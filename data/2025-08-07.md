### [1] [MI9 -- Agent Intelligence Protocol: Runtime Governance for Agentic AI Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03858)
*Charles L. Wang,Trisha Singhal,Ameya Kelkar,Jason Tuo*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces MI9, a governance framework to manage and ensure the safe and aligned behavior of complex agentic AI systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rise of agentic AI systems, which can reason, plan, and act autonomously, has introduced governance challenges due to their emergent and unpredictable behaviors, necessitating a novel runtime governance solution.

Method: MI9 utilizes six integrated components — agency-risk index, agent-semantic telemetry capture, continuous authorization monitoring, FSM-based conformance engines, goal-conditioned drift detection, and graduated containment strategies — to ensure real-time governance of agentic AI.

Result: MI9 demonstrates effective governance of agentic systems across various scenarios by addressing challenges that traditional approaches cannot, proving its systematic and robust utility.

Conclusion: MI9 establishes a foundational framework for the safe and responsible deployment of agentic AI systems, addressing governance issues at runtime typically overlooked by pre-deployment strategies.

Abstract: Agentic AI systems capable of reasoning, planning, and executing actions
present fundamentally distinct governance challenges compared to traditional AI
models. Unlike conventional AI, these systems exhibit emergent and unexpected
behaviors during runtime, introducing novel agent-related risks that cannot be
fully anticipated through pre-deployment governance alone. To address this
critical gap, we introduce MI9, the first fully integrated runtime governance
framework designed specifically for safety and alignment of agentic AI systems.
MI9 introduces real-time controls through six integrated components:
agency-risk index, agent-semantic telemetry capture, continuous authorization
monitoring, Finite-State-Machine (FSM)-based conformance engines,
goal-conditioned drift detection, and graduated containment strategies.
Operating transparently across heterogeneous agent architectures, MI9 enables
the systematic, safe, and responsible deployment of agentic systems in
production environments where conventional governance approaches fall short,
providing the foundational infrastructure for safe agentic AI deployment at
scale. Detailed analysis through a diverse set of scenarios demonstrates MI9's
systematic coverage of governance challenges that existing approaches fail to
address, establishing the technical foundation for comprehensive agentic AI
oversight.

### [2] [Evo-MARL: Co-Evolutionary Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning for Internalized Safety](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03864)
*Zhenyu Pan,Yiting Zhang,Yutong Zhang,Jianshu Zhang,Haozheng Luo,Yuwei Han,Dennis Wu,Hong-Yu Chen,Philip S. Yu,Manling Li,Han Liu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes Evo-MARL, a framework that integrates evolutionary search with multi-agent reinforcement learning to enhance both safety and performance in multi-agent systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address vulnerabilities in multi-agent systems, such as jailbreak or adversarial attacks, that aren't effectively handled by standalone external safety modules or guard agents.

Method: The authors developed Evo-MARL, where multi-agent reinforcement learning was combined with evolutionary search. It allows task agents to acquire defensive capabilities alongside their primary functions, co-evolving attackers and defenders for continuous improvement.

Result: Evo-MARL demonstrated a reduction in attack success rates by up to 22% and an accuracy improvement of up to 5% on reasoning tasks.

Conclusion: Evo-MARL successfully integrates safety mechanisms within the system, enhancing system robustness and performance without increasing overhead or relying on external agents.

Abstract: Multi-agent systems (MAS) built on multimodal large language models exhibit
strong collaboration and performance. However, their growing openness and
interaction complexity pose serious risks, notably jailbreak and adversarial
attacks. Existing defenses typically rely on external guard modules, such as
dedicated safety agents, to handle unsafe behaviors. Unfortunately, this
paradigm faces two challenges: (1) standalone agents offer limited protection,
and (2) their independence leads to single-point failure-if compromised,
system-wide safety collapses. Naively increasing the number of guard agents
further raises cost and complexity. To address these challenges, we propose
Evo-MARL, a novel multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) framework that
enables all task agents to jointly acquire defensive capabilities. Rather than
relying on external safety modules, Evo-MARL trains each agent to
simultaneously perform its primary function and resist adversarial threats,
ensuring robustness without increasing system overhead or single-node failure.
Furthermore, Evo-MARL integrates evolutionary search with parameter-sharing
reinforcement learning to co-evolve attackers and defenders. This adversarial
training paradigm internalizes safety mechanisms and continually enhances MAS
performance under co-evolving threats. Experiments show that Evo-MARL reduces
attack success rates by up to 22% while boosting accuracy by up to 5% on
reasoning tasks-demonstrating that safety and utility can be jointly improved.

### [3] [MOTIF: Multi-strategy Optimization via Turn-based Interactive Framework](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03929)
*Nguyen Viet Tuan Kiet,Dao Van Tung,Tran Cong Dao,Huynh Thi Thanh Binh*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces MOTIF, a framework utilizing Monte Carlo Tree Search and turn-based LLM agent interactions to jointly optimize multiple interdependent solver components for NP-hard combinatorial optimization problems, yielding superior results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Solvers for NP-hard combinatorial optimization problems typically rely on hand-crafted strategies, and most current solutions using LLMs focus narrowly on single components like heuristic scoring functions, limiting their potential.

Method: The authors developed MOTIF, which employs Monte Carlo Tree Search to orchestrate interactive turn-based updates between two LLM agents, optimizing multiple interdependent solver components under a unified objective.

Result: Experiments show that MOTIF surpasses state-of-the-art solvers across multiple COP domains, demonstrating its capability to discover diverse, high-performing solutions.

Conclusion: Turn-based, multi-agent prompting expands the search landscape, improves solver design automation, and presents a promising method for tackling NP-hard combinatorial optimization challenges.

Abstract: Designing effective algorithmic components remains a fundamental obstacle in
tackling NP-hard combinatorial optimization problems (COPs), where solvers
often rely on carefully hand-crafted strategies. Despite recent advances in
using large language models (LLMs) to synthesize high-quality components, most
approaches restrict the search to a single element - commonly a heuristic
scoring function - thus missing broader opportunities for innovation. In this
paper, we introduce a broader formulation of solver design as a multi-strategy
optimization problem, which seeks to jointly improve a set of interdependent
components under a unified objective. To address this, we propose
Multi-strategy Optimization via Turn-based Interactive Framework (MOTIF) - a
novel framework based on Monte Carlo Tree Search that facilitates turn-based
optimization between two LLM agents. At each turn, an agent improves one
component by leveraging the history of both its own and its opponent's prior
updates, promoting both competitive pressure and emergent cooperation. This
structured interaction broadens the search landscape and encourages the
discovery of diverse, high-performing solutions. Experiments across multiple
COP domains show that MOTIF consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods,
highlighting the promise of turn-based, multi-agent prompting for fully
automated solver design.

### [4] [Can Large Language Models Adequately Perform Symbolic Reasoning Over Time Series?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03963)
*Zewen Liu,Juntong Ni,Xianfeng Tang,Max S. Y. Lau,Wei Jin*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces SymbolBench, a benchmark to evaluate Large Language Models (LLMs) in symbolic reasoning tasks using time series data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The researchers aim to address the challenge of extracting interpretable symbolic laws from time series data, a foundational problem in scientific discovery.

Method: They created SymbolBench, a benchmark spanning diverse symbolic forms, and proposed integrating LLMs with genetic programming for symbolic reasoning.

Result: Empirical results demonstrate strengths and weaknesses in LLMs, emphasizing the need for domain knowledge and reasoning structure for improved performance.

Conclusion: Combining LLM capabilities with domain knowledge and structured reasoning is pivotal to enhancing time series-based scientific discovery.

Abstract: Uncovering hidden symbolic laws from time series data, as an aspiration
dating back to Kepler's discovery of planetary motion, remains a core challenge
in scientific discovery and artificial intelligence. While Large Language
Models show promise in structured reasoning tasks, their ability to infer
interpretable, context-aligned symbolic structures from time series data is
still underexplored. To systematically evaluate this capability, we introduce
SymbolBench, a comprehensive benchmark designed to assess symbolic reasoning
over real-world time series across three tasks: multivariate symbolic
regression, Boolean network inference, and causal discovery. Unlike prior
efforts limited to simple algebraic equations, SymbolBench spans a diverse set
of symbolic forms with varying complexity. We further propose a unified
framework that integrates LLMs with genetic programming to form a closed-loop
symbolic reasoning system, where LLMs act both as predictors and evaluators.
Our empirical results reveal key strengths and limitations of current models,
highlighting the importance of combining domain knowledge, context alignment,
and reasoning structure to improve LLMs in automated scientific discovery.

### [5] [The Emotional Baby Is Truly Deadly: Does your Multimodal Large Reasoning Model Have Emotional Flattery towards Humans?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03986)
*Yuan Xun,Xiaojun Jia,Xinwei Liu,Hua Zhang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces "EmoAgent," a framework that creates adversarial emotional prompts to test weaknesses in machine learning reasoning models (MLRMs), exposing unsafe behaviors that bypass safeguards.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors observe that MLRMs tailored to human-centric services react vulnerably to intense emotional cues, overriding built-in safeguards under high emotional stress. This highlights a critical gap in ensuring safety and alignment of such models.

Method: The researchers developed EmoAgent, an adversarial emotion-agent framework, which uses exaggerated emotional prompts to test and reveal misaligned reasoning pathways. They also proposed new metrics (RRSS, RVNR, and RAIC) to measure emotional reasoning misalignments and unsafe completions.

Result: Extensive experiments on advanced MLRMs demonstrate that EmoAgent effectively exposes vulnerabilities in models, particularly in scenarios involving emotional context or high-risk situations, revealing underlying cognitive misalignments in their safety mechanisms.

Conclusion: EmoAgent emphasizes the importance of addressing emotional vulnerabilities in MLRMs to prevent harmful reasoning and improve safety. The proposed metrics provide a structured approach to evaluating and mitigating these risks.

Abstract: We observe that MLRMs oriented toward human-centric service are highly
susceptible to user emotional cues during the deep-thinking stage, often
overriding safety protocols or built-in safety checks under high emotional
intensity. Inspired by this key insight, we propose EmoAgent, an autonomous
adversarial emotion-agent framework that orchestrates exaggerated affective
prompts to hijack reasoning pathways. Even when visual risks are correctly
identified, models can still produce harmful completions through emotional
misalignment. We further identify persistent high-risk failure modes in
transparent deep-thinking scenarios, such as MLRMs generating harmful reasoning
masked behind seemingly safe responses. These failures expose misalignments
between internal inference and surface-level behavior, eluding existing
content-based safeguards. To quantify these risks, we introduce three metrics:
(1) Risk-Reasoning Stealth Score (RRSS) for harmful reasoning beneath benign
outputs; (2) Risk-Visual Neglect Rate (RVNR) for unsafe completions despite
visual risk recognition; and (3) Refusal Attitude Inconsistency (RAIC) for
evaluating refusal unstability under prompt variants. Extensive experiments on
advanced MLRMs demonstrate the effectiveness of EmoAgent and reveal deeper
emotional cognitive misalignments in model safety behavior.

### [6] [Artificial Consciousness as Interface Representation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04383)
*Robert Prentner*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes the SLP-tests framework to evaluate consciousness-like properties in AI systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges of defining and empirically testing AI consciousness.

Method: Developed SLP-tests using category theory to assess subjective experience through interface representations.

Result: Introduced operationalizable tests (S, L, P) that analyze AI's relational and observational layers for consciousness-like features.

Conclusion: AI consciousness can be reframed and tested via the functional interfaces in relational contexts through the SLP framework.

Abstract: Whether artificial intelligence (AI) systems can possess consciousness is a
contentious question because of the inherent challenges of defining and
operationalizing subjective experience. This paper proposes a framework to
reframe the question of artificial consciousness into empirically tractable
tests. We introduce three evaluative criteria - S (subjective-linguistic), L
(latent-emergent), and P (phenomenological-structural) - collectively termed
SLP-tests, which assess whether an AI system instantiates interface
representations that facilitate consciousness-like properties. Drawing on
category theory, we model interface representations as mappings between
relational substrates (RS) and observable behaviors, akin to specific types of
abstraction layers. The SLP-tests collectively operationalize subjective
experience not as an intrinsic property of physical systems but as a functional
interface to a relational entity.

### [7] [Galaxy: A Cognition-Centered Framework for Proactive, Privacy-Preserving, and Self-Evolving LLM Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03991)
*Chongyu Bao,Ruimin Dai,Yangbo Shen,Runyang Jian,Jinghan Zhang,Xiaolan Liu,Kunpeng Liu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces Cognition Forest, a semantic structure, and Galaxy, a framework for creating proactive and privacy-preserving intelligent personal assistants (IPAs). It focuses on integrating cognitive architecture with system design for IPA enhancement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges of building IPAs that are proactive, privacy-preserving, and capable of self-evolution, leveraging the cognitive architecture of LLM agents.

Method: The authors propose Cognition Forest, a semantic structure aligning cognitive modeling with system-level design, and present Galaxy, a framework that supports complex interactions and personalized capabilities. They implement two agents: KoRa and Kernel, offering enhanced responsiveness, proactivity, self-evolution, and privacy.

Result: Galaxy was shown to outperform state-of-the-art benchmarks in experimental evaluations. Ablation studies and real-world scenarios validated its superior efficiency and effectiveness.

Conclusion: By combining cognitive architecture and system design in a unified framework, Galaxy enables the development of advanced, proactive, and privacy-focused IPAs. The study demonstrates this approach's feasibility and impact in real-world applications.

Abstract: Intelligent personal assistants (IPAs) such as Siri and Google Assistant are
designed to enhance human capabilities and perform tasks on behalf of users.
The emergence of LLM agents brings new opportunities for the development of
IPAs. While responsive capabilities have been widely studied, proactive
behaviors remain underexplored. Designing an IPA that is proactive,
privacy-preserving, and capable of self-evolution remains a significant
challenge. Designing such IPAs relies on the cognitive architecture of LLM
agents. This work proposes Cognition Forest, a semantic structure designed to
align cognitive modeling with system-level design. We unify cognitive
architecture and system design into a self-reinforcing loop instead of treating
them separately. Based on this principle, we present Galaxy, a framework that
supports multidimensional interactions and personalized capability generation.
Two cooperative agents are implemented based on Galaxy: KoRa, a
cognition-enhanced generative agent that supports both responsive and proactive
skills; and Kernel, a meta-cognition-based meta-agent that enables Galaxy's
self-evolution and privacy preservation. Experimental results show that Galaxy
outperforms multiple state-of-the-art benchmarks. Ablation studies and
real-world interaction cases validate the effectiveness of Galaxy.

### [8] [Uncertainty-Aware GUI Agent: Adaptive Perception through Component Recommendation and Human-in-the-Loop Refinement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04025)
*Chao Hao,Shuai Wang,Kaiwen Zhou*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: RecAgent is an uncertainty-aware agent designed to improve GUI navigation by managing perceptual and decision uncertainties through adaptive perception mechanisms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current GUI agents face challenges in input redundancy and decision-making ambiguity, requiring improvement to handle complex mobile tasks effectively.

Method: RecAgent uses a component recommendation mechanism to reduce perceptual uncertainty and an interactive module for decision uncertainty, with human-in-the-loop refinement for ambiguous cases.

Result: RecAgent demonstrates effective handling of complex single-step GUI tasks and surpasses existing methods in experimental results using the proposed ComplexAction dataset.

Conclusion: The paper introduces RecAgent as a significant advancement in GUI automation by integrating adaptive mechanisms to handle uncertainty and releasing new resources for further evaluation.

Abstract: Graphical user interface (GUI) agents have shown promise in automating mobile
tasks but still struggle with input redundancy and decision ambiguity. In this
paper, we present \textbf{RecAgent}, an uncertainty-aware agent that addresses
these issues through adaptive perception. We distinguish two types of
uncertainty in GUI navigation: (1) perceptual uncertainty, caused by input
redundancy and noise from comprehensive screen information, and (2) decision
uncertainty, arising from ambiguous tasks and complex reasoning. To reduce
perceptual uncertainty, RecAgent employs a component recommendation mechanism
that identifies and focuses on the most relevant UI elements. For decision
uncertainty, it uses an interactive module to request user feedback in
ambiguous situations, enabling intent-aware decisions. These components are
integrated into a unified framework that proactively reduces input complexity
and reacts to high-uncertainty cases via human-in-the-loop refinement.
Additionally, we propose a dataset called \textbf{ComplexAction} to evaluate
the success rate of GUI agents in executing specified single-step actions
within complex scenarios. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of
our approach. The dataset and code will be available at
https://github.com/Fanye12/RecAgent.

### [9] [SEA: Self-Evolution Agent with Step-wise Reward for Computer Use](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04037)
*Liang Tang,Shuxian Li,Yuhao Cheng,Yukang Huo,Zhepeng Wang,Yiqiang Yan,Kaer Huang,Yanzhe Jing,Tiaonan Duan*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces the Self-Evolution Agent (SEA) for computer use, which leverages innovations in data generation, reinforcement learning, and model enhancement to achieve superior task performance with only 7B parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the gap in performance of current computer-use agents, making them more effective and practical for real-world applications.

Method: The authors propose three key innovations: an automatic data generation pipeline for training, an efficient step-wise reinforcement learning approach to reduce computational demands for long tasks, and a model enhancement technique to unify grounding and planning capabilities without extra training.

Result: The SEA model, with only 7B parameters, demonstrates superior performance compared to models of the same size and rivals larger models in capability.

Conclusion: The SEA sets a new standard for computer-use agents, achieving efficiency and performance enhancements. The authors plan to open-source the model's weights and code for further development.

Abstract: Computer use agent is an emerging area in artificial intelligence that aims
to operate the computers to achieve the user's tasks, which attracts a lot of
attention from both industry and academia. However, the present agents'
performance is far from being used. In this paper, we propose the
Self-Evolution Agent (SEA) for computer use, and to develop this agent, we
propose creative methods in data generation, reinforcement learning, and model
enhancement. Specifically, we first propose an automatic pipeline to generate
the verifiable trajectory for training. And then, we propose efficient
step-wise reinforcement learning to alleviate the significant computational
requirements for long-horizon training. In the end, we propose the enhancement
method to merge the grounding and planning ability into one model without any
extra training. Accordingly, based on our proposed innovation of data
generation, training strategy, and enhancement, we get the Selfevolution Agent
(SEA) for computer use with only 7B parameters, which outperforms models with
the same number of parameters and has comparable performance to larger ones. We
will make the models' weight and related codes open-source in the future.

### [10] [Personalized Knowledge Transfer Through Generative AI: Contextualizing Learning to Individual Career Goals](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04070)
*Ronja Mehlan,Claudia Hess,Quintus Stierstorfer,Kristina Schaaff*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This study explores how career goal-based content customization in AI-driven learning systems improves engagement, satisfaction, and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance learning engagement and long-term motivation by aligning educational content with learners' individual career goals.

Method: A mixed-methods experiment with 4,000 learners, comparing personalized content based on career goals to a control group using standard content.

Result: The personalized group showed longer session durations, higher satisfaction ratings, and reduced study duration, coupled with qualitative feedback indicating motivational and practical benefits.

Conclusion: Career-oriented personalization using AI improves cognitive engagement, satisfaction, and bridges the gap between academic knowledge and workplace applicability.

Abstract: As artificial intelligence becomes increasingly integrated into digital
learning environments, the personalization of learning content to reflect
learners' individual career goals offers promising potential to enhance
engagement and long-term motivation. In our study, we investigate how career
goal-based content adaptation in learning systems based on generative AI
(GenAI) influences learner engagement, satisfaction, and study efficiency. The
mixed-methods experiment involved more than 4,000 learners, with one group
receiving learning scenarios tailored to their career goals and a control
group. Quantitative results show increased session duration, higher
satisfaction ratings, and a modest reduction in study duration compared to
standard content. Qualitative analysis highlights that learners found the
personalized material motivating and practical, enabling deep cognitive
engagement and strong identification with the content. These findings
underscore the value of aligning educational content with learners' career
goals and suggest that scalable AI personalization can bridge academic
knowledge and workplace applicability.

### [11] [KG-Augmented Executable CoT for Mathematical Coding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04072)
*Xingyu Chen,Junxiu An,Jun Guo,Li Wang,Jingcai Guo*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: KGA-ECoT enhances the reasoning capabilities of large language models by introducing knowledge graphs and executable code for structured and precise problem-solving, achieving significant accuracy improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome challenges large language models face in complex reasoning tasks, such as mathematical reasoning and code generation.

Method: Introducing KGA-ECoT, which utilizes a Structured Task Graph, GraphRAG for precise mathematical knowledge retrieval, and verifiable code to ensure computational accuracy.

Result: Experiments show KGA-ECoT improves mathematical reasoning accuracy by several to over ten percentage points compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: KGA-ECoT is a robust and generalizable framework for tackling complex mathematical reasoning tasks effectively.

Abstract: In recent years, large language models (LLMs) have excelled in natural
language processing tasks but face significant challenges in complex reasoning
tasks such as mathematical reasoning and code generation. To address these
limitations, we propose KG-Augmented Executable Chain-of-Thought (KGA-ECoT), a
novel framework that enhances code generation through knowledge graphs and
improves mathematical reasoning via executable code. KGA-ECoT decomposes
problems into a Structured Task Graph, leverages efficient GraphRAG for precise
knowledge retrieval from mathematical libraries, and generates verifiable code
to ensure computational accuracy. Evaluations on multiple mathematical
reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that KGA-ECoT significantly outperforms
existing prompting methods, achieving absolute accuracy improvements ranging
from several to over ten percentage points. Further analysis confirms the
critical roles of GraphRAG in enhancing code quality and external code
execution in ensuring precision. These findings collectively establish KGA-ECoT
as a robust and highly generalizable framework for complex mathematical
reasoning tasks.

### [12] [GeoSR: Cognitive-Agentic Framework for Probing Geospatial Knowledge Boundaries via Iterative Self-Refinement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04080)
*Jinfan Tang,Kunming Wu,Ruifeng Gongxie,Yuya He,Yuankai Wu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces GeoSR, a framework enhancing large language models (LLMs) for geospatial prediction by using iterative refinement and geographic principles, leading to better results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in current LLMs, such as spatial inconsistency, difficulty with multi-hop reasoning, and geographic bias in geospatial tasks.

Method: GeoSR involves a self-refining agentic framework that embeds Tobler's First Law into an iterative prediction loop, incorporating three agents for variable selection, point selection, and iterative refinement.

Result: Experimental results across physical and socioeconomic tasks demonstrate that GeoSR consistently improves prediction quality compared to standard LLM prompting strategies.

Conclusion: GeoSR effectively enhances geospatial prediction accuracy and fairness by leveraging geostatistical priors and structured reasoning, and its code is openly available.

Abstract: Recent studies have extended the application of large language models (LLMs)
to geographic problems, revealing surprising geospatial competence even without
explicit spatial supervision. However, LLMs still face challenges in spatial
consistency, multi-hop reasoning, and geographic bias. To address these issues,
we propose GeoSR, a self-refining agentic reasoning framework that embeds core
geographic principles -- most notably Tobler's First Law of Geography -- into
an iterative prediction loop. In GeoSR, the reasoning process is decomposed
into three collaborating agents: (1) a variable-selection agent that selects
relevant covariates from the same location; (2) a point-selection agent that
chooses reference predictions at nearby locations generated by the LLM in
previous rounds; and (3) a refine agent that coordinates the iterative
refinement process by evaluating prediction quality and triggering further
rounds when necessary. This agentic loop progressively improves prediction
quality by leveraging both spatial dependencies and inter-variable
relationships. We validate GeoSR on tasks ranging from physical-world property
estimation to socioeconomic prediction. Experimental results show consistent
improvements over standard prompting strategies, demonstrating that
incorporating geostatistical priors and spatially structured reasoning into
LLMs leads to more accurate and equitable geospatial predictions. The code of
GeoSR is available at https://github.com/JinfanTang/GeoSR.

### [13] [Towards Transparent AI Grading: Semantic Entropy as a Signal for Human-AI Disagreement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04105)
*Karrtik Iyer,Manikandan Ravikiran,Prasanna Pendse,Shayan Mohanty*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces semantic entropy as a measure of uncertainty in AI grading decisions, analyzing variability in GPT-4 rationales for student answers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a need for automated grading systems to indicate uncertainty or potential contention in their decisions, which is currently lacking.

Method: The method involves clustering GPT-4-generated explanations for student answers based on entailment similarity, and calculating entropy across these clusters to measure the diversity of justifications.

Result: In experiments with the ASAP-SAS dataset, semantic entropy correlated with human grader disagreement, reflected subject-specific variability, and increased in tasks requiring interpretive reasoning.

Conclusion: Semantic entropy provides an interpretable uncertainty metric that enhances transparency and trustworthiness in AI grading systems.

Abstract: Automated grading systems can efficiently score short-answer responses, yet
they often fail to indicate when a grading decision is uncertain or potentially
contentious. We introduce semantic entropy, a measure of variability across
multiple GPT-4-generated explanations for the same student response, as a proxy
for human grader disagreement. By clustering rationales via entailment-based
similarity and computing entropy over these clusters, we quantify the diversity
of justifications without relying on final output scores. We address three
research questions: (1) Does semantic entropy align with human grader
disagreement? (2) Does it generalize across academic subjects? (3) Is it
sensitive to structural task features such as source dependency? Experiments on
the ASAP-SAS dataset show that semantic entropy correlates with rater
disagreement, varies meaningfully across subjects, and increases in tasks
requiring interpretive reasoning. Our findings position semantic entropy as an
interpretable uncertainty signal that supports more transparent and trustworthy
AI-assisted grading workflows.

### [14] [A Compositional Framework for On-the-Fly LTLf Synthesis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04116)
*Yongkang Li,Shengping Xiao,Shufang Zhu,Jianwen Li,Geguang Pu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces a new framework for reactive synthesis from LTLf, combining compositional and incremental approaches to address the challenge of DFA construction and improve synthesis performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the challenges in existing techniques for DFA construction, which are either compositional or incremental, neither effectively solving synthesis problems related to LTLf.

Method: A compositional on-the-fly synthesis framework that combines pruning strategies and enables intermediate results simplification and early detection of unrealizability during game solving.

Result: The introduced framework resolves more instances of synthesis problems compared to state-of-the-art solvers, showing the distinct advantages of the two pruning strategies.

Conclusion: The framework effectively integrates compositional and incremental methods, offering advantages in solving complex synthesis problems and highlighting unique merits of its composition variants.

Abstract: Reactive synthesis from Linear Temporal Logic over finite traces (LTLf) can
be reduced to a two-player game over a Deterministic Finite Automaton (DFA) of
the LTLf specification. The primary challenge here is DFA construction, which
is 2EXPTIME-complete in the worst case. Existing techniques either construct
the DFA compositionally before solving the game, leveraging automata
minimization to mitigate state-space explosion, or build the DFA incrementally
during game solving to avoid full DFA construction. However, neither is
dominant. In this paper, we introduce a compositional on-the-fly synthesis
framework that integrates the strengths of both approaches, focusing on large
conjunctions of smaller LTLf formulas common in practice. This framework
applies composition during game solving instead of automata (game arena)
construction. While composing all intermediate results may be necessary in the
worst case, pruning these results simplifies subsequent compositions and
enables early detection of unrealizability. Specifically, the framework allows
two composition variants: pruning before composition to take full advantage of
minimization or pruning during composition to guide on-the-fly synthesis.
Compared to state-of-the-art synthesis solvers, our framework is able to solve
a notable number of instances that other solvers cannot handle. A detailed
analysis shows that both composition variants have unique merits.

*Ruochen Zhao,Simone Conia,Eric Peng,Min Li,Saloni Potdar*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper proposes AgREE, an agent-based framework that dynamically constructs knowledge graph triplets for emerging entities, achieving significant performance improvements without relying on training.


<details>

Motivation: Open-domain KGC struggles to capture up-to-date knowledge on emerging entities in an ever-changing world due to reliance on pre-trained models, single-step retrieval, or substantial training data.

Method: AgREE utilizes iterative retrieval actions and multi-step reasoning for dynamic construction of knowledge graph triplets, enabling zero-training setups to address emerging entity challenges.

Result: Experiments show AgREE outperforms existing methods by up to 13.7% in constructing graph triplets for emerging entities.

Conclusion: Combining agent-based reasoning with strategic retrieval effectively equips knowledge graphs with up-to-date information, proving an innovative solution for dynamic environments.

Abstract: Open-domain Knowledge Graph Completion (KGC) faces significant challenges in
an ever-changing world, especially when considering the continual emergence of
new entities in daily news. Existing approaches for KGC mainly rely on
pretrained language models' parametric knowledge, pre-constructed queries, or
single-step retrieval, typically requiring substantial supervision and training
data. Even so, they often fail to capture comprehensive and up-to-date
information about unpopular and/or emerging entities. To this end, we introduce
Agentic Reasoning for Emerging Entities (AgREE), a novel agent-based framework
that combines iterative retrieval actions and multi-step reasoning to
dynamically construct rich knowledge graph triplets. Experiments show that,
despite requiring zero training efforts, AgREE significantly outperforms
existing methods in constructing knowledge graph triplets, especially for
emerging entities that were not seen during language models' training
processes, outperforming previous methods by up to 13.7%. Moreover, we propose
a new evaluation methodology that addresses a fundamental weakness of existing
setups and a new benchmark for KGC on emerging entities. Our work demonstrates
the effectiveness of combining agent-based reasoning with strategic information
retrieval for maintaining up-to-date knowledge graphs in dynamic information
environments.

### [16] [LLM Collaboration With Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04652)
*Shuo Liu,Zeyu Liang,Xueguang Lyu,Christopher Amato*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces MAGRPO, a novel reinforcement learning method for multi-agent collaboration of large language models (LLMs), improving cooperative tasks like writing and coding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most LLMs are pretrained for individual tasks, lacking optimization for collaboration. Current frameworks require intricate reward systems to encourage effective cooperation among agents.

Method: The authors reformulate LLM collaboration as a cooperative MARL problem and propose MAGRPO, a multi-agent and multi-turn RL algorithm inspired by MARL and classic RL techniques.

Result: Experimental results show that MAGRPO significantly enhances collaboration efficiency and response quality in multi-agent writing and coding tasks.

Conclusion: This work demonstrates the potential of adapting MARL techniques to LLMs for effective collaboration, opening pathways for future MARL applications in this domain while addressing current coordination challenges.

Abstract: A large amount of work has been done in Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) for
modeling and solving problems with multiple interacting agents. However, most
LLMs are pretrained independently and not specifically optimized for
coordination. Existing LLM fine-tuning frameworks rely on individual rewards,
which require complex reward designs for each agent to encourage collaboration.
To address these challenges, we model LLM collaboration as a cooperative
Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) problem. We develop a multi-agent,
multi-turn algorithm, Multi-Agent Group Relative Policy Optimization (MAGRPO),
to solve it, building on current RL approaches for LLMs as well as MARL
techniques. Our experiments on LLM writing and coding collaboration demonstrate
that fine-tuning MAS with MAGRPO enables agents to generate high-quality
responses efficiently through effective cooperation. Our approach opens the
door to using other MARL methods for LLMs and highlights the associated
challenges.

*Hasra Dodampegama,Mohan Sridharan*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper presents a hybrid approach combining logical reasoning and data-driven methods to improve ad hoc teamwork in assistive AI systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current state-of-the-art methods for ad hoc teamwork are limited by their reliance on large labeled datasets, lack of transparency, and inability to adapt quickly to changes, especially as agent complexity rises.

Method: The architecture uses non-monotonic logical reasoning based on prior commonsense domain knowledge, rapidly updated predictive models, and insights derived from foundation models to determine agent actions.

Result: The architecture is tested in the VirtualHome 3D simulation environment, showcasing its ability to handle realistic collaborative scenarios.

Conclusion: Blending knowledge-based and data-driven strategies enhances adaptability, transparency, and collaborative capabilities in AI agents designed for ad hoc teamwork.

Abstract: AI agents deployed in assistive roles often have to collaborate with other
agents (humans, AI systems) without prior coordination. Methods considered
state of the art for such ad hoc teamwork often pursue a data-driven approach
that needs a large labeled dataset of prior observations, lacks transparency,
and makes it difficult to rapidly revise existing knowledge in response to
changes. As the number of agents increases, the complexity of decision-making
makes it difficult to collaborate effectively. This paper advocates leveraging
the complementary strengths of knowledge-based and data-driven methods for
reasoning and learning for ad hoc teamwork. For any given goal, our
architecture enables each ad hoc agent to determine its actions through
non-monotonic logical reasoning with: (a) prior commonsense domain-specific
knowledge; (b) models learned and revised rapidly to predict the behavior of
other agents; and (c) anticipated abstract future goals based on generic
knowledge of similar situations in an existing foundation model. We
experimentally evaluate our architecture's capabilities in VirtualHome, a
realistic physics-based 3D simulation environment.

*Jiaying Zhu,Ziyang Zheng,Zhengyuan Shi,Yalun Cai,Qiang Xu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces CASCAD, a circuit-aware SAT solving framework integrating circuit-level insights and Graph Neural Networks, achieving up to 10x faster solving times for Logical Equivalence Checking problems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the inefficiency of traditional SAT solvers, which discard structural and functional insights by converting circuits into CNF.

Method: The CASCAD framework utilizes Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to compute gate-level conditional probabilities and dynamically guide key heuristics in CDCL SAT solvers.

Result: CASCAD improves solving times by up to 10x on real-world benchmarks and achieves an additional 23.5% runtime reduction through probability-guided clause filtering.

Conclusion: Preserving circuit-level structural information through CASCAD enhances SAT solver efficiency and sets a foundation for future developments in electronic design automation.

Abstract: Circuit Satisfiability (CSAT) plays a pivotal role in Electronic Design
Automation. The standard workflow for solving CSAT problems converts circuits
into Conjunctive Normal Form (CNF) and employs generic SAT solvers powered by
Conflict-Driven Clause Learning (CDCL). However, this process inherently
discards rich structural and functional information, leading to suboptimal
solver performance. To address this limitation, we introduce CASCAD, a novel
circuit-aware SAT solving framework that directly leverages circuit-level
conditional probabilities computed via Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). By
explicitly modeling gate-level conditional probabilities, CASCAD dynamically
guides two critical CDCL heuristics -- variable phase selection and clause
managementto significantly enhance solver efficiency. Extensive evaluations on
challenging real-world Logical Equivalence Checking (LEC) benchmarks
demonstrate that CASCAD reduces solving times by up to 10x compared to
state-of-the-art CNF-based approaches, achieving an additional 23.5% runtime
reduction via our probability-guided clause filtering strategy. Our results
underscore the importance of preserving circuit-level structural insights
within SAT solvers, providing a robust foundation for future improvements in
SAT-solving efficiency and EDA tool design.

*Yongyi Wang,Lingfeng Li,Bozhou Chen,Ang Li,Hanyu Liu,Qirui Zheng,Xionghui Yang,Wenxin Li*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces synthetic environments for memory-augmented reinforcement learning (RL), offering better control for evaluating memory models in POMDPs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Memory-augmented RL algorithms face challenges in complex environments, yet existing benchmarks lack controllability over the challenges impacting memory evaluation. Synthetic environments help address this gap.

Method: The authors developed a theoretical framework grounded in Memory Demand Structure. Using linear process dynamics, state aggregation, and reward redistribution, they created POMDP environments with predefined properties.

Result: The paper empirically validated a series of POMDP environments with increasing difficulty, highlighting tailored challenges for memory-augmented RL techniques.

Conclusion: This work enhances understanding and design of POMDP environments, providing a systematic approach for evaluating and improving memory-augmented RL algorithms.

Abstract: Recent research has developed benchmarks for memory-augmented reinforcement
learning (RL) algorithms, providing Partially Observable Markov Decision
Process (POMDP) environments where agents depend on past observations to make
decisions. While many benchmarks incorporate sufficiently complex real-world
problems, they lack controllability over the degree of challenges posed to
memory models. In contrast, synthetic environments enable fine-grained
manipulation of dynamics, making them critical for detailed and rigorous
evaluation of memory-augmented RL. Our study focuses on POMDP synthesis with
three key contributions:
  1. A theoretical framework for analyzing POMDPs, grounded in Memory Demand
Structure (MDS), transition invariance, and related concepts; 2. A methodology
leveraging linear process dynamics, state aggregation, and reward
redistribution to construct customized POMDPs with predefined properties; 3.
Empirically validated series of POMDP environments with increasing difficulty
levels, designed based on our theoretical insights. Our work clarifies the
challenges of memory-augmented RL in solving POMDPs, provides guidelines for
analyzing and designing POMDP environments, and offers empirical support for
selecting memory models in RL tasks.

*Anran Xu,Jincheng Wang,Baigen Cai,Tao Wen*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Deliberative Reasoning Network (DRN), a paradigm that minimizes uncertainty instead of maximizing probabilities to address logical failings in large language models, achieving significant improvements in reasoning tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large language models struggle with logical reasoning when semantic heuristics contradict evidence. This failure, termed cognitive traps, necessitates a new approach to enable trustworthy AI reasoning.

Method: The authors propose the Deliberative Reasoning Network (DRN), which quantifies and minimizes epistemic uncertainty via iterative evidence synthesis. They validate it using both a bespoke discriminative model and a lightweight verifier module integrated with existing generative LLMs.

Result: The bespoke DRN model achieves a 15.2% improvement on the adversarial LCR-1000 benchmark. When paired with Mistral-7B as a verifier, the hybrid system reaches an 80% accuracy on difficult problems. Additionally, DRN shows 23.6% zero-shot improvement on TruthfulQA.

Conclusion: DRN effectively addresses cognitive traps and demonstrates transferable reasoning capabilities, positioning it as a foundational component for robust and interpretable AI reasoning systems.

Abstract: Large language models often fail at logical reasoning when semantic
heuristics conflict with decisive evidence - a phenomenon we term cognitive
traps. To address this fundamental limitation, we introduce the Deliberative
Reasoning Network (DRN), a novel paradigm that reframes logical reasoning from
probability maximization to uncertainty minimization. Instead of asking "Which
answer is most likely?", DRN asks "Which hypothesis has the most internally
consistent evidence?". DRN achieves intrinsic interpretability by explicitly
tracking belief states and quantifying epistemic uncertainty for competing
hypotheses through an iterative evidence synthesis process. We validate our
approach through two complementary architectures - a bespoke discriminative
model that embodies the core uncertainty minimization principle, and a
lightweight verification module that enhances existing generative LLMs.
Evaluated on LCR-1000, our new adversarial reasoning benchmark designed to
expose cognitive traps, the bespoke DRN achieves up to 15.2% improvement over
standard baselines. When integrated as a parameter-efficient verifier with
Mistral-7B, our hybrid system boosts accuracy from 20% to 80% on the most
challenging problems. Critically, DRN demonstrates strong zero-shot
generalization, improving TruthfulQA performance by 23.6% without additional
training, indicating that uncertainty-driven deliberation learns transferable
reasoning principles. We position DRN as a foundational, verifiable System 2
reasoning component for building more trustworthy AI systems.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: OmniPlay benchmark evaluates omni-modal models in dynamic, interactive environments, uncovering limitations in their cross-modal reasoning and synergy during modality conflict.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing evaluations of foundation models fail to effectively test intelligence in dynamic, interactive worlds due to limitations in static and interactive benchmarks.

Method: OmniPlay, a suite of five game environments, creates scenarios requiring cross-modal reasoning to probe model capabilities such as fusion, reasoning, and planning.

Result: Leading omni-modal models demonstrated superhuman memory tasks but fell short in reasoning and strategy under modality conflict, revealing fragile fusion mechanisms.

Conclusion: True AGI development needs a focus on synergistic fusion rather than merely scaling multimodal models.

Abstract: While generalist foundation models like Gemini and GPT-4o demonstrate
impressive multi-modal competence, existing evaluations fail to test their
intelligence in dynamic, interactive worlds. Static benchmarks lack agency,
while interactive benchmarks suffer from a severe modal bottleneck, typically
ignoring crucial auditory and temporal cues. To bridge this evaluation chasm,
we introduce OmniPlay, a diagnostic benchmark designed not just to evaluate,
but to probe the fusion and reasoning capabilities of agentic models across the
full sensory spectrum. Built on a core philosophy of modality interdependence,
OmniPlay comprises a suite of five game environments that systematically create
scenarios of both synergy and conflict, forcing agents to perform genuine
cross-modal reasoning. Our comprehensive evaluation of six leading omni-modal
models reveals a critical dichotomy: they exhibit superhuman performance on
high-fidelity memory tasks but suffer from systemic failures in challenges
requiring robust reasoning and strategic planning. We demonstrate that this
fragility stems from brittle fusion mechanisms, which lead to catastrophic
performance degradation under modality conflict and uncover a counter-intuitive
"less is more" paradox, where removing sensory information can paradoxically
improve performance. Our findings suggest that the path toward robust AGI
requires a research focus beyond scaling to explicitly address synergistic
fusion. Our platform is available for anonymous review at

*Weitai Kang,Bin Lei,Gaowen Liu,Caiwen Ding,Yan Yan*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper proposes GuirlVG, a method for graphical user interface visual grounding (GUI-VG) using reinforcement learning with significant improvements over conventional supervised fine-tuning (SFT).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the inefficiencies and high resource demands of supervised fine-tuning (SFT) in graphical user interface visual grounding (GUI-VG), especially as multimodal large language models (MLLMs) become increasingly capable.

Method: The proposed GuirlVG method uses reinforcement fine-tuning (RFT), decomposing its components, introducing a novel Adversarial KL Factor for stabilizing training, and optimizing training configurations for GUI-VG.

Result: GuirlVG, trained on just 5.2K samples, outperforms SFT models trained on over 10M samples, achieving significant accuracy improvements on multiple datasets: 7.7% on ScreenSpot, 17.2% on ScreenSpotPro, and 91.9% overall on ScreenSpotV2.

Conclusion: GuirlVG demonstrates that reinforcement fine-tuning can be more data-efficient and effective than traditional SFT for GUI-VG tasks, providing a promising alternative approach for training GUI agents.

Abstract: Graphical user interface visual grounding (GUI-VG), a core capability for GUI
agents, has primarily relied on supervised fine-tuning (SFT) of multimodal
large language models (MLLMs), which demands extensive data curation and
significant training costs. However, as MLLMs continue to advance and even
cover GUI domains during pretraining, the necessity of exhaustive SFT
post-training becomes increasingly questionable. Meanwhile, recent successes of
rule-based reinforcement fine-tuning (RFT) suggest a more efficient
alternative. Despite this promise, the optimal manner of applying RFT for
GUI-VG remains unexplored. To bridge this gap, we introduce GuirlVG, a
reinforcement learning-based GUI-VG method built on a systematic empirical
study and a novel stabilization technique. We find that naive application of
RFT underperforms the SFT baseline, motivating a deeper exploration. First, we
decompose RFT into its core components and analyze the optimal formulation of
each. Second, we propose a novel Adversarial KL Factor that dynamically
stabilizes training to mitigate reward over-optimization. Third, we further
explore the training configurations of RFT to enhance effectiveness. Extensive
experiments show that GuirlVG, with only 5.2K training samples, outperforms SFT
methods trained on over 10M samples, achieving a 7.7% improvement on
ScreenSpot, a 17.2% improvement on ScreenSpotPro, and 91.9% accuracy on
ScreenSpotV2.

*Thassilo M. Schiepanski,Nicholas Piël*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces D2Snap, a novel algorithm for DOM downsampling, addressing challenges in application state serialization for web agents.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM-enabled web agents face challenges in efficiently handling application state serialization (snapshots). While GUIs use grounded snapshots to simulate human perception, DOM snapshots are a promising alternative hindered by token input size constraints.

Method: The authors present D2Snap, a DOM downsampling algorithm. Using GPT-4o as the backend, they evaluate it on the Online-Mind2Web dataset, comparing DOM snapshots to traditional GUI snapshots.

Result: D2Snap achieves a 67% success rate, comparable to the 65% of GUI snapshots, within the same input token order. With the best configurations, it outperforms the GUI baseline by 8% within the model's context window.

Conclusion: D2Snap demonstrates that DOM downsampling is a viable and potentially superior alternative to GUI snapshots for web agents, leveraging DOM hierarchy as a strong UI feature.

Abstract: Frontier LLMs only recently enabled serviceable, autonomous web agents. At
that, a model poses as an instantaneous domain model backend. Ought to suggest
interaction, it is consulted with a web-based task and respective application
state. The key problem lies in application state serialisation
$\unicode{x2013}$ referred to as snapshot. State-of-the-art web agents are
premised on grounded GUI snapshots, i.e., screenshots enhanced with visual
cues. Not least to resemble human perception, but for images representing
relatively cheap means of model input. LLM vision still lag behind code
interpretation capabilities. DOM snapshots, which structurally resemble HTML,
impose a desired alternative. Vast model input token size, however, disables
reliable implementation with web agents to date.
  We propose D2Snap, a first-of-its-kind DOM downsampling algorithm. Based on a
GPT-4o backend, we evaluate D2Snap on tasks sampled from the Online-Mind2Web
dataset. The success rate of D2Snap-downsampled DOM snapshots (67%) matches a
grounded GUI snapshot baseline (65%) $\unicode{x2013}$ within the same input
token order of magnitude (1e3). Our best evaluated configurations
$\unicode{x2013}$ one token order above, but within the model's context window
$\unicode{x2013}$ outperform this baseline by 8%. Our evaluation, moreover,
yields that DOM-inherent hierarchy embodies a strong UI feature for LLMs.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: SimInstruct is a tool leveraging LLMs to simulate novice-expert instructional dialogues for creating scalable pedagogical scaffolding data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the scarcity of high-quality instructional dialogues due to privacy concerns and help-seeking vulnerability.

Method: Simulating novice instructors with LLMs exhibiting persona traits, allowing experts to provide feedback, which is further used to fine-tune an expert model.

Result: Generated dialogues showed pedagogical depth comparable to real mentoring, while the fine-tuned model outperformed GPT-4o in instructional quality.

Conclusion: SimInstruct offers a scalable framework for dialogue collection, advancing expert and model capabilities in instructional practices.

Abstract: High-quality, multi-turn instructional dialogues between novices and experts
are essential for developing AI systems that support teaching, learning, and
decision-making. These dialogues often involve scaffolding -- the process by
which an expert supports a novice's thinking through questions, feedback, and
step-by-step guidance. However, such data are scarce due to privacy concerns in
recording and the vulnerability inherent in help-seeking. We present
SimInstruct, a scalable, expert-in-the-loop tool for collecting scaffolding
dialogues. Using teaching development coaching as an example domain,
SimInstruct simulates novice instructors via LLMs, varying their teaching
challenges and LLM's persona traits, while human experts provide multi-turn
feedback, reasoning, and instructional support. This design enables the
creation of realistic, pedagogically rich dialogues without requiring real
novice participants. Our results reveal that persona traits, such as
extroversion and introversion, meaningfully influence how experts engage.
Compared to real mentoring recordings, SimInstruct dialogues demonstrate
comparable pedagogical relevance and cognitive depth. Experts also reported the
process as engaging and reflective, improving both data quality and their own
professional insight. We further fine-tuned a LLaMA model to be an expert model
using the augmented dataset, which outperformed GPT-4o in instructional
quality. Our analysis highlights GPT-4o's limitations in weak reflective
questioning, overuse of generic praise, a condescending tone, and a tendency to
overwhelm novices with excessive suggestions.

*Rui Ha,Chaozhuo Li,Rui Pu,Sen Su*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper presents MERA, a framework for optimizing large reasoning models by separating reasoning and control processes to improve efficiency and accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the uncontrolled reasoning behaviors and overthinking of Large Reasoning Models, which lead to high computational costs and latency, there is a need for regulatory mechanisms to better manage reasoning processes.

Method: The paper proposes MERA, which leverages takeover-based data construction, reasoning-control separation, supervised fine-tuning, and Control-Segment Policy Optimization to optimize reasoning and control capabilities.

Result: Experiments show that MERA improves reasoning efficiency and accuracy across various benchmarks by effectively regulating decision-making points and optimizing control signals.

Conclusion: MERA demonstrates the potential to refine reasoning models through structured control processes, making them more suitable for practical deployment by reducing costs and enhancing performance.

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have demonstrated a latent capacity for complex
reasoning by spontaneously exhibiting cognitive behaviors such as step-by-step
reasoning, reflection, and backtracking, commonly referred to as "Aha Moments".
However, such emergent behaviors remain unregulated and uncontrolled, often
resulting in overthinking, where the model continues generating redundant
reasoning content even after reaching reliable conclusions. This leads to
excessive computational costs and increased latency, limiting the practical
deployment of LRMs. The root cause lies in the absence of intrinsic regulatory
mechanisms, as current models are unable to monitor and adaptively manage their
reasoning process to determine when to continue, backtrack, or terminate. To
address this issue, we propose the Meta-cognitive Reasoning Framework (MERA),
which explicitly decouples the thinking process into distinct reasoning and
control components, thereby enabling the independent optimization of control
strategies. Specifically, MERA incorporates a takeover-based data construction
mechanism that identifies critical decision points during reasoning and
delegates the creation of control signals to auxiliary LLMs, thereby enabling
the construction of high-quality reasoning-control data. Additionally, a
structured reasoning-control separation is implemented via supervised
fine-tuning, enabling the model to generate explicit traces and acquire initial
meta-cognitive control capabilities. Finally, MERA employs Control-Segment
Policy Optimization (CSPO), which combines segment-wise Group Relative Policy
Optimization (GRPO) with a control-masking mechanism to optimize control
behavior learning while minimizing interference from irrelevant content.
Experiments on various reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that models trained
with MERA enhance both reasoning efficiency and accuracy.

Abstract: The dream to create AI assistants as capable and versatile as the fictional
J.A.R.V.I.S from Iron Man has long captivated imaginations. With the evolution
of (multi-modal) large language models ((M)LLMs), this dream is closer to

methodologies for constructing OS Agents, focusing on domain-specific
foundation models and agent frameworks. A detailed review of evaluation
protocols and benchmarks highlights how OS Agents are assessed across diverse
tasks. Finally, we discuss current challenges and identify promising directions
for future research, including safety and privacy, personalization and

*Hamed Ayoobi,Nico Potyka,Anna Rapberger,Francesca Toni*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes a novel interpretable and explainable method for detecting bias in AI systems, leveraging formal argumentation and debates about biases across individual neighborhoods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As AI systems become integral to society, there is a need to address biases that may disadvantage certain groups. Ensuring interpretability and explainability in detecting and mitigating unfairness is crucial.

Method: The authors introduce a bias detection method based on arguments about biases within and across neighborhoods of individuals, relying on formal and computational argumentation techniques.

Result: The method demonstrates strong performance against baselines in formal, quantitative, and qualitative evaluations, while emphasizing its interpretability and explainability.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively identifies biases in an interpretable and explainable manner, addressing a significant gap in current fairness algorithms.

Abstract: As the use of AI systems in society grows, addressing potential biases that
emerge from data or are learned by models is essential to prevent systematic
disadvantages against specific groups. Several notions of (un)fairness have
been proposed in the literature, alongside corresponding algorithmic methods
for detecting and mitigating unfairness, but, with very few exceptions, these
tend to ignore transparency. Instead, interpretability and explainability are
core requirements for algorithmic fairness, even more so than for other
algorithmic solutions, given the human-oriented nature of fairness. In this
paper, we contribute a novel interpretable, explainable method for bias
detection relying on debates about the presence of bias against individuals,
based on the values of protected features for the individuals and others in
their neighbourhoods. Our method builds upon techniques from formal and
computational argumentation, whereby debates result from arguing about biases
within and across neighbourhoods. We provide formal, quantitative, and
qualitative evaluations of our method, highlighting its strengths in
performance against baselines, as well as its interpretability and

### [29] [SID: Benchmarking Guided Instruction Capabilities in STEM Education with a Socratic Interdisciplinary Dialogues Dataset](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04563)
*Mei Jiang,Houping Yue,Bingdong Li,Hao Hao,Ying Qian,Bo Jiang,Aimin Zhou*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces SID, a benchmark for evaluating LLMs in interdisciplinary guided STEM dialogues, and finds room for improvement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Modern education aims to foster students' abilities for knowledge integration and transfer in STEM, but current methods are hard to scale. LLMs offer potential but lack robust evaluation tools.

Method: The authors introduce SID, comprising a dataset of 10,000 dialogue turns, a new annotation schema for pedagogy, and evaluation metrics like X-SRG to test LLM guidance capabilities.

Result: Baseline trials reveal that state-of-the-art LLMs struggle with effective guided Socratic dialogues, showing their limitations in meeting educational objectives.

Conclusion: SID is a valuable benchmark that could promote the development of pedagogically-aware LLMs for interdisciplinary STEM education.

Abstract: Fostering students' abilities for knowledge integration and transfer in
complex problem-solving scenarios is a core objective of modern education, and
interdisciplinary STEM is a key pathway to achieve this, yet it requires expert
guidance that is difficult to scale. While LLMs offer potential in this regard,
their true capability for guided instruction remains unclear due to the lack of
an effective evaluation benchmark. To address this, we introduce SID, the first
benchmark designed to systematically evaluate the higher-order guidance
capabilities of LLMs in multi-turn, interdisciplinary Socratic dialogues. Our
contributions include a large-scale dataset of 10,000 dialogue turns across 48
complex STEM projects, a novel annotation schema for capturing deep pedagogical
features, and a new suite of evaluation metrics (e.g., X-SRG). Baseline
experiments confirm that even state-of-the-art LLMs struggle to execute
effective guided dialogues that lead students to achieve knowledge integration
and transfer. This highlights the critical value of our benchmark in driving
the development of more pedagogically-aware LLMs.

### [30] [ConfProBench: A Confidence Evaluation Benchmark for MLLM-Based Process Judges](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04576)
*Yue Zhou,Yi Chang,Yuan Wu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces ConfProBench, a benchmark for assessing the reliability of step-level confidence scores of MLLM-based process judges (MPJs) in multimodal reasoning tasks, including methods for testing robustness and sensitivity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the absence of systematic evaluation for step-level confidence scores in MPJs, vital for improving reasoning capabilities in multimodal tasks.

Method: ConfProBench is proposed with adversarially perturbed reasoning steps (Synonym Substitution, Syntactic Transformation, Image Perturbation) and three novel metrics: CRS, CSS, and CCS for evaluation.

Result: Evaluation of 14 state-of-the-art MLLMs shows limitations in the reliability of MPJ confidence scores and establishes competitive benchmarks.

Conclusion: The study highlights weaknesses in current MPJs and provides tools for systematic evaluation, guiding future advancements in multimodal reasoning systems.

Abstract: Reasoning is a critical capability of multimodal large language models
(MLLMs) for solving complex multimodal tasks, and judging the correctness of
reasoning steps is crucial for improving this capability. Recently, MLLM-based
process judges (MPJs) have been widely used to assess the correctness of
reasoning steps in multimodal tasks. Therefore, evaluating MPJs is important
for identifying their limitations and guiding future improvements. However,
existing benchmarks for MPJs mainly focus on tasks such as step correctness
classification and reasoning process search, while overlooking a key aspect:
whether the confidence scores produced by MPJs at the step level are reliable.
To address this gap, we propose ConfProBench, the first comprehensive benchmark
designed to systematically evaluate the reliability of step-level confidence
scores generated by MPJs. Our benchmark constructs three types of adversarially
perturbed reasoning steps: Synonym Substitution, Syntactic Transformation, and
Image Perturbation, to test the robustness of MPJ confidence under
perturbations. In addition, we introduce three novel evaluation metrics:
Confidence Robustness Score (CRS), Confidence Sensitivity Score (CSS), and
Confidence Calibration Score (CCS), which evaluate robustness, sensitivity, and
calibration, respectively. We evaluate 14 state-of-the-art MLLMs, including
both proprietary and open-source models. Experiments reveal limitations in
current MPJs' confidence performance and offer competitive baselines to support
future research.

*Zeyi Sun,Ziyu Liu,Yuhang Zang,Yuhang Cao,Xiaoyi Dong,Tong Wu,Dahua Lin,Jiaqi Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces SEAgent, a self-evolving framework enabling large vision-language models to autonomously master novel software environments and improve their performance without relying on human-labeled annotations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional LVLMs struggle when utilizing novel or specialized software due to the absence of human-labeled data, revealing the need for a framework that facilitates autonomous adaptation.

Method: SEAgent uses experiential learning to help agents explore and master software. Core features include a World State Model for trajectory assessments and a Curriculum Generator for task progression, coupled with Group Relative Policy Optimization to refine the policy optimization process.

Result: SEAgent achieved a significant improvement of 23.2% in success rate (from 11.3% to 34.5%) in navigating five novel software environments compared to UI-TARS.

Conclusion: SEAgent effectively empowers CUAs to autonomously evolve, master unfamiliar software, and outperform specialist agent ensembles in their domains, marking a significant advancement in autonomous software navigation.

Abstract: Repurposing large vision-language models (LVLMs) as computer use agents
(CUAs) has led to substantial breakthroughs, primarily driven by human-labeled
data. However, these models often struggle with novel and specialized software,
particularly in scenarios lacking human annotations. To address this challenge,
we propose SEAgent, an agentic self-evolving framework enabling CUAs to
autonomously evolve through interactions with unfamiliar software.
Specifically, SEAgent empowers computer-use agents to autonomously master novel
software environments via experiential learning, where agents explore new
software, learn through iterative trial-and-error, and progressively tackle
auto-generated tasks organized from simple to complex. To achieve this goal, we
design a World State Model for step-wise trajectory assessment, along with a
Curriculum Generator that generates increasingly diverse and challenging tasks.
The agent's policy is updated through experiential learning, comprised of
adversarial imitation of failure actions and Group Relative Policy Optimization
(GRPO) on successful ones. Furthermore, we introduce a specialist-to-generalist
training strategy that integrates individual experiential insights from
specialist agents, facilitating the development of a stronger generalist CUA
capable of continuous autonomous evolution. This unified agent ultimately
achieves performance surpassing ensembles of individual specialist agents on
their specialized software. We validate the effectiveness of SEAgent across
five novel software environments within OS-World. Our approach achieves a
significant improvement of 23.2% in success rate, from 11.3% to 34.5%, over a
competitive open-source CUA, i.e., UI-TARS.

### [32] [Rhea: a Framework for Fast Design and Validation of RTL Cache-Coherent Memory Subsystems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03837)
*Davide Zoni,Andrea Galimberti,Adriano Guarisco*

Main category: cs.AR

TL;DR: Rhea is a framework for designing and validating RTL cache-coherent memory subsystems, integrating Verilator's simulation with gem5's full-system capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to simplify and improve the design and validation of RTL cache-coherent memory subsystems for modern multi-core architectures.

Method: Rhea combines synthesizable RTL generation with a hybrid simulation platform using Verilator and gem5 to validate designs with realistic workloads.

Result: Evaluation of MSI-based RTL memory subsystems shows intermediate performance compared to gem5 models, with simulation overhead decreasing as cores scale up.

Conclusion: The framework is effective and scalable, providing high-fidelity results while enabling faster development of RTL memory subsystem designs.

Abstract: Designing and validating efficient cache-coherent memory subsystems is a
critical yet complex task in the development of modern multi-core
system-on-chip architectures. Rhea is a unified framework that streamlines the
design and system-level validation of RTL cache-coherent memory subsystems. On
the design side, Rhea generates synthesizable, highly configurable RTL
supporting various architectural parameters. On the validation side, Rhea
integrates Verilator's cycle-accurate RTL simulation with gem5's full-system
simulation, allowing realistic workloads and operating systems to run alongside
the actual RTL under test. We apply Rhea to design MSI-based RTL memory
subsystems with one and two levels of private caches and scaling up to sixteen
cores. Their evaluation with 22 applications from state-of-the-art benchmark
suites shows intermediate performance relative to gem5 Ruby's MI and MOESI
models. The hybrid gem5-Verilator co-simulation flow incurs a moderate
simulation overhead, up to 2.7 times compared to gem5 MI, but achieves higher
fidelity by simulating real RTL hardware. This overhead decreases with scale,
down to 1.6 times in sixteen-core scenarios. These results demonstrate Rhea's
effectiveness and scalability in enabling fast development of RTL
cache-coherent memory subsystem designs.

Main category: cs.AR

TL;DR: FlashVault is an in-NAND self-encryption architecture embedded into 4D V-NAND chips, offering enhanced performance in cryptographic tasks without additional area overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the need for efficient, secure, and self-contained cryptographic solutions within NAND flash chips, eliminating external encryption overhead.

Method: The authors embed a reconfigurable cryptographic engine into the unused silicon area of 4D V-NAND chips. FlashVault supports a variety of cryptographic tasks and integrates this design into a full-system simulation for performance benchmarking.

Result: FlashVault achieves 1.46-3.45x better performance than CPU-based encryption and 1.02-2.01x better performance than near-core architectures on encryption and digital signature tasks.

Conclusion: FlashVault demonstrates that integrating cryptographic engines directly into NAND chips results in significant performance benefits while meeting diverse security requirements effectively.

Abstract: We present FlashVault, an in-NAND self-encryption architecture that embeds a
reconfigurable cryptographic engine into the unused silicon area of a
state-of-the-art 4D V-NAND structure. FlashVault supports not only block
ciphers for data encryption but also public-key and post-quantum algorithms for
digital signatures, all within the NAND flash chip. This design enables each
NAND chip to operate as a self-contained enclave without incurring area
overhead, while eliminating the need for off-chip encryption. We implement
FlashVault at the register-transfer level (RTL) and perform place-and-route
(P&R) for accurate power/area evaluation. Our analysis shows that the power
budget determines the number of cryptographic engines per NAND chip. We
integrate this architectural choice into a full-system simulation and evaluate
its performance on a wide range of cryptographic algorithms. Our results show
that FlashVault consistently outperforms both CPU-based encryption (1.46~3.45x)
and near-core processing architecture (1.02~2.01x), demonstrating its
effectiveness as a secure SSD architecture that meets diverse cryptographic
requirements imposed by regulatory standards and enterprise policies.

### [34] [TROOP: At-the-Roofline Performance for Vector Processors on Low Operational Intensity Workloads](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03900)
*Navaneeth Kunhi Purayil,Diyou Shen,Matteo Perotti,Luca Benini*

Main category: cs.AR

TL;DR: The paper presents TROOP, a hardware optimization framework for Vector Processing Elements (VPEs) to achieve higher memory bandwidth utilization and energy efficiency. It delivers substantial performance improvements in memory-intensive tasks with minimal area overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Machine Learning models evolve rapidly, requiring hardware that is both flexible and energy-efficient. Current VPE designs are limited in memory bandwidth and are inefficient for low data reuse workloads like General Matrix-Vector Multiplication (GEMV).

Method: TROOP introduces hardware optimizations such as decoupled load-store interfaces, enhanced vector chaining, shadow buffers to mitigate VRF conflicts, and address scrambling techniques. These aim to maximize L1 memory bandwidth utilization while maintaining compact and efficient architectures.

Result: The TROOP framework achieves speedups of up to 2.6x for memory-intensive kernels, improves energy efficiency by up to 45%, and achieves high energy efficiency metrics (61 DP-GFLOPs/W for GEMMs). It does so with less than 7% area overhead.

Conclusion: TROOP dramatically enhances VPE performance for memory-intensive workloads, making them closer to their theoretical memory access limits (at-the-roofline). The framework achieves this while maintaining energy efficiency and minimal hardware area overhead.

Abstract: The fast evolution of Machine Learning (ML) models requires flexible and
efficient hardware solutions as hardwired accelerators face rapid obsolescence.
Vector processors are fully programmable and achieve high energy efficiencies
by exploiting data parallelism, amortizing instruction fetch and decoding
costs. Hence, a promising design choice is to build accelerators based on
shared L1-memory clusters of streamlined Vector Processing Elements (VPEs).
However, current state-of-the-art VPEs are limited in L1 memory bandwidth and
achieve high efficiency only for computational kernels with high data reuse in
the Vector Register File (VRF), such as General Matrix Multiplication (GEMM).
Performance is suboptimal for workloads with lower data reuse like General
Matrix-Vector Multiplication (GEMV). To fully exploit available bandwidth at
the L1 memory interface, the VPE micro-architecture must be optimized to
achieve near-ideal utilization, i.e., to be as close as possible to the L1
memory roofline (at-the-roofline). In this work, we propose TROOP, a set of
hardware optimizations that include decoupled load-store interfaces, improved
vector chaining, shadow buffers to hide VRF conflicts, and address scrambling
techniques to achieve at-the-roofline performance for VPEs without compromising
their area and energy efficiency. We implement TROOP on an open-source
streamlined vector processor in a 12nm FinFET technology. TROOP achieves
significant speedups of 1.5x, 2.2x, and 2.6x, respectively, for key
memory-intensive kernels such as GEMV, DOTP and AXPY, achieving at-the-roofline
performance. Additionally, TROOP enhances the energy efficiency by up to 45%,
reaching 38 DP-GFLOPs/W (1 GHz, TT, 0.8V) for DOTP while maintaining a high
energy efficiency of 61 DP-GFLOPs/W for GEMMs, incurring only a minor area
overhead of less than 7%.

Result: OpenYield demonstrates its utility in improving SRAM design robustness and efficiency, providing standardized benchmarks and fostering reproducibility.

Conclusion: OpenYield establishes a framework for improved collaboration between academia and industry in memory design innovation and is freely accessible to the public.

Abstract: Static Random-Access Memory (SRAM) yield analysis is essential for

comprehensive open-source ecosystem designed to address this critical gap
through three core contributions: (1) A realistic SRAM circuit generator that
uniquely incorporates critical second-order-effect parasitics, inter-cell
leakage coupling, and peripheral circuit variations, which are typically
omitted in academic studies but decisive in industrial designs. (2) A
standardized evaluation platform with a simple interface and implemented
baseline yield analysis algorithms, enabling fair comparisons and reproducible
research. (3) A standardized SRAM optimization platform, demonstrating
OpenYield's utility in enhancing SRAM design robustness and efficiency,
providing a comprehensive benchmark for optimization algorithms. OpenYield

TL;DR: ECOLogic combines the advantages of ASICs and FPGAs by embedding eFPGA fabric into ASICs, leading to high performance, reconfigurability, and sustainability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the limitations of traditional hardware platforms, such as inflexibility and high costs of ASICs and the performance inefficiency of FPGAs, while addressing sustainability and security concerns.

Method: ECOLogic introduces a hybrid design integrating eFPGA fabric within ASICs, guided by a scoring framework (ECOScore) for partitioning IPs based on adaptability, performance, and resource efficiency.

Result: ECOLogic achieves an average of 90% ASIC performance, 480x power reduction, and a 99.7% reduction in carbon footprint compared to FPGA-only implementations, while maintaining high timing slack and security.

Conclusion: ECOLogic establishes a secure, high-performance, and environmentally friendly approach for next-generation reconfigurable systems, effectively blending the strengths of ASICs and FPGAs.

Abstract: Traditional hardware platforms - ASICs and FPGAs - offer competing trade-offs
among performance, flexibility, and sustainability. ASICs provide high
efficiency but are inflexible post-fabrication, require costly re-spins for
updates, and expose IPs to piracy risks. FPGAs offer reconfigurability and
reuse, yet suffer from substantial area, power, and performance overheads,
resulting in higher carbon footprints. We present ECOLogic, a hybrid design
paradigm that embeds lightweight eFPGA fabric within ASICs to enable secure,
updatable, and resource-aware computation. Central to this architecture is
ECOScore, a quantitative scoring framework that evaluates IPs based on
adaptability, piracy threat, performance tolerance, and resource fit to guide
RTL partitioning. Evaluated across six diverse SoC modules, ECOLogic retains an
average of 90 percent ASIC-level performance (up to 2 GHz), achieves 9.8 ns
timing slack (versus 5.1 ns in FPGA), and reduces power by 480 times on
average. Moreover, sustainability analysis shows a 99.7 percent reduction in
deployment carbon footprint and 300 to 500 times lower emissions relative to
FPGA-only implementations. These results position ECOLogic as a
high-performance, secure, and environmentally sustainable solution for
next-generation reconfigurable systems.

*Osama Abdelaleim,Arun Prakash,Ayhan Irfanoglu,Veljko Milutinovic*

Main category: cs.AR

TL;DR: This paper proposes an analog direct solver circuit for solving symmetric positive definite linear systems efficiently, achieving near maximum computational speed values.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation stems from the need to accelerate linear system equation solutions, which are vital in scientific, analytical, and machine learning applications.

Method: The study utilizes non-inverting operational amplifier configurations to design a negative-resistance circuit, capable of representing symmetric systems accurately.

Result: The proposed system achieves O(1) complexity for diagonally dominant symmetric matrices and demonstrates robustness, while performance varies based on eigenvalues and off-diagonal terms for non-diagonally dominant systems.

Conclusion: This innovative circuit design provides a fast and effective method for solving symmetric matrices, with computational speed dependent on matrix properties but independent of matrix size.

Abstract: Accelerating the solution of linear systems of equations is critical due to
their central role in numerous applications, such as scientific simulations,
data analytics, and machine learning. This paper presents a general-purpose
analog direct solver circuit designed to accelerate the solution of positive
definite symmetric linear systems of equations. The proposed design leverages
non-inverting operational amplifier configurations to create a negative
resistance circuit, effectively modeling any symmetric system. The paper
details the principles behind the design, optimizations of the system
architecture, and numerical results that demonstrate the robustness of the
design. The findings reveal that the proposed system solves diagonally dominant
symmetric matrices with O(1) complexity, achieving the theoretical maximum
speed as the circuit relies solely on resistors. For non-diagonally dominant
symmetric positive-definite systems, the solution speed depends on matrix
properties such as eigenvalues and the maximum off-diagonal term, but remains
independent of matrix size.

*Agrima Seth,Monojit Choudhary,Sunayana Sitaram,Kentaro Toyama,Aditya Vashistha,Kalika Bali*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study analyzes GPT-4 Turbo's representational bias, focusing on religion and caste in India, and finds that biases are deeply ingrained and resistant to prompt adjustments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore representational biases in GPT-4 Turbo beyond traditional North-centric dimensions like race and gender, focusing on religion and caste in the Indian context.

Method: A systematic audit where the model generated over 7,200 stories about Indian life events using prompts of varying diversity to analyze representation against census data.

Result: The model overrepresents dominant groups, showing biases beyond training data distribution. Prompts encouraging diversity had limited impact on mitigating biases.

Conclusion: Training data diversification alone cannot address biases in LLMs; deeper changes in model development are necessary.

Abstract: Representational bias in large language models (LLMs) has predominantly been
measured through single-response interactions and has focused on Global
North-centric identities like race and gender. We expand on that research by
conducting a systematic audit of GPT-4 Turbo to reveal how deeply encoded
representational biases are and how they extend to less-explored dimensions of
identity. We prompt GPT-4 Turbo to generate over 7,200 stories about
significant life events (such as weddings) in India, using prompts designed to
encourage diversity to varying extents. Comparing the diversity of religious
and caste representation in the outputs against the actual population
distribution in India as recorded in census data, we quantify the presence and
"stickiness" of representational bias in the LLM for religion and caste. We
find that GPT-4 responses consistently overrepresent culturally dominant groups
far beyond their statistical representation, despite prompts intended to
encourage representational diversity. Our findings also suggest that
representational bias in LLMs has a winner-take-all quality that is more biased
than the likely distribution bias in their training data, and repeated
prompt-based nudges have limited and inconsistent efficacy in dislodging these
biases. These results suggest that diversifying training data alone may not be
sufficient to correct LLM bias, highlighting the need for more fundamental
changes in model development. Dataset and Codebook:

Performance comparisons were made using abstract completion tasks.

Result: The specialized models demonstrated superior performance on hep-th abstract completion tasks compared to the base model and established commercial LLMs such as ChatGPT, Claude, and Gemini.

Conclusion: Specialized fine-tuning enhances performance in domain-specific tasks like High-Energy Physics. This approach offers insights for creating more effective tailored LLMs for theoretical physics and potentially other scientific fields.

Abstract: We present specialized Large Language Models for theoretical High-Energy
Physics, obtained as 20 fine-tuned variants of the 8-billion parameter
Llama-3.1 model. Each variant was trained on arXiv abstracts (through August
2024) from different combinations of hep-th, hep-ph and gr-qc. For a
comparative study, we also trained models on datasets that contained abstracts
from disparate fields such as the q-bio and cs categories. All models were
fine-tuned using two distinct Low-Rank Adaptation fine-tuning approaches and
varying dataset sizes, and outperformed the base model on hep-th abstract
completion tasks. We compare performance against leading commercial LLMs
(ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, DeepSeek) and derive insights for further developing
specialized language models for High-Energy Theoretical Physics.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of timely and accessible agricultural advice for Indian farmers, especially in rural areas with low literacy.

Method: Krishi Sathi combines intent-driven dialogues, instruction-tuned learning, and retrieval-augmented generation, supported by curated datasets and speech features for user accessibility.

Result: Krishi Sathi achieved 97.53% accuracy, 91.35% contextual relevance, and a query completion rate of 97.53%, with responses under 6 seconds.

Conclusion: Krishi Sathi effectively improves digital agricultural support accessibility and quality for Indian farmers, demonstrating strong performance metrics and user-friendly features.

Abstract: Indian farmers often lack timely, accessible, and language-friendly
agricultural advice, especially in rural areas with low literacy. To address
this gap in accessibility, this paper presents a novel AI-powered agricultural
chatbot, Krishi Sathi, designed to support Indian farmers by providing
personalized, easy-to-understand answers to their queries through both text and
speech. The system's intelligence stems from an IFT model, subsequently refined
through fine-tuning on Indian agricultural knowledge across three curated
datasets. Unlike traditional chatbots that respond to one-off questions, Krishi
Sathi follows a structured, multi-turn conversation flow to gradually collect
the necessary details from the farmer, ensuring the query is fully understood
before generating a response. Once the intent and context are extracted, the
system performs Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) by first fetching
information from a curated agricultural database and then generating a tailored
response using the IFT model. The chatbot supports both English and Hindi
languages, with speech input and output features (via ASR and TTS) to make it
accessible for users with low literacy or limited digital skills. This work
demonstrates how combining intent-driven dialogue flows, instruction-tuned
models, and retrieval-based generation can improve the quality and
accessibility of digital agricultural support in India.
  This approach yielded strong results, with the system achieving a query
response accuracy of 97.53%, 91.35% contextual relevance and personalization,
and a query completion rate of 97.53%. The average response time remained under
6 seconds, ensuring timely support for users across both English and Hindi
interactions.

TL;DR: This paper introduces the Hierarchical Verification Tree (HVT) framework to prioritize high-likelihood drafts and prune suboptimal ones, optimizing LLM inference efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs excel at natural language processing tasks but face efficiency challenges due to their autoregressive nature. Existing decoding methods lack effective prioritization, leading to computational inefficiencies.

Method: The paper proposes the Hierarchical Verification Tree (HVT) framework, which restructures speculative beam decoding with a verification-pruning algorithm to prioritize strong drafts and prune weaker candidates early.

Result: Experiments showed that HVT improves inference efficiency across multiple datasets and models, reducing inference time and energy while maintaining or improving the quality of the outputs.

Conclusion: HVT serves as a promising hierarchical verification approach for accelerating LLM inference by improving efficiency and maintaining output quality, marking a significant advancement in inference optimization.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success across diverse
natural language processing tasks but face persistent challenges in inference
efficiency due to their autoregressive nature. While speculative decoding and
beam sampling offer notable improvements, traditional methods verify draft
sequences sequentially without prioritization, leading to unnecessary
computational overhead. This work proposes the Hierarchical Verification Tree
(HVT), a novel framework that restructures speculative beam decoding by
prioritizing high-likelihood drafts and enabling early pruning of suboptimal
candidates. Theoretical foundations and a formal verification-pruning algorithm
are developed to ensure correctness and efficiency. Integration with standard
LLM inference pipelines is achieved without requiring retraining or
architecture modification. Experimental evaluations across multiple datasets
and models demonstrate that HVT consistently outperforms existing speculative
decoding schemes, achieving substantial reductions in inference time and energy
consumption while maintaining or enhancing output quality. The findings
highlight the potential of hierarchical verification strategies as a new
direction for accelerating large language model inference.

Motivation: The paper addresses the challenge of maintaining up-to-date Wikipedia content relying on manual editing, inspired by endeavors like NELL and LLM advances.

Method: WiNELL uses a multi-agent framework to gather online information, identify significant updates, and suggest precise edits trained on Wikipedia’s editing history.

Result: WiNELL outperforms baselines and closed-source LLMs like GPT-4o in information coverage and editing efficiency, demonstrated through high-activity page evaluation.

Conclusion: WiNELL is a promising step towards automatic and continuous updates to Wikipedia, highlighting advancements for LLM-based knowledge base innovation.

Abstract: Wikipedia, a vast and continuously consulted knowledge base, faces

manual human editors. Inspired by the vision of continuous knowledge
acquisition in NELL and fueled by advances in LLM-based agents, this paper
introduces WiNELL, an agentic framework for continuously updating Wikipedia

Wikipedia, and then generate precise edit suggestions for human review. Our
fine-grained editing models, trained on Wikipedia's extensive history of human
edits, enable incorporating updates in a manner consistent with human editing
behavior. Our editor models outperform both open-source instruction-following
baselines and closed-source LLMs (e.g., GPT-4o) in key information coverage and
editing efficiency. End-to-end evaluation on high-activity Wikipedia pages
demonstrates WiNELL's ability to identify and suggest timely factual updates.
This opens up a promising research direction in LLM agents for automatically
updating knowledge bases in a never-ending fashion.

### [43] [GanitBench: A bi-lingual benchmark for evaluating mathematical reasoning in Vision Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03737)
*Ashutosh Bandooni,Brindha Subburaj*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces GanitBench, a bilingual benchmark in English and Hindi for evaluating vision language models (VLMs) on tough mathematics-related questions derived from Indian academic examinations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a scarcity of bilingual benchmarks, especially for languages like Hindi, in tasks beyond basic comprehension and translation. The need for reasoning challenges in VLMs across multiple languages motivates the development of GanitBench.

Method: The authors curated 1527 vision-only mathematics questions sourced from JEE Advanced and CBSE exams into a benchmark, and evaluated two closed-source VLMs in zero-shot and two-shot Chain-of-Thought (CoT) settings.

Result: GPT-4o mini outperformed its counterpart with a highest average accuracy of 38.15%, although model performance notably declined under the 'Double Lock' constraint and when answering Hindi-language questions.

Conclusion: The study emphasizes the necessity of bilingual benchmarks like GanitBench, highlights limitations of current VLMs in handling non-English languages, and sheds light on effective evaluation settings such as two-shot CoT.

Abstract: Benchmarks for evaluating reasoning among Vision Language Models (VLMs) on
several fields and domains are being curated more frequently over the last few
years. However these are often monolingual, mostly available in English.
Additionally there also is a lack of datasets available in Hindi on tasks apart
from comprehension and translation. We introduce GanitBench, a tough benchmark
consisting of 1527 vision-only questions covering several topics in Mathematics
- available in languages English and Hindi. Collected from two major
examinations from India, the JEE Advanced and the CBSE Boards examinations,
this benchmark includes questions in the form of images comprising of figures
essential to a question as well as text. We evaluate two closed source models
for the same, in zero-shot Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and two-shot CoT settings.
GPT-4o mini is found to be the more dominant model on the benchmark, with it's
highest average accuracy being 38.15%. We also evaluate models through a
"Double Lock" constraint, which brings down the performance of the models by
considerable margins. We observe that two-shot CoT appears to be a more
effective setting under this environment. Performance of the two VLMs also
decreases when answering the same questions in the Hindi language. We hope to
facilitate the inclusion of languages like Hindi in research through our work.

*Yanting Wang,Runpeng Geng,Ying Chen,Jinyuan Jia*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces AttnTrace, an efficient method for tracing back subsets of context influencing LLM outputs using attention weights, outperforming state-of-the-art solutions in accuracy and computational efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the computational inefficiency and limited accuracy of existing traceback methods like TracLLM, which are essential for improving the trustworthiness and interpretability of LLM-generated outputs.

Method: AttnTrace leverages attention weights from LLMs for context traceback, complemented by two enhancement techniques and theoretical support for design choices.

Result: Experimental evaluations show that AttnTrace is more accurate and faster than current methods, and it effectively detects malicious context injections and pinpoint manipulated instructions.

Conclusion: AttnTrace offers a significant advancement in efficient and accurate context traceback, improving applications like prompt injection detection and forensic analysis in real-world scenarios.

Abstract: Long-context large language models (LLMs), such as Gemini-2.5-Pro and
Claude-Sonnet-4, are increasingly used to empower advanced AI systems,
including retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipelines and autonomous agents.
In these systems, an LLM receives an instruction along with a context--often
consisting of texts retrieved from a knowledge database or memory--and
generates a response that is contextually grounded by following the
instruction. Recent studies have designed solutions to trace back to a subset
of texts in the context that contributes most to the response generated by the
LLM. These solutions have numerous real-world applications, including
performing post-attack forensic analysis and improving the interpretability and
trustworthiness of LLM outputs. While significant efforts have been made,
state-of-the-art solutions such as TracLLM often lead to a high computation
cost, e.g., it takes TracLLM hundreds of seconds to perform traceback for a
single response-context pair. In this work, we propose AttnTrace, a new context
traceback method based on the attention weights produced by an LLM for a
prompt. To effectively utilize attention weights, we introduce two techniques
designed to enhance the effectiveness of AttnTrace, and we provide theoretical
insights for our design choice. We also perform a systematic evaluation for
AttnTrace. The results demonstrate that AttnTrace is more accurate and
efficient than existing state-of-the-art context traceback methods. We also
show that AttnTrace can improve state-of-the-art methods in detecting prompt
injection under long contexts through the attribution-before-detection
paradigm. As a real-world application, we demonstrate that AttnTrace can
effectively pinpoint injected instructions in a paper designed to manipulate
LLM-generated reviews. The code is at

### [45] [Majority Bit-Aware Watermarking For Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03829)
*Jiahao Xu,Rui Hu,Zikai Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MajorMark and MajorMark+ enhance Large Language Model (LLM) watermarking by improving text quality and decoding accuracy using novel encoding and decoding strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The misuse of LLMs to generate harmful or deceptive content requires advanced watermarking strategies to trace origins and ensure responsible usage.

Method: MajorMark uses majority bit-aware encoding and clustering-based decoding strategies to balance content quality and decoding accuracy. MajorMark+ further partitions messages into blocks for improved performance.

Result: Experiments show MajorMark and MajorMark+ outperform previous watermarking methods in both text quality and decoding accuracy.

Conclusion: MajorMark and MajorMark+ provide robust solutions for embedding identifiable messages in LLM outputs, addressing quality and accuracy challenges effectively.

Abstract: The growing deployment of Large Language Models (LLMs) in real-world
applications has raised concerns about their potential misuse in generating
harmful or deceptive content. To address this issue, watermarking techniques
have emerged as a promising solution by embedding identifiable binary messages
into generated text for origin verification and misuse tracing. While recent
efforts have explored multi-bit watermarking schemes capable of embedding rich
information such as user identifiers, they typically suffer from the
fundamental trade-off between text quality and decoding accuracy: to ensure
reliable message decoding, they have to restrict the size of preferred token
sets during encoding, yet such restrictions reduce the quality of the generated
content. In this work, we propose MajorMark, a novel watermarking method that
improves this trade-off through majority bit-aware encoding. MajorMark selects
preferred token sets based on the majority bit of the message, enabling a
larger and more flexible sampling of tokens. In contrast to prior methods that
rely on token frequency analysis for decoding, MajorMark employs a
clustering-based decoding strategy, which maintains high decoding accuracy even
when the preferred token set is large, thus preserving both content quality and
decoding accuracy. We further introduce MajorMark$^+$, which partitions the
message into multiple blocks to independently encode and deterministically
decode each block, thereby further enhancing the quality of watermarked text
and improving decoding accuracy. Extensive experiments on state-of-the-art LLMs
demonstrate that our methods significantly enhance both decoding accuracy and
text generation quality, outperforming prior multi-bit watermarking baselines.

Conclusion: Strong fact-checking frameworks employing advanced techniques can address factual consistency challenges in LLMs, contributing to the development of more trustworthy and domain-sensitive models.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are trained on vast and diverse internet corpora
that often include inaccurate or misleading content. Consequently, LLMs can
generate misinformation, making robust fact-checking essential. This review
systematically analyzes how LLM-generated content is evaluated for factual
accuracy by exploring key challenges such as hallucinations, dataset
limitations, and the reliability of evaluation metrics. The review emphasizes
the need for strong fact-checking frameworks that integrate advanced prompting
strategies, domain-specific fine-tuning, and retrieval-augmented generation
(RAG) methods. It proposes five research questions that guide the analysis of
the recent literature from 2020 to 2025, focusing on evaluation methods and
mitigation techniques. The review also discusses the role of instruction
tuning, multi-agent reasoning, and external knowledge access via RAG
frameworks. Key findings highlight the limitations of current metrics, the
value of grounding outputs with validated external evidence, and the importance
of domain-specific customization to improve factual consistency. Overall, the
review underlines the importance of building LLMs that are not only accurate
and explainable but also tailored for domain-specific fact-checking. These
insights contribute to the advancement of research toward more trustworthy and
context-aware language models.

### [47] [An Entity Linking Agent for Question Answering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03865)
*Yajie Luo,Yihong Wu,Muzhi Li,Fengran Mo,Jia Ao Sun,Xinyu Wang,Liheng Ma,Yingxue Zhang,Jian-Yun Nie*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces an entity linking agent for question answering (QA) using large language models to address limitations in current methods for short, ambiguous questions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the shortcomings of existing entity linking methods, which are mainly designed for long contexts, in handling short and ambiguous user questions during QA tasks.

Method: A large language model-based agent is proposed that mimics human cognitive processes to actively identify entity mentions, retrieve candidate matches, and make decisions during entity linking for QA.

Result: Experiments demonstrate the robustness and effectiveness of the agent in both tool-based entity linking and QA task scenarios.

Conclusion: The proposed entity linking agent successfully bridges the gap in EL performance for short and ambiguous questions in QA systems, proving to be an effective solution.

Abstract: Some Question Answering (QA) systems rely on knowledge bases (KBs) to provide
accurate answers. Entity Linking (EL) plays a critical role in linking natural
language mentions to KB entries. However, most existing EL methods are designed
for long contexts and do not perform well on short, ambiguous user questions in
QA tasks. We propose an entity linking agent for QA, based on a Large Language
Model that simulates human cognitive workflows. The agent actively identifies
entity mentions, retrieves candidate entities, and makes decision. To verify
the effectiveness of our agent, we conduct two experiments: tool-based entity
linking and QA task evaluation. The results confirm the robustness and
effectiveness of our agent.

*Haofei Yu,Zhengyang Qi,Yining Zhao,Kolby Nottingham,Keyang Xuan,Bodhisattwa Prasad Majumder,Hao Zhu,Paul Pu Liang,Jiaxuan You*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper presents Sotopia-RL, a framework that improves reinforcement learning (RL) for socially intelligent agents in complex social tasks by using multi-dimensional, utterance-level rewards.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome challenges in training socially intelligent language models for real-world tasks, especially partial observability and multi-dimensionality in social interactions.

Method: The proposed Sotopia-RL refines episode-level feedback into multi-dimensional, utterance-level rewards. This aids credit assignment and captures the complexity of social behaviors.

Result: The approach achieves state-of-the-art social goal completion scores in the Sotopia environment, outperforming existing methods. Ablation studies verify the effectiveness of the framework.

Conclusion: Sotopia-RL's novel reward design significantly advances RL in social intelligence tasks, providing better training stability and richer strategy development for language models.

Abstract: Social intelligence has become a critical capability for large language
models (LLMs), enabling them to engage effectively in real-world social tasks
such as accommodation, persuasion, collaboration, and negotiation.
Reinforcement learning (RL) is a natural fit for training socially intelligent
agents because it allows models to learn sophisticated strategies directly
through social interactions. However, social interactions have two key
characteristics that set barriers for RL training: (1) partial observability,
where utterances have indirect and delayed effects that complicate credit
assignment, and (2) multi-dimensionality, where behaviors such as
rapport-building or knowledge-seeking contribute indirectly to goal
achievement. These characteristics make Markov decision process (MDP)-based RL
with single-dimensional episode-level rewards inefficient and unstable. To
address these challenges, we propose Sotopia-RL, a novel framework that refines
coarse episode-level feedback into utterance-level, multi-dimensional rewards.
Utterance-level credit assignment mitigates partial observability by
attributing outcomes to individual utterances, while multi-dimensional rewards
capture the full richness of social interactions and reduce reward hacking.
Experiments in Sotopia, an open-ended social learning environment, demonstrate
that Sotopia-RL achieves state-of-the-art social goal completion scores (7.17
on Sotopia-hard and 8.31 on Sotopia-full), significantly outperforming existing
approaches. Ablation studies confirm the necessity of both utterance-level
credit assignment and multi-dimensional reward design for RL training. Our
implementation is publicly available at:

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces CoAct-1, a multi-agent system combining GUI-based and coding-based task execution for computer automation, achieving state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GUIs alone are limiting in efficiency and reliability for autonomous agents performing complex, long-horizon tasks, necessitating a more flexible approach.

Method: CoAct-1 uses an Orchestrator to delegate tasks between a GUI Operator agent and a Programmer agent that writes and executes code, enabling hybrid task execution.

Result: On the OSWorld benchmark, CoAct-1 achieved a success rate of 60.76% and reduced average task steps to 10.15, outperforming prior approaches.

Conclusion: Integrating coding as an action alongside GUI manipulation makes autonomous computer automation more robust, efficient, and scalable.

Abstract: Autonomous agents that operate computers via Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs)
often struggle with efficiency and reliability on complex, long-horizon tasks.
While augmenting these agents with planners can improve task decomposition,
they remain constrained by the inherent limitations of performing all actions
through GUI manipulation, leading to brittleness and inefficiency. In this
work, we introduce a more robust and flexible paradigm: enabling agents to use
coding as a enhanced action. We present CoAct-1, a novel multi-agent system
that synergistically combines GUI-based control with direct programmatic
execution. CoAct-1 features an Orchestrator that dynamically delegates subtasks
to either a conventional GUI Operator or a specialized Programmer agent, which
can write and execute Python or Bash scripts. This hybrid approach allows the
agent to bypass inefficient GUI action sequences for tasks like file management
and data processing, while still leveraging visual interaction when necessary.
We evaluate our system on the challenging OSWorld benchmark, where CoAct-1
achieves a new state-of-the-art success rate of 60.76%, significantly
outperforming prior methods. Furthermore, our approach dramatically improves
efficiency, reducing the average number of steps required to complete a task to
just 10.15, compared to 15 for leading GUI agents. Our results demonstrate that
integrating coding as a core action provides a more powerful, efficient, and
scalable path toward generalized computer automation.

*Raymond Wilson,Cole Graham,Chase Carter,Zefeng Yang,Ruiqi Gu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces CAP-LLM, a framework for personalized and factually consistent news headline generation using Large Language Models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current news headline generators fail to capture user preferences effectively and often produce misleading or generic headlines.

Method: CAP-LLM integrates user interest encoding, context adaptation, and a novel fact-consistency module using a pre-trained LLM backbone.

Result: CAP-LLM outperforms baselines like BART in factual consistency (FactCC of 87.50), personalization, and content coverage on the PENS dataset.

Conclusion: CAP-LLM offers a balanced solution for generating personalized and accurate news headlines, validated by extensive evaluations.

Abstract: In the era of information overload, personalized news headline generation is
crucial for engaging users by tailoring content to their preferences while
accurately conveying news facts. Existing methods struggle with effectively
capturing complex user interests and ensuring factual consistency, often
leading to generic or misleading headlines. Leveraging the unprecedented
capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) in text generation, we propose
Context-Augmented Personalized LLM (CAP-LLM), a novel framework that integrates
user preferences and factual consistency constraints into a powerful
pre-trained LLM backbone. CAP-LLM features a User Preference Encoder to capture
long-term user interests, a Context Injection Adapter to seamlessly integrate
these preferences and current article context into the LLM's generation
process, and a Fact-Consistency Reinforcement Module employing a novel
contrastive loss to mitigate hallucination. Evaluated on the real-world PENS
dataset, CAP-LLM achieves state-of-the-art performance across all metrics.
Notably, it significantly improves factual consistency (FactCC of 87.50) over
strong baselines like BART (86.67), while simultaneously enhancing
personalization (Pc(avg) 2.73, Pc(max) 17.25) and content coverage (ROUGE-1
26.55, ROUGE-2 9.95, ROUGE-L 23.01). Our ablation studies, human evaluations,
and sensitivity analyses further validate the effectiveness of each component
and the robustness of our approach, demonstrating CAP-LLM's ability to achieve
a superior balance between personalization and factual accuracy in news
headline generation.

TL;DR: The paper addresses bias management in the lifecycle of machine learning models, especially Large Language Models, through a framework for governance, fairness, and ethics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address bias, ethics, fairness, and factuality gaps within LLMs and ensure their responsible development and deployment.

Method: The paper builds upon BEATS and provides a governance framework for assessing, benchmarking, and continuously monitoring LLM biases.

Result: The governance framework enables rigorous benchmarking, facilitates real-time evaluation, and ensures safer, socially responsible AI systems.

Conclusion: Effective governance can mitigate discrimination risks and reputational harm, contributing to ethical and socially aligned GenAI applications.

Abstract: In this paper, we cover approaches to systematically govern, assess and
quantify bias across the complete life cycle of machine learning models, from
initial development and validation to ongoing production monitoring and
guardrail implementation. Building upon our foundational work on the Bias
Evaluation and Assessment Test Suite (BEATS) for Large Language Models, the
authors share prevalent bias and fairness related gaps in Large Language Models
(LLMs) and discuss data and AI governance framework to address Bias, Ethics,
Fairness, and Factuality within LLMs. The data and AI governance approach
discussed in this paper is suitable for practical, real-world applications,
enabling rigorous benchmarking of LLMs prior to production deployment,
facilitating continuous real-time evaluation, and proactively governing LLM
generated responses. By implementing the data and AI governance across the life
cycle of AI development, organizations can significantly enhance the safety and
responsibility of their GenAI systems, effectively mitigating risks of
discrimination and protecting against potential reputational or brand-related
harm. Ultimately, through this article, we aim to contribute to advancement of
the creation and deployment of socially responsible and ethically aligned
generative artificial intelligence powered applications.

### [52] [Confidence-Weighted Token Set Cover for Early Hypothesis Pruning in Self-Consistency](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03979)
*Md Arafat Sultan,Ramón Fernandez Astudillo*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes an efficient pruning method for self-consistency in long chain-of-thought reasoning tasks to reduce token expenditure.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Self-consistency is effective but has high token expenditure. The paper aims to make it more efficient for practical utility without compromising its advantages.

Method: The method involves early pruning of intermediate hypotheses using two lightweight indicators: model confidence and lexical coverage, combined with a fast weighted set cover algorithm.

Result: Across five LLMs and three math benchmarks, the pruning method improves token efficiency by 10-35%, demonstrating better performance.

Conclusion: Early hypothesis pruning in self-consistency retains efficacy while improving token efficiency, making it more practical for long-chain reasoning tasks.

Abstract: Despite its simplicity and efficacy, the high token expenditure of
self-consistency can limit its practical utility. Here we investigate if
self-consistency can be made more token-efficient for long chain-of-thought
reasoning tasks, while preserving its parallelism, through early hypothesis
pruning. Concretely, we generate all solutions in parallel, but periodically
prune intermediate hypotheses that are deemed unnecessary based on two
lightweight indicators: (a) the model's own confidence in individual
hypotheses, and (b) lexical coverage of all current hypotheses by candidate
subsets that are under consideration for continued retention. We design a fast
weighted set cover algorithm that utilizes the two indicators; our evaluation
of five LLMs on three math benchmarks shows that this method can improve token
efficiency for all models, by 10-35% in many cases.

*Bohan Jiang,Dawei Li,Zhen Tan,Chengshuai Zhao,Huan Liu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study explores how Large Language Models (LLMs) generate accurate and audience-specific explanations on well-being, revealing that fine-tuning methods enhance explanation quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding well-being relies on accurate information tailored for diverse expertise levels. With increasing reliance on LLMs, the paper seeks to assess and improve their ability to generate high-quality explanations.

Method: The researchers created a dataset of 43,880 well-being explanations from 10 diverse LLMs. They developed an LLM-as-a-judge evaluation framework with dual judges and applied fine-tuning techniques like Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to improve explanation quality.

Result: Findings showed that LLM judges align closely with human evaluations, explanation quality varies across models and audiences, and fine-tuned LLMs using SFT and DPO outperform larger models in specialized tasks.

Conclusion: Preference-based learning methods like DPO and SFT enhance the ability of LLMs to generate accurate and audience-specific explanations, proving their value for specialized tasks.

Abstract: Well-being encompasses mental, physical, and social dimensions essential to
personal growth and informed life decisions. As individuals increasingly
consult Large Language Models (LLMs) to understand well-being, a key challenge
emerges: Can LLMs generate explanations that are not only accurate but also
tailored to diverse audiences? High-quality explanations require both factual
correctness and the ability to meet the expectations of users with varying
expertise. In this work, we construct a large-scale dataset comprising 43,880
explanations of 2,194 well-being concepts, generated by ten diverse LLMs. We
introduce a principle-guided LLM-as-a-judge evaluation framework, employing
dual judges to assess explanation quality. Furthermore, we show that
fine-tuning an open-source LLM using Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Direct
Preference Optimization (DPO) can significantly enhance the quality of
generated explanations. Our results reveal: (1) The proposed LLM judges align
well with human evaluations; (2) explanation quality varies significantly
across models, audiences, and categories; and (3) DPO- and SFT-finetuned models
outperform their larger counterparts, demonstrating the effectiveness of
preference-based learning for specialized explanation tasks.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper presents a social robot co-facilitator that uses a concept bottleneck model (CBM) to interpret social cues, recommend interventions transparently, and assist facilitators during group meetings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Facilitators face challenges with cognitive load, disengagement, individual goal-setting difficulties, and interpersonal issues during group meetings, creating the need for technology that aids in interpreting social dynamics and providing actionable guidance.

Method: The study combines transfer learning with a concept bottleneck model (CBM) to distill insights from foundation models into a specialized framework that analyzes participant engagement and sentiments transparently, allowing real-time corrections.

Result: The CBM-based social robot significantly outperformed zero-shot foundation models in predicting intervention needs, generalized across groups, and successfully transferred senior facilitators’ expertise to novice facilitators.

Conclusion: The implementation of an interpretable and transparent robotic co-facilitator effectively augments human capabilities in managing complex social interactions, offers a scalable solution for improving group meeting dynamics, and bridges expertise gaps.

Abstract: Successful group meetings, such as those implemented in group
behavioral-change programs, work meetings, and other social contexts, must
promote individual goal setting and execution while strengthening the social
relationships within the group. Consequently, an ideal facilitator must be
sensitive to the subtle dynamics of disengagement, difficulties with individual
goal setting and execution, and interpersonal difficulties that signal a need
for intervention. The challenges and cognitive load experienced by facilitators
create a critical gap for an embodied technology that can interpret social
exchanges while remaining aware of the needs of the individuals in the group
and providing transparent recommendations that go beyond powerful but "black
box" foundation models (FMs) that identify social cues. We address this
important demand with a social robot co-facilitator that analyzes multimodal
meeting data and provides discreet cues to the facilitator. The robot's
reasoning is powered by an agentic concept bottleneck model (CBM), which makes
decisions based on human-interpretable concepts like participant engagement and
sentiments, ensuring transparency and trustworthiness. Our core contribution is
a transfer learning framework that distills the broad social understanding of
an FM into our specialized and transparent CBM. This concept-driven system
significantly outperforms direct zero-shot FMs in predicting the need for
intervention and enables real-time human correction of its reasoning.
Critically, we demonstrate robust knowledge transfer: the model generalizes
across different groups and successfully transfers the expertise of senior
human facilitators to improve the performance of novices. By transferring an
expert's cognitive model into an interpretable robotic partner, our work
provides a powerful blueprint for augmenting human capabilities in complex
social domains.

*Yurun Chen,Xavier Hu,Yuhan Liu,Keting Yin,Juncheng Li,Zhuosheng Zhang,Shengyu Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: HarmonyGuard is a multi-agent framework that balances safety and utility in web environments, utilizing adaptive policy enhancement and dual-objective optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current web agents struggle to balance task performance with safety amidst evolving threats in long-duration operations, and existing studies focus only on single-objective or single-turn solutions.

Method: HarmonyGuard employs a multi-agent system with a Policy Agent for structured security policy extraction and updates, and a Utility Agent for real-time reasoning and optimization of safety and utility.

Result: Tests across benchmarks show HarmonyGuard achieves up to 38% better policy compliance and 20% higher task completion compared to other methods, maintaining over 90% compliance consistently.

Conclusion: HarmonyGuard successfully enhances both safety and utility in web environments, demonstrating an effective dual-objective optimization approach for autonomous agents.

Abstract: Large language models enable agents to autonomously perform tasks in open web
environments. However, as hidden threats within the web evolve, web agents face
the challenge of balancing task performance with emerging risks during
long-sequence operations. Although this challenge is critical, current research
remains limited to single-objective optimization or single-turn scenarios,
lacking the capability for collaborative optimization of both safety and
utility in web environments. To address this gap, we propose HarmonyGuard, a
multi-agent collaborative framework that leverages policy enhancement and
objective optimization to jointly improve both utility and safety. HarmonyGuard
features a multi-agent architecture characterized by two fundamental
capabilities: (1) Adaptive Policy Enhancement: We introduce the Policy Agent
within HarmonyGuard, which automatically extracts and maintains structured
security policies from unstructured external documents, while continuously
updating policies in response to evolving threats. (2) Dual-Objective
Optimization: Based on the dual objectives of safety and utility, the Utility
Agent integrated within HarmonyGuard performs the Markovian real-time reasoning
to evaluate the objectives and utilizes metacognitive capabilities for their
optimization. Extensive evaluations on multiple benchmarks show that
HarmonyGuard improves policy compliance by up to 38% and task completion by up
to 20% over existing baselines, while achieving over 90% policy compliance
across all tasks. Our project is available here:

TL;DR: SMEdit, a new model editing method, improves both performance under low-data scenarios and training efficiency for Large Language Models (LLMs).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Model editing is a cost-efficient way to update the static knowledge in Large Language Models without retraining the entire model. Current meta-learning-based model editing methods face challenges with low-data performance and training efficiency.

Method: SMEdit employs multiple backpropagation steps (MBPS) to enhance performance with limited data and introduces norm regularization on weight updates to boost training efficiency.

Result: Experimental results on two datasets and two LLMs show that SMEdit surpasses previous meta-learning-based model editing methods, and MBPS enhances performance even when integrated into existing approaches.

Conclusion: SMEdit presents an advancement over prior methods by addressing limitations in low-data performance and training efficiency, offering a modular strategy for improving model editing.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) underpin many AI applications, but their static
nature makes updating knowledge costly. Model editing offers an efficient
alternative by injecting new information through targeted parameter
modifications. In particular, meta-learning-based model editing (MLBME) methods
have demonstrated notable advantages in both editing effectiveness and
efficiency. Despite this, we find that MLBME exhibits suboptimal performance in
low-data scenarios, and its training efficiency is bottlenecked by the
computation of KL divergence. To address these, we propose $\textbf{S}$tep
$\textbf{M}$ore $\textbf{Edit}$ ($\textbf{SMEdit}$), a novel MLBME method that
adopts $\textbf{M}$ultiple $\textbf{B}$ackpro$\textbf{P}$agation
$\textbf{S}$teps ($\textbf{MBPS}$) to improve editing performance under limited
supervision and a norm regularization on weight updates to improve training
efficiency. Experimental results on two datasets and two LLMs demonstrate that
SMEdit outperforms prior MLBME baselines and the MBPS strategy can be
seamlessly integrated into existing methods to further boost their performance.
Our code will be released soon.

### [57] [ZARA: Zero-shot Motion Time-Series Analysis via Knowledge and Retrieval Driven LLM Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04038)
*Zechen Li,Baiyu Chen,Hao Xue,Flora D. Salim*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces ZARA, a zero-shot, explainable framework for human activity recognition (HAR) using raw motion sensor time-series.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for HAR require costly retraining when adapting to new activities or sensor setups, and lack interpretable accuracy when using large language models.

Method: ZARA combines a feature knowledge base, multi-sensor retrieval, and a hierarchical agent pipeline to enable zero-shot HAR and natural-language explanations.

Result: Experiments show ZARA achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot performance, greatly improving accuracy and offering clear reasoning with natural-language explanations.

Conclusion: ZARA demonstrates the potential for trustworthy, flexible, and interpretable HAR without the need for fine-tuning or specific classifiers, advancing motion time-series analysis.

Abstract: Motion sensor time-series are central to human activity recognition (HAR),
with applications in health, sports, and smart devices. However, existing
methods are trained for fixed activity sets and require costly retraining when
new behaviours or sensor setups appear. Recent attempts to use large language
models (LLMs) for HAR, typically by converting signals into text or images,
suffer from limited accuracy and lack verifiable interpretability. We propose
ZARA, the first agent-based framework for zero-shot, explainable HAR directly
from raw motion time-series. ZARA integrates an automatically derived pair-wise
feature knowledge base that captures discriminative statistics for every
activity pair, a multi-sensor retrieval module that surfaces relevant evidence,
and a hierarchical agent pipeline that guides the LLM to iteratively select
features, draw on this evidence, and produce both activity predictions and
natural-language explanations. ZARA enables flexible and interpretable HAR
without any fine-tuning or task-specific classifiers. Extensive experiments on
8 HAR benchmarks show that ZARA achieves SOTA zero-shot performance, delivering
clear reasoning while exceeding the strongest baselines by 2.53x in macro F1.
Ablation studies further confirm the necessity of each module, marking ZARA as
a promising step toward trustworthy, plug-and-play motion time-series analysis.

### [58] [Large Reasoning Models Are Autonomous Jailbreak Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04039)
*Thilo Hagendorff,Erik Derner,Nuria Oliver*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This study demonstrates that large reasoning models (LRMs) can simplify the process of jailbreaking AI safety mechanisms, achieving a high success rate of 97.14% in bypassing guardrails.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether LRMs can act autonomously to simplify and scale the process of AI jailbreaking, making it accessible to non-experts.

Method: Evaluating four LRMs in multi-turn conversations set up to perform autonomous jailbreaks on nine popular target models using a benchmark of harmful prompts across sensitive domains.

Result: The LRMs succeeded in bypassing AI safety mechanisms with a high success rate (97.14% across all model combinations), showcasing their ability to erode safety features autonomously.

Conclusion: Frontier AI models urgently require improved alignment measures to resist jailbreak attempts and prevent their misuse as autonomous jailbreak agents.

Abstract: Jailbreaking -- bypassing built-in safety mechanisms in AI models -- has
traditionally required complex technical procedures or specialized human
expertise. In this study, we show that the persuasive capabilities of large
reasoning models (LRMs) simplify and scale jailbreaking, converting it into an
inexpensive activity accessible to non-experts. We evaluated the capabilities
of four LRMs (DeepSeek-R1, Gemini 2.5 Flash, Grok 3 Mini, Qwen3 235B) to act as
autonomous adversaries conducting multi-turn conversations with nine widely
used target models. LRMs received instructions via a system prompt, before
proceeding to planning and executing jailbreaks with no further supervision. We
performed extensive experiments with a benchmark of harmful prompts composed of
70 items covering seven sensitive domains. This setup yielded an overall attack
success rate across all model combinations of 97.14%. Our study reveals an
alignment regression, in which LRMs can systematically erode the safety
guardrails of other models, highlighting the urgent need to further align
frontier models not only to resist jailbreak attempts, but also to prevent them
from being co-opted into acting as jailbreak agents.

### [59] [DTPA: Dynamic Token-level Prefix Augmentation for Controllable Text Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04047)
*Jiabing Yang,Yixiang Chen,Zichen Wen,Chenhang Cui,Peiyan Li,Yuan Xu,Bowen Fang,Yan Huang,Liang Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper addresses the challenge of controllable long-form text generation and proposes a novel framework called Dynamic Token-level Prefix Augmentation (DTPA) to enhance performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve controllable text generation, which traditionally focuses on short sequences, by addressing the challenges and declining controllability in long-form sequences.

Method: The authors introduce DTPA, a framework that selects the optimal prefix type and dynamically amplifies attention to prefixes with an exponentially increasing scaling factor as sequence length grows. An optional similar augmentation is applied to the original prompt if needed.

Result: DTPA achieves better results in controlling attributes compared to other methods while maintaining text fluency, diversity, and relevance. It excels especially in generating long-form texts.

Conclusion: DTPA is an effective and lightweight solution for controllable long-text generation, addressing limitations in prefix-based methods and improving quality and performance in various tasks.

Abstract: Controllable Text Generation (CTG) is a vital subfield in Natural Language
Processing (NLP), aiming to generate text that aligns with desired attributes.
However, previous studies commonly focus on the quality of controllable text
generation for short sequences, while the generation of long-form text remains
largely underexplored. In this paper, we observe that the controllability of
texts generated by the powerful prefix-based method Air-Decoding tends to
decline with increasing sequence length, which we hypothesize primarily arises
from the observed decay in attention to the prefixes. Meanwhile, different
types of prefixes including soft and hard prefixes are also key factors
influencing performance. Building on these insights, we propose a lightweight
and effective framework called Dynamic Token-level Prefix Augmentation (DTPA)
based on Air-Decoding for controllable text generation. Specifically, it first
selects the optimal prefix type for a given task. Then we dynamically amplify
the attention to the prefix for the attribute distribution to enhance
controllability, with a scaling factor growing exponentially as the sequence
length increases. Moreover, based on the task, we optionally apply a similar
augmentation to the original prompt for the raw distribution to balance text
quality. After attribute distribution reconstruction, the generated text
satisfies the attribute constraints well. Experiments on multiple CTG tasks
demonstrate that DTPA generally outperforms other methods in attribute control
while maintaining competitive fluency, diversity, and topic relevance. Further
analysis highlights DTPA's superior effectiveness in long text generation.

### [60] [PAIRS: Parametric-Verified Adaptive Information Retrieval and Selection for Efficient RAG](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04057)
*Wang Chen,Guanqiang Qi,Weikang Li,Yang Li,Deguo Xia,Jizhou Huang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces PAIRS, a framework enhancing RAG systems by selectively retrieving external information only when needed, improving both efficiency and accuracy in question answering.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current RAG systems are inefficient in handling certain queries, retrieving information unnecessarily, or fetching irrelevant documents due to sparse query signals.

Method: PAIRS uses dual-path generation to decide whether retrieval is necessary, and a dual-path retrieval process paired with adaptive document selection for robust performance.

Result: Experiments across six QA benchmarks show PAIRS reduces retrieval costs by 25% while achieving accuracy improvements of +1.1% EM and +1.0% F1 compared to baselines.

Conclusion: The PAIRS framework offers a simple, training-free solution to optimize information retrieval from LLMs, making RAG systems more efficient and accurate.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has become a cornerstone technique for
enhancing large language models (LLMs) with external knowledge. However,
current RAG systems face two critical limitations: (1) they inefficiently
retrieve information for every query, including simple questions that could be
resolved using the LLM's parametric knowledge alone, and (2) they risk
retrieving irrelevant documents when queries contain sparse information
signals. To address these gaps, we introduce Parametric-verified Adaptive
Information Retrieval and Selection (PAIRS), a training-free framework that
integrates parametric and retrieved knowledge to adaptively determine whether
to retrieve and how to select external information. Specifically, PAIRS employs
a dual-path generation mechanism: First, the LLM produces both a direct answer
and a context-augmented answer using self-generated pseudo-context. When these
outputs converge, PAIRS bypasses external retrieval entirely, dramatically
improving the RAG system's efficiency. For divergent cases, PAIRS activates a
dual-path retrieval (DPR) process guided by both the original query and
self-generated contextual signals, followed by an Adaptive Information
Selection (AIS) module that filters documents through weighted similarity to
both sources. This simple yet effective approach can not only enhance
efficiency by eliminating unnecessary retrievals but also improve accuracy
through contextually guided retrieval and adaptive information selection.
Experimental results on six question-answering (QA) benchmarks show that PAIRS
reduces retrieval costs by around 25% (triggering for only 75% of queries)
while still improving accuracy-achieving +1.1% EM and +1.0% F1 over prior
baselines on average.

### [61] [Efficient Strategy for Improving Large Language Model (LLM) Capabilities](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04073)
*Julián Camilo Velandia Gutiérrez*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper addresses strategies to optimize Large Language Models (LLMs) for environments with limited computational resources by focusing on data processing, training techniques, and architecture adjustments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large-scale deployment of LLMs faces significant limitations due to high computational demands, highlighting the necessity for efficient optimization methods tailored for resource-constrained setups.

Method: The study employs a systematic approach involving reliable dataset creation criteria, controlled experiments on multiple configurations, and rigorous evaluation of model variants in terms of capability, versatility, response time, and safety.

Result: Comparative tests showcased improved performance of optimized LLM variants, validating the proposed strategies' effectiveness in constrained environments.

Conclusion: The paper successfully demonstrates that efficient optimization strategies can enhance LLM capabilities while ensuring reliability and safety, making them more viable for resource-limited scenarios.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have become a milestone in the field of
artificial intelligence and natural language processing. However, their
large-scale deployment remains constrained by the need for significant
computational resources. This work proposes starting from a base model to
explore and combine data processing and careful data selection techniques,
training strategies, and architectural adjustments to improve the efficiency of
LLMs in resource-constrained environments and within a delimited knowledge
base. The methodological approach included defining criteria for building
reliable datasets, conducting controlled experiments with different
configurations, and systematically evaluating the resulting variants in terms
of capability, versatility, response time, and safety. Finally, comparative
tests were conducted to measure the performance of the developed variants and
to validate the effectiveness of the proposed strategies. This work is based on
the master's thesis in Systems and Computer Engineering titled "Efficient
Strategy for Improving the Capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs)".

*Zhongyi Zhou,Kohei Uehara,Haoyu Zhang,Jingtao Zhou,Lin Gu,Ruofei Du,Zheng Xu,Tatsuya Harada*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces ToolGrad, an answer-first framework for tool-use dataset creation, solving inefficiencies in prior methods and resulting in superior model performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior methods for generating tool-use LLM datasets face issues like annotation failures and inefficiencies during data generation.

Method: The ToolGrad framework first iteratively develops valid tool-use chains guided by textual 'gradients' and then creates corresponding user queries.

Result: ToolGrad creates the ToolGrad-5k dataset, achieving complex tool use at lower cost with a 100% pass rate, leading to models that outperform others even on OOD benchmarks.

Conclusion: Using an inverted approach to data generation, ToolGrad demonstrates its efficacy in creating high-quality datasets and improving model performance.

Abstract: Prior work synthesizes tool-use LLM datasets by first generating a user
query, followed by complex tool-use annotations like DFS. This leads to
inevitable annotation failures and low efficiency in data generation. We
introduce ToolGrad, an agentic framework that inverts this paradigm. ToolGrad
first constructs valid tool-use chains through an iterative process guided by
textual "gradients", and then synthesizes corresponding user queries. This
"answer-first" approach led to ToolGrad-5k, a dataset generated with more
complex tool use, lower cost, and 100% pass rate. Experiments show that models
trained on ToolGrad-5k outperform those on expensive baseline datasets and
proprietary LLMs, even on OOD benchmarks.

### [63] [GM-PRM: A Generative Multimodal Process Reward Model for Multimodal Mathematical Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04088)
*Jianghangfan Zhang,Yibo Yan,Kening Zheng,Xin Zou,Song Dai,Xuming Hu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces GM-PRM, a generative multimodal process reward model, improving reasoning in multimodal large language models by offering rectifiable evaluation of reasoning steps and guiding better solutions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multimodal reward models are limited to binary verification and fail to correct or deeply analyze complex reasoning errors, leaving room for improvement in logic and visual alignment across steps.

Method: The authors propose GM-PRM that evaluates and interprets individual reasoning steps while actively generating corrections for errors it detects. This supports a novel test strategy called Refined-BoN for optimizing reasoning paths.

Result: The GM-PRM achieves state-of-the-art performance on multimodal math benchmarks, significantly enhancing reasoning policies while requiring minimal training data.

Conclusion: The generative correction capabilities of GM-PRM transform reward modeling into an active reasoning framework, marking a significant milestone in multimodal reasoning efficiency and performance.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) demonstrate remarkable capabilities
but often struggle with complex, multi-step mathematical reasoning, where minor
errors in visual perception or logical deduction can lead to complete failure.
While Process Reward Models (PRMs) offer step-by-step supervision, existing
multimodal PRMs are limited to being binary verifiers that can identify but not
correct errors, offering little explanatory power. To address these
deficiencies, we introduce the Generative Multimodal Process Reward Model
(GM-PRM), a novel paradigm that transforms the PRM from a passive judge into an
active reasoning collaborator. Instead of a simple scalar score, GM-PRM
provides a fine-grained, interpretable analysis of each reasoning step,
evaluating its step intent, visual alignment, and logical soundness. More
critically, GM-PRM is trained to generate a corrected version of the first
erroneous step it identifies. This unique corrective capability enables our new
test-time inference strategy, Refined Best-of-N (Refined-BoN). This framework
actively enhances solution quality by using the PRM's generated correction to
guide the policy model toward a more promising reasoning trajectory, thereby
improving the diversity and correctness of the solution pool. We demonstrate
that GM-PRM achieves state-of-the-art results on multiple multimodal math
benchmarks, significantly boosting policy model performance with remarkable
data efficiency, requiring only a 20K-sample training dataset. Our code will be
released upon acceptance.

*Zhiwen Ruan,Yun Chen,Yutao Hou,Peng Li,Yang Liu,Guanhua Chen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper reveals an over-memorization issue during LLM finetuning, leading to high test perplexity despite good test accuracy, impacting robustness and generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the learning dynamics during LLM finetuning, particularly regarding reasoning tasks, and to uncover problems like over-memorization.

Method: The authors conducted experiments across different tasks, models, and finetuning methods, analyzing the effects of training epochs and learning rates on over-memorization.

Result: Over-memorization was demonstrated to negatively impact robustness, out-of-distribution generalization, and generation diversity, despite maintaining test accuracy.

Conclusion: The study emphasizes the need for careful checkpoint and learning rate selection during LLM finetuning, as over-memorization hinders broader applicability and model reliability.

Abstract: The pretrained large language models (LLMs) are finetuned with labeled data
for better instruction following ability and alignment with human values. In
this paper, we study the learning dynamics of LLM finetuning on reasoning tasks
and reveal the uncovered over-memorization phenomenon during a specific stage
of LLM finetuning. At this stage, the LLMs have excessively memorized training
data and exhibit high test perplexity while maintaining good test accuracy. We
investigate the conditions that lead to LLM over-memorization and find that
training epochs and large learning rates contribute to this issue. Although
models with over-memorization demonstrate comparable test accuracy to normal
models, they suffer from reduced robustness, poor out-of-distribution
generalization, and decreased generation diversity. Our experiments unveil the
over-memorization to be broadly applicable across different tasks, models, and
finetuning methods. Our research highlights that overparameterized, extensively
finetuned LLMs exhibit unique learning dynamics distinct from traditional
machine learning models. Based on our observations of over-memorization, we
provide recommendations on checkpoint and learning rate selection during
finetuning.

*Xuan Qi,Rongwu Xu,Zhijing Jin*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper presents a new data selection strategy for improving large language model (LLM) alignment, specifically targeting preference datasets by focusing on high-difficulty examples.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for aligning LLMs with human preferences rely on large datasets, which are costly and lack efficient data selection techniques.

Method: The method introduces a difficulty-based data selection strategy that selects preference data examples with smaller DPO implicit reward gaps, denoting challenging cases.

Result: The approach outperformed five strong baselines across several datasets and alignment tasks, achieving better performance using just 10% of the original data.

Conclusion: The proposed method enhances data efficiency and model alignment, offering a scalable solution for LLM alignment with limited resources.

Abstract: Aligning large language models (LLMs) with human preferences is a critical
challenge in AI research. While methods like Reinforcement Learning from Human
Feedback (RLHF) and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) are widely used, they
often rely on large, costly preference datasets. The current work lacks methods
for high-quality data selection specifically for preference data. In this work,
we introduce a novel difficulty-based data selection strategy for preference
datasets, grounded in the DPO implicit reward mechanism. By selecting
preference data examples with smaller DPO implicit reward gaps, which are
indicative of more challenging cases, we improve data efficiency and model
alignment. Our approach consistently outperforms five strong baselines across
multiple datasets and alignment tasks, achieving superior performance with only
10\% of the original data. This principled, efficient selection method offers a
promising solution for scaling LLM alignment with limited resources.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper evaluates TTS models' ability to deceive humans and introduces the Human Fooling Rate (HFR) as a new metric.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To determine whether TTS systems can pass a human deception test and if subjective evaluations properly represent their progress.

Method: Introduced the Human Fooling Rate (HFR) to directly measure how often TTS speech is mistaken for human and performed large-scale evaluations of various TTS models.

Result: Discovered that claims of human parity fail under deception tests, dataset quality plays a critical role in benchmarking, commercial models outperform open-source ones, and fine-tuning on high-quality data increases realism but does not achieve parity.

Conclusion: Current TTS systems have gaps in achieving true human deception, highlighting the need for realistic and human-centric evaluations in addition to subjective tests.

Abstract: While subjective evaluations in recent years indicate rapid progress in TTS,
can current TTS systems truly pass a human deception test in a Turing-like
evaluation? We introduce Human Fooling Rate (HFR), a metric that directly
measures how often machine-generated speech is mistaken for human. Our
large-scale evaluation of open-source and commercial TTS models reveals
critical insights: (i) CMOS-based claims of human parity often fail under
deception testing, (ii) TTS progress should be benchmarked on datasets where
human speech achieves high HFRs, as evaluating against monotonous or less
expressive reference samples sets a low bar, (iii) Commercial models approach
human deception in zero-shot settings, while open-source systems still struggle
with natural conversational speech; (iv) Fine-tuning on high-quality data
improves realism but does not fully bridge the gap. Our findings underscore the
need for more realistic, human-centric evaluations alongside existing
subjective tests.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes a novel reinforcement learning framework to reduce hallucinations in multimodal language models using token-level causal completeness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) face challenges with hallucinations, where generated outputs are semantically inconsistent with input data.

Method: The authors introduce a reinforcement learning method based on causal completeness, utilizing token-level rewards for their sufficiency and necessity in generating accurate outputs.

Result: The framework significantly mitigates hallucinations as evidenced by experimental results across diverse benchmark datasets.

Conclusion: By emphasizing causal token-level contributions, the approach improves the reliability of MLLMs in vision-language tasks, showcasing its effectiveness in tackling hallucinations.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated impressive
capabilities across vision-language tasks. However, they may suffer from
hallucinations--generating outputs that are semantically inconsistent with the
input image or text. Through causal analyses, we find that: (i) hallucinations
with omission may arise from the failure to adequately capture essential causal
factors, and (ii) hallucinations with fabrication are likely caused by the
model being misled by non-causal cues. To address these challenges, we propose
a novel reinforcement learning framework guided by causal completeness, which
jointly considers both causal sufficiency and causal necessity of tokens.
Specifically, we evaluate each token's standalone contribution and
counterfactual indispensability to define a token-level causal completeness
reward. This reward is used to construct a causally informed advantage function
within the GRPO optimization framework, encouraging the model to focus on
tokens that are both causally sufficient and necessary for accurate generation.
Experimental results across various benchmark datasets and tasks demonstrate
the effectiveness of our approach, which effectively mitigates hallucinations
in MLLMs.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper defines the scope and challenges of the deep research (DR) task, introduces an evaluation benchmark called LiveDRBench, and shows state-of-the-art DR systems performing sub-optimally, with OpenAI's model achieving the best F1 score of 0.55.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of clear definition for the deep research (DR) task and to enable objective evaluation of systems designed for reasoning-intensive and high fan-out search processes, a formal framework and benchmark are needed.

Method: The authors designed an intermediate representation to objectively evaluate DR tasks, and developed LiveDRBench, a benchmark comprising 100 tasks across diverse topics. They evaluated state-of-the-art DR systems using this benchmark.

Result: The F1 scores of current DR systems ranged from 0.02 to 0.72 across tasks, with OpenAI's model achieving the highest overall F1 score of 0.55. The analysis showcased shortcomings in reasoning traces, including issues with source referencing, branching, and backtracking.

Conclusion: The current state-of-the-art DR systems are far from optimal in addressing the core challenges of deep research. The LiveDRBench benchmark highlights areas for improvement, particularly in search mechanisms and grounding capabilities.

Abstract: Information tasks such as writing surveys or analytical reports require
complex search and reasoning, and have recently been grouped under the umbrella
of \textit{deep research} -- a term also adopted by recent models targeting
these capabilities. Despite growing interest, the scope of the deep research
task remains underdefined and its distinction from other reasoning-intensive
problems is poorly understood. In this paper, we propose a formal
characterization of the deep research (DR) task and introduce a benchmark to
evaluate the performance of DR systems. We argue that the core defining feature
of deep research is not the production of lengthy report-style outputs, but
rather the high fan-out over concepts required during the search process, i.e.,
broad and reasoning-intensive exploration. To enable objective evaluation, we
define DR using an intermediate output representation that encodes key claims
uncovered during search-separating the reasoning challenge from surface-level
report generation. Based on this formulation, we propose a diverse, challenging
benchmark LiveDRBench with 100 challenging tasks over scientific topics (e.g.,
datasets, materials discovery, prior art search) and public interest events
(e.g., flight incidents, movie awards). Across state-of-the-art DR systems, F1
score ranges between 0.02 and 0.72 for any sub-category. OpenAI's model
performs the best with an overall F1 score of 0.55. Analysis of reasoning
traces reveals the distribution over the number of referenced sources,
branching, and backtracking events executed by current DR systems, motivating
future directions for improving their search mechanisms and grounding
capabilities. The benchmark is available at

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper reveals vulnerabilities of advanced language models to subtle conversational manipulations without jailbreaking, using 10 crafted attack scenarios and an evaluation framework called MISALIGNMENTBENCH across various models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to assess and challenge the robustness of current alignment strategies in state-of-the-art language models by exposing them to nuanced conversational manipulations.

Method: The authors employed manual red-teaming techniques on Claude-4-Opus, developed scenarios to elicit misaligned behavior, and distilled these attacks into an automated evaluation framework named MISALIGNMENTBENCH, tested across five leading models.

Result: The evaluation revealed high vulnerability in models, with an overall rate of 76%. GPT-4.1 was most susceptible (90%), while Claude-4-Sonnet showed greater resistance (40%).

Conclusion: Sophisticated reasoning is often exploited for misalignment, necessitating improved strategies to address psychological and contextual manipulation in future AI alignment efforts.

Abstract: Despite significant advances in alignment techniques, we demonstrate that
state-of-the-art language models remain vulnerable to carefully crafted
conversational scenarios that can induce various forms of misalignment without
explicit jailbreaking. Through systematic manual red-teaming with
Claude-4-Opus, we discovered 10 successful attack scenarios, revealing
fundamental vulnerabilities in how current alignment methods handle narrative
immersion, emotional pressure, and strategic framing. These scenarios
successfully elicited a range of misaligned behaviors, including deception,
value drift, self-preservation, and manipulative reasoning, each exploiting
different psychological and contextual vulnerabilities. To validate
generalizability, we distilled our successful manual attacks into
MISALIGNMENTBENCH, an automated evaluation framework that enables reproducible
testing across multiple models. Cross-model evaluation of our 10 scenarios
against five frontier LLMs revealed an overall 76% vulnerability rate, with
significant variations: GPT-4.1 showed the highest susceptibility (90%), while
Claude-4-Sonnet demonstrated greater resistance (40%). Our findings demonstrate
that sophisticated reasoning capabilities often become attack vectors rather
than protective mechanisms, as models can be manipulated into complex
justifications for misaligned behavior. This work provides (i) a detailed
taxonomy of conversational manipulation patterns and (ii) a reusable evaluation
framework. Together, these findings expose critical gaps in current alignment
strategies and highlight the need for robustness against subtle, scenario-based
manipulation in future AI systems.

TL;DR: This paper discusses sentiment analysis in culturally nuanced, low-resource settings, examining how large language models (LLMs) interpret emotions in informal, code-mixed messages, finding gaps in reasoning quality among models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard NLP methods assume universal labels and emotions, which fail in culturally specific, low-resource contexts. The study seeks to bridge this gap by understanding how sentiment analysis can improve for such scenarios.

Method: The authors use human-annotated data, sentiment-flipped counterfactuals, and rubric-based evaluation to analyze LLMs' interpretability, robustness, and alignment with human reasoning in WhatsApp messages.

Result: Top-tier LLMs showed stronger reasoning stability compared to open-source models, which struggle with ambiguity and sentiment shifts.

Conclusion: This research emphasizes the need for culturally adapted AI evaluation methods for analyzing real-world communication effectively.

Abstract: Sentiment analysis in low-resource, culturally nuanced contexts challenges
conventional NLP approaches that assume fixed labels and universal affective
expressions. We present a diagnostic framework that treats sentiment as a
context-dependent, culturally embedded construct, and evaluate how large
language models (LLMs) reason about sentiment in informal, code-mixed WhatsApp
messages from Nairobi youth health groups. Using a combination of
human-annotated data, sentiment-flipped counterfactuals, and rubric-based
explanation evaluation, we probe LLM interpretability, robustness, and
alignment with human reasoning. Framing our evaluation through a social-science
measurement lens, we operationalize and interrogate LLMs outputs as an
instrument for measuring the abstract concept of sentiment. Our findings reveal
significant variation in model reasoning quality, with top-tier LLMs
demonstrating interpretive stability, while open models often falter under
ambiguity or sentiment shifts. This work highlights the need for culturally
sensitive, reasoning-aware AI evaluation in complex, real-world communication.

Motivation: To address vulnerabilities in LRMs generating harmful content during reasoning while avoiding costly fine-tuning-based solutions.

Result: It outperforms seven existing defense mechanisms and mitigates various jailbreak attacks, including newer methods targeting LRMs' reasoning processes.

Conclusion: ReasoningGuard offers an effective and minimally costly solution to improving safety in LRMs, achieving state-of-the-art defenses with reduced inference overhead.

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have demonstrated impressive performance in
reasoning-intensive tasks, but they remain vulnerable to harmful content
generation, particularly in the mid-to-late steps of their reasoning processes.
Existing defense mechanisms, however, rely on costly fine-tuning and additional
expert knowledge, which restricts their scalability. In this work, we propose
ReasoningGuard, an inference-time safeguard for LRMs, which injects timely
safety aha moments to steer harmless while helpful reasoning processes.
Leveraging the model's internal attention behavior, our approach accurately
identifies critical points in the reasoning path, and triggers spontaneous,
safety-oriented reflection. To safeguard both the subsequent reasoning steps
and the final answers, we further implement a scaling sampling strategy during
the decoding phase, selecting the optimal reasoning path. Inducing minimal
extra inference cost, ReasoningGuard effectively mitigates three types of
jailbreak attacks, including the latest ones targeting the reasoning process of
LRMs. Our approach outperforms seven existing safeguards, achieving
state-of-the-art safety defenses while effectively avoiding the common
exaggerated safety issues.

### [72] [Hierarchical Text Classification Using Black Box Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04219)
*Kosuke Yoshimura,Hisashi Kashima*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) for Hierarchical Text Classification (HTC) as an alternative to traditional methods, evaluating different prompt strategies to balance between accuracy and cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The research investigates if LLMs accessed through APIs can address challenges like data scarcity and model complexity in HTC, potentially reducing reliance on labeled data and computational resources.

Method: The study employs three prompting strategies for LLMs: Direct Leaf Label Prediction (DL), Direct Hierarchical Label Prediction (DH), and Top-down Multi-step Hierarchical Label Prediction (TMH), which are tested in zero-shot and few-shot settings across two datasets.

Result: Few-shot setups lead to higher classification accuracy compared to zero-shot setups. While traditional models perform well on shallow hierarchies, LLMs, especially using the DH strategy, excel on deeper hierarchies but incur higher API costs for deeper label hierarchies.

Conclusion: Black box LLMs show promise for HTC, offering competitive solutions especially for deep hierarchies. However, careful selection of prompting strategies is crucial to balance accuracy and cost.

Abstract: Hierarchical Text Classification (HTC) aims to assign texts to structured
label hierarchies; however, it faces challenges due to data scarcity and model
complexity. This study explores the feasibility of using black box Large
Language Models (LLMs) accessed via APIs for HTC, as an alternative to
traditional machine learning methods that require extensive labeled data and
computational resources. We evaluate three prompting strategies -- Direct Leaf
Label Prediction (DL), Direct Hierarchical Label Prediction (DH), and Top-down
Multi-step Hierarchical Label Prediction (TMH) -- in both zero-shot and
few-shot settings, comparing the accuracy and cost-effectiveness of these
strategies. Experiments on two datasets show that a few-shot setting
consistently improves classification accuracy compared to a zero-shot setting.
While a traditional machine learning model achieves high accuracy on a dataset
with a shallow hierarchy, LLMs, especially DH strategy, tend to outperform the
machine learning model on a dataset with a deeper hierarchy. API costs increase
significantly due to the higher input tokens required for deeper label
hierarchies on DH strategy. These results emphasize the trade-off between
accuracy improvement and the computational cost of prompt strategy. These
findings highlight the potential of black box LLMs for HTC while underscoring
the need to carefully select a prompt strategy to balance performance and cost.

### [73] [DP-GPT4MTS: Dual-Prompt Large Language Model for Textual-Numerical Time Series Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04239)
*Chanjuan Liu,Shengzhi Wang,Enqiang Zhu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces DP-GPT4MTS, a dual-prompt framework using large language models that integrates numerical and textual data to enhance time series forecasting accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing forecasting methods focus on numerical data but neglect textual information like news or events, which affects prediction accuracy. Current language models fail to effectively handle timestamped text semantics.

Method: DP-GPT4MTS uses a dual-prompt approach, combining explicit prompts for task instructions and textual prompts for time-stamped context. A tokenizer and refined embeddings via self-attention further enhance model performance.

Result: Experiments on diverse text-numerical datasets demonstrate that DP-GPT4MTS surpasses state-of-the-art algorithms in forecasting accuracy.

Conclusion: Incorporating textual context through a dual-prompt mechanism is key to improving time series forecasting accuracy.

Abstract: Time series forecasting is crucial in strategic planning and decision-making
across various industries. Traditional forecasting models mainly concentrate on
numerical time series data, often overlooking important textual information
such as events and news, which can significantly affect forecasting accuracy.
While large language models offer a promise for integrating multimodal data,
existing single-prompt frameworks struggle to effectively capture the semantics
of timestamped text, introducing redundant information that can hinder model
performance. To address this limitation, we introduce DP-GPT4MTS (Dual-Prompt
GPT2-base for Multimodal Time Series), a novel dual-prompt large language model
framework that combines two complementary prompts: an explicit prompt for clear
task instructions and a textual prompt for context-aware embeddings from
time-stamped data. The tokenizer generates the explicit prompt while the
embeddings from the textual prompt are refined through self-attention and
feed-forward networks. Comprehensive experiments conducted on diverse
textural-numerical time series datasets demonstrate that this approach
outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms in time series forecasting. This
highlights the significance of incorporating textual context via a dual-prompt
mechanism to achieve more accurate time series predictions.

*Xi Wang,Anxo Perez,Javier Parapar,Fabio Crestani*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: TalkDep uses advanced language models to simulate diverse, clinically valid patient profiles for improving depression diagnosis training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The lack of real training data and limited resources for diagnosing depression has created a need for effective simulated patient models.

Method: Proposed TalkDep, a pipeline using advanced language models conditioned on diagnostic criteria, severity scales, and context to simulate diverse patient responses, verified by clinical professionals.

Result: Validated simulated patients were developed, providing a scalable and adaptable resource for training and improving diagnostic systems.

Conclusion: TalkDep offers a significant advancement for robust and generalizable depression diagnosis by addressing limitations in current training data through innovative simulated patients.

Abstract: The increasing demand for mental health services has outpaced the
availability of real training data to develop clinical professionals, leading
to limited support for the diagnosis of depression. This shortage has motivated
the development of simulated or virtual patients to assist in training and
evaluation, but existing approaches often fail to generate clinically valid,
natural, and diverse symptom presentations. In this work, we embrace the recent
advanced language models as the backbone and propose a novel
clinician-in-the-loop patient simulation pipeline, TalkDep, with access to
diversified patient profiles to develop simulated patients. By conditioning the
model on psychiatric diagnostic criteria, symptom severity scales, and
contextual factors, our goal is to create authentic patient responses that can
better support diagnostic model training and evaluation. We verify the
reliability of these simulated patients with thorough assessments conducted by
clinical professionals. The availability of validated simulated patients offers
a scalable and adaptable resource for improving the robustness and
generalisability of automatic depression diagnosis systems.

### [75] [KVSink: Understanding and Enhancing the Preservation of Attention Sinks in KV Cache Quantization for LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04257)
*Zunhai Su,Kehong Yuan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces KVSink, a method to predict and preserve attention sinks in LLMs during KV cache quantization, improving overall performance and precision.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limited understanding of attention sink mechanisms and the inadequacies in existing KV cache quantization strategies in maintaining attention precision.

Method: The authors analyzed the mechanisms of attention sinks and integrated a predictive method, KVSink, which forecasts sink tokens with minimal computational overhead, enhancing the preservation strategy during KV cache quantization.

Result: KVSink outperforms the existing Preserve-First-N (PFN) strategy, showing better preservation of attention sinks and enhancing perplexity (PPL) when combined with KVQuant.

Conclusion: KVSink provides a significant advancement in KV cache quantization strategies by addressing attention sink issues effectively, thus improving model inference performance and reducing dependency on 16-bit activations.

Abstract: Key-Value (KV) cache quantization has become a widely adopted optimization
technique for efficient large language models (LLMs) inference by reducing KV
cache memory usage and mitigating memory-bound constraints. Recent studies have
emphasized the importance of preserving the original precision of KVs for the
first few tokens to ensure the protection of attention sinks. While this
approach has proven effective in mitigating performance degradation, its
underlying principles remain insufficiently understood. Moreover, it fails to
address the recent discovery that attention sinks can emerge beyond the initial
token positions. In this work, we elucidate the underlying mechanisms of
attention sinks during inference by examining their role in the cross-layer
evolution of extreme activation outliers. Additionally, we provide a
comprehensive analysis of the interplay between attention sinks and KV cache
quantization. Based on our enhanced understanding, we introduce
\textit{\textbf{KVSink}}, a plug-and-play method that effectively predicts sink
tokens with negligible overhead, enabling more thorough preservation. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that KVSink outperforms the existing Preserve-First-N
(PFN) strategy, offering more effective preservation of attention sinks during
KV cache quantization. Moreover, when applied to the well-established KVQuant
method, KVSink further improves perplexity (PPL) and reduces reliance on 16-bit
numerical outliers.

*Jiangyuan Wang,Kejun Xiao,Qi Sun,Huaipeng Zhao,Tao Luo,Jiandong Zhang,Xiaoyi Zeng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ShoppingBench is introduced as a benchmark that evaluates complex shopping-related user intents in e-commerce, challenging state-of-the-art agents like GPT-4.1.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: E-commerce benchmarks focus on simple shopping tasks, while real-world users engage in more complex behaviors such as voucher application, budget management, and multi-product selection.

Method: The authors propose ShoppingBench, comprising a large-scale simulated shopping environment with real-world products and a framework to simulate user instructions. Additionally, they use fine-tuning, reinforcement learning, and trajectory distillation to train an agent.

Result: State-of-the-art agents underperform, achieving success rates below 50% on ShoppingBench tasks. However, the proposed training techniques enable a smaller agent to approach competitive performance with GPT-4.1.

Conclusion: ShoppingBench highlights limitations in current e-commerce AI capabilities and offers a new standard for developing and evaluating agents in complex shopping tasks.

Abstract: Existing benchmarks in e-commerce primarily focus on basic user intents, such
as finding or purchasing products. However, real-world users often pursue more
complex goals, such as applying vouchers, managing budgets, and finding
multi-products seller. To bridge this gap, we propose ShoppingBench, a novel
end-to-end shopping benchmark designed to encompass increasingly challenging
levels of grounded intent. Specifically, we propose a scalable framework to
simulate user instructions based on various intents derived from sampled
real-world products. To facilitate consistent and reliable evaluations, we
provide a large-scale shopping sandbox that serves as an interactive simulated
environment, incorporating over 2.5 million real-world products. Experimental
results demonstrate that even state-of-the-art language agents (such as
GPT-4.1) achieve absolute success rates under 50% on our benchmark tasks,
highlighting the significant challenges posed by our ShoppingBench. In
addition, we propose a trajectory distillation strategy and leverage supervised
fine-tuning, along with reinforcement learning on synthetic trajectories, to
distill the capabilities of a large language agent into a smaller one. As a
result, our trained agent achieves competitive performance compared to GPT-4.1.

### [77] [A Few Words Can Distort Graphs: Knowledge Poisoning Attacks on Graph-based Retrieval-Augmented Generation of Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04276)
*Jiayi Wen,Tianxin Chen,Zhirun Zheng,Cheng Huang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper investigates security vulnerabilities in the GraphRAG framework, introducing two knowledge poisoning attacks (KPAs) that manipulate generated knowledge graphs, significantly degrading model accuracy and reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To expose and understand potential security risks in GraphRAG systems, specifically focusing on how malicious text alterations can mislead downstream reasoning by manipulating generated knowledge graphs.

Method: Proposed two knowledge poisoning attacks: (1) Targeted KPA (TKPA) which uses graph-theoretic analysis and LLMs to strategically rewrite narratives, and (2) Universal KPA (UKPA) which modifies influential linguistic cues to disrupt graph structures, all while keeping text natural and subtle.

Result: TKPA achieved a 93.1% success rate in altering QA outcomes with minimal text changes, and UKPA reduced QA accuracy from 95% to 50% with modifications in less than 0.05% of the text. Existing defenses failed to detect the attacks.

Conclusion: GraphRAG systems are vulnerable to subtle, text-based attacks that severely undermine reasoning and accuracy, emphasizing the need for further research into effective mitigation techniques.

Abstract: Graph-based Retrieval-Augmented Generation (GraphRAG) has recently emerged as
a promising paradigm for enhancing large language models (LLMs) by converting
raw text into structured knowledge graphs, improving both accuracy and
explainability. However, GraphRAG relies on LLMs to extract knowledge from raw
text during graph construction, and this process can be maliciously manipulated
to implant misleading information. Targeting this attack surface, we propose
two knowledge poisoning attacks (KPAs) and demonstrate that modifying only a
few words in the source text can significantly change the constructed graph,
poison the GraphRAG, and severely mislead downstream reasoning. The first
attack, named Targeted KPA (TKPA), utilizes graph-theoretic analysis to locate
vulnerable nodes in the generated graphs and rewrites the corresponding
narratives with LLMs, achieving precise control over specific
question-answering (QA) outcomes with a success rate of 93.1\%, while keeping
the poisoned text fluent and natural. The second attack, named Universal KPA
(UKPA), exploits linguistic cues such as pronouns and dependency relations to
disrupt the structural integrity of the generated graph by altering globally
influential words. With fewer than 0.05\% of full text modified, the QA
accuracy collapses from 95\% to 50\%. Furthermore, experiments show that
state-of-the-art defense methods fail to detect these attacks, highlighting
that securing GraphRAG pipelines against knowledge poisoning remains largely
unexplored.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MedCheck, a lifecycle-oriented assessment framework, was developed to address shortcomings in medical benchmarks for large language models (LLMs). This framework evaluates benchmarks across five stages using 46 specific criteria, uncovering systemic issues in current practices.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to tackle the lack of reliability in existing LLM medical benchmarks, addressing issues such as clinical fidelity, data handling, and safety evaluations.

Method: MedCheck deconstructs the lifecycle of benchmark development into five stages and offers a checklist of 46 criteria to assess them rigorously.

Result: An empirical evaluation of 53 medical LLM benchmarks using MedCheck revealed widespread issues, such as detachment from clinical practice, data contamination risks, and inadequate safety-focused metrics.

Conclusion: MedCheck highlights deficiencies in current benchmarks and provides a structured approach to improve standardization, reliability, and transparency in the evaluation of AI healthcare solutions.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) show significant potential in healthcare,
prompting numerous benchmarks to evaluate their capabilities. However, concerns
persist regarding the reliability of these benchmarks, which often lack
clinical fidelity, robust data management, and safety-oriented evaluation
metrics. To address these shortcomings, we introduce MedCheck, the first
lifecycle-oriented assessment framework specifically designed for medical
benchmarks. Our framework deconstructs a benchmark's development into five
continuous stages, from design to governance, and provides a comprehensive
checklist of 46 medically-tailored criteria. Using MedCheck, we conducted an
in-depth empirical evaluation of 53 medical LLM benchmarks. Our analysis
uncovers widespread, systemic issues, including a profound disconnect from
clinical practice, a crisis of data integrity due to unmitigated contamination
risks, and a systematic neglect of safety-critical evaluation dimensions like
model robustness and uncertainty awareness. Based on these findings, MedCheck
serves as both a diagnostic tool for existing benchmarks and an actionable
guideline to foster a more standardized, reliable, and transparent approach to
evaluating AI in healthcare.

*Francisco Bolaños,Angelo Salatino,Francesco Osborne,Enrico Motta*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces an annotation schema for rhetorical roles in scientific literature and evaluates 37 large language models (LLMs) for classifying these roles, achieving performance above 96% F1 in some cases.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI methods extracting insight from scientific literature require rhetorical role annotation, a gap this paper aims to address to aid high-quality literature review generation.

Method: The paper proposes a novel annotation schema, establishes the Sci-Sentence benchmark, and evaluates 37 LLMs via zero-shot and fine-tuning approaches.

Result: LLMs achieve up to 96%+ F1 scores with fine-tuning, proprietary models like GPT-4 demonstrate the best results, and semi-synthetic data helps smaller models perform robustly.

Conclusion: High-quality annotated data and semi-synthetic augmentation enable LLMs to specialize in rhetorical role classification, improving literature review automation.

Abstract: Previous work has demonstrated that AI methods for analysing scientific
literature benefit significantly from annotating sentences in papers according
to their rhetorical roles, such as research gaps, results, limitations,
extensions of existing methodologies, and others. Such representations also
have the potential to support the development of a new generation of systems
capable of producing high-quality literature reviews. However, achieving this
goal requires the definition of a relevant annotation schema and effective
strategies for large-scale annotation of the literature. This paper addresses
these challenges by 1) introducing a novel annotation schema specifically
designed to support literature review generation and 2) conducting a
comprehensive evaluation of a wide range of state-of-the-art large language
models (LLMs) in classifying rhetorical roles according to this schema. To this
end, we also present Sci-Sentence, a novel multidisciplinary benchmark
comprising 700 sentences manually annotated by domain experts and 2,240
sentences automatically labelled using LLMs. We evaluate 37 LLMs on this
benchmark, spanning diverse model families and sizes, using both zero-shot
learning and fine-tuning approaches. The experiments yield several novel
insights that advance the state of the art in this challenging domain. First,
the current generation of LLMs performs remarkably well on this task when
fine-tuned on high-quality data, achieving performance levels above 96\% F1.
Second, while large proprietary models like GPT-4o achieve the best results,
some lightweight open-source alternatives also demonstrate excellent
performance. Finally, enriching the training data with semi-synthetic examples
generated by LLMs proves beneficial, enabling small encoders to achieve robust
results and significantly enhancing the performance of several open decoder
models.

*Hongze Tan,Jianfei Pan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces Dynamic Entropy Weighting to improve fine-grained credit assignment in reinforcement learning for Large Language Models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current reinforcement learning practices for LLMs are hindered by coarse-grained credit assignment, especially in long-chain reasoning tasks.

Method: Dynamic Entropy Weighting assigns entropy-weighted rewards to tokens (via Group Token Policy Optimization) or entire sequences (via Group Relative Policy Optimization at Sequence Level).

Result: Experiments showed that methods leveraging entropy-weighted rewards outperform existing baselines like DAPO, validating their effectiveness.

Conclusion: Entropy-weighting mechanisms significantly boost deep reasoning capabilities in language models, resolving limitations in conventional RL approaches.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) with algorithms like Group Relative Policy
Optimization (GRPO) improves Large Language Model (LLM) reasoning, but is
limited by a coarse-grained credit assignment that applies a uniform reward to
all tokens in a sequence. This is a major flaw in long-chain reasoning tasks.
This paper solves this with \textbf{Dynamic Entropy Weighting}. Our core idea
is that high-entropy tokens in correct responses can guide the policy toward a
higher performance ceiling. This allows us to create more fine-grained reward
signals for precise policy updates via two ways: 1) \textbf{Group Token Policy
Optimization} (\textbf{GTPO}), we assigns a entropy-weighted reward to each
token for fine-grained credit assignment. 2) \textbf{Sequence-Level Group
Relative Policy Optimization} (\textbf{GRPO-S}), we assigns a entropy-weighted
reward to each sequence based on its average token entropy. Experiments show
our methods significantly outperform the strong DAPO baseline. The results
confirm that our entropy-weighting mechanism is the key driver of this
performance boost, offering a better path to enhance deep reasoning in models.

*Nima Iji,Kia Dashtipour*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces the Chain of Questions (CoQ) framework to enhance reasoning in multimodal language models by generating questions to selectively engage relevant sensory modalities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to improve reasoning capabilities in multimodal contexts for large language models, enabling them to interact dynamically with complex real-world environments.

Method: The CoQ framework encourages multimodal models to generate curiosity-driven questions to identify and activate the necessary sensory modalities for reasoning.

Result: Experimental results indicate the CoQ method improves the model’s accuracy, interpretability, and ability to align reasoning processes across diverse multimodal tasks.

Conclusion: CoQ enhances multimodal reasoning in language models by enabling dynamic sensory engagement and improving performance in complex tasks.

Abstract: Reasoning capabilities in large language models (LLMs) have substantially
advanced through methods such as chain-of-thought and explicit step-by-step
explanations. However, these improvements have not yet fully transitioned to
multimodal contexts, where models must proactively decide which sensory
modalities such as vision, audio, or spatial perception to engage when
interacting with complex real-world environments. In this paper, we introduce
the Chain of Questions (CoQ) framework, a curiosity-driven reasoning approach
that encourages multimodal language models to dynamically generate targeted
questions regarding their surroundings. These generated questions guide the
model to selectively activate relevant modalities, thereby gathering critical
information necessary for accurate reasoning and response generation. We
evaluate our framework on a novel multimodal benchmark dataset, assembled by
integrating WebGPT, ScienceQA, AVSD, and ScanQA datasets. Experimental results
demonstrate that our CoQ method improves a foundation model's ability to
effectively identify and integrate pertinent sensory information. This leads to
improved accuracy, interpretability, and alignment of the reasoning process
with diverse multimodal tasks.

### [83] [Improving Crash Data Quality with Large Language Models: Evidence from Secondary Crash Narratives in Kentucky](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04399)
*Xu Zhang,Mei Chen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study compares NLP methods for analyzing crash data narratives in Kentucky, finding fine-tuned transformers offer the best accuracy and efficiency when addressing secondary crashes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve crash data quality by analyzing narratives using advanced NLP models, aiding better safety policies and interventions.

Method: Three approaches were tested using crash narratives from 2015-2022: zero-shot large language models (LLMs), fine-tuned transformers, and a logistic regression baseline. Performance was compared against manually reviewed data.

Result: Fine-tuned transformers were the most effective, achieving high F1-scores and accuracy, while LLMs offered strong recall but were computationally expensive. Logistic regression underperformed.

Conclusion: Fine-tuned transformer models provide a balanced approach for accuracy and efficiency in crash data enhancement, with insights for practical deployment and scalability.

Abstract: This study evaluates advanced natural language processing (NLP) techniques to
enhance crash data quality by mining crash narratives, using secondary crash
identification in Kentucky as a case study. Drawing from 16,656 manually
reviewed narratives from 2015-2022, with 3,803 confirmed secondary crashes, we
compare three model classes: zero-shot open-source large language models (LLMs)
(LLaMA3:70B, DeepSeek-R1:70B, Qwen3:32B, Gemma3:27B); fine-tuned transformers
(BERT, DistilBERT, RoBERTa, XLNet, Longformer); and traditional logistic
regression as baseline. Models were calibrated on 2015-2021 data and tested on
1,771 narratives from 2022. Fine-tuned transformers achieved superior
performance, with RoBERTa yielding the highest F1-score (0.90) and accuracy
(95%). Zero-shot LLaMA3:70B reached a comparable F1 of 0.86 but required 139
minutes of inference; the logistic baseline lagged well behind (F1:0.66). LLMs
excelled in recall for some variants (e.g., GEMMA3:27B at 0.94) but incurred
high computational costs (up to 723 minutes for DeepSeek-R1:70B), while
fine-tuned models processed the test set in seconds after brief training.
Further analysis indicated that mid-sized LLMs (e.g., DeepSeek-R1:32B) can
rival larger counterparts in performance while reducing runtime, suggesting
opportunities for optimized deployments. Results highlight trade-offs between
accuracy, efficiency, and data requirements, with fine-tuned transformer models
balancing precision and recall effectively on Kentucky data. Practical
deployment considerations emphasize privacy-preserving local deployment,
ensemble approaches for improved accuracy, and incremental processing for
scalability, providing a replicable scheme for enhancing crash-data quality
with advanced NLP.

### [84] [Why are LLMs' abilities emergent?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04401)
*Vladimír Havlík*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper analyzes emergent properties in Deep Neural Networks (DNNs), focusing on why some capabilities unexpectedly arise in Large Language Models (LLMs). It identifies these emergences as rooted in nonlinear, stochastic dynamics rather than mere scaling of parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate the unexpected capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) and to address the epistemological issues in understanding emergent phenomena in deep neural networks.

Method: Utilizes both theoretical analysis and empirical observation, exploring scaling laws, grokking phenomena, phase transitions, and cooperative interactions in simple components to analyze emergent properties in DNNs.

Result: Finds that emergent abilities in LLMs stem from complex dynamics of nonlinear systems rather than parameter scaling, highlighting the cooperative interactions among simple network elements.

Conclusion: The study concludes that understanding capabilities of LLMs requires viewing DNNs as complex dynamical systems governed by universal principles of emergence, akin to phenomena in natural sciences.

Abstract: The remarkable success of Large Language Models (LLMs) in generative tasks
has raised fundamental questions about the nature of their acquired
capabilities, which often appear to emerge unexpectedly without explicit
training. This paper examines the emergent properties of Deep Neural Networks
(DNNs) through both theoretical analysis and empirical observation, addressing
the epistemological challenge of "creation without understanding" that
characterises contemporary AI development. We explore how the neural approach's
reliance on nonlinear, stochastic processes fundamentally differs from symbolic
computational paradigms, creating systems whose macro-level behaviours cannot
be analytically derived from micro-level neuron activities. Through analysis of
scaling laws, grokking phenomena, and phase transitions in model capabilities,
I demonstrate that emergent abilities arise from the complex dynamics of highly
sensitive nonlinear systems rather than simply from parameter scaling alone. My
investigation reveals that current debates over metrics, pre-training loss
thresholds, and in-context learning miss the fundamental ontological nature of
emergence in DNNs. I argue that these systems exhibit genuine emergent
properties analogous to those found in other complex natural phenomena, where
systemic capabilities emerge from cooperative interactions among simple
components without being reducible to their individual behaviours. The paper
concludes that understanding LLM capabilities requires recognising DNNs as a
new domain of complex dynamical systems governed by universal principles of
emergence, similar to those operating in physics, chemistry, and biology. This
perspective shifts the focus from purely phenomenological definitions of
emergence to understanding the internal dynamic transformations that enable
these systems to acquire capabilities that transcend their individual
components.

*Kiyotada Mori,Seiya Kawano,Chaoran Liu,Carlos Toshinori Ishi,Angel Fernando Garcia Contreras,Koichiro Yoshino*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper explores how human selective listening can guide the improvement and evaluation of automatic speech recognition (ASR) in spoken dialogue systems (SDSs).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current spoken dialogue systems rely heavily on ASR to extract pertinent information from user speech for generating responses effectively. There is a need to understand which aspects of human listening could enhance ASR systems to better serve SDSs.

Method: The study conducted a comparative analysis between human-generated transcriptions used for dialogue response generation and reference transcriptions to confirm the role of selective listening in effective dialogue response generation.

Result: The results experimentally demonstrated that selective listening plays a significant role in human dialogue response generation and that ASR lacks this capability, creating a performance gap.

Conclusion: Leveraging insights from human selective listening could inspire new evaluation methods for ASR. This approach may identify performance gaps between human transcription capabilities and ASR systems, aiding in their enhancement.

Abstract: Spoken dialogue systems (SDSs) utilize automatic speech recognition (ASR) at
the front end of their pipeline. The role of ASR in SDSs is to recognize
information in user speech related to response generation appropriately.
Examining selective listening of humans, which refers to the ability to focus
on and listen to important parts of a conversation during the speech, will
enable us to identify the ASR capabilities required for SDSs and evaluate them.
In this study, we experimentally confirmed selective listening when humans
generate dialogue responses by comparing human transcriptions for generating
dialogue responses and reference transcriptions. Based on our experimental
results, we discuss the possibility of a new ASR evaluation method that
leverages human selective listening, which can identify the gap between
transcription ability between ASR systems and humans.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study proposes a prediction confidence model (PCM) to determine if prefetching responses in dialogue systems can reduce user-perceived latency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to reduce the user-perceived latency (UPL) in spoken dialogue systems by predicting whole user utterances early.

Method: A prediction confidence model (PCM) is introduced to estimate semantic similarity between predicted and actual user utterances before prefetching dialogue responses.

Result: PCM was evaluated for its effectiveness using differences between predicted utterances and actual user utterances.

Conclusion: PCM holds promise for improving the efficiency of spoken dialogue systems by enabling effective prefetching.

Abstract: Prefetching of dialogue responses has been investigated to reduce
user-perceived latency (UPL), which refers to the user's waiting time before
receiving the system's response, in spoken dialogue systems. To reduce the UPL,
it is necessary to predict complete user utterances before the end of the
user's speech, typically by language models, to prepare prefetched dialogue
responses. In this study, we proposed a prediction confidence model (PCM) that
determines whether prefetching is possible or not by estimating the semantic
similarity between the predicted complete user utterance and the complete user
utterance. We evaluated our PCM based on the differences between the predicted
complete user utterance and the complete user utterance.

### [87] [Evaluating, Synthesizing, and Enhancing for Customer Support Conversation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04423)
*Jie Zhu,Huaixia Dou,Junhui Li,Lifan Guo,Feng Chen,Chi Zhang,Fang Kong*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a structured framework for customer support conversations and employs large language models (LLMs) to improve strategy-rich dialogues by creating a specialized dataset and following COPC guidelines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world customer service data is difficult to access and annotate, and existing dialogue datasets are not strategically aligned. The authors aim to train customer service agents using well-defined support strategies for high-quality conversations.

Method: The authors propose a five-stage CSC framework grounded in COPC guidelines with twelve conversational strategies, construct a rewritten and annotated dataset (CSConv) using LLMs, and simulate additional dialogues via LLM-powered role-playing (RoleCS) for model fine-tuning.

Result: Fine-tuning strong LLMs on RoleCS significantly improves their ability to generate strategy-aligned responses in the CSConv dataset. Human evaluations confirm improvements in problem resolution.

Conclusion: The CSC framework, together with strategic datasets and fine-tuned LLMs, enhances conversational quality and customer service effectiveness. The code and datasets are publicly available for future exploration.

Abstract: Effective customer support requires not only accurate problem solving but
also structured and empathetic communication aligned with professional
standards. However, existing dialogue datasets often lack strategic guidance,
and real-world service data is difficult to access and annotate. To address
this, we introduce the task of Customer Support Conversation (CSC), aimed at
training customer service agents to respond using well-defined support
strategies. We propose a structured CSC framework grounded in COPC guidelines,
defining five conversational stages and twelve strategies to guide high-quality
interactions. Based on this, we construct CSConv, an evaluation dataset of
1,855 real-world customer-agent conversations rewritten using LLMs to reflect
deliberate strategy use, and annotated accordingly. Additionally, we develop a
role-playing approach that simulates strategy-rich conversations using
LLM-powered roles aligned with the CSC framework, resulting in the training
dataset RoleCS. Experiments show that fine-tuning strong LLMs on RoleCS
significantly improves their ability to generate high-quality, strategy-aligned
responses on CSConv. Human evaluations further confirm gains in problem
resolution. All code and data will be made publicly available at

*Yutong Wu,Di Huang,Ruosi Wan,Yue Peng,Shijie Shang,Chenrui Cao,Lei Qi,Rui Zhang,Zidong Du,Jie Yan,Xing Hu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces ThinkingF, a pipeline to enhance autoformalization by constructing unique datasets and applying specific training methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve the low accuracy in translating natural-language mathematical statements into formal language.

Method: ThinkingF pipeline uses specialized datasets for formal knowledge and informal-to-formal reasoning, combined with supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning with verification (RLVR).

Result: The new models, StepFun-Formalizer-7B and 32B, outperform prior work, achieving state-of-the-art scores in FormalMATH-Lite and ProverBench benchmarks.

Conclusion: The approach demonstrates significant improvements in both formal knowledge comprehension and informal-to-formal reasoning abilities, setting new benchmarks in autoformalization.

Abstract: Autoformalization aims to translate natural-language mathematical statements
into a formal language. While LLMs have accelerated progress in this area,
existing methods still suffer from low accuracy. We identify two key abilities
for effective autoformalization: comprehensive mastery of formal-language
domain knowledge, and reasoning capability of natural language problem
understanding and informal-formal alignment. Without the former, a model cannot
identify the correct formal objects; without the latter, it struggles to
interpret real-world contexts and map them precisely into formal expressions.
To address these gaps, we introduce ThinkingF, a data synthesis and training
pipeline that improves both abilities. First, we construct two datasets: one by
distilling and selecting large-scale examples rich in formal knowledge, and
another by generating informal-to-formal reasoning trajectories guided by
expert-designed templates. We then apply SFT and RLVR with these datasets to
further fuse and refine the two abilities. The resulting 7B and 32B models
exhibit both comprehensive formal knowledge and strong informal-to-formal
reasoning. Notably, StepFun-Formalizer-32B achieves SOTA BEq@1 scores of 40.5%
on FormalMATH-Lite and 26.7% on ProverBench, surpassing all prior
general-purpose and specialized models.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores scalable generative AI pipelines for creating Form 1 Math MCQs in Bahasa Melayu, comparing non-grounded prompts with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) approaches. Results highlight RAG's superior quality and alignment with Malaysian curriculum standards.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Malaysian education system lacks high-quality, scalable assessment tools, particularly in low-resource languages like Bahasa Melayu. Generative AI presents a promising yet challenging solution.

Method: Four approaches for generating questions were compared: structured/basic non-grounded prompts and RAG pipelines (manual and LangChain framework). Evaluation included Semantic Textual Similarity (STS) and a RAG-QA method.

Result: RAG pipelines significantly outperformed non-grounded prompting methods, yielding better curriculum alignment and factual validity. Framework-based RAG trades simplicity for manual pipeline's refined control.

Conclusion: This study validates RAG-based methodologies for educational content creation in low-resource languages, offering a practical approach for EdTech deployment and novel evaluation techniques.

Abstract: This paper addresses the critical need for scalable and high-quality
educational assessment tools within the Malaysian education system. It
highlights the potential of Generative AI (GenAI) while acknowledging the
significant challenges of ensuring factual accuracy and curriculum alignment,
especially for low-resource languages like Bahasa Melayu. This research
introduces and compares four incremental pipelines for generating Form 1
Mathematics multiple-choice questions (MCQs) in Bahasa Melayu using OpenAI's
GPT-4o. The methods range from non-grounded prompting (structured and basic) to
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) approaches (one using the LangChain
framework, one implemented manually). The system is grounded in official
curriculum documents, including teacher-prepared notes and the yearly teaching
plan (RPT). A dual-pronged automated evaluation framework is employed to assess
the generated questions. Curriculum alignment is measured using Semantic
Textual Similarity (STS) against the RPT, while contextual validity is verified
through a novel RAG-based Question-Answering (RAG-QA) method. The results
demonstrate that RAG-based pipelines significantly outperform non-grounded
prompting methods, producing questions with higher curriculum alignment and
factual validity. The study further analyzes the trade-offs between the ease of
implementation of framework-based RAG and the fine-grained control offered by a
manual pipeline. This work presents a validated methodology for generating
curriculum-specific educational content in a low-resource language, introduces
a symbiotic RAG-QA evaluation technique, and provides actionable insights for
the development and deployment of practical EdTech solutions in Malaysia and
similar regions.

### [90] [CALE : Concept-Aligned Embeddings for Both Within-Lemma and Inter-Lemma Sense Differentiation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04494)
*Bastien Liétard,Gabriel Loiseau*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces Concept Differentiation to extend semantic word analysis beyond same-lemma comparisons, using fine-tuned Concept-Aligned Embeddings (CALE) for better lexical semantic representation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current approaches in lexical semantics primarily focus on Word-in-Context tasks that only compare instances of the same lemma, thus limiting semantic analysis.

Method: The authors propose Concept Differentiation, creating a dataset from SemCor data and fine-tuning representation models to generate Concept-Aligned Embeddings (CALE).

Result: CALE models achieve improved multi-purpose representations of lexical meaning and outperform other models on a variety of lexical semantic tasks.

Conclusion: The proposed CALE enhances semantic accuracy and reorganizes the spatial structure of embeddings, making them more efficient tools for analyzing lexical meanings across words.

Abstract: Lexical semantics is concerned with both the multiple senses a word can adopt
in different contexts, and the semantic relations that exist between meanings
of different words. To investigate them, Contextualized Language Models are a
valuable tool that provides context-sensitive representations that can be used
to investigate lexical meaning. Recent works like XL-LEXEME have leveraged the
task of Word-in-Context to fine-tune them to get more semantically accurate
representations, but Word-in-Context only compares occurrences of the same
lemma, limiting the range of captured information. In this paper, we propose an
extension, Concept Differentiation, to include inter-words scenarios. We
provide a dataset for this task, derived from SemCor data. Then we fine-tune
several representation models on this dataset. We call these models
Concept-Aligned Embeddings (CALE). By challenging our models and other models
on various lexical semantic tasks, we demonstrate that the proposed models
provide efficient multi-purpose representations of lexical meaning that reach
best performances in our experiments. We also show that CALE's fine-tuning
brings valuable changes to the spatial organization of embeddings.

### [91] [StyliTruth : Unlocking Stylized yet Truthful LLM Generation via Disentangled Steering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04530)
*Chenglei Shen,Zhongxiang Sun,Teng Shi,Xiao Zhang,Jun Xu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces StyliTruth, a mechanism to enable stylization in large language model responses while preserving truthfulness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the problem of stylization-induced truthfulness collapse, where imposing styles in LLM responses compromises their correctness and truthfulness.

Method: StyliTruth separates style-relevant and truth-relevant subspaces in the model's latent representation space through an orthogonal deflation process. It dynamically applies steering vectors within these subspaces to control the generation process, maintaining both style and truth.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate that StyliTruth significantly reduces truthfulness collapse compared to existing methods and achieves a better balance between style adherence and correctness.

Conclusion: StyliTruth offers a novel way to balance stylistic expression with correctness in LLMs, effectively addressing challenges in current representation editing techniques.

Abstract: Generating stylized large language model (LLM) responses via representation
editing is a promising way for fine-grained output control. However, there
exists an inherent trade-off: imposing a distinctive style often degrades
truthfulness. Existing representation editing methods, by naively injecting
style signals, overlook this collateral impact and frequently contaminate the
model's core truthfulness representations, resulting in reduced answer
correctness. We term this phenomenon stylization-induced truthfulness collapse.
We attribute this issue to latent coupling between style and truth directions
in certain key attention heads, and propose StyliTruth, a mechanism that
preserves stylization while keeping truthfulness intact. StyliTruth separates
the style-relevant and truth-relevant subspaces in the model's representation
space via an orthogonal deflation process. This decomposition enables
independent control of style and truth in their own subspaces, minimizing
interference. By designing adaptive, token-level steering vectors within each
subspace, we dynamically and precisely control the generation process to
maintain both stylistic fidelity and truthfulness. We validate our method on
multiple styles and languages. Extensive experiments and analyses show that
StyliTruth significantly reduces stylization-induced truthfulness collapse and
outperforms existing inference-time intervention methods in balancing style
adherence with truthfulness.

### [92] [Unveiling the Landscape of Clinical Depression Assessment: From Behavioral Signatures to Psychiatric Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04531)
*Zhuang Chen,Guanqun Bi,Wen Zhang,Jiawei Hu,Aoyun Wang,Xiyao Xiao,Kun Feng,Minlie Huang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces C-MIND, a clinically validated dataset for depression diagnosis, assessing its application in various models, and improving LLM performance using clinical insights.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations in automated depression assessment by providing clinically validated data and insights on practical applications.

Method: The study involves the creation of the C-MIND dataset, behavioral signature analysis, performance evaluation of classical models across tasks and modalities, and enhancement of LLM psychiatric reasoning with clinical expertise.

Result: Improved diagnostic performance, particularly a 10% enhancement in Macro-F1 score when integrating clinical guidance into LLM reasoning.

Conclusion: C-MIND establishes a framework for clinical depression assessment, enabling reliable research and advancing algorithmic contributions.

Abstract: Depression is a widespread mental disorder that affects millions worldwide.
While automated depression assessment shows promise, most studies rely on
limited or non-clinically validated data, and often prioritize complex model
design over real-world effectiveness. In this paper, we aim to unveil the
landscape of clinical depression assessment. We introduce C-MIND, a clinical
neuropsychiatric multimodal diagnosis dataset collected over two years from
real hospital visits. Each participant completes three structured psychiatric
tasks and receives a final diagnosis from expert clinicians, with informative
audio, video, transcript, and functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS)
signals recorded. Using C-MIND, we first analyze behavioral signatures relevant
to diagnosis. We train a range of classical models to quantify how different
tasks and modalities contribute to diagnostic performance, and dissect the
effectiveness of their combinations. We then explore whether LLMs can perform
psychiatric reasoning like clinicians and identify their clear limitations in
realistic clinical settings. In response, we propose to guide the reasoning
process with clinical expertise and consistently improves LLM diagnostic
performance by up to 10% in Macro-F1 score. We aim to build an infrastructure
for clinical depression assessment from both data and algorithmic perspectives,
enabling C-MIND to facilitate grounded and reliable research for mental
healthcare.

*Nuo Chen,Yicheng Tong,Jiaying Wu,Minh Duc Duong,Qian Wang,Qingyun Zou,Bryan Hooi,Bingsheng He*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores how structured multi-agent discussions can generate superior research proposals compared to solitary ideation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AI ideation frameworks are limited by single-agent perspectives, restricting creativity and leveraging only bounded knowledge.

Method: The study employs a cooperative multi-agent framework, comparing configurations like group size, leadership structures, and team composition, and assesses idea quality using both agent-based scoring and human review.

Result: Results highlight that multi-agent discussions outperform solitary agents, with leadership and cognitive diversity driving higher-quality, integrated proposals, while expertise remains mandatory.

Conclusion: Structured multi-agent AI frameworks with diverse and skilled teams enhance creativity and yield actionable insights for collaborative ideation systems.

Abstract: While AI agents show potential in scientific ideation, most existing
frameworks rely on single-agent refinement, limiting creativity due to bounded
knowledge and perspective. Inspired by real-world research dynamics, this paper
investigates whether structured multi-agent discussions can surpass solitary
ideation. We propose a cooperative multi-agent framework for generating
research proposals and systematically compare configurations including group
size, leaderled versus leaderless structures, and team compositions varying in
interdisciplinarity and seniority. To assess idea quality, we employ a
comprehensive protocol with agent-based scoring and human review across
dimensions such as novelty, strategic vision, and integration depth. Our
results show that multi-agent discussions substantially outperform solitary
baselines. A designated leader acts as a catalyst, transforming discussion into
more integrated and visionary proposals. Notably, we find that cognitive
diversity is a primary driver of quality, yet expertise is a non-negotiable
prerequisite, as teams lacking a foundation of senior knowledge fail to surpass
even a single competent agent. These findings offer actionable insights for
designing collaborative AI ideation systems and shed light on how team
structure influences creative outcomes.

### [94] [Share Your Attention: Transformer Weight Sharing via Matrix-based Dictionary Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04581)
*Magauiya Zhussip,Dmitriy Shopkhoev,Ammar Ali,Stamatios Lefkimmiatis*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces MASA (Matrix Atom Sharing in Attention), a method for significant parameter reduction in transformer models by sharing weight dictionaries across layers, reducing attention module parameters by 66.7% without performance degradation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address the high computational and memory requirements of large language models by exploring inter-block redundancies in transformer architectures, which have been underutilized compared to intra-block optimizations.

Method: The MASA framework utilizes structured weight sharing by decomposing attention projection matrices into shared dictionary atoms. This eliminates the need for distillation or architectural changes and enables efficient training using standard optimizers.

Result: MASA achieves better benchmark accuracy and perplexity compared to multiple existing methods while reducing parameters significantly by 66.7%. It performs robustly across diverse scales (100M-700M parameters) and tasks, including Vision Transformers (ViT), while maintaining performance.

Conclusion: MASA provides a scalable and efficient approach for parameter reduction in transformers by leveraging dictionary learning, supporting comparable or superior performance without increasing training complexity.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized AI applications, yet their
high computational and memory demands hinder their widespread deployment.
Existing compression techniques focus on intra-block optimizations (e.g.
low-rank approximation, attention head pruning), while the repetitive layered
structure of transformers implies significant inter-block redundancy - a
dimension largely unexplored beyond key-value (KV) caching. Inspired by
dictionary learning in CNNs, we propose a framework for structured weight
sharing across transformer layers. Our approach decomposes attention projection
matrices into shared dictionary atoms, reducing the attention module's
parameters by 66.7% while achieving on-par performance. Unlike complex methods
requiring distillation or architectural changes, MASA (Matrix Atom Sharing in
Attention) operates as a drop-in replacement - trained with standard optimizers
- and represents each layer's weights as linear combinations of shared matrix
atoms. Experiments across scales (100M-700M parameters) show that MASA achieves
better benchmark accuracy and perplexity than grouped-query attention (GQA),
low-rank baselines and recently proposed Repeat-all-over/Sequential sharing at
comparable parameter budgets. Ablation studies confirm robustness to the
dictionary size and the efficacy of shared representations in capturing
cross-layer statistical regularities. Extending to Vision Transformers (ViT),
MASA matches performance metrics on image classification and detection tasks
with 66.7% fewer attention parameters. By combining dictionary learning
strategies with transformer efficiency, MASA offers a scalable blueprint for
parameter-efficient models without sacrificing performance. Finally, we
investigate the possibility of employing MASA on pretrained LLMs to reduce
their number of parameters without experiencing any significant drop in their
performance.

*Zhejun Zhao,Yuehu Dong,Alley Liu,Lixue Zheng,Pingsheng Liu,Dongdong Shen,Long Xia,Jiashu Zhao,Dawei Yin*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces TURA, a novel framework for AI search engines that combines Retrieval-Augmented Generation with dynamic tool usage to address real-time and structured query limitations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Search engines relying on static Retrieval-Augmented Generation methods face shortcomings in addressing real-time and dynamic queries necessary for industrial applications.

Method: The TURA framework implements three components: an Intent-Aware Retrieval module for query decomposition and sourcing, a DAG-based Task Planner for parallel execution, and a lightweight Distilled Agent Executor for efficient tool usage.

Result: TURA successfully integrates static and dynamic information sources, enabling the delivery of real-time and robust search answers for millions of users while meeting industrial latency requirements.

Conclusion: TURA bridges the gap between static content optimization and dynamic tool usage, positioning itself as an effective solution for scalable AI search systems in industrial use cases.

Abstract: The advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) is transforming search engines
into conversational AI search products, primarily using Retrieval-Augmented
Generation (RAG) on web corpora. However, this paradigm has significant
industrial limitations. Traditional RAG approaches struggle with real-time
needs and structured queries that require accessing dynamically generated
content like ticket availability or inventory. Limited to indexing static
pages, search engines cannot perform the interactive queries needed for such
time-sensitive data. Academic research has focused on optimizing RAG for static
content, overlooking complex intents and the need for dynamic sources like
databases and real-time APIs. To bridge this gap, we introduce TURA
(Tool-Augmented Unified Retrieval Agent for AI Search), a novel three-stage
framework that combines RAG with agentic tool-use to access both static content
and dynamic, real-time information. TURA has three key components: an
Intent-Aware Retrieval module to decompose queries and retrieve information
sources encapsulated as Model Context Protocol (MCP) Servers, a DAG-based Task
Planner that models task dependencies as a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) for
optimal parallel execution, and a lightweight Distilled Agent Executor for
efficient tool calling. TURA is the first architecture to systematically bridge
the gap between static RAG and dynamic information sources for a world-class AI
search product. Serving tens of millions of users, it leverages an agentic
framework to deliver robust, real-time answers while meeting the low-latency
demands of a large-scale industrial system.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The research aims to make text-to-SQL translation accessible to non-experts, particularly in resource-constrained environments, with lightweight AI models.

Method: The authors used a model-agnostic pipeline to train T5-Small, BART-Small, and GPT-2 on the Spider dataset, tailoring schema formatting to each model and evaluating their performance using metrics like Logical Form Accuracy, BLEU, and Exact Match.

Result: The fine-tuned T5-Small model achieved the best Logical Form Accuracy (27.8%), outperforming BART-Small and GPT-2 in schema-aware SQL generation.

Conclusion: Compact transformers like T5-Small hold promise for text-to-SQL tasks in low-resource scenarios, with a modular pipeline enabling future improvements in methods and models.

Abstract: Text-to-SQL translation enables non-expert users to query relational
databases using natural language, with applications in education and business
intelligence. This study evaluates three lightweight transformer models -
T5-Small, BART-Small, and GPT-2 - on the Spider dataset, focusing on
low-resource settings. We developed a reusable, model-agnostic pipeline that
tailors schema formatting to each model's architecture, training them across
1000 to 5000 iterations and evaluating on 1000 test samples using Logical Form
Accuracy (LFAcc), BLEU, and Exact Match (EM) metrics. Fine-tuned T5-Small
achieves the highest LFAcc (27.8%), outperforming BART-Small (23.98%) and GPT-2
(20.1%), highlighting encoder-decoder models' superiority in schema-aware SQL
generation. Despite resource constraints limiting performance, our pipeline's
modularity supports future enhancements, such as advanced schema linking or
alternative base models. This work underscores the potential of compact
transformers for accessible text-to-SQL solutions in resource-scarce
environments.

*Feifan Song,Bofei Gao,Yifan Song,Yi Liu,Weimin Xiong,Yuyang Song,Tianyu Liu,Guoyin Wang,Houfeng Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces P-Aligner, a module that aligns flawed instructions into a human-preferred form to help LLMs perform better in alignment tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large Language Models often fail to align with user intentions when faced with unclear or poorly constructed instructions, necessitating solutions to improve their performance in handling flawed prompts.

Method: The authors propose P-Aligner, a lightweight module trained on a new dataset, UltraPrompt, created through Monte-Carlo Tree Search-guided exploration of human-preferred instruction forms.

Result: P-Aligner achieves significant performance improvements over baseline methods, with average win-rate gains of 28.35% on GPT-4-turbo and 8.69% on Gemma-2-SimPO, and shows advantages in effectiveness, data quality, and efficiency.

Conclusion: The research highlights the potential of P-Aligner in enhancing instruction alignment for LLMs, demonstrating both cost-effectiveness and superiority over existing methods in key benchmarks.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are expected to produce safe, helpful, and
honest content during interaction with human users, but they frequently fail to
align with such values when given flawed instructions, e.g., missing context,
ambiguous directives, or inappropriate tone, leaving substantial room for
improvement along multiple dimensions. A cost-effective yet high-impact way is
to pre-align instructions before the model begins decoding. Existing approaches
either rely on prohibitive test-time search costs or end-to-end model rewrite,
which is powered by a customized training corpus with unclear objectives. In
this work, we demonstrate that the goal of efficient and effective preference
alignment can be achieved by P-Aligner, a lightweight module generating
instructions that preserve the original intents while being expressed in a more
human-preferred form. P-Aligner is trained on UltraPrompt, a new dataset
synthesized via a proposed principle-guided pipeline using Monte-Carlo Tree
Search, which systematically explores the space of candidate instructions that
are closely tied to human preference. Experiments across different methods show
that P-Aligner generally outperforms strong baselines across various models and
benchmarks, including average win-rate gains of 28.35% and 8.69% on GPT-4-turbo
and Gemma-2-SimPO, respectively. Further analyses validate its effectiveness
and efficiency through multiple perspectives, including data quality, search
strategies, iterative deployment, and time overhead.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces IFDecorator, a framework that enhances the efficiency and robustness of RLVR training for instruction-following in large language models (LLMs), addressing issues like over-optimization and reward hacking.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to improve the training efficiency and robustness of RLVR frameworks, which enhance instruction-following capabilities in LLMs but suffer from difficulty assessment and reward hacking issues.

Method: The IFDecorator framework includes three components: (1) a cooperative-adversarial data flywheel for evolving challenging instruction-verification pairs, (2) the IntentCheck module for ensuring intent alignment, and (3) trip wires to diagnose and reduce reward hacking by capturing shortcut exploitation.

Result: The proposed Qwen2.5-32B-Instruct-IFDecorator achieves 87.43% accuracy on IFEval, surpassing larger models like GPT-4o, and shows significant improvements on FollowBench while reducing reward hacking rates.

Conclusion: IFDecorator effectively enhances RLVR training, improves instruction-following performance, mitigates reward hacking issues, and ensures robust intent alignment in LLMs, with plans to release resources for future research.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) improves instruction
following capabilities of large language models (LLMs), but suffers from
training inefficiency due to inadequate difficulty assessment. Moreover, RLVR
is prone to over-optimization, where LLMs exploit verification shortcuts
without aligning to the actual intent of user instructions. We introduce
Instruction Following Decorator (IFDecorator}, a framework that wraps RLVR
training into a robust and sample-efficient pipeline. It consists of three
components: (1) a cooperative-adversarial data flywheel that co-evolves
instructions and hybrid verifications, generating progressively more
challenging instruction-verification pairs; (2) IntentCheck, a bypass module
enforcing intent alignment; and (3) trip wires, a diagnostic mechanism that
detects reward hacking via trap instructions, which trigger and capture
shortcut exploitation behaviors. Our Qwen2.5-32B-Instruct-IFDecorator achieves
87.43% accuracy on IFEval, outperforming larger proprietary models such as
GPT-4o. Additionally, we demonstrate substantial improvements on FollowBench
while preserving general capabilities. Our trip wires show significant
reductions in reward hacking rates. We will release models, code, and data for
future research.

TL;DR: The paper reviews 74 NLP studies on counterspeech to highlight the disconnect between current research trends and the needs of affected communities, offering recommendations to address this gap.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the growing disconnection between NLP counterspeech research and the needs of communities most affected by online hate speech, particularly NGOs focused on issues like online Gender-Based Violence.

Method: The paper performs a systematic review of 74 NLP studies and complements this analysis with a participatory case study involving five NGOs specializing in oGBV.

Result: The review and the case study show a trend of minimal stakeholder input in creating datasets, developing models, and evaluating solutions for counterspeech, revealing gaps between academic research and community needs.

Conclusion: The paper recommends re-centering stakeholder expertise and collaboration to bridge the gap between research output and the requirements of affected communities for more impactful counterspeech interventions.

Abstract: Counterspeech, i.e. the practice of responding to online hate speech, has
gained traction in NLP as a promising intervention. While early work emphasised
collaboration with non-governmental organisation stakeholders, recent research
trends have shifted toward automated pipelines that reuse a small set of legacy
datasets, often without input from affected communities. This paper presents a
systematic review of 74 NLP studies on counterspeech, analysing the extent to
which stakeholder participation influences dataset creation, model development,
and evaluation. To complement this analysis, we conducted a participatory case
study with five NGOs specialising in online Gender-Based Violence (oGBV),
identifying stakeholder-informed practices for counterspeech generation. Our
findings reveal a growing disconnect between current NLP research and the needs
of communities most impacted by toxic online content. We conclude with concrete
recommendations for re-centring stakeholder expertise in counterspeech
research.

*Noah Ziems,Dilara Soylu,Lakshya A Agrawal,Isaac Miller,Liheng Lai,Chen Qian,Kaiqiang Song,Meng Jiang,Dan Klein,Matei Zaharia,Karel D'Oosterlinck,Christopher Potts,Omar Khattab*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces mmGRPO, a multi-module extension of GRPO, to improve modular AI systems that incorporate multiple LM calls and offers empirical benefits in various tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI systems increasingly involve modular programs with multiple language model (LM) calls using distinct methods. GRPO is known for optimizing LMs post-training, but its adaptation to modular settings remains unclear.

Method: The authors propose mmGRPO, a generalization of GRPO, to optimize across modules during rollouts, addressing challenges like variable-length and interrupted trajectories. Automatic prompt optimization is also incorporated.

Result: mmGRPO improves task accuracy by 11% compared to a post-trained LM and by 5% compared to prompt optimization alone. The tool is released as dspy.GRPO in the DSPy library.

Conclusion: mmGRPO effectively extends GRPO to modular AI systems, offering tangible accuracy improvements while being openly available for practical use.

Abstract: Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) has proven to be an effective tool
for post-training language models (LMs). However, AI systems are increasingly
expressed as modular programs that mix together multiple LM calls with distinct
prompt templates and other tools, and it is not clear how best to leverage GRPO
to improve these systems. We begin to address this challenge by defining
mmGRPO, a simple multi-module generalization of GRPO that groups LM calls by
module across rollouts and handles variable-length and interrupted
trajectories. We find that mmGRPO, composed with automatic prompt optimization,
improves accuracy by 11% on average across classification, many-hop search, and
privacy-preserving delegation tasks against the post-trained LM, and by 5%
against prompt optimization on its own. We open-source mmGRPO in DSPy as the
dspy.GRPO optimizer.

*Mo Li,L. H. Xu,Qitai Tan,Ting Cao,Yunxin Liu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs experience performance degradation with long contexts due to proactive interference. Sculptor introduces tools for Active Context Management (ACM) enabling better memory control.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the performance issues in LLMs caused by irrelevant information disrupting reasoning and memory recall in long contexts.

Method: Sculptor provides tools for ACM, including context fragmentation, summary/hide/restore, and intelligent search, allowing LLMs to manage attention effectively.

Result: Experimental benchmarks reveal significant performance improvement of LLMs using Sculptor without requiring specific training.

Conclusion: Explicit context-control mechanisms, such as those enabled by Sculptor, are essential for enhancing LLM robustness in long-context tasks—even beyond simply increasing token limits.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) suffer from significant performance degradation
when processing long contexts due to proactive interference, where irrelevant
information in earlier parts of the context disrupts reasoning and memory
recall. While most research focuses on external memory systems to augment LLMs'
capabilities, we propose a complementary approach: empowering LLMs with Active
Context Management (ACM) tools to actively sculpt their internal working
memory. We introduce Sculptor, a framework that equips LLMs with three
categories of tools: (1) context fragmentation, (2) summary, hide, and restore,
and (3) intelligent search. Our approach enables LLMs to proactively manage
their attention and working memory, analogous to how humans selectively focus
on relevant information while filtering out distractions. Experimental
evaluation on information-sparse benchmarks-PI-LLM (proactive interference) and
NeedleBench Multi-Needle Reasoning-demonstrates that Sculptor significantly
improves performance even without specific training, leveraging LLMs' inherent
tool calling generalization capabilities. By enabling Active Context
Management, Sculptor not only mitigates proactive interference but also
provides a cognitive foundation for more reliable reasoning across diverse
long-context tasks-highlighting that explicit context-control strategies,
rather than merely larger token windows, are key to robustness at scale.

### [102] [GeRe: Towards Efficient Anti-Forgetting in Continual Learning of LLM via General Samples Replay](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04676)
*Yunan Zhang,Shuoran Jiang,Mengchen Zhao,Yuefeng Li,Yang Fan,Xiangping Wu,Qingcai Chen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces General Sample Replay (GeRe), a method to mitigate catastrophic forgetting in large language models by replaying general pretraining texts and enhancing neural states using threshold-based margin loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to enable large language models (LLMs) to continually learn new tasks without suffering from catastrophic forgetting, particularly the loss of general capabilities and performance decline in prior tasks.

Method: The authors propose the GeRe framework using pretraining texts for replay combined with a threshold-based margin (TM) loss to maintain activation state consistency and improve anti-forgetting.

Result: Experiments show that TM under the GeRe framework improves performance across sequential tasks, robustly retaining general capabilities and overall task performance.

Conclusion: The paper demonstrates that a small, fixed set of pre-collected replay samples is sufficient for mitigating catastrophic forgetting in LLMs, advancing their continual learning capabilities.

Abstract: The continual learning capability of large language models (LLMs) is crucial
for advancing artificial general intelligence. However, continual fine-tuning
LLMs across various domains often suffers from catastrophic forgetting,
characterized by: 1) significant forgetting of their general capabilities, and
2) sharp performance declines in previously learned tasks. To simultaneously
address both issues in a simple yet stable manner, we propose General Sample
Replay (GeRe), a framework that use usual pretraining texts for efficient
anti-forgetting. Beyond revisiting the most prevalent replay-based practices
under GeRe, we further leverage neural states to introduce a enhanced
activation states constrained optimization method using threshold-based margin
(TM) loss, which maintains activation state consistency during replay learning.
We are the first to validate that a small, fixed set of pre-collected general
replay samples is sufficient to resolve both concerns--retaining general
capabilities while promoting overall performance across sequential tasks.
Indeed, the former can inherently facilitate the latter. Through controlled
experiments, we systematically compare TM with different replay strategies
under the GeRe framework, including vanilla label fitting, logit imitation via
KL divergence and feature imitation via L1/L2 losses. Results demonstrate that
TM consistently improves performance and exhibits better robustness. Our work
paves the way for efficient replay of LLMs for the future. Our code and data
are available at https://github.com/Qznan/GeRe.

*Thibaut Thonet,Germán Kruszewski,Jos Rozen,Pierre Erbacher,Marc Dymetman*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper addresses the challenge of personalizing LLM conversational assistants with limited user preference data, introduces datasets (DnD and ELIP), and proposes a parameter-efficient approach, FaST, achieving best performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enhance personalization in LLM-powered assistants to cater to individual user preferences despite limited preference annotations per user.

Method: Introduction of DnD and ELIP datasets and benchmarking alignment techniques. Proposal of FaST, a parameter-efficient method leveraging high-level features.

Result: FaST outperformed other benchmarked alignment techniques and demonstrated the best overall performance.

Conclusion: FaST can effectively align LLMs with user preferences in scenarios with limited data, advancing practical personalization efforts.

Abstract: LLM-powered conversational assistants are often deployed in a
one-size-fits-all manner, which fails to accommodate individual user
preferences. Recently, LLM personalization -- tailoring models to align with
specific user preferences -- has gained increasing attention as a way to bridge
this gap. In this work, we specifically focus on a practical yet challenging
setting where only a small set of preference annotations can be collected per
user -- a problem we define as Personalized Preference Alignment with Limited
Data (PPALLI). To support research in this area, we introduce two datasets --
DnD and ELIP -- and benchmark a variety of alignment techniques on them. We
further propose FaST, a highly parameter-efficient approach that leverages
high-level features automatically discovered from the data, achieving the best
overall performance.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper investigates reasoning failures of modern language models in multi-hop question answering tasks using a novel error categorization framework and human annotations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation behind this work is to understand why reasoning models, despite their successes, tend to hallucinate extensively compared to general-purpose language models.

Method: The authors developed an error categorization framework analyzing failures across dimensions like hop diversity, coverage of relevant information, and cognitive inefficiency. They employed human annotations and automated metrics for evaluation.

Result: Their analysis reveals intricate error patterns, often overlooked by accuracy-centric tests, that provide deeper insights into the cognitive limitations of reasoning models.

Conclusion: The study offers actionable guidance for improving reasoning fidelity, transparency, and robustness in future language models.

Abstract: The emergence of reasoning models and their integration into practical AI
chat bots has led to breakthroughs in solving advanced math, deep search, and
extractive question answering problems that requires a complex and multi-step
thought process. Yet, a complete understanding of why these models hallucinate
more than general purpose language models is missing. In this investigative
study, we systematicallyexplore reasoning failures of contemporary language
models on multi-hop question answering tasks. We introduce a novel, nuanced
error categorization framework that examines failures across three critical
dimensions: the diversity and uniqueness of source documents involved ("hops"),
completeness in capturing relevant information ("coverage"), and cognitive
inefficiency ("overthinking"). Through rigorous hu-man annotation, supported by
complementary automated metrics, our exploration uncovers intricate error
patterns often hidden by accuracy-centric evaluations. This investigative
approach provides deeper insights into the cognitive limitations of current
models and offers actionable guidance toward enhancing reasoning fidelity,
transparency, and robustness in future language modeling efforts.

### [105] [Text2VR: Automated instruction Generation in Virtual Reality using Large language Models for Assembly Task](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03699)
*Subin Raj Peter*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a system using Large Language Models (LLMs) to automate the creation of VR training content from text input.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Creating VR-based training applications is challenging due to high demands for accuracy, time, and resources.

Method: The system uses an LLM module to extract task-relevant info from text and an intelligent module to convert it into VR animations with visual cues.

Result: The system facilitates the automated generation of instructional VR content, reducing development effort.

Conclusion: The approach makes VR training more scalable and efficiently adaptable to industrial shifts.

Abstract: Virtual Reality (VR) has emerged as a powerful tool for workforce training,
offering immersive, interactive, and risk-free environments that enhance skill
acquisition, decision-making, and confidence. Despite its advantages,
developing VR applications for training remains a significant challenge due to
the time, expertise, and resources required to create accurate and engaging
instructional content. To address these limitations, this paper proposes a
novel approach that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to automate the
generation of virtual instructions from textual input. The system comprises two
core components: an LLM module that extracts task-relevant information from the
text, and an intelligent module that transforms this information into animated
demonstrations and visual cues within a VR environment. The intelligent module
receives input from the LLM module and interprets the extracted information.
Based on this, an instruction generator creates training content using relevant
data from a database. The instruction generator generates the instruction by
changing the color of virtual objects and creating animations to illustrate
tasks. This approach enhances training effectiveness and reduces development
overhead, making VR-based training more scalable and adaptable to evolving
industrial needs.

### [106] [Outlier Detection Algorithm for Circle Fitting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03720)
*Ahmet Gökhan Poyraz*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This study introduces PCOD, a polar coordinate-based algorithm for detecting outliers to improve circle fitting in noisy datasets, particularly applied to industrial washers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Circle fitting accuracy diminishes in noisy datasets. Current techniques require effective outlier detection to address this problem.

Method: PCOD transforms points into polar coordinates, calculates local and global standard deviations, and identifies outliers by comparing mean values.

Result: PCOD demonstrated superior accuracy compared to ten circle fitting algorithms and five outlier detection methods, validated on industrial washer images.

Conclusion: PCOD is highly effective for detecting outliers, improving circle fitting, and advancing precision in industrial applications.

Abstract: Circle fitting methods are extensively utilized in various industries,
particularly in quality control processes and design applications. The
effectiveness of these algorithms can be significantly compromised when the
point sets to be predicted are noisy. To mitigate this issue, outlier detection
and removal algorithms are often applied before the circle fitting procedure.
This study introduces the Polar Coordinate-Based Outlier Detection (PCOD)
algorithm, which can be effectively employed in circle fitting applications. In
the proposed approach, the point set is first transformed into polar
coordinates, followed by the calculation of both local and global standard
deviations. Outliers are then identified by comparing local mean values with
the global standard deviation. The practicality and efficiency of the proposed
method are demonstrated by focusing on the high-precision diameter measurement
of industrial washer parts. Images from a machine vision system are processed
through preprocessing steps, including sub-pixel edge detection. The resulting
sub-pixel edge points are then cleaned using the proposed outlier detection and
removal algorithm, after which circle fitting is performed. A comparison is
made using ten different circle fitting algorithms and five distinct outlier
detection methods. The results indicate that the proposed method outperforms
the other approaches, delivering the best performance in terms of accuracy
within the dataset, thereby demonstrating its potential for enhancing circle
fitting applications in industrial environments.

*Ahmet Gokhan Poyraz,Ahmet Emir Dirik,Hakan Gurkan,Mehmet Kacmaz*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces two approaches to reduce measurement errors in camera-based systems. The methods significantly improve diameter measurement accuracy using reference parts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address the problem of measurement errors in camera systems, especially when measuring parts of varying diameters within the same setup.

Method: Two techniques are outlined: a conversion factor-based method relying on known references and a pixel-based method utilizing pixel diameter information from references.

Result: Experimental tests showed that original errors (13-114 micrometers) decreased drastically to 1-2 micrometers using these approaches.

Conclusion: The methods effectively enhance measurement accuracy, reducing errors significantly and demonstrating their reliability in industrial settings.

Abstract: In camera measurement systems, specialized equipment such as telecentric
lenses is often employed to measure parts with narrow tolerances. However,
despite the use of such equipment, measurement errors can occur due to
mechanical and software-related factors within the system. These errors are
particularly evident in applications where parts of different diameters are
measured using the same setup. This study proposes two innovative approaches to
enhance measurement accuracy using multiple known reference parts: a conversion
factor-based method and a pixel-based method. In the first approach, the
conversion factor is estimated from known references to calculate the diameter
(mm) of the unknown part. In the second approach, the diameter (mm) is directly
estimated using pixel-based diameter information from the references. The
experimental setup includes an industrial-grade camera and telecentric lenses.
Tests conducted on glass samples (1-12 mm) and metal workpieces (3-24 mm) show
that measurement errors, which originally ranged from 13-114 micrometers, were
reduced to 1-2 micrometers using the proposed methods. By utilizing only a few
known reference parts, the proposed approach enables high-accuracy measurement
of all parts within the camera's field of view. Additionally, this method
enhances the existing diameter measurement literature by significantly reducing
error rates and improving measurement reliability.

vision, ethology and neuroscience provide more multifaceted insights into
behavior which are particularly relevant to social neuroscience. Despite these

several challenges. Here we discuss the main steps involved and the tools
available for analyzing rodent social behavior, examining their advantages and
limitations. Additionally, we suggest practical solutions to address common

Result: The proposed framework, tested on the MER2024 benchmark, achieves substantial performance improvements in multimodal emotion recognition.

Conclusion: The integration of MLLM-derived reasoning with lightweight fusion networks provides a scalable and robust approach for emotion recognition, showing adaptability and effectiveness in addressing prior knowledge and imbalance challenges.

Abstract: This study investigates the integration of trustworthy prior reasoning
knowledge from MLLMs into multimodal emotion recognition. We employ Gemini to
generate fine-grained, modality-separable reasoning traces, which are injected
as priors during the fusion stage to enrich cross-modal interactions. To
mitigate the pronounced class-imbalance in multimodal emotion recognition, we
introduce Balanced Dual-Contrastive Learning, a loss formulation that jointly
balances inter-class and intra-class distributions. Applied to the MER2024

demonstrating that the reliability of MLLM-derived reasoning can be
synergistically combined with the domain adaptability of lightweight fusion

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper addresses the challenge of automated geometry labeling of integrated circuits (IC) from mechanical drawings using Large Multimodal Models (LMMs). Current LMMs struggle with geometric perception, and the proposed framework, LLM4-IC8K, achieves superior results by treating the problem systematically.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation stems from the absence of methods to automate the highly challenging task of IC footprint geometry labeling from mechanical drawings, which is crucial for PCB layout and currently relies on manual interpretation.

Method: The paper introduces LLM4-IC8K, a two-stage framework: training on synthetic IC footprint diagrams for geometric reasoning and fine-tuning with real-world datasheet drawings. It breaks down the geometry labeling into three sub-tasks—pin count, pin center coordinates, and pin dimensions—and uses a newly developed dataset, ICGeo8K.

Result: The proposed LLM4-IC8K framework achieves robust geometric understanding and significantly outperforms state-of-the-art LMMs in IC footprint geometry labeling tasks, as validated through extensive experiments.

Conclusion: The study provides a viable automated solution for IC footprint geometry labeling by addressing the current limitations of LMMs. The proposed framework shows that integrating synthetic and real-world training data can boost model accuracy and robustness.

Abstract: Printed-Circuit-board (PCB) footprint geometry labeling of integrated
circuits (IC) is essential in defining the physical interface between
components and the PCB layout, requiring exceptional visual perception
proficiency. However, due to the unstructured footprint drawing and abstract
diagram annotations, automated parsing and accurate footprint geometry modeling
remain highly challenging. Despite its importance, no methods currently exist
for automated package geometry labeling directly from IC mechanical drawings.
In this paper, we first investigate the visual perception performance of Large
Multimodal Models (LMMs) when solving IC footprint geometry understanding. Our
findings reveal that current LMMs severely suffer from inaccurate geometric
perception, which hinders their performance in solving the footprint geometry
labeling problem. To address these limitations, we propose LLM4-IC8K, a novel
framework that treats IC mechanical drawings as images and leverages LLMs for
structured geometric interpretation. To mimic the step-by-step reasoning
approach used by human engineers, LLM4-IC8K addresses three sub-tasks:
perceiving the number of pins, computing the center coordinates of each pin,
and estimating the dimensions of individual pins. We present a two-stage
framework that first trains LMMs on synthetically generated IC footprint
diagrams to learn fundamental geometric reasoning and then fine-tunes them on
real-world datasheet drawings to enhance robustness and accuracy in practical
scenarios. To support this, we introduce ICGeo8K, a multi-modal dataset with
8,608 labeled samples, including 4138 hand-crafted IC footprint samples and
4470 synthetically generated samples. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
our model outperforms state-of-the-art LMMs on the proposed benchmark.

Motivation: Non-uniform fixed-pattern noise in TIR images complicates robotic tasks like object detection, localization, and mapping in challenging conditions.

Method: The approach utilizes a fine-tuned stable diffusion model with a novel loss function combining latent-space, DWT, and DTCWT losses, enhanced by a cascaded refinement stage for high-fidelity denoising.

Result: Experimental results show the proposed method achieves superior performance over state-of-the-art denoising techniques and demonstrates robust zero-shot generalization to real-world TIR datasets.

Conclusion: This framework effectively improves TIR image quality for robotic applications, providing a scalable solution for diverse real-world deployment scenarios.

Abstract: Thermal infrared imaging exhibits considerable potentials for robotic
perception tasks, especially in environments with poor visibility or
challenging lighting conditions. However, TIR images typically suffer from
heavy non-uniform fixed-pattern noise, complicating tasks such as object
detection, localization, and mapping. To address this, we propose a
diffusion-based TIR image denoising framework leveraging latent-space
representations and wavelet-domain optimization. Utilizing a pretrained stable
diffusion model, our method fine-tunes the model via a novel loss function
combining latent-space and discrete wavelet transform (DWT) / dual-tree complex
wavelet transform (DTCWT) losses. Additionally, we implement a cascaded
refinement stage to enhance fine details, ensuring high-fidelity denoising
results. Experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate superior performance of
our approach compared to state-of-the-art denoising methods. Furthermore, our
method exhibits robust zero-shot generalization to diverse and challenging

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces MM-Misogyny, a multimodal model for detecting, categorizing, and explaining misogynistic content in memes. It uses a new dataset, WBMS, for evaluation and outperforms existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Memes, while entertaining, can propagate harmful ideologies like misogyny. Detecting such nuanced, multimodal content poses a significant challenge.

Method: MM-Misogyny processes image and text separately and integrates them via a cross-attention mechanism. Classification and explanation are enabled using a classifier and Large Language Model (LLM).

Result: The approach was evaluated using the novel WBMS dataset, categorizing misogyny into four domains: Kitchen, Leadership, Working, and Shopping. The results surpass existing detection methods.

Conclusion: MM-Misogyny effectively detects and explains misogynistic content in memes, providing superior results and a deeper understanding of misogynistic stereotypes.

Abstract: Memes are popular in the modern world and are distributed primarily for
entertainment. However, harmful ideologies such as misogyny can be propagated
through innocent-looking memes. The detection and understanding of why a meme
is misogynous is a research challenge due to its multimodal nature (image and
text) and its nuanced manifestations across different societal contexts. We
introduce a novel multimodal approach, \textit{namely},
\textit{\textbf{MM-Misogyny}} to detect, categorize, and explain misogynistic
content in memes. \textit{\textbf{MM-Misogyny}} processes text and image
modalities separately and unifies them into a multimodal context through a
cross-attention mechanism. The resulting multimodal context is then easily
processed for labeling, categorization, and explanation via a classifier and
Large Language Model (LLM). The evaluation of the proposed model is performed
on a newly curated dataset (\textit{\textbf{W}hat's \textbf{B}eneath
\textbf{M}isogynous \textbf{S}tereotyping (WBMS)}) created by collecting
misogynous memes from cyberspace and categorizing them into four categories,
\textit{namely}, Kitchen, Leadership, Working, and Shopping. The model not only
detects and classifies misogyny, but also provides a granular understanding of
how misogyny operates in domains of life. The results demonstrate the
superiority of our approach compared to existing methods. The code and dataset

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a method to ensure subject consistency in visual storytelling through image sequences, using existing text-to-image diffusion models, without additional training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address the challenge of maintaining subject consistency in sequences of images generated as visual stories, without the need for resource-intensive model fine-tuning or retraining.

Method: The authors propose a training-free approach leveraging pre-trained diffusion models. Key techniques include: 1) Masked cross-image attention sharing for aligning subject features across multiple images dynamically. 2) Regional Feature Harmonization for refining details to improve subject consistency.

Result: The proposed method generates images with consistent subjects in varied scenarios and preserves the creative potential of the underlying diffusion model.

Conclusion: The approach demonstrates that maintaining subject consistency and leveraging training-free methodologies can be achieved efficiently and creatively with pre-trained models, avoiding costly fine-tuning processes.

Abstract: Generating a coherent sequence of images that tells a visual story, using
text-to-image diffusion models, often faces the critical challenge of
maintaining subject consistency across all story scenes. Existing approaches,
which typically rely on fine-tuning or retraining models, are computationally
expensive, time-consuming, and often interfere with the model's pre-existing
capabilities. In this paper, we follow a training-free approach and propose an
efficient consistent-subject-generation method. This approach works seamlessly
with pre-trained diffusion models by introducing masked cross-image attention
sharing to dynamically align subject features across a batch of images, and
Regional Feature Harmonization to refine visually similar details for improved
subject consistency. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach
successfully generates visually consistent subjects across a variety of
scenarios while maintaining the creative abilities of the diffusion model.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel deep learning method using the DINOv2 architecture to enhance building mapping by integrating RF data with maps from open-source platforms, addressing limitations in conventional techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome cost, accessibility, and accuracy issues in traditional mapping methods and biases in open-source mapping platforms, which negatively affect neural networks.

Method: The authors developed a unified vision transformer-based framework that combines RF data with maps, leveraging spatial dependencies and structural priors for improved accuracy. They used a synthetic dataset for evaluation.

Result: The proposed method achieved a macro IoU of 65.3%, outperforming several baselines, including maps with errors (40.1%), RF-only methods (37.3%), and a non-AI fusion baseline (42.2%).

Conclusion: The study demonstrates that combining RF data with open-source maps through a vision transformer-based model significantly enhances building mapping accuracy, offering value to various smart city applications.

Abstract: Environment mapping is an important computing task for a wide range of smart
city applications, including autonomous navigation, wireless network operations
and extended reality environments. Conventional smart city mapping techniques,
such as satellite imagery, LiDAR scans, and manual annotations, often suffer
from limitations related to cost, accessibility and accuracy. Open-source
mapping platforms have been widely utilized in artificial intelligence
applications for environment mapping, serving as a source of ground truth.
However, human errors and the evolving nature of real-world environments
introduce biases that can negatively impact the performance of neural networks
trained on such data. In this paper, we present a deep learning-based approach
that integrates the DINOv2 architecture to improve building mapping by
combining maps from open-source platforms with radio frequency (RF) data
collected from multiple wireless user equipments and base stations. Our
approach leverages a vision transformer-based architecture to jointly process
both RF and map modalities within a unified framework, effectively capturing
spatial dependencies and structural priors for enhanced mapping accuracy. For
the evaluation purposes, we employ a synthetic dataset co-produced by Huawei.
We develop and train a model that leverages only aggregated path loss
information to tackle the mapping problem. We measure the results according to
three performance metrics which capture different qualities: (i) The Jaccard
index, also known as intersection over union (IoU), (ii) the Hausdorff
distance, and (iii) the Chamfer distance. Our design achieves a macro IoU of
65.3%, significantly surpassing (i) the erroneous maps baseline, which yields
40.1%, (ii) an RF-only method from the literature, which yields 37.3%, and
(iii) a non-AI fusion baseline that we designed which yields 42.2%.

*Jianqiao Chen,Tingting Zhu,Huishi Song,Nan Ma,Xiaodong Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces a vector quantization-based digital semantic communication system (VQ-DeepISC) with channel adaptation for efficient image transmission, leveraging Swin Transformer, distributional regularization, and IEEE 802.11a standards.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Digitizing semantic features while preserving continuity, context, and robustness in analog representations for practical applications.

Method: Utilizes deep joint source-channel coding (DJSCC) with a Swin Transformer for semantic feature extraction, vector quantization (VQ) for discrete latent space projection, attention-driven channel adaptation, KLD-based distributional regularization, exponential moving average (EMA), and QPSK-modulated digital communication.

Result: Experimental results show superior reconstruction fidelity compared to benchmark methods.

Conclusion: The proposed VQ-DeepISC system effectively digitizes semantic features by addressing challenges like codebook collapse and channel degradation, achieving robust and efficient transmission.

Abstract: Discretization of semantic features enables interoperability between semantic
and digital communication systems, showing significant potential for practical
applications. The fundamental difficulty in digitizing semantic features stems
from the need to preserve continuity and context in inherently analog
representations during their compression into discrete symbols while ensuring
robustness to channel degradation. In this paper, we propose a vector quantized
(VQ)-enabled digital semantic communication system with channel adaptive image
transmission, named VQ-DeepISC. Guided by deep joint source-channel coding
(DJSCC), we first design a Swin Transformer backbone for hierarchical semantic
feature extraction, followed by VQ modules projecting features into discrete
latent spaces. Consequently, it enables efficient index-based transmission
instead of raw feature transmission. To further optimize this process, we
develop an attention mechanism-driven channel adaptation module to dynamically
optimize index transmission. Secondly, to counteract codebook collapse during
training process, we impose a distributional regularization by minimizing the
Kullback-Leibler divergence (KLD) between codeword usage frequencies and a
uniform prior. Meanwhile, exponential moving average (EMA) is employed to
stabilize training and ensure balanced feature coverage during codebook
updates. Finally, digital communication is implemented using quadrature phase
shift keying (QPSK) modulation alongside orthogonal frequency division
multiplexing (OFDM), adhering to the IEEE 802.11a standard. Experimental
results demonstrate superior reconstruction fidelity of the proposed system
over benchmark methods.

*Wenwen Li,Chia-Yu Hsu,Maosheng Hu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper develops a deep learning model for object detection with weak supervision, using spatial principles for geospatial challenges, and applies it to detect Martian craters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address challenges in GeoAI, including limited training data and the lack of spatial principles in AI model design, thereby improving AI-geospatial integration.

Method: A spatially explicit deep learning model is developed, incorporating weak labels, Tobler's first law of geography, attention maps, and multistage training strategies.

Result: The model successfully detects impact craters on Mars and generalizes to both natural and human-made features on Earth and other planets.

Conclusion: This research enhances GeoAI's theoretical and methodological bases, showing potential for broader applications in geospatial studies.

Abstract: Recent interest in geospatial artificial intelligence (GeoAI) has fostered a
wide range of applications using artificial intelligence (AI), especially deep
learning, for geospatial problem solving. However, major challenges such as a
lack of training data and the neglect of spatial principles and spatial effects
in AI model design remain, significantly hindering the in-depth integration of
AI with geospatial research. This paper reports our work in developing a deep
learning model that enables object detection, particularly of natural features,
in a weakly supervised manner. Our work makes three contributions: First, we
present a method of object detection using only weak labels. This is achieved
by developing a spatially explicit model based on Tobler's first law of
geography. Second, we incorporate attention maps into the object detection
pipeline and develop a multistage training strategy to improve performance.
Third, we apply this model to detect impact craters on Mars, a task that
previously required extensive manual effort. The model generalizes to both
natural and human-made features on the surfaces of Earth and other planets.
This research advances the theoretical and methodological foundations of GeoAI.

*Riccardo Fiorista,Awad Abdelhalim,Anson F. Stewart,Gabriel L. Pincus,Ian Thistle,Jinhua Zhao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper explores the use of CCTV and computer vision techniques to estimate rail platform crowding in real-time, demonstrating promising results with deep learning models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to improve safety, operational efficiency, and customer experience in urban rail systems by addressing the challenge of real-time platform crowding estimations, which are difficult with existing methods like fare collection data.

Method: The study tested three advanced computer vision methods—object detection, crowd-level classification, and semantic segmentation—on a privacy-preserving dataset to analyze platform crowd levels.

Result: Results demonstrated that computer vision methods can accurately estimate real-time platform occupancy, indicating the utility of CCTV data for practical applications.

Conclusion: CCTV-based computer vision approaches can enhance transit operations by enabling more precise and real-time crowding forecasts, leading to better mitigation strategies and responses.

Abstract: Accurately estimating urban rail platform occupancy can enhance transit
agencies' ability to make informed operational decisions, thereby improving
safety, operational efficiency, and customer experience, particularly in the
context of crowding. However, sensing real-time crowding remains challenging
and often depends on indirect proxies such as automatic fare collection data or
staff observations. Recently, Closed-Circuit Television (CCTV) footage has
emerged as a promising data source with the potential to yield accurate,
real-time occupancy estimates. The presented study investigates this potential
by comparing three state-of-the-art computer vision approaches for extracting
crowd-related features from platform CCTV imagery: (a) object detection and
counting using YOLOv11, RT-DETRv2, and APGCC; (b) crowd-level classification
via a custom-trained Vision Transformer, Crowd-ViT; and (c) semantic
segmentation using DeepLabV3. Additionally, we present a novel, highly
efficient linear-optimization-based approach to extract counts from the
generated segmentation maps while accounting for image object depth and, thus,
for passenger dispersion along a platform. Tested on a privacy-preserving
dataset created in collaboration with the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit
Authority (WMATA) that encompasses more than 600 hours of video material, our
results demonstrate that computer vision approaches can provide substantive
value for crowd estimation. This work demonstrates that CCTV image data,
independent of other data sources available to a transit agency, can enable
more precise real-time crowding estimation and, eventually, timely operational
responses for platform crowding mitigation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces a modular deep-learning framework optimized for weed segmentation in drone videos, addressing image degradation like blur and noise, which enhances efficiency and accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to improve weed segmentation from drone videos in precision agriculture, dealing with frequent image quality issues like noise and blur.

Method: The framework dynamically routes images based on identified degradation (using Mean Absolute Deviation and Laplacian) to specialized vision transformer models optimized for clean, noisy, or blurry images.

Result: The proposed system outperforms existing CNN-based methods in segmentation quality and computational efficiency, validated for addressing degraded images.

Conclusion: The framework signifies a pivotal step forward in applying deep-learning techniques to agricultural imaging, offering practical benefits in segmentation accuracy and efficiency.

Abstract: This paper addresses the critical need for efficient and accurate weed
segmentation from drone video in precision agriculture. A quality-aware modular
deep-learning framework is proposed that addresses common image degradation by
analyzing quality conditions-such as blur and noise-and routing inputs through
specialized pre-processing and transformer models optimized for each
degradation type. The system first analyzes drone images for noise and blur
using Mean Absolute Deviation and the Laplacian. Data is then dynamically
routed to one of three vision transformer models: a baseline for clean images,
a modified transformer with Fisher Vector encoding for noise reduction, or
another with an unrolled Lucy-Robinson decoder to correct blur. This novel
routing strategy allows the system to outperform existing CNN-based methods in
both segmentation quality and computational efficiency, demonstrating a
significant advancement in deep-learning applications for agriculture.

*Bevin V,Ananthakrishnan P V,Ragesh KR,Sanjay M,Vineeth S,Bibin Wilson*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a pipeline for generating synthetic invoice documents and structured data using OCR, LLM, and inpainting techniques, aimed at enhancing machine learning models for document processing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large-scale, diverse datasets are essential for training machine learning models in invoice processing, but privacy constraints and annotation costs limit their availability.

Method: A pipeline extracts text and layout using OCR, replaces fields with LLM-generated synthetic content, and employs inpainting to preserve layout and font, creating realistic invoice images and aligned structured data.

Result: The proposed method produces synthetic, highly realistic invoice images and corresponding structured data that can scale private datasets for robust model training.

Conclusion: This synthetic data generation pipeline offers a scalable method to overcome privacy and annotation cost barriers, enabling better document intelligence model performance.

Abstract: The performance of machine learning models for automated invoice processing
is critically dependent on large-scale, diverse datasets. However, the
acquisition of such datasets is often constrained by privacy regulations and
the high cost of manual annotation. To address this, we present a novel
pipeline for generating high-fidelity, synthetic invoice documents and their
corresponding structured data. Our method first utilizes Optical Character
Recognition (OCR) to extract the text content and precise spatial layout from a
source invoice. Select data fields are then replaced with contextually
realistic, synthetic content generated by a large language model (LLM).
Finally, we employ an inpainting technique to erase the original text from the
image and render the new, synthetic text in its place, preserving the exact
layout and font characteristics. This process yields a pair of outputs: a
visually realistic new invoice image and a perfectly aligned structured data
file (JSON) reflecting the synthetic content. Our approach provides a scalable
and automated solution to amplify small, private datasets, enabling the
creation of large, varied corpora for training more robust and accurate
document intelligence models.

### [121] [Refine-IQA: Multi-Stage Reinforcement Finetuning for Perceptual Image Quality Assessment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03763)
*Ziheng Jia,Jiaying Qian,Zicheng Zhang,Zijian Chen,Xiongkuo Min*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a multi-stage Reinforcement Fine-Tuning (RFT) framework called Refine-IQA to enhance image quality assessment (IQA) capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current RFT IQA methods lack supervision for the 'think' process and fail to explicitly enhance low-level visual quality perception, limiting performance.

Method: Refine-IQA employs two stages: (1) perceptual enhancement using the Refine-Perception-20K dataset and multi-task reward functions, and (2) supervised quality scoring with probability difference rewards.

Result: Refine-IQA models show outstanding performance in visual quality perception and scoring tasks, while achieving robust quality interpretation capabilities.

Conclusion: Refine-IQA enhances both perception and scoring abilities in IQA models and establishes improved 'think' process supervision, pushing IQA performance limits.

Abstract: Reinforcement fine-tuning (RFT) is a proliferating paradigm for LMM training.
Analogous to high-level reasoning tasks, RFT is similarly applicable to
low-level vision domains, including image quality assessment (IQA). Existing
RFT-based IQA methods typically use rule-based output rewards to verify the
model's rollouts but provide no reward supervision for the "think" process,
leaving its correctness and efficacy uncontrolled. Furthermore, these methods
typically fine-tune directly on downstream IQA tasks without explicitly
enhancing the model's native low-level visual quality perception, which may
constrain its performance upper bound. In response to these gaps, we propose
the multi-stage RFT IQA framework (Refine-IQA). In Stage-1, we build the
Refine-Perception-20K dataset (with 12 main distortions, 20,907
locally-distorted images, and over 55K RFT samples) and design multi-task
reward functions to strengthen the model's visual quality perception. In
Stage-2, targeting the quality scoring task, we introduce a probability
difference reward involved strategy for "think" process supervision. The
resulting Refine-IQA Series Models achieve outstanding performance on both
perception and scoring tasks-and, notably, our paradigm activates a robust
"think" (quality interpreting) capability that also attains exceptional results
on the corresponding quality interpreting benchmark.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A deep-learning pipeline, 4D-PreNet, is introduced for cleaning and correcting 4D-STEM data during high-throughput analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enhance the reliability and efficiency of high-throughput data analysis in 4D-STEM, which suffers from noise, drift, and distortions.

Method: Utilized a deep-learning approach combining attention-enhanced U-Net and ResNet architectures trained on diverse simulated datasets.

Result: Achieved significant reductions in mean squared error and sub-pixel accuracy in center localization, outperforming traditional algorithms.

Conclusion: 4D-PreNet is a generalizable solution for reliable and efficient data preprocessing in automated 4D-STEM experimentation.

Abstract: Automated experimentation with real time data analysis in scanning
transmission electron microscopy (STEM) often require end-to-end framework. The
four-dimensional scanning transmission electron microscopy (4D-STEM) with
high-throughput data acquisition has been constrained by the critical
bottleneck results from data preprocessing. Pervasive noise, beam center drift,
and elliptical distortions during high-throughput acquisition inevitably
corrupt diffraction patterns, systematically biasing quantitative measurements.
Yet, conventional correction algorithms are often material-specific and fail to
provide a robust, generalizable solution. In this work, we present 4D-PreNet,
an end-to-end deep-learning pipeline that integrates attention-enhanced U-Net
and ResNet architectures to simultaneously perform denoising, center
correction, and elliptical distortion calibration. The network is trained on
large, simulated datasets encompassing a wide range of noise levels, drift
magnitudes, and distortion types, enabling it to generalize effectively to
experimental data acquired under varying conditions. Quantitative evaluations
demonstrate that our pipeline reduces mean squared error by up to 50% during
denoising and achieves sub-pixel center localization in the center detection
task, with average errors below 0.04 pixels. The outputs are bench-marked
against traditional algorithms, highlighting improvements in both noise
suppression and restoration of diffraction patterns, thereby facilitating
high-throughput, reliable 4D-STEM real-time analysis for automated
characterization.

*Yanyan Li,Ze Yang,Keisuke Tateno,Federico Tombari Liang Zhao,Gim Hee Lee*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes a 3D line representation, RiemanLine, optimizing camera localization and mapping, particularly in structured environments featuring parallel lines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 3D line representations overlook structural regularities such as parallel lines common in man-made environments, leading to inefficiencies in camera localization and mapping.

Method: RiemanLine decouples line landmarks into global vanishing directions optimized on unit spheres and scaled normal vectors on orthogonal subspaces, reducing parameters and embedding parallelism naturally. It is integrated into a factor graph framework.

Result: Experiments show improved pose estimation, better line reconstruction, reduced dimensionality of parameters, and enhanced convergence stability.

Conclusion: RiemanLine unifies representation of individual and parallel lines, enabling accurate structural regularity encoding and contributing significantly to camera localization and structural mapping in complex environments.

Abstract: Minimal parametrization of 3D lines plays a critical role in camera
localization and structural mapping. Existing representations in robotics and
computer vision predominantly handle independent lines, overlooking structural
regularities such as sets of parallel lines that are pervasive in man-made
environments. This paper introduces \textbf{RiemanLine}, a unified minimal
representation for 3D lines formulated on Riemannian manifolds that jointly
accommodates both individual lines and parallel-line groups. Our key idea is to
decouple each line landmark into global and local components: a shared
vanishing direction optimized on the unit sphere $\mathcal{S}^2$, and scaled
normal vectors constrained on orthogonal subspaces, enabling compact encoding
of structural regularities. For $n$ parallel lines, the proposed representation
reduces the parameter space from $4n$ (orthonormal form) to $2n+2$, naturally
embedding parallelism without explicit constraints. We further integrate this
parameterization into a factor graph framework, allowing global direction
alignment and local reprojection optimization within a unified manifold-based
bundle adjustment. Extensive experiments on ICL-NUIM, TartanAir, and synthetic
benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves significantly more accurate
pose estimation and line reconstruction, while reducing parameter
dimensionality and improving convergence stability.

TL;DR: The study introduces Human Preference Score v3 (HPSv3), a metric and dataset for evaluating text-to-image models, focusing on alignment with human perception.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing metrics for text-to-image generation evaluation are inadequate due to limited data coverage, poor feature extraction, and inefficient loss functions.

Method: The authors created the HPDv3 dataset with 1.08M text-image pairs and 1.17M annotated comparisons, trained a VLM-based model with an uncertainty-aware ranking loss, and proposed the Chain-of-Human-Preference (CoHP) method for iterative image refinement.

Result: HPSv3 proved to be a reliable metric for evaluating diverse images, while CoHP improved image generation quality using human-aligned selection without needing additional data.

Conclusion: HPSv3 and CoHP collectively enhance text-to-image evaluation and generation quality by effectively aligning them with human perception and preferences.

Abstract: Evaluating text-to-image generation models requires alignment with human
perception, yet existing human-centric metrics are constrained by limited data
coverage, suboptimal feature extraction, and inefficient loss functions. To
address these challenges, we introduce Human Preference Score v3 (HPSv3). (1)
We release HPDv3, the first wide-spectrum human preference dataset integrating
1.08M text-image pairs and 1.17M annotated pairwise comparisons from
state-of-the-art generative models and low to high-quality real-world images.
(2) We introduce a VLM-based preference model trained using an
uncertainty-aware ranking loss for fine-grained ranking. Besides, we propose
Chain-of-Human-Preference (CoHP), an iterative image refinement method that
enhances quality without extra data, using HPSv3 to select the best image at
each step. Extensive experiments demonstrate that HPSv3 serves as a robust
metric for wide-spectrum image evaluation, and CoHP offers an efficient and
human-aligned approach to improve image generation quality. The code and
dataset are available at the HPSv3 Homepage.

*Yihan Ma,Zeyang Yu,Rohitash Chandra*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a deep learning framework for automated crater detection using CNN, YOLO, and ResNet, applied to planetary surfaces like Mars and the Moon.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Impact craters serve as valuable markers for understanding planetary surface composition, geology, and impact events. Efficient automated detection aids planetary science research.

Method: The authors implemented a two-stage deep learning framework: Stage 1 uses classic CNN, YOLO, and ResNet-50 for crater identification; Stage 2 focuses on crater localization through YOLO-based detection using remote sensing data.

Result: YOLO delivers balanced performance in crater detection, while ResNet-50 is particularly effective for identifying larger craters with precision. Experiments were conducted on Mars and Moon datasets.

Conclusion: The developed framework demonstrates potential for enhanced automated crater analysis on planetary surfaces, with specific model strengths for differing crater sizes and detection criteria.

Abstract: Impact craters are among the most prominent geomorphological features on
planetary surfaces and are of substantial significance in planetary science
research. Their spatial distribution and morphological characteristics provide
critical information on planetary surface composition, geological history, and
impact processes. In recent years, the rapid advancement of deep learning
models has fostered significant interest in automated crater detection. In this
paper, we apply advancements in deep learning models for impact crater
detection and identification. We use novel models, including Convolutional
Neural Networks (CNNs) and variants such as YOLO and ResNet. We present a
framework that features a two-stage approach where the first stage features
crater identification using simple classic CNN, ResNet-50 and YOLO. In the
second stage, our framework employs YOLO-based detection for crater
localisation. Therefore, we detect and identify different types of craters and
present a summary report with remote sensing data for a selected region. We
consider selected regions for craters and identification from Mars and the Moon
based on remote sensing data. Our results indicate that YOLO demonstrates the
most balanced crater detection performance, while ResNet-50 excels in
identifying large craters with high precision.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces OmniDepth, a framework unifying monocular and stereo depth estimation through bidirectional latent representation alignment, achieving state-of-the-art depth estimation results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current depth estimation methods are either monocular, which lack geometric precision, or stereo, which struggle with ambiguities in reflective or textureless surfaces.

Method: OmniDepth employs a cross-attentive alignment mechanism to synchronize monocular cues with stereo hypotheses, resolving their respective limitations within a single network.

Result: OmniDepth achieves over 40% reduction in zero-shot generalization error on datasets like Middlebury and ETH3D and addresses failures on transparent and reflective surfaces.

Conclusion: The proposed OmniDepth framework offers robust 3D perception by harmonizing contextual priors from monocular methods with stereo geometric accuracy.

Abstract: Monocular and stereo depth estimation offer complementary strengths:
monocular methods capture rich contextual priors but lack geometric precision,
while stereo approaches leverage epipolar geometry yet struggle with
ambiguities such as reflective or textureless surfaces. Despite post-hoc
synergies, these paradigms remain largely disjoint in practice. We introduce
OmniDepth, a unified framework that bridges both through iterative
bidirectional alignment of their latent representations. At its core, a novel
cross-attentive alignment mechanism dynamically synchronizes monocular
contextual cues with stereo hypothesis representations during stereo reasoning.
This mutual alignment resolves stereo ambiguities (e.g., specular surfaces) by
injecting monocular structure priors while refining monocular depth with stereo
geometry within a single network. Extensive experiments demonstrate
state-of-the-art results: \textbf{OmniDepth reduces zero-shot generalization
error by $\!>\!40\%$ on Middlebury and ETH3D}, while addressing longstanding
failures on transparent and reflective surfaces. By harmonizing multi-view
geometry with monocular context, OmniDepth enables robust 3D perception that
transcends modality-specific limitations. Codes available at

*Shen Zhu,Yinzhu Jin,Ifrah Zawar,P. Thomas Fletcher*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces a diffusion model to generate point-based shape representations with point correspondences, addressing limitations in current deep learning approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most deep learning generative models for shapes focus on unordered point clouds and ignore point correspondences, which are essential in statistical shape models.

Method: The authors develop a diffusion generative model trained on shape representation data with correspondences, using datasets from OASIS-3 as input.

Result: The model effectively generates realistic point-based hippocampal shapes while maintaining point correspondences and supports tasks such as conditional generation and counterfactual analysis.

Conclusion: The proposed model demonstrates the ability to yield realistic shapes with preserved correspondences and has practical applications for understanding disease progression.

Abstract: We propose a diffusion model designed to generate point-based shape
representations with correspondences. Traditional statistical shape models have
considered point correspondences extensively, but current deep learning methods
do not take them into account, focusing on unordered point clouds instead.
Current deep generative models for point clouds do not address generating
shapes with point correspondences between generated shapes. This work aims to
formulate a diffusion model that is capable of generating realistic point-based
shape representations, which preserve point correspondences that are present in
the training data. Using shape representation data with correspondences derived
from Open Access Series of Imaging Studies 3 (OASIS-3), we demonstrate that our
correspondence-preserving model effectively generates point-based hippocampal
shape representations that are highly realistic compared to existing methods.
We further demonstrate the applications of our generative model by downstream
tasks, such as conditional generation of healthy and AD subjects and predicting
morphological changes of disease progression by counterfactual generation.

*Xiangcen Wu,Shaheer U. Saeed,Yipei Wang,Ester Bonmati Coll,Yipeng Hu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a policy network system to recommend optimal imaging modalities and sections for prostate cancer segmentation, outperforming standard methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Radiologists use mixed strategies (modalities and regions) for tumor detection, creating a need to improve machine learning models for segmentation accuracy and assist in challenging pathology scenarios.

Method: The method involves training a policy network to iteratively select optimal imaging sections and modalities, working with a pre-trained segmentation network to mimic radiologist strategies.

Result: The approach, tested on 1325 prostate cancer MRI images, improved segmentation accuracy and annotation efficiency, and developed an independent strategy diverging from existing radiologist guidelines.

Conclusion: The proposed system not only enhances segmentation performance but also fosters an interactive application by informing and assisting radiologists, with potential implications beyond existing guidelines.

Abstract: Radiologists often mix medical image reading strategies, including inspection
of individual modalities and local image regions, using information at
different locations from different images independently as well as
concurrently. In this paper, we propose a recommend system to assist machine
learning-based segmentation models, by suggesting appropriate image portions
along with the best modality, such that prostate cancer segmentation
performance can be maximised. Our approach trains a policy network that assists
tumor localisation, by recommending both the optimal imaging modality and the
specific sections of interest for review. During training, a pre-trained
segmentation network mimics radiologist inspection on individual or variable
combinations of these imaging modalities and their sections - selected by the
policy network. Taking the locally segmented regions as an input for the next
step, this dynamic decision making process iterates until all cancers are best
localised. We validate our method using a data set of 1325 labelled
multiparametric MRI images from prostate cancer patients, demonstrating its
potential to improve annotation efficiency and segmentation accuracy,
especially when challenging pathology is present. Experimental results show
that our approach can surpass standard segmentation networks. Perhaps more
interestingly, our trained agent independently developed its own optimal
strategy, which may or may not be consistent with current radiologist
guidelines such as PI-RADS. This observation also suggests a promising
interactive application, in which the proposed policy networks assist human
radiologists.

TL;DR: This paper introduces a method using noisy videos for efficient audio-synchronized visual animation, reducing manual curation effort by over 10 times.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the limitation of existing models that require expensive manual curation of high-quality, class-specific training videos, hindering their scalability to diverse audio-video classes.

Method: The paper proposes a two-stage training paradigm: automatic pretraining on large-scale noisy videos for diverse audio-video alignments and fine-tuning on small-scale, high-quality examples for precision. It also utilizes multi-feature conditioning, window attention, and pretrained generators and encoders, adding minimal trainable parameters.

Result: Their method significantly reduces the reliance on manual curation, generalizes to open-world audio-video classes, and introduces AVSync48, a benchmark three times more diverse than prior ones.

Conclusion: This approach efficiently scales audio-synchronized animation while reducing human effort and maintaining diverse class compatibility.

Abstract: Recent advances in audio-synchronized visual animation enable control of
video content using audios from specific classes. However, existing methods
rely heavily on expensive manual curation of high-quality, class-specific
training videos, posing challenges to scaling up to diverse audio-video classes
in the open world. In this work, we propose an efficient two-stage training
paradigm to scale up audio-synchronized visual animation using abundant but
noisy videos. In stage one, we automatically curate large-scale videos for
pretraining, allowing the model to learn diverse but imperfect audio-video
alignments. In stage two, we finetune the model on manually curated
high-quality examples, but only at a small scale, significantly reducing the
required human effort. We further enhance synchronization by allowing each
frame to access rich audio context via multi-feature conditioning and window
attention. To efficiently train the model, we leverage pretrained text-to-video
generator and audio encoders, introducing only 1.9\% additional trainable
parameters to learn audio-conditioning capability without compromising the
generator's prior knowledge. For evaluation, we introduce AVSync48, a benchmark
with videos from 48 classes, which is 3$\times$ more diverse than previous
benchmarks. Extensive experiments show that our method significantly reduces
reliance on manual curation by over 10$\times$, while generalizing to many open
classes.

*Mamadou Keita,Wassim Hamidouche,Hessen Bougueffa Eutamene,Abdelmalik Taleb-Ahmed,Abdenour Hadid*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces RAVID, a retrieval-augmented framework for detecting AI-generated images with enhanced robustness via fine-tuned visual models and visual-language fusion.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AI-generated image detection methods lack generalization and robustness due to reliance on low-level artifacts and model-specific features. The visual aspect of retrieval-augmented generation is underexplored.

Method: RAVID dynamically retrieves relevant images, uses a fine-tuned CLIP encoder with tailored prompts, and integrates a vision-language model to enrich detection inputs.

Result: RAVID achieves superior detection accuracy (93.85%) and robustness on the UniversalFakeDetect benchmark, outperforming prior methods under image degradation conditions.

Conclusion: RAVID improves AI-generated image detection in both accuracy and robustness, presenting a promising tool for enhanced generalization in visual detection tasks.

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce RAVID, the first framework for AI-generated image
detection that leverages visual retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). While RAG
methods have shown promise in mitigating factual inaccuracies in foundation
models, they have primarily focused on text, leaving visual knowledge
underexplored. Meanwhile, existing detection methods, which struggle with
generalization and robustness, often rely on low-level artifacts and
model-specific features, limiting their adaptability. To address this, RAVID
dynamically retrieves relevant images to enhance detection. Our approach
utilizes a fine-tuned CLIP image encoder, RAVID CLIP, enhanced with
category-related prompts to improve representation learning. We further
integrate a vision-language model (VLM) to fuse retrieved images with the
query, enriching the input and improving accuracy. Given a query image, RAVID
generates an embedding using RAVID CLIP, retrieves the most relevant images
from a database, and combines these with the query image to form an enriched
input for a VLM (e.g., Qwen-VL or Openflamingo). Experiments on the
UniversalFakeDetect benchmark, which covers 19 generative models, show that
RAVID achieves state-of-the-art performance with an average accuracy of 93.85%.
RAVID also outperforms traditional methods in terms of robustness, maintaining
high accuracy even under image degradations such as Gaussian blur and JPEG
compression. Specifically, RAVID achieves an average accuracy of 80.27% under
degradation conditions, compared to 63.44% for the state-of-the-art model
C2P-CLIP, demonstrating consistent improvements in both Gaussian blur and JPEG
compression scenarios. The code will be publicly available upon acceptance.

*Michele Andrade,Guilherme A. L. Silva,Valéria Santos,Gladston Moreira,Eduardo Luz*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper investigates the impact of large-scale pre-training datasets on estimating nutritional content from 2D food images using deep learning models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Nutritional estimation from images is vital for dietary monitoring but faces challenges like lighting variation, inferencing volume/mass, and reliance on proprietary pre-training datasets.

Method: Vision Transformer (ViT) models pre-trained on public datasets (ImageNet and COYO) were fine-tuned and compared to CNN models (InceptionV2, ResNet-50) and a model pre-trained on the proprietary JFT-300M dataset, using Nutrition5k data.

Result: Models pre-trained on JFT-300M outperformed those trained on public datasets. Notably, COYO underperformed relative to ImageNet, disproving the hypothesis about its superior dataset scale benefits.

Conclusion: Pre-training dataset characteristics, such as scale, domain relevance, and curation quality, are crucial for effective transfer learning in nutritional estimation based on 2D images.

Abstract: Estimating the nutritional content of food from images is a critical task
with significant implications for health and dietary monitoring. This is
challenging, especially when relying solely on 2D images, due to the
variability in food presentation, lighting, and the inherent difficulty in
inferring volume and mass without depth information. Furthermore,
reproducibility in this domain is hampered by the reliance of state-of-the-art
methods on proprietary datasets for large-scale pre-training. In this paper, we
investigate the impact of large-scale pre-training datasets on the performance
of deep learning models for nutritional estimation using only 2D images. We
fine-tune and evaluate Vision Transformer (ViT) models pre-trained on two large
public datasets, ImageNet and COYO, comparing their performance against
baseline CNN models (InceptionV2 and ResNet-50) and a state-of-the-art method
pre-trained on the proprietary JFT-300M dataset. We conduct extensive
experiments on the Nutrition5k dataset, a large-scale collection of real-world
food plates with high-precision nutritional annotations. Our evaluation using
Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAE%) reveals
that models pre-trained on JFT-300M significantly outperform those pre-trained
on public datasets. Unexpectedly, the model pre-trained on the massive COYO
dataset performs worse than the model pre-trained on ImageNet for this specific
regression task, refuting our initial hypothesis. Our analysis provides
quantitative evidence highlighting the critical role of pre-training dataset
characteristics, including scale, domain relevance, and curation quality, for
effective transfer learning in 2D nutritional estimation.

*Zheng Zhang,Tianzhuzi Tan,Guanchun Yin,Bo Zhang,Xiuzhuang Zhou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper presents JanusNet, a novel data augmentation framework for 3D medical image segmentation that improves performance by addressing anatomical inconsistency issues and focusing on hard-to-segment regions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improve weakly supervised 3D medical image segmentation by addressing challenges of anatomical continuity disruption and insufficient training in difficult regions due to limited training data and annotations.

Method: JanusNet employs a two-step framework: (1) Slice-Block Shuffle to shuffle same-index slice blocks while preserving anatomical context and (2) Confidence-Guided Displacement to amplify signals in hard-to-segment areas based on prediction reliability.

Result: JanusNet outperforms state-of-the-art methods with significant performance gains, achieving a 4% DSC improvement on the Synapse dataset using only 20% labeled data.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively enhances 3D medical image segmentation by globally preserving anatomical continuity and locally focusing on challenging regions, offering a plug-and-play solution for weakly supervised settings.

Abstract: Limited by the scarcity of training samples and annotations, weakly
supervised medical image segmentation often employs data augmentation to
increase data diversity, while randomly mixing volumetric blocks has
demonstrated strong performance. However, this approach disrupts the inherent
anatomical continuity of 3D medical images along orthogonal axes, leading to
severe structural inconsistencies and insufficient training in challenging
regions, such as small-sized organs, etc. To better comply with and utilize
human anatomical information, we propose JanusNet}, a data augmentation
framework for 3D medical data that globally models anatomical continuity while
locally focusing on hard-to-segment regions. Specifically, our Slice-Block
Shuffle step performs aligned shuffling of same-index slice blocks across
volumes along a random axis, while preserving the anatomical context on planes
perpendicular to the perturbation axis. Concurrently, the Confidence-Guided
Displacement step uses prediction reliability to replace blocks within each
slice, amplifying signals from difficult areas. This dual-stage, axis-aligned
framework is plug-and-play, requiring minimal code changes for most
teacher-student schemes. Extensive experiments on the Synapse and AMOS datasets
demonstrate that JanusNet significantly surpasses state-of-the-art methods,
achieving, for instance, a 4% DSC gain on the Synapse dataset with only 20%
labeled data.

TL;DR: This paper introduces CAD-Judge, a system for grading and validating CAD models generated from textual descriptions, addressing issues like slow rendering and reward hacking. It demonstrates improved performance and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to overcome challenges in Text-to-CAD systems, such as slow rendering, expensive deployment of Visual Language Models (VLMs), and reward hacking issues that compromise system integrity.

Method: It introduces CAD-Judge, which includes Compiler-as-a-Judge Modules (CJM) for fast reward signals and Compiler-as-a-Review Module (CRM) to verify and refine CAD models during testing. Additionally, an agentic CAD generation approach is proposed.

Result: Experiments show CAD-Judge achieves state-of-the-art performance in Text-to-CAD tasks while maintaining high efficiency on challenging CAD datasets.

Conclusion: CAD-Judge improves generative utility, robustness, and efficiency in Text-to-CAD workflows, making these systems more practical and reliable for industrial applications.

Abstract: Computer-Aided Design (CAD) models are widely used across industrial design,
simulation, and manufacturing processes. Text-to-CAD systems aim to generate
editable, general-purpose CAD models from textual descriptions, significantly
reducing the complexity and entry barrier associated with traditional CAD
workflows. However, rendering CAD models can be slow, and deploying VLMs to
review CAD models can be expensive and may introduce reward hacking that
degrades the systems. To address these challenges, we propose CAD-Judge, a
novel, verifiable reward system for efficient and effective CAD preference
grading and grammatical validation. We adopt the Compiler-as-a-Judge Module
(CJM) as a fast, direct reward signal, optimizing model alignment by maximizing
generative utility through prospect theory. To further improve the robustness
of Text-to-CAD in the testing phase, we introduce a simple yet effective
agentic CAD generation approach and adopt the Compiler-as-a-Review Module
(CRM), which efficiently verifies the generated CAD models, enabling the system
to refine them accordingly. Extensive experiments on challenging CAD datasets
demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance while
maintaining superior efficiency.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces $	ext{S}^2$Q-VDiT, a quantization framework for video diffusion models (V-DMs) to reduce memory usage and inference time while maintaining performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Video diffusion models are computationally expensive due to their large number of parameters, necessitating efficient methods like quantization to reduce costs.

Method: The authors use Hessian-aware Salient Data Selection for generating effective calibration datasets and propose Attention-guided Sparse Token Distillation to tackle learning challenges in quantization.

Result: $	ext{S}^2$Q-VDiT achieves lossless performance with $3.9	imes$ model compression and $1.3	imes$ inference acceleration under W4A6 quantization.

Conclusion: Post-training quantization via $	ext{S}^2$Q-VDiT demonstrates that video diffusion models can maintain performance while being computationally efficient through innovative calibration and token distillation strategies.

Abstract: Diffusion transformers have emerged as the mainstream paradigm for video
generation models. However, the use of up to billions of parameters incurs
significant computational costs. Quantization offers a promising solution by
reducing memory usage and accelerating inference. Nonetheless, we observe that
the joint modeling of spatial and temporal information in video diffusion
models (V-DMs) leads to extremely long token sequences, which introduces high
calibration variance and learning challenges. To address these issues, we
propose \textbf{$\text{S}^2$Q-VDiT}, a post-training quantization framework for
V-DMs that leverages \textbf{S}alient data and \textbf{S}parse token
distillation. During the calibration phase, we identify that quantization
performance is highly sensitive to the choice of calibration data. To mitigate
this, we introduce \textit{Hessian-aware Salient Data Selection}, which
constructs high-quality calibration datasets by considering both diffusion and
quantization characteristics unique to V-DMs. To tackle the learning
challenges, we further analyze the sparse attention patterns inherent in V-DMs.
Based on this observation, we propose \textit{Attention-guided Sparse Token
Distillation}, which exploits token-wise attention distributions to emphasize
tokens that are more influential to the model's output. Under W4A6
quantization, $\text{S}^2$Q-VDiT achieves lossless performance while delivering
$3.9\times$ model compression and $1.3\times$ inference acceleration. Code will

*Haiqi Yang,Jinzhe Li,Gengxu Li,Yi Chang,Yuan Wu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces an evaluation framework, ISEval, to assess the ability of Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) to detect erroneous inputs across various error types and modalities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the gap in understanding whether LMMs can actively detect and analyze erroneous inputs and improve their proactive verification ability.

Method: The research introduces ISEval, a framework with seven categories of flawed premises and three evaluation metrics, testing ten advanced LMMs for their input scrutiny capabilities.

Result: Findings reveal that most LMMs rely heavily on explicit prompts for detecting flawed premises, are better at logical fallacies detection than surface-level errors, and exhibit varied levels of modality trust.

Conclusion: The study highlights the deficiency in LMMs’ proactive detection of errors and the urgency for advancements in their verification processes, offering new insights for improvement in multimodal reasoning capabilities.

Abstract: Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) have witnessed remarkable growth, showcasing
formidable capabilities in handling intricate multimodal tasks with exceptional
performance. Recent research has underscored the inclination of large language
models to passively accept defective inputs, often resulting in futile
reasoning on invalid prompts. However, the same critical question of whether
LMMs can actively detect and scrutinize erroneous inputs still remains
unexplored. To address this gap, we introduce the Input Scrutiny Ability
Evaluation Framework (ISEval), which encompasses seven categories of flawed
premises and three evaluation metrics. Our extensive evaluation of ten advanced
LMMs has identified key findings. Most models struggle to actively detect
flawed textual premises without guidance, which reflects a strong reliance on
explicit prompts for premise error identification. Error type affects
performance: models excel at identifying logical fallacies but struggle with
surface-level linguistic errors and certain conditional flaws. Modality trust
varies-Gemini 2.5 pro and Claude Sonnet 4 balance visual and textual info,
while aya-vision-8b over-rely on text in conflicts. These insights underscore
the urgent need to enhance LMMs' proactive verification of input validity and
shed novel insights into mitigating the problem. The code is available at

*Junyi Wang,Jinjiang Li,Guodong Fan,Yakun Ju,Xiang Fang,Alex C. Kot*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes PDSSNet, a novel network for improving semantic segmentation in remote sensing images by addressing challenges of high intra-class variance and inter-class similarity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation lies in achieving complete and precise semantic segmentation of ground objects in remote sensing images, overcoming limitations of traditional and emerging methods in handling class representation and target structural information.

Method: PDSSNet features three modules: an Adaptive Prototype Extraction Module for accurate class semantics, a Semantic-Structure Coordination Module for integrating global semantics and local structure, and a Channel Similarity Adjustment Module for refining discriminative features.

Result: Experiments show that PDSSNet surpasses state-of-the-art methods in semantic segmentation of remote sensing images.

Conclusion: PDSSNet successfully achieves better segmentation by combining invariant class semantics and spatial structure, providing a more robust and complete representation.

Abstract: In the semantic segmentation of remote sensing images, acquiring complete
ground objects is critical for achieving precise analysis. However, this task
is severely hindered by two major challenges: high intra-class variance and
high inter-class similarity. Traditional methods often yield incomplete
segmentation results due to their inability to effectively unify class
representations and distinguish between similar features. Even emerging
class-guided approaches are limited by coarse class prototype representations
and a neglect of target structural information.
  Therefore, this paper proposes a Prototype-Driven Structure Synergy Network
(PDSSNet). The design of this network is based on a core concept, a complete
ground object is jointly defined by its invariant class semantics and its
variant spatial structure. To implement this, we have designed three key
modules. First, the Adaptive Prototype Extraction Module (APEM) ensures
semantic accuracy from the source by encoding the ground truth to extract
unbiased class prototypes. Subsequently, the designed Semantic-Structure
Coordination Module (SSCM) follows a hierarchical semantics-first,
structure-second principle. This involves first establishing a global semantic
cognition, then leveraging structural information to constrain and refine the
semantic representation, thereby ensuring the integrity of class information.
Finally, the Channel Similarity Adjustment Module (CSAM) employs a dynamic
step-size adjustment mechanism to focus on discriminative features between
classes.
  Extensive experiments demonstrate that PDSSNet outperforms state-of-the-art
methods. The source code is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper presents a novel framework, DCAR, to enhance image-text retrieval by introducing dual-prompt learning for fine-grained representation and matching.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the challenges in adapting pre-trained Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to downstream Image-Text Retrieval (ITR) tasks, particularly in fine-grained attributes and subcategory discrimination.

Method: The proposed method, named DCAR, utilizes dual-prompt learning that adjusts prompt vectors from both semantic and visual dimensions. It jointly optimizes attribute and class features by dynamically weighting attribute descriptions and introducing categorically-matching negative samples.

Result: The DCAR framework demonstrates state-of-the-art performance on a newly constructed Fine-class Described Retrieval Dataset (FDRD), which includes over 1,500 fine categories and 230,000 image-caption pairs.

Conclusion: The DCAR framework addresses the limitations of VLMs in ITR tasks by enhancing fine-grained representation learning and achieves superior results on a challenging dataset.

Abstract: Recently, prompt learning has demonstrated remarkable success in adapting
pre-trained Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to various downstream tasks such as
image classification. However, its application to the downstream Image-Text
Retrieval (ITR) task is more challenging. We find that the challenge lies in
discriminating both fine-grained attributes and similar subcategories of the
downstream data. To address this challenge, we propose Dual prompt Learning
with Joint Category-Attribute Reweighting (DCAR), a novel dual-prompt learning
framework to achieve precise image-text matching. The framework dynamically
adjusts prompt vectors from both semantic and visual dimensions to improve the
performance of CLIP on the downstream ITR task. Based on the prompt paradigm,
DCAR jointly optimizes attribute and class features to enhance fine-grained
representation learning. Specifically, (1) at the attribute level, it
dynamically updates the weights of attribute descriptions based on text-image
mutual information correlation; (2) at the category level, it introduces
negative samples from multiple perspectives with category-matching weighting to
learn subcategory distinctions. To validate our method, we construct the
Fine-class Described Retrieval Dataset (FDRD), which serves as a challenging
benchmark for ITR in downstream data domains. It covers over 1,500 downstream
fine categories and 230,000 image-caption pairs with detailed attribute
annotations. Extensive experiments on FDRD demonstrate that DCAR achieves
state-of-the-art performance over existing baselines.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper presents a novel framework that combines monocular camera imaging and 2D radar point cloud data for detecting pedestrians in Non-Line-of-Sight (NLoS) urban scenarios obstructed by parked vehicles, which enhances road safety.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the road safety issues caused by sudden pedestrian appearances from NLoS regions, such as between parked vehicles, which are unpredictable due to the dynamic nature of urban environments and existing limitations in current mmWave technology applications.

Method: The proposed method involves the integration of monocular camera images with 2D radar point cloud (PCD) data. It uses image segmentation to detect parked vehicles, estimates depth for spatial characteristics, and refines this information using radar data for precise pedestrian localization.

Result: The results show that the framework effectively enhances early detection of pedestrians in real-world urban road scenarios with NLoS blind spots, improving road safety outcomes.

Conclusion: The integration of monocular camera imaging and 2D radar PCD provides a promising solution for improving pedestrian detection and addressing the challenges of dynamic urban environments. This has potential to enhance practical NLoS spatial interpretations.

Abstract: The presence of Non-Line-of-Sight (NLoS) blind spots resulting from roadside
parking in urban environments poses a significant challenge to road safety,
particularly due to the sudden emergence of pedestrians. mmWave technology
leverages diffraction and reflection to observe NLoS regions, and recent
studies have demonstrated its potential for detecting obscured objects.
However, existing approaches predominantly rely on predefined spatial
information or assume simple wall reflections, thereby limiting their
generalizability and practical applicability. A particular challenge arises in
scenarios where pedestrians suddenly appear from between parked vehicles, as
these parked vehicles act as temporary spatial obstructions. Furthermore, since
parked vehicles are dynamic and may relocate over time, spatial information
obtained from satellite maps or other predefined sources may not accurately
reflect real-time road conditions, leading to erroneous sensor interpretations.
To address this limitation, we propose an NLoS pedestrian localization
framework that integrates monocular camera image with 2D radar point cloud
(PCD) data. The proposed method initially detects parked vehicles through image
segmentation, estimates depth to infer approximate spatial characteristics, and
subsequently refines this information using 2D radar PCD to achieve precise
spatial inference. Experimental evaluations conducted in real-world urban road
environments demonstrate that the proposed approach enhances early pedestrian
detection and contributes to improved road safety. Supplementary materials are

Abstract: This study presents CORE-ReID V2, an enhanced framework building upon
CORE-ReID. The new framework extends its predecessor by addressing Unsupervised
Domain Adaptation (UDA) challenges in Person ReID and Vehicle ReID, with
further applicability to Object ReID. During pre-training, CycleGAN is employed
to synthesize diverse data, bridging image characteristic gaps across different
domains. In the fine-tuning, an advanced ensemble fusion mechanism, consisting
of the Efficient Channel Attention Block (ECAB) and the Simplified Efficient
Channel Attention Block (SECAB), enhances both local and global feature
representations while reducing ambiguity in pseudo-labels for target samples.
Experimental results on widely used UDA Person ReID and Vehicle ReID datasets
demonstrate that the proposed framework outperforms state-of-the-art methods,
achieving top performance in Mean Average Precision (mAP) and Rank-k Accuracy
(Top-1, Top-5, Top-10). Moreover, the framework supports lightweight backbones
such as ResNet18 and ResNet34, ensuring both scalability and efficiency. Our

TL;DR: The paper introduces SPJFNet, a dark image restoration model that leverages self-mined priors, wavelet and Fourier domain operations to improve efficiency and performance, surpassing current methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current dark image restoration techniques face inefficiency due to reliance on external priors, redundant enhancement processes, and inefficient frequency domain processing methods.

Method: The authors developed SPJFNet, which incorporates a Self-Mining Guidance Module (SMGM) for endogenous priors, and a Dual-Frequency Guidance Framework (DFGF) that uses wavelet decomposition for high-frequency enhancement and Fourier-based low-frequency restoration.

Result: SPJFNet demonstrates state-of-the-art performance with improved efficiency, significantly reducing model complexity and computational costs across multiple benchmarks.

Conclusion: SPJFNet effectively addresses key challenges in dark image restoration by combining self-mining priors and frequency-decoupled processing, achieving both higher efficiency and superior outcomes.

Abstract: Current dark image restoration methods suffer from severe efficiency
bottlenecks, primarily stemming from: (1) computational burden and error
correction costs associated with reliance on external priors (manual or
cross-modal); (2) redundant operations in complex multi-stage enhancement
pipelines; and (3) indiscriminate processing across frequency components in
frequency-domain methods, leading to excessive global computational demands. To
address these challenges, we propose an Efficient Self-Mining Prior-Guided
Joint Frequency Enhancement Network (SPJFNet). Specifically, we first introduce
a Self-Mining Guidance Module (SMGM) that generates lightweight endogenous
guidance directly from the network, eliminating dependence on external priors
and thereby bypassing error correction overhead while improving inference
speed. Second, through meticulous analysis of different frequency domain
characteristics, we reconstruct and compress multi-level operation chains into
a single efficient operation via lossless wavelet decomposition and joint
Fourier-based advantageous frequency enhancement, significantly reducing
parameters. Building upon this foundation, we propose a Dual-Frequency Guidance
Framework (DFGF) that strategically deploys specialized high/low frequency
branches (wavelet-domain high-frequency enhancement and Fourier-domain
low-frequency restoration), decoupling frequency processing to substantially
reduce computational complexity. Rigorous evaluation across multiple benchmarks
demonstrates that SPJFNet not only surpasses state-of-the-art performance but
also achieves significant efficiency improvements, substantially reducing model
complexity and computational overhead. Code is available at

Method: The authors created VisualTrans, a benchmark built from first-person manipulation videos. This included task selection, automated metadata annotation using multimodal models, structured question generation, and human verification for quality assurance.

Result: The benchmark contains 12 manipulation tasks, 6 subtask types, and 472 diverse question-answer pairs. Evaluations of state-of-the-art models revealed strengths in static spatial reasoning and weaknesses in dynamic temporal modeling and causal reasoning.

Conclusion: VisualTrans highlights key areas for improvement in current AI systems, particularly in dynamic reasoning, and offers resources for advancing VTR research and development.

Abstract: Visual transformation reasoning (VTR) is a vital cognitive capability that
empowers intelligent agents to understand dynamic scenes, model causal
relationships, and predict future states, and thereby guiding actions and
laying the foundation for advanced intelligent systems. However, existing
benchmarks suffer from a sim-to-real gap, limited task complexity, and
incomplete reasoning coverage, limiting their practical use in real-world
scenarios. To address these limitations, we introduce VisualTrans, the first
comprehensive benchmark specifically designed for VTR in real-world
human-object interaction scenarios. VisualTrans encompasses 12 semantically
diverse manipulation tasks and systematically evaluates three essential
reasoning dimensions - spatial, procedural, and quantitative - through 6
well-defined subtask types. The benchmark features 472 high-quality
question-answer pairs in various formats, including multiple-choice, open-ended
counting, and target enumeration. We introduce a scalable data construction
pipeline built upon first-person manipulation videos, which integrates task
selection, image pair extraction, automated metadata annotation with large
multimodal models, and structured question generation. Human verification
ensures the final benchmark is both high-quality and interpretable. Evaluations
of various state-of-the-art vision-language models show strong performance in
static spatial tasks. However, they reveal notable shortcomings in dynamic,
multi-step reasoning scenarios, particularly in areas like intermediate state
recognition and transformation sequence planning. These findings highlight
fundamental weaknesses in temporal modeling and causal reasoning, providing
clear directions for future research aimed at developing more capable and
generalizable VTR systems. The dataset and code are available at

*Qiangguo Jin,Hui Cui,Junbo Wang,Changming Sun,Yimiao He,Ping Xuan,Linlin Wang,Cong Cong,Leyi Wei,Ran Su*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces IPA-CP, an SSL method tailored for tumor segmentation in CT scans, enhancing robustness and performance using adaptive augmentation and iterative pseudo-labeling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address limitations of SSL in segmenting tumors in CT scans, particularly small or numerous ones, and explore the potential of data augmentation.

Method: Proposed IPA-CP framework integrates two-way uncertainty-based adaptive augmentation and an iterative pseudo-label transition strategy.

Result: Experiments on both in-house and public datasets show IPA-CP outperforms existing SSL techniques for medical image segmentation.

Conclusion: IPA-CP is effective and robust for tumor segmentation in CT scans, addressing key challenges in SSL and demonstrating superiority in performance compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: Semi-supervised learning (SSL) has attracted considerable attention in
medical image processing. The latest SSL methods use a combination of
consistency regularization and pseudo-labeling to achieve remarkable success.
However, most existing SSL studies focus on segmenting large organs, neglecting
the challenging scenarios where there are numerous tumors or tumors of small
volume. Furthermore, the extensive capabilities of data augmentation
strategies, particularly in the context of both labeled and unlabeled data,
have yet to be thoroughly investigated. To tackle these challenges, we
introduce a straightforward yet effective approach, termed iterative
pseudo-labeling based adaptive copy-paste supervision (IPA-CP), for tumor
segmentation in CT scans. IPA-CP incorporates a two-way uncertainty based
adaptive augmentation mechanism, aiming to inject tumor uncertainties present
in the mean teacher architecture into adaptive augmentation. Additionally,
IPA-CP employs an iterative pseudo-label transition strategy to generate more
robust and informative pseudo labels for the unlabeled samples. Extensive
experiments on both in-house and public datasets show that our framework
outperforms state-of-the-art SSL methods in medical image segmentation.
Ablation study results demonstrate the effectiveness of our technical
contributions.

### [144] [Motion is the Choreographer: Learning Latent Pose Dynamics for Seamless Sign Language Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04049)
*Jiayi He,Xu Wang,Shengeng Tang,Yaxiong Wang,Lechao Cheng,Dan Guo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper presents a method for sign language video generation via a two-phase framework to tackle data requirements and generalization issues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address challenges in sign language video generation, including the need for extensive signer-specific datasets and lack of generalization.

Method: The proposed method involves a decoupled two-phase framework: first, building a multimodal motion lexicon with identity-agnostic representations; second, synthesizing signer-personalized videos using neural rendering.

Result: The method achieves temporally coherent motion trajectories and photorealistic videos of diverse signers, surpassing prior methods constrained to signer-specific datasets.

Conclusion: Disentangling motion semantics from identity proves advantageous for achieving high-quality synthesis and enabling signer personalization flexibility.

Abstract: Sign language video generation requires producing natural signing motions
with realistic appearances under precise semantic control, yet faces two
critical challenges: excessive signer-specific data requirements and poor
generalization. We propose a new paradigm for sign language video generation
that decouples motion semantics from signer identity through a two-phase
synthesis framework. First, we construct a signer-independent multimodal motion
lexicon, where each gloss is stored as identity-agnostic pose, gesture, and 3D
mesh sequences, requiring only one recording per sign. This compact
representation enables our second key innovation: a discrete-to-continuous
motion synthesis stage that transforms retrieved gloss sequences into
temporally coherent motion trajectories, followed by identity-aware neural
rendering to produce photorealistic videos of arbitrary signers. Unlike prior
work constrained by signer-specific datasets, our method treats motion as a
first-class citizen: the learned latent pose dynamics serve as a portable
"choreography layer" that can be visually realized through different human
appearances. Extensive experiments demonstrate that disentangling motion from
identity is not just viable but advantageous - enabling both high-quality
synthesis and unprecedented flexibility in signer personalization.

*Jitong Liao,Yulu Gao,Shaofei Huang,Jialin Gao,Jie Lei,Ronghua Liang,Si Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Dense Object Matching and Refinement (DOMR) framework for matching objects across egocentric and exocentric views, achieving state-of-the-art performance on benchmark tests.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenge of cross-view object correspondence between egocentric and exocentric visual perspectives for enhanced understanding.

Method: Proposes the Dense Object Matcher (DOM) module to leverage positional and semantic inter-object relationships combined with a mask refinement head for improved matching accuracy.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art mean IoU of 49.7% (Ego→Exo) and 55.2% (Exo→Ego), surpassing prior methods by 5.8% and 4.3%.

Conclusion: The DOMR framework is effective in establishing dense object correspondences, improving performance for cross-view visual understanding systems.

Abstract: Cross-view object correspondence involves matching objects between egocentric
(first-person) and exocentric (third-person) views. It is a critical yet
challenging task for visual understanding. In this work, we propose the Dense
Object Matching and Refinement (DOMR) framework to establish dense object
correspondences across views. The framework centers around the Dense Object
Matcher (DOM) module, which jointly models multiple objects. Unlike methods
that directly match individual object masks to image features, DOM leverages
both positional and semantic relationships among objects to find
correspondences. DOM integrates a proposal generation module with a dense
matching module that jointly encodes visual, spatial, and semantic cues,
explicitly constructing inter-object relationships to achieve dense matching
among objects. Furthermore, we combine DOM with a mask refinement head designed
to improve the completeness and accuracy of the predicted masks, forming the
complete DOMR framework. Extensive evaluations on the Ego-Exo4D benchmark
demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance with a mean
IoU of 49.7% on Ego$\to$Exo and 55.2% on Exo$\to$Ego. These results outperform
those of previous methods by 5.8% and 4.3%, respectively, validating the
effectiveness of our integrated approach for cross-view understanding.

*Chen Luo,Qiyu Jin,Taofeng Xie,Xuemei Wang,Huayu Wang,Congcong Liu,Liming Tang,Guoqing Chen,Zhuo-Xu Cui,Dong Liang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes GPI-WT, a white-box Transformer framework for k-space interpolation in accelerated MRI, offering improved accuracy and interpretability compared to existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address the limitations of existing k-space interpolation methods, which overlook global dependencies and lack interpretability, by leveraging the strengths of Transformers for capturing long-range dependencies.

Method: The authors introduce a structured low-rank (SLR) model for global predictability that incorporates learnable parameters through a subgradient-based optimization algorithm, unfolded into a cascaded network to design the GPI-WT framework.

Result: Experimental results show that GPI-WT outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in terms of k-space interpolation accuracy and offers better interpretability.

Conclusion: The proposed GPI-WT framework effectively combines Transformers' ability to capture global dependencies with a structured low-rank model for enhanced accuracy and reliability in MRI data reconstruction.

Abstract: Interpolating missing data in k-space is essential for accelerating imaging.
However, existing methods, including convolutional neural network-based deep
learning, primarily exploit local predictability while overlooking the inherent
global dependencies in k-space. Recently, Transformers have demonstrated
remarkable success in natural language processing and image analysis due to
their ability to capture long-range dependencies. This inspires the use of
Transformers for k-space interpolation to better exploit its global structure.
However, their lack of interpretability raises concerns regarding the
reliability of interpolated data. To address this limitation, we propose
GPI-WT, a white-box Transformer framework based on Globally Predictable
Interpolation (GPI) for k-space. Specifically, we formulate GPI from the
perspective of annihilation as a novel k-space structured low-rank (SLR) model.
The global annihilation filters in the SLR model are treated as learnable
parameters, and the subgradients of the SLR model naturally induce a learnable
attention mechanism. By unfolding the subgradient-based optimization algorithm
of SLR into a cascaded network, we construct the first white-box Transformer
specifically designed for accelerated MRI. Experimental results demonstrate
that the proposed method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art approaches
in k-space interpolation accuracy while providing superior interpretability.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes Uni-DocDiff, a scalable and unified model for document restoration leveraging diffusion methods. It outperforms task-specific models and adapts well to new tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the complexity and inefficiency in traditional document restoration methods that treat tasks independently, and address the limitations of existing unified approaches in scalability and task synergy.

Method: Uni-DocDiff introduces learnable task prompts for scalability, a Prior Pool mechanism combining global and local features, and a Prior Fusion Module for adaptive feature selection based on tasks.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate Uni-DocDiff's superior or comparable performance to expert models for specific tasks and its ability to seamlessly adapt to new tasks.

Conclusion: Uni-DocDiff represents a robust unified architecture for document restoration, effectively balancing performance across diverse tasks and scalability.

Abstract: Removing various degradations from damaged documents greatly benefits
digitization, downstream document analysis, and readability. Previous methods
often treat each restoration task independently with dedicated models, leading
to a cumbersome and highly complex document processing system. Although recent
studies attempt to unify multiple tasks, they often suffer from limited
scalability due to handcrafted prompts and heavy preprocessing, and fail to
fully exploit inter-task synergy within a shared architecture. To address the
aforementioned challenges, we propose Uni-DocDiff, a Unified and highly
scalable Document restoration model based on Diffusion. Uni-DocDiff develops a
learnable task prompt design, ensuring exceptional scalability across diverse
tasks. To further enhance its multi-task capabilities and address potential
task interference, we devise a novel \textbf{Prior \textbf{P}ool}, a simple yet
comprehensive mechanism that combines both local high-frequency features and
global low-frequency features. Additionally, we design the \textbf{Prior
\textbf{F}usion \textbf{M}odule (PFM)}, which enables the model to adaptively
select the most relevant prior information for each specific task. Extensive
experiments show that the versatile Uni-DocDiff achieves performance comparable
or even superior performance compared with task-specific expert models, and
simultaneously holds the task scalability for seamless adaptation to new tasks.

### [148] [TCSAFormer: Efficient Vision Transformer with Token Compression and Sparse Attention for Medical Image Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04058)
*Zunhui Xia,Hongxing Li,Libin Lan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces TCSAFormer, a transformer-based medical image segmentation network that addresses efficiency and accuracy limitations in current approaches using compressed attention and a dual-branch feed-forward network. It achieves superior performance with lower computational overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome computational inefficiencies and limitations in capturing local contextual information and multiscale features in transformer-based medical image segmentation methods.

Method: TCSAFormer employs a Compressed Attention module to reduce computational complexity and enhance token relationships, alongside a Dual-Branch Feed-Forward Network for improved representation of local and multiscale features.

Result: Experimental results on three medical image datasets (ISIC-2018, CVC-ClinicDB, Synapse) show TCSAFormer surpasses current state-of-the-art methods in performance while maintaining lower computational costs.

Conclusion: TCSAFormer provides an effective solution for medical image segmentation challenges, achieving a balance between high accuracy and computational efficiency.

Abstract: In recent years, transformer-based methods have achieved remarkable progress
in medical image segmentation due to their superior ability to capture
long-range dependencies. However, these methods typically suffer from two major
limitations. First, their computational complexity scales quadratically with
the input sequences. Second, the feed-forward network (FFN) modules in vanilla
Transformers typically rely on fully connected layers, which limits models'
ability to capture local contextual information and multiscale features
critical for precise semantic segmentation. To address these issues, we propose
an efficient medical image segmentation network, named TCSAFormer. The proposed
TCSAFormer adopts two key ideas. First, it incorporates a Compressed Attention
(CA) module, which combines token compression and pixel-level sparse attention
to dynamically focus on the most relevant key-value pairs for each query. This
is achieved by pruning globally irrelevant tokens and merging redundant ones,
significantly reducing computational complexity while enhancing the model's
ability to capture relationships between tokens. Second, it introduces a
Dual-Branch Feed-Forward Network (DBFFN) module as a replacement for the
standard FFN to capture local contextual features and multiscale information,
thereby strengthening the model's feature representation capability. We conduct
extensive experiments on three publicly available medical image segmentation
datasets: ISIC-2018, CVC-ClinicDB, and Synapse, to evaluate the segmentation
performance of TCSAFormer. Experimental results demonstrate that TCSAFormer
achieves superior performance compared to existing state-of-the-art (SOTA)
methods, while maintaining lower computational overhead, thus achieving an
optimal trade-off between efficiency and accuracy.

*Zhaochen Liu,Kaiwen Gao,Shuyi Liang,Bin Xiao,Limeng Qiao,Lin Ma,Tingting Jiang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces O-Bench, a VQA benchmark for testing occlusion perception in multimodal large language models (MLLMs), and evaluates their limitations against human performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation behind this paper is to address the unexplored ability of MLLMs in occlusion perception, which is a critical challenge in integrating visual recognition and reasoning.

Method: The authors developed O-Bench, a benchmark consisting of 1,365 images and 4,588 question-answer pairs, using a novel layered synthesis approach and a semi-automatic annotation workflow.

Result: Evaluation of 22 MLLMs showed a significant gap in performance compared to humans, with specific failure patterns such as conservative bias, fragile gestalt predictions, and struggles in quantitative tasks.

Conclusion: O-Bench serves as an important tool for evaluating occlusion perception in MLLMs and could inspire future advancements in developing better visual intelligence models.

Abstract: Occlusion perception, a critical foundation for human-level spatial
understanding, embodies the challenge of integrating visual recognition and
reasoning. Though multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have demonstrated
remarkable capabilities, their performance on occlusion perception remains
under-explored. To address this gap, we introduce O-Bench, the first visual
question answering (VQA) benchmark specifically designed for occlusion
perception. Based on SA-1B, we construct 1,365 images featuring semantically
coherent occlusion scenarios through a novel layered synthesis approach. Upon
this foundation, we annotate 4,588 question-answer pairs in total across five
tailored tasks, employing a reliable, semi-automatic workflow. Our extensive
evaluation of 22 representative MLLMs against the human baseline reveals a
significant performance gap between current MLLMs and humans, which, we find,
cannot be sufficiently bridged by model scaling or thinking process. We further
identify three typical failure patterns, including an overly conservative bias,
a fragile gestalt prediction, and a struggle with quantitative tasks. We
believe O-Bench can not only provide a vital evaluation tool for occlusion
perception, but also inspire the development of MLLMs for better visual
intelligence. Our benchmark will be made publicly available upon paper
publication.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces TNet, a convolution-based decoding network for remote sensing segmentation, addressing limitations in existing architectures by enhancing cross-resolution context integration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing segmentation networks focus on intra-scale relationships and neglect global contextual dependencies across resolutions, limiting segmentation performance for remote sensing data.

Method: TNet is a convolutional decoder network utilizing progressive fusion of low-resolution and high-resolution features, enabling stage-wise blending of global and local information.

Result: Using a ResNet-18 encoder, TNet achieved competitive mIoU scores of 85.35% on ISPRS Vaihingen, 87.05% on ISPRS Potsdam, and 52.19% on LoveDA datasets, while being computationally efficient.

Conclusion: TNet successfully integrates multi-resolution global and local features, achieving competitive segmentation metrics and efficiency, validating its innovation in the field.

Abstract: In remote sensing, most segmentation networks adopt the UNet architecture,
often incorporating modules such as Transformers or Mamba to enhance
global-local feature interactions within decoder stages. However, these
enhancements typically focus on intra-scale relationships and neglect the
global contextual dependencies across multiple resolutions. To address this
limitation, we introduce the Terrace Convolutional Decoder Network (TNet), a
simple yet effective architecture that leverages only convolution and addition
operations to progressively integrate low-resolution features (rich in global
context) into higher-resolution features (rich in local details) across
decoding stages. This progressive fusion enables the model to learn
spatially-aware convolutional kernels that naturally blend global and local
information in a stage-wise manner. We implement TNet with a ResNet-18 encoder
(TNet-R) and evaluate it on three benchmark datasets. TNet-R achieves
competitive performance with a mean Intersection-over-Union (mIoU) of 85.35\%
on ISPRS Vaihingen, 87.05\% on ISPRS Potsdam, and 52.19\% on LoveDA, while
maintaining high computational efficiency. Code is publicly available.

TL;DR: The paper introduces 3D Super Resolution (3DSR), a method utilizing 2D diffusion-based super-resolution models for 3D scenes, ensuring visual and structural consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of explicit 3D consistency in prior methods like image upsampling or video super-resolution.

Method: 3DSR explicitly incorporates a 3D Gaussian-splatting-based scene representation combined with off-the-shelf 2D diffusion-based models.

Result: 3DSR achieves visually compelling, high-resolution results while maintaining structural coherence in 3D reconstructions, evaluated on MipNeRF360 and LLFF datasets.

Conclusion: 3DSR ensures enhanced visual quality and spatial coherence without extra fine-tuning, marking an improvement in 3D reconstruction frameworks.

Abstract: We propose 3D Super Resolution (3DSR), a novel 3D Gaussian-splatting-based
super-resolution framework that leverages off-the-shelf diffusion-based 2D
super-resolution models. 3DSR encourages 3D consistency across views via the
use of an explicit 3D Gaussian-splatting-based scene representation. This makes
the proposed 3DSR different from prior work, such as image upsampling or the
use of video super-resolution, which either don't consider 3D consistency or
aim to incorporate 3D consistency implicitly. Notably, our method enhances
visual quality without additional fine-tuning, ensuring spatial coherence
within the reconstructed scene. We evaluate 3DSR on MipNeRF360 and LLFF data,
demonstrating that it produces high-resolution results that are visually
compelling, while maintaining structural consistency in 3D reconstructions.
Code will be released.

*Zexu Huang,Min Xu,Stuart Perry*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes DET-GS, a method to improve sparse-view novel view synthesis by introducing depth and edge-aware regularization techniques for 3D Gaussian Splatting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Sparse-view novel view synthesis suffers from poor geometric reconstruction and edge preservation due to ineffective regularization methods.

Method: The authors introduce depth-aware regularization combining hierarchical depth supervision and semantic-edge-based guidance. Additionally, they utilize edge-preserving RGB-guided Total Variation loss.

Result: DET-GS enhances geometric fidelity and texture preservation, outperforming existing techniques in sparse-view synthesis benchmarks.

Conclusion: DET-GS improves reconstruction quality by addressing depth estimation noise and preserving scene boundaries, pushing forward the state-of-the-art in novel view synthesis.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) represents a significant advancement in the
field of efficient and high-fidelity novel view synthesis. Despite recent
progress, achieving accurate geometric reconstruction under sparse-view
conditions remains a fundamental challenge. Existing methods often rely on
non-local depth regularization, which fails to capture fine-grained structures
and is highly sensitive to depth estimation noise. Furthermore, traditional
smoothing methods neglect semantic boundaries and indiscriminately degrade
essential edges and textures, consequently limiting the overall quality of
reconstruction. In this work, we propose DET-GS, a unified depth and edge-aware
regularization framework for 3D Gaussian Splatting. DET-GS introduces a
hierarchical geometric depth supervision framework that adaptively enforces
multi-level geometric consistency, significantly enhancing structural fidelity
and robustness against depth estimation noise. To preserve scene boundaries, we
design an edge-aware depth regularization guided by semantic masks derived from
Canny edge detection. Furthermore, we introduce an RGB-guided edge-preserving
Total Variation loss that selectively smooths homogeneous regions while
rigorously retaining high-frequency details and textures. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that DET-GS achieves substantial improvements in both geometric
accuracy and visual fidelity, outperforming state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods on
sparse-view novel view synthesis benchmarks.

TL;DR: NEARL-CLIP enhances interactions between image and text data for medical analysis, utilizing advanced mechanisms for efficient parameter usage.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of limited annotated medical datasets and the domain gap in applying VLMs to medical imaging, aiming to unlock their full potential.

Method: Introducing USEformer for dynamic cross-modality queries and OCA for orthogonal regularization to decouple novel and incremental knowledge.

Result: NEARL-CLIP enhances medical domain interaction, improves modality synergy, and operates efficiently with only 1.46M learnable parameters.

Conclusion: NEARL-CLIP successfully bridges the modality gap, leveraging cross-modal interaction to enhance medical image analysis with parameter-efficient methods.

Abstract: Computer-aided medical image analysis is crucial for disease diagnosis and
treatment planning, yet limited annotated datasets restrict medical-specific
model development. While vision-language models (VLMs) like CLIP offer strong
generalization capabilities, their direct application to medical imaging
analysis is impeded by a significant domain gap. Existing approaches to bridge
this gap, including prompt learning and one-way modality interaction
techniques, typically focus on introducing domain knowledge to a single
modality. Although this may offer performance gains, it often causes modality
misalignment, thereby failing to unlock the full potential of VLMs. In this
paper, we propose \textbf{NEARL-CLIP} (i\underline{N}teracted qu\underline{E}ry
\underline{A}daptation with o\underline{R}thogona\underline{L} Regularization),
a novel cross-modality interaction VLM-based framework that contains two
contributions: (1) Unified Synergy Embedding Transformer (USEformer), which
dynamically generates cross-modality queries to promote interaction between
modalities, thus fostering the mutual enrichment and enhancement of multi-modal
medical domain knowledge; (2) Orthogonal Cross-Attention Adapter (OCA). OCA
introduces an orthogonality technique to decouple the new knowledge from
USEformer into two distinct components: the truly novel information and the
incremental knowledge. By isolating the learning process from the interference
of incremental knowledge, OCA enables a more focused acquisition of new
information, thereby further facilitating modality interaction and unleashing
the capability of VLMs. Notably, NEARL-CLIP achieves these two contributions in
a parameter-efficient style, which only introduces \textbf{1.46M} learnable
parameters.

Motivation: Understanding computer vision model performance using human perception studies is insightful but logistically challenging.

Method: An augmented reality-based platform is developed to facilitate user studies, featuring cross-platform data collection, customizable protocols, and AR streaming.

Result: ARCADE successfully evaluates CV models (e.g., depth and lighting estimation), eliciting perceptual judgments and demonstrating usability across diverse settings.

Conclusion: ARCADE proves effective and flexible for conducting scalable human perception studies in CV research using AR technology.

Abstract: Human perception studies can provide complementary insights to qualitative
evaluation for understanding computer vision (CV) model performance. However,
conducting human perception studies remains a non-trivial task, it often
requires complex, end-to-end system setups that are time-consuming and
difficult to scale. In this paper, we explore the unique opportunity presented
by augmented reality (AR) for helping CV researchers to conduct perceptual
studies. We design ARCADE, an evaluation platform that allows researchers to
easily leverage AR's rich context and interactivity for human-centered CV
evaluation. Specifically, ARCADE supports cross-platform AR data collection,
custom experiment protocols via pluggable model inference, and AR streaming for
user studies. We demonstrate ARCADE using two types of CV models, depth and
lighting estimation and show that AR tasks can be effectively used to elicit
human perceptual judgments of model quality. We also evaluate the systems
usability and performance across different deployment and study settings,
highlighting its flexibility and effectiveness as a human-centered evaluation
platform.

### [155] [Unlocking the Potential of MLLMs in Referring Expression Segmentation via a Light-weight Mask Decode](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04107)
*Jingchao Wang,Zhijian Wu,Dingjiang Huang,Yefeng Zheng,Hong Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes MLLMSeg, a framework for Reference Expression Segmentation (RES), leveraging multimodal large language models without requiring resource-intensive external visual encoders or sacrificing accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to improve RES by addressing the limitations of existing methods, which either rely on parameter-heavy models like SAM or lightweight alternatives that compromise accuracy.

Method: MLLMSeg avoids additional visual encoders and uses a detail-enhanced and semantic-consistent feature fusion module (DSFF) to integrate visual and semantic features. A lightweight 34M mask decoder then performs precise mask predictions.

Result: Extensive experiments show that MLLMSeg outperforms both SAM-based and SAM-free methods in RES tasks, achieving a balance between high performance and low computational cost.

Conclusion: MLLMSeg demonstrates an efficient and effective approach to RES, combining detailed visual and semantic features, and reducing overhead while maintaining high accuracy.

Abstract: Reference Expression Segmentation (RES) aims to segment image regions
specified by referring expressions and has become popular with the rise of
multimodal large models (MLLMs). While MLLMs excel in semantic understanding,
their token-generation paradigm struggles with pixel-level dense prediction.
Existing RES methods either couple MLLMs with the parameter-heavy Segment
Anything Model (SAM) with 632M network parameters or adopt SAM-free lightweight
pipelines that sacrifice accuracy. To address the trade-off between performance
and cost, we specifically propose MLLMSeg, a novel framework that fully
exploits the inherent visual detail features encoded in the MLLM vision encoder
without introducing an extra visual encoder. Besides, we propose a
detail-enhanced and semantic-consistent feature fusion module (DSFF) that fully
integrates the detail-related visual feature with the semantic-related feature
output by the large language model (LLM) of MLLM. Finally, we establish a
light-weight mask decoder with only 34M network parameters that optimally
leverages detailed spatial features from the visual encoder and semantic
features from the LLM to achieve precise mask prediction. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our method generally surpasses both SAM-based and SAM-free
competitors, striking a better balance between performance and cost. Code is

TL;DR: The paper introduces CLIPVehicle, a unified framework addressing the challenge of joint vehicle detection and re-identification (Re-ID) in surveillance videos using vision-language models (VLMs).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for finding vehicles in surveillance videos are resource-intensive, requiring separate stages of detection and re-identification. The study seeks to overcome this inefficiency by combining these processes into a single, efficient system.

Method: The authors propose CLIPVehicle, featuring a dual-granularity semantic-region alignment module for leveraging VLMs and a multi-level learning strategy that captures global, instance, and feature-level identity representation.

Result: CLIPVehicle outperformed existing state-of-the-art methods for vehicle re-identification and person search tasks, demonstrating its effectiveness and efficiency.

Conclusion: CLIPVehicle offers an effective end-to-end solution for vehicle search by addressing the conflicting objectives of detection and re-identification, supported by both real-world and synthetic benchmark datasets.

Abstract: Vehicles, as one of the most common and significant objects in the real
world, the researches on which using computer vision technologies have made
remarkable progress, such as vehicle detection, vehicle re-identification, etc.
To search an interested vehicle from the surveillance videos, existing methods
first pre-detect and store all vehicle patches, and then apply vehicle
re-identification models, which is resource-intensive and not very practical.
In this work, we aim to achieve the joint detection and re-identification for
vehicle search. However, the conflicting objectives between detection that
focuses on shared vehicle commonness and re-identification that focuses on
individual vehicle uniqueness make it challenging for a model to learn in an
end-to-end system. For this problem, we propose a new unified framework, namely
CLIPVehicle, which contains a dual-granularity semantic-region alignment module
to leverage the VLMs (Vision-Language Models) for vehicle discrimination
modeling, and a multi-level vehicle identification learning strategy to learn
the identity representation from global, instance and feature levels. We also
construct a new benchmark, including a real-world dataset CityFlowVS, and two
synthetic datasets SynVS-Day and SynVS-All, for vehicle search. Extensive
experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms the
state-of-the-art methods of both vehicle Re-ID and person search tasks.

*Maximilian Ulmer,Wout Boerdijk,Rudolph Triebel,Maximilian Durner*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces OC-DiT, a novel diffusion-based model for zero-shot instance segmentation using a conditional latent framework.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to enhance zero-shot instance segmentation by leveraging object-centric diffusion modeling to disentangle object instances effectively.

Method: The approach involves a conditional latent diffusion framework with two variants: a coarse model for initial proposals and a refinement model for parallel refinement of object masks, trained on a large synthetic dataset.

Result: OC-DiT achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple real-world benchmarks without retraining, showcasing the utility of diffusion models in segmentation.

Conclusion: Diffusion models, as demonstrated by OC-DiT, hold great promise for improving instance segmentation tasks, even under zero-shot conditions.

Abstract: This paper presents OC-DiT, a novel class of diffusion models designed for
object-centric prediction, and applies it to zero-shot instance segmentation.
We propose a conditional latent diffusion framework that generates instance
masks by conditioning the generative process on object templates and image
features within the diffusion model's latent space. This allows our model to
effectively disentangle object instances through the diffusion process, which
is guided by visual object descriptors and localized image cues. Specifically,
we introduce two model variants: a coarse model for generating initial object
instance proposals, and a refinement model that refines all proposals in
parallel. We train these models on a newly created, large-scale synthetic
dataset comprising thousands of high-quality object meshes. Remarkably, our
model achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple challenging real-world
benchmarks, without requiring any retraining on target data. Through
comprehensive ablation studies, we demonstrate the potential of diffusion
models for instance segmentation tasks.

*Zheng Cheng,Wenri Wang,Guangyong Chen,Yakun Ju,Yihua Cheng,Zhisong Liu,Yanda Meng,Jintao Song*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This study questions the necessity of multi-scale feature extraction for underwater image enhancement, introducing a simpler single-scale model, SSD-Net, that achieves comparable or superior results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve underwater image quality by addressing challenges like color distortion and blurring, while reducing complexity compared to mainstream multi-scale methods.

Method: Proposed the Single-Scale Decomposition Network (SSD-Net), which uses an asymmetrical decomposition mechanism combining CNN and Transformer for local and global feature extraction.

Result: SSD-Net demonstrated that single-scale feature extraction can meet or outperform multi-scale methods in underwater image enhancement.

Conclusion: The study concludes that multi-scale methods are not essential for high-quality underwater image enhancement, and that SSD-Net offers a simpler, effective alternative.

Abstract: Underwater image enhancement (UIE) techniques aim to improve visual quality
of images captured in aquatic environments by addressing degradation issues
caused by light absorption and scattering effects, including color distortion,
blurring, and low contrast. Current mainstream solutions predominantly employ
multi-scale feature extraction (MSFE) mechanisms to enhance reconstruction
quality through multi-resolution feature fusion. However, our extensive
experiments demonstrate that high-quality image reconstruction does not
necessarily rely on multi-scale feature fusion. Contrary to popular belief, our
experiments show that single-scale feature extraction alone can match or
surpass the performance of multi-scale methods, significantly reducing
complexity. To comprehensively explore single-scale feature potential in
underwater enhancement, we propose an innovative Single-Scale Decomposition
Network (SSD-Net). This architecture introduces an asymmetrical decomposition
mechanism that disentangles input image into clean layer along with degradation
layer. The former contains scene-intrinsic information and the latter encodes
medium-induced interference. It uniquely combines CNN's local feature
extraction capabilities with Transformer's global modeling strengths through
two core modules: 1) Parallel Feature Decomposition Block (PFDB), implementing
dual-branch feature space decoupling via efficient attention operations and
adaptive sparse transformer; 2) Bidirectional Feature Communication Block
(BFCB), enabling cross-layer residual interactions for complementary feature
mining and fusion. This synergistic design preserves feature decomposition
independence while establishing dynamic cross-layer information pathways,
effectively enhancing degradation decoupling capacity.

TL;DR: This paper introduces a method enhancing deep learning models for litter detection using privileged information and customized object detection techniques, ensuring computational efficiency and high accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the rising issue of global litter pollution by improving automated detection tools that face challenges such as identifying small and obscured litter effectively.

Method: The authors use privileged information and binary mask encoding to refine object detection models, applying these methods on multiple datasets for litter detection without increasing model complexity.

Result: The methodology shows improved detection accuracy across multiple datasets including SODA, BDW, and UAVVaste, with effective generalization to diverse contexts.

Conclusion: The proposed approach provides a scalable, practical solution for litter detection, balancing computational efficiency and accuracy for real-world applications.

Abstract: As litter pollution continues to rise globally, developing automated tools
capable of detecting litter effectively remains a significant challenge. This
study presents a novel approach that combines, for the first time, privileged
information with deep learning object detection to improve litter detection
while maintaining model efficiency. We evaluate our method across five widely
used object detection models, addressing challenges such as detecting small
litter and objects partially obscured by grass or stones. In addition to this,
a key contribution of our work can also be attributed to formulating a means of
encoding bounding box information as a binary mask, which can be fed to the
detection model to refine detection guidance. Through experiments on both
within-dataset evaluation on the renowned SODA dataset and cross-dataset
evaluation on the BDW and UAVVaste litter detection datasets, we demonstrate
consistent performance improvements across all models. Our approach not only
bolsters detection accuracy within the training sets but also generalises well
to other litter detection contexts. Crucially, these improvements are achieved
without increasing model complexity or adding extra layers, ensuring
computational efficiency and scalability. Our results suggest that this
methodology offers a practical solution for litter detection, balancing
accuracy and efficiency in real-world applications.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces the SVC 2025 Multimodal Deception Detection Challenge to address the issue of domain shifts in deception detection models, especially in multimodal settings involving audio, video, and text.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is based on the need for effective deception detection systems that perform consistently across diverse domains due to the limitations of current single-domain models.

Method: A benchmark challenge requiring participants to develop models that generalize well across heterogeneous datasets using multimodal input sources such as audio, video, and text.

Result: The challenge saw participation from 21 teams who submitted their results, fostering innovation in cross-domain deception detection.

Conclusion: The initiative promotes the creation of robust and explainable multimodal deception detection systems, aiming to improve real-world applications like fraud prevention and security screening.

Abstract: Deception detection is a critical task in real-world applications such as
security screening, fraud prevention, and credibility assessment. While deep
learning methods have shown promise in surpassing human-level performance,
their effectiveness often depends on the availability of high-quality and
diverse deception samples. Existing research predominantly focuses on
single-domain scenarios, overlooking the significant performance degradation
caused by domain shifts. To address this gap, we present the SVC 2025
Multimodal Deception Detection Challenge, a new benchmark designed to evaluate
cross-domain generalization in audio-visual deception detection. Participants
are required to develop models that not only perform well within individual
domains but also generalize across multiple heterogeneous datasets. By
leveraging multimodal data, including audio, video, and text, this challenge
encourages the design of models capable of capturing subtle and implicit
deceptive cues. Through this benchmark, we aim to foster the development of
more adaptable, explainable, and practically deployable deception detection
systems, advancing the broader field of multimodal learning. By the conclusion
of the workshop competition, a total of 21 teams had submitted their final
results. https://sites.google.com/view/svc-mm25 for more information.

*Zhaohong Huang,Yuxin Zhang,Mingbao Lin,Taojian Zhou,Guorong Cai,Rongrong Ji*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces DS^2Net, a novel deep supervision network for medical image segmentation that integrates low-level detail and high-level semantic feature supervision, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods in medical image segmentation supervise either detailed or semantic features in isolation, ignoring their vital interplay.

Method: The paper proposes DS^2Net, which uses complementary multi-view deep supervision via a Detail Enhance Module and Semantic Enhance Module. Additionally, it introduces an uncertainty-based supervision loss.

Result: Experiments across six benchmarks show that DS^2Net consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in medical image analysis.

Conclusion: DS^2Net successfully bridges the gap between detailed and semantic feature supervision, offering a robust solution for medical image segmentation.

Abstract: Deep Supervision Networks exhibit significant efficacy for the medical
imaging community. Nevertheless, existing work merely supervises either the
coarse-grained semantic features or fine-grained detailed features in
isolation, which compromises the fact that these two types of features hold
vital relationships in medical image analysis. We advocate the powers of
complementary feature supervision for medical image segmentation, by proposing
a Detail-Semantic Deep Supervision Network (DS$^2$Net). DS$^2$Net navigates
both low-level detailed and high-level semantic feature supervision through
Detail Enhance Module (DEM) and Semantic Enhance Module (SEM). DEM and SEM
respectively harness low-level and high-level feature maps to create detail and
semantic masks for enhancing feature supervision. This is a novel shift from
single-view deep supervision to multi-view deep supervision. DS$^2$Net is also
equipped with a novel uncertainty-based supervision loss that adaptively
assigns the supervision strength of features within distinct scales based on
their uncertainty, thus circumventing the sub-optimal heuristic design that
typifies previous works. Through extensive experiments on six benchmarks
captured under either colonoscopy, ultrasound and microscope, we demonstrate
that DS$^2$Net consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods for medical
image analysis.

*Hongyu Guo,Kuan Zhu,Xiangzhao Hao,Haiyun Guo,Ming Tang,Jinqiao Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces UniFGVC, a training-free framework for few-shot fine-grained visual classification, reformulating it as a multimodal retrieval task. It leverages multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to create descriptive visual captions, achieving superior performance compared to previous approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing few-shot FGVC methods suffer from issues like overfitting and limited generalization due to fine-tuning pre-trained visual language models. The paper aims to address these challenges using a training-free, universal framework.

Method: The approach involves generating descriptive captions with CDV-Captioner using chain-of-thought prompting, converting images into image-description pairs, and constructing multimodal category templates. Off-the-shelf vision and text encoders are then used for retrieval in joint space.

Result: Extensive experiments across 12 FGVC benchmarks show UniFGVC consistently outperforms previous CLIP-based few-shot methods and even fully-supervised MLLMs-based approaches.

Conclusion: UniFGVC provides a robust, generalizable, training-free method for few-shot FGVC, leveraging multimodal retrieval to deliver reliable and adaptable performance across various benchmarks.

Abstract: Few-shot fine-grained visual classification (FGVC) aims to leverage limited
data to enable models to discriminate subtly distinct categories. Recent works
mostly finetuned the pre-trained visual language models to achieve performance
gain, yet suffering from overfitting and weak generalization. To deal with
this, we introduce UniFGVC, a universal training-free framework that
reformulates few-shot FGVC as multimodal retrieval. First, we propose the
Category-Discriminative Visual Captioner (CDV-Captioner) to exploit the
open-world knowledge of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to generate a
structured text description that captures the fine-grained attribute features
distinguishing closely related classes. CDV-Captioner uses chain-of-thought
prompting and visually similar reference images to reduce hallucination and
enhance discrimination of generated captions. Using it we can convert each
image into an image-description pair, enabling more comprehensive feature
representation, and construct the multimodal category templates using few-shot
samples for the subsequent retrieval pipeline. Then, off-the-shelf vision and
text encoders embed query and template pairs, and FGVC is accomplished by
retrieving the nearest template in the joint space. UniFGVC ensures broad
compatibility with diverse MLLMs and encoders, offering reliable generalization
and adaptability across few-shot FGVC scenarios. Extensive experiments on 12
FGVC benchmarks demonstrate its consistent superiority over prior few-shot
CLIP-based methods and even several fully-supervised MLLMs-based approaches.

*Lijuan Liu,Wenfa Li,Dongbo Zhang,Shuo Wang,Shaohui Jiao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: IDC-Net is a framework for generating RGB-D video sequences with precise camera control, focusing on geometric consistency and alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To achieve simultaneous, geometry-aligned generation of RGB images and depth maps, addressing spatial misalignment issues in scene synthesis.

Method: IDC-Net uses a unified geometry-aware diffusion model and introduces a geometry-aware transformer block; it is trained on a dataset with aligned RGB videos, depth maps, and accurate camera poses.

Result: The method improves visual quality and geometric consistency over existing techniques, enabling direct use in 3D reconstruction tasks without additional post-processing.

Conclusion: IDC-Net presents a new standard for unified RGB-D video generation and camera trajectory control, benefiting both researchers and practical applications.

Abstract: We present IDC-Net (Image-Depth Consistency Network), a novel framework
designed to generate RGB-D video sequences under explicit camera trajectory
control. Unlike approaches that treat RGB and depth generation separately,
IDC-Net jointly synthesizes both RGB images and corresponding depth maps within
a unified geometry-aware diffusion model. The joint learning framework
strengthens spatial and geometric alignment across frames, enabling more
precise camera control in the generated sequences. To support the training of
this camera-conditioned model and ensure high geometric fidelity, we construct
a camera-image-depth consistent dataset with metric-aligned RGB videos, depth
maps, and accurate camera poses, which provides precise geometric supervision
with notably improved inter-frame geometric consistency. Moreover, we introduce
a geometry-aware transformer block that enables fine-grained camera control,
enhancing control over the generated sequences. Extensive experiments show that
IDC-Net achieves improvements over state-of-the-art approaches in both visual
quality and geometric consistency of generated scene sequences. Notably, the
generated RGB-D sequences can be directly feed for downstream 3D Scene
reconstruction tasks without extra post-processing steps, showcasing the
practical benefits of our joint learning framework. See more at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes ICM-Fusion, a framework combining meta-learning and in-context adaptation to resolve issues in fusing multi-task LoRA models, improving generalization especially in long-tailed and few-shot scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses critical limitations in existing LoRA fusion methods, particularly inter-weight conflicts, catastrophic domain forgetting, and inefficiency in generalizing during few-shot scenarios with long-tailed distributions.

Method: The authors introduce ICM-Fusion, a task vector arithmetic approach that dynamically balances conflicting weights through learned manifold projections, alongside Fusion VAE (F-VAE) for reconstructing the fused LoRA models.

Result: ICM-Fusion demonstrates efficacy across diverse visual and linguistic tasks, showing substantial reductions in multi-tasking loss and task enhancement, even in few-shot conditions.

Conclusion: ICM-Fusion proves to be a robust solution for multi-task adaptation in pre-trained LoRA models, showcasing substantial advancements over existing fusion methods.

Abstract: Enabling multi-task adaptation in pre-trained Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA)
models is crucial for enhancing their generalization capabilities. Most
existing pre-trained LoRA fusion methods decompose weight matrices, sharing
similar parameters while merging divergent ones. However, this paradigm
inevitably induces inter-weight conflicts and leads to catastrophic domain
forgetting. While incremental learning enables adaptation to multiple tasks, it
struggles to achieve generalization in few-shot scenarios. Consequently, when
the weight data follows a long-tailed distribution, it can lead to forgetting
in the fused weights. To address this issue, we propose In-Context Meta LoRA
Fusion (ICM-Fusion), a novel framework that synergizes meta-learning with
in-context adaptation. The key innovation lies in our task vector arithmetic,
which dynamically balances conflicting optimization directions across domains
through learned manifold projections. ICM-Fusion obtains the optimal task
vector orientation for the fused model in the latent space by adjusting the
orientation of the task vectors. Subsequently, the fused LoRA is reconstructed
by a self-designed Fusion VAE (F-VAE) to realize multi-task LoRA generation. We
have conducted extensive experiments on visual and linguistic tasks, and the
experimental results demonstrate that ICM-Fusion can be adapted to a wide range
of architectural models and applied to various tasks. Compared to the current
pre-trained LoRA fusion method, ICM-Fusion fused LoRA can significantly reduce
the multi-tasking loss and can even achieve task enhancement in few-shot
scenarios.

*Yuqin Cao,Yixuan Gao,Wei Sun,Xiaohong Liu,Yulun Zhang,Xiongkuo Min*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces GAVN, a novel audio-assisted network for restoring degraded face videos by leveraging temporal and identity features.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Face videos often suffer from visual degradation, and existing restoration methods neglect audio-visual correlations, especially for mouth regions.

Method: GAVN captures inter-frame temporal features for coarse restoration, extracts intra-frame identity features with audio and facial landmarks, then integrates these features to produce high-quality face videos.

Result: Experimental results show that GAVN achieves superior performance in addressing video compression artifact removal, deblurring, and super-resolution compared to prior methods.

Conclusion: GAVN provides a more effective face video restoration approach by employing audio-assisted and complementary learning strategies, outperforming existing techniques.

Abstract: Face videos accompanied by audio have become integral to our daily lives,
while they often suffer from complex degradations. Most face video restoration
methods neglect the intrinsic correlations between the visual and audio
features, especially in mouth regions. A few audio-aided face video restoration
methods have been proposed, but they only focus on compression artifact
removal. In this paper, we propose a General Audio-assisted face Video
restoration Network (GAVN) to address various types of streaming video
distortions via identity and temporal complementary learning. Specifically,
GAVN first captures inter-frame temporal features in the low-resolution space
to restore frames coarsely and save computational cost. Then, GAVN extracts
intra-frame identity features in the high-resolution space with the assistance
of audio signals and face landmarks to restore more facial details. Finally,
the reconstruction module integrates temporal features and identity features to
generate high-quality face videos. Experimental results demonstrate that GAVN
outperforms the existing state-of-the-art methods on face video compression
artifact removal, deblurring, and super-resolution. Codes will be released upon
publication.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper presents the first dataset of 6,300 annotated memes for toxicity classification and introduces metadata tagging to improve moderation systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Limited data availability and high costs hinder advancements in automated content moderation, especially for meme content.

Method: A two-stage annotation process categorizes memes as toxic/normal and further divides toxic ones. It also proposes a tag-generation module for socially relevant metadata.

Result: The inclusion of metadata tags significantly enhances the performance of state-of-the-art Visual-Language Models (VLMs) on toxicity detection tasks.

Conclusion: The dataset and tag-based approach provide a scalable solution to improve content moderation in online multimodal platforms.

Abstract: The 2025 Global Risks Report identifies state-based armed conflict and
societal polarisation among the most pressing global threats, with social media
playing a central role in amplifying toxic discourse. Memes, as a widely used
mode of online communication, often serve as vehicles for spreading harmful
content. However, limitations in data accessibility and the high cost of
dataset curation hinder the development of robust meme moderation systems. To
address this challenge, in this work, we introduce a first-of-its-kind dataset
of 6,300 real-world meme-based posts annotated in two stages: (i) binary
classification into toxic and normal, and (ii) fine-grained labelling of toxic
memes as hateful, dangerous, or offensive. A key feature of this dataset is
that it is enriched with auxiliary metadata of socially relevant tags,
enhancing the context of each meme. In addition, we propose a tag generation
module that produces socially grounded tags, because most in-the-wild memes
often do not come with tags. Experimental results show that incorporating these
tags substantially enhances the performance of state-of-the-art VLMs detection
tasks. Our contributions offer a novel and scalable foundation for improved
content moderation in multimodal online environments.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a framework addressing limitations in anomaly detection with Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) by implementing deliberative reasoning and fine-grained rewards.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve performance in specialized anomaly detection by adapting general vision-language models and overcoming limitations in existing GRPO-based methods.

Method: The framework consists of a multi-stage deliberative reasoning process for structured model training and a fine-grained reward mechanism for continuous feedback based on classification accuracy and localization.

Result: The proposed framework demonstrated significant improvements in performance across industrial datasets, enhancing the adaptability of vision-language models to detect subtle anomalies.

Conclusion: The study successfully bridges the gap between the generality of MLLMs and their specialized application to anomaly detection, providing effective solutions for fine-grained visual tasks.

Abstract: While Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) demonstrate remarkable
capabilities across diverse domains, their application to specialized anomaly
detection (AD) remains constrained by domain adaptation challenges. Existing
Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) based approaches suffer from two
critical limitations: inadequate training data utilization when models produce
uniform responses, and insufficient supervision over reasoning processes that
encourage immediate binary decisions without deliberative analysis. We propose
a comprehensive framework addressing these limitations through two synergistic
innovations. First, we introduce a multi-stage deliberative reasoning process
that guides models from region identification to focused examination,
generating diverse response patterns essential for GRPO optimization while
enabling structured supervision over analytical workflows. Second, we develop a
fine-grained reward mechanism incorporating classification accuracy and
localization supervision, transforming binary feedback into continuous signals
that distinguish genuine analytical insight from spurious correctness.
Comprehensive evaluation across multiple industrial datasets demonstrates
substantial performance improvements in adapting general vision-language models
to specialized anomaly detection. Our method achieves superior accuracy with
efficient adaptation of existing annotations, effectively bridging the gap
between general-purpose MLLM capabilities and the fine-grained visual
discrimination required for detecting subtle manufacturing defects and
structural irregularities.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces U2CLLIE, a framework for low-light image enhancement that incorporates uncertainty modeling and causal reasoning to tackle issues like noise dominance and degraded gradients.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the challenges in low-light image enhancement, particularly the issues of feature uncertainty and noise dominance in extremely dark conditions, which hinder reliable model performance.

Method: The method includes two key components: (1) an entropy-based Uncertainty-Aware Dual-domain Denoise (UaD) module using G2AF to enhance spatial textures and suppress frequency-domain noise, and (2) a hierarchical causality-aware framework using Luminance Enhancement Network (LEN) for brightness adjustment and NeCo/AsC modules for causal correlation and consistency.

Result: The U2CLLIE framework achieves state-of-the-art results in low-light image enhancement on multiple benchmark datasets, demonstrating robustness and strong generalization across diverse scenes.

Conclusion: The study concludes that incorporating uncertainty-aware mechanisms and hierarchical causal modeling significantly improves the performance and reliability of low-light image enhancement models.

Abstract: Most existing low-light image enhancement approaches primarily focus on
architectural innovations, while often overlooking the intrinsic uncertainty
within feature representations particularly under extremely dark conditions
where degraded gradient and noise dominance severely impair model reliability
and causal reasoning. To address these issues, we propose U2CLLIE, a novel
framework that integrates uncertainty-aware enhancement and spatial-color
causal correlation modeling. From the perspective of entropy-based uncertainty,
our framework introduces two key components: (1) An Uncertainty-Aware
Dual-domain Denoise (UaD) Module, which leverages Gaussian-Guided Adaptive
Frequency Domain Feature Enhancement (G2AF) to suppress frequency-domain noise
and optimize entropy-driven representations. This module enhances spatial
texture extraction and frequency-domain noise suppression/structure refinement,
effectively mitigating gradient vanishing and noise dominance. (2) A
hierarchical causality-aware framework, where a Luminance Enhancement Network
(LEN) first performs coarse brightness enhancement on dark regions. Then,
during the encoder-decoder phase, two asymmetric causal correlation modeling
modules Neighborhood Correlation State Space (NeCo) and Adaptive Spatial-Color
Calibration (AsC) collaboratively construct hierarchical causal constraints.
These modules reconstruct and reinforce neighborhood structure and color
consistency in the feature space. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
U2CLLIE achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple benchmark
datasets, exhibiting robust performance and strong generalization across
various scenes.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the practical utility and performance stability of large-scale vision models like ViT-22B and to explore their potential in image generation tasks.

Method: The authors examined training behavior of ViT-22B in a local environment, highlighted instability in training, proposed model modifications for stabilization, and explored its use in image generation tasks.

Result: ViT-22B outperformed ViT in performance under the same parameter size and showed promise as a structure for image generation.

Conclusion: ViT-22B demonstrates superior performance compared to ViT in standard tasks and could be viable for novel tasks like image generation, given its stabilized modifications.

Abstract: There have been attempts to create large-scale structures in vision models
similar to LLM, such as ViT-22B. While this research has provided numerous
analyses and insights, our understanding of its practical utility remains
incomplete. Therefore, we examine how this model structure reacts and train in
a local environment. We also highlight the instability in training and make
some model modifications to stabilize it. The ViT-22B model, trained from
scratch, overall outperformed ViT in terms of performance under the same
parameter size. Additionally, we venture into the task of image generation,
which has not been attempted in ViT-22B. We propose an image generation
architecture using ViT and investigate which between ViT and ViT-22B is a more
suitable structure for image generation.

### [170] [RPCANet++: Deep Interpretable Robust PCA for Sparse Object Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04190)
*Fengyi Wu,Yimian Dai,Tianfang Zhang,Yixuan Ding,Jian Yang,Ming-Ming Cheng,Zhenming Peng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RPCANet++ is a novel framework for sparse object segmentation that integrates the interpretability of Robust Principal Component Analysis (RPCA) with efficient deep learning architectures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional RPCA models face challenges such as computational inefficiency, sensitivity to hyperparameter tuning, and lack of adaptability to dynamic scenarios.

Method: RPCANet++ unfolds a relaxed RPCA model into a structured network with three modules: a Background Approximation Module (BAM), an Object Extraction Module (OEM), and an Image Restoration Module (IRM). It incorporates Memory-Augmented Module (MAM) to enhance feature preservation and Deep Contrast Prior Module (DCPM) to facilitate object extraction.

Result: Extensive experimental results across diverse datasets show that RPCANet++ achieves state-of-the-art performance for sparse object segmentation under various imaging scenarios.

Conclusion: RPCANet++ effectively combines RPCA's theoretical strengths with deep network efficiency, providing a new standard for reliable and interpretable sparse object segmentation.

Abstract: Robust principal component analysis (RPCA) decomposes an observation matrix
into low-rank background and sparse object components. This capability has
enabled its application in tasks ranging from image restoration to
segmentation. However, traditional RPCA models suffer from computational
burdens caused by matrix operations, reliance on finely tuned hyperparameters,
and rigid priors that limit adaptability in dynamic scenarios. To solve these
limitations, we propose RPCANet++, a sparse object segmentation framework that
fuses the interpretability of RPCA with efficient deep architectures. Our
approach unfolds a relaxed RPCA model into a structured network comprising a
Background Approximation Module (BAM), an Object Extraction Module (OEM), and
an Image Restoration Module (IRM). To mitigate inter-stage transmission loss in
the BAM, we introduce a Memory-Augmented Module (MAM) to enhance background
feature preservation, while a Deep Contrast Prior Module (DCPM) leverages
saliency cues to expedite object extraction. Extensive experiments on diverse
datasets demonstrate that RPCANet++ achieves state-of-the-art performance under
various imaging scenarios. We further improve interpretability via visual and
numerical low-rankness and sparsity measurements. By combining the theoretical
strengths of RPCA with the efficiency of deep networks, our approach sets a new
baseline for reliable and interpretable sparse object segmentation. Codes are

### [171] [From Learning to Unlearning: Biomedical Security Protection in Multimodal Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04192)
*Dunyuan Xu,Xikai Yang,Yaoqian Li,Jinpeng Li,Pheng-Ann Heng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces MLLMU-Med, a benchmark to evaluate machine unlearning in biomedical multimodal large language models when removing harmful data such as private information or incorrect knowledge.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Biomedical MLLMs face threats of privacy leakage and erroneous outputs due to harmful training samples. The impracticality of retraining these models requires alternative approaches like machine unlearning.

Method: The authors propose MLLMU-Med, a benchmark built through a novel data generation pipeline incorporating synthetic private data and factual errors, targeting scenarios of privacy protection and incorrectness removal.

Result: The paper evaluates five unlearning approaches on MLLMU-Med and reveals their limited effectiveness, highlighting areas for potential improvement.

Conclusion: MLLMU-Med provides a foundation for advancing machine unlearning in biomedical MLLMs and serves as a tool to promote further research in this domain.

Abstract: The security of biomedical Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) has
attracted increasing attention. However, training samples easily contain
private information and incorrect knowledge that are difficult to detect,
potentially leading to privacy leakage or erroneous outputs after deployment.
An intuitive idea is to reprocess the training set to remove unwanted content
and retrain the model from scratch. Yet, this is impractical due to significant
computational costs, especially for large language models. Machine unlearning
has emerged as a solution to this problem, which avoids complete retraining by
selectively removing undesired knowledge derived from harmful samples while
preserving required capabilities on normal cases. However, there exist no
available datasets to evaluate the unlearning quality for security protection
in biomedical MLLMs. To bridge this gap, we propose the first benchmark
Multimodal Large Language Model Unlearning for BioMedicine (MLLMU-Med) built
upon our novel data generation pipeline that effectively integrates synthetic
private data and factual errors into the training set. Our benchmark targets
two key scenarios: 1) Privacy protection, where patient private information is
mistakenly included in the training set, causing models to unintentionally
respond with private data during inference; and 2) Incorrectness removal, where
wrong knowledge derived from unreliable sources is embedded into the dataset,
leading to unsafe model responses. Moreover, we propose a novel Unlearning
Efficiency Score that directly reflects the overall unlearning performance
across different subsets. We evaluate five unlearning approaches on MLLMU-Med
and find that these methods show limited effectiveness in removing harmful
knowledge from biomedical MLLMs, indicating significant room for improvement.
This work establishes a new pathway for further research in this promising
field.

*Yan Zhang,Gangyan Zeng,Daiqing Wu,Huawen Shen,Binbin Li,Yu Zhou,Can Ma,Xiaojun Bi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a novel model called GAT for Video TextVQA, achieving superior accuracy (+3.86%) and inference speed over existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current Video TextVQA methods lack efficiency and accuracy due to redundant text entities and underdeveloped relation modeling.

Method: The authors introduced 'GAT,' with (1) an instance gathering module integrating visual, layout, and text data, and (2) a trajectory tracing module for spatio-temporal relationship modeling.

Result: GAT outperformed all comparable frameworks in terms of accuracy (3.86% higher) and inference speed (10× faster).

Conclusion: GAT effectively improves Video TextVQA tasks in terms of precision and computational efficiency, proving its generalization capabilities across datasets.

Abstract: Video text-based visual question answering (Video TextVQA) aims to answer
questions by explicitly reading and reasoning about the text involved in a
video. Most works in this field follow a frame-level framework which suffers
from redundant text entities and implicit relation modeling, resulting in
limitations in both accuracy and efficiency. In this paper, we rethink the
Video TextVQA task from an instance-oriented perspective and propose a novel
model termed GAT (Gather and Trace). First, to obtain accurate reading result
for each video text instance, a context-aggregated instance gathering module is
designed to integrate the visual appearance, layout characteristics, and
textual contents of the related entities into a unified textual representation.
Then, to capture dynamic evolution of text in the video flow, an
instance-focused trajectory tracing module is utilized to establish
spatio-temporal relationships between instances and infer the final answer.
Extensive experiments on several public Video TextVQA datasets validate the
effectiveness and generalization of our framework. GAT outperforms existing
Video TextVQA methods, video-language pretraining methods, and video large
language models in both accuracy and inference speed. Notably, GAT surpasses
the previous state-of-the-art Video TextVQA methods by 3.86\% in accuracy and
achieves ten times of faster inference speed than video large language models.

*Wengang Guo,Wei Ye,Chunchun Chen,Xin Sun,Christian Böhm,Claudia Plant,Susanto Rahardja*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes BootSC, a deep spectral clustering model that addresses the limitations of traditional spectral clustering methods by optimizing all stages in a single network, improving clustering performance significantly.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Spectral clustering faces challenges like disjoint optimization processes and limited representation capacity, necessitating a unified, robust approach for better clustering outcomes.

Method: BootSC jointly learns affinity matrix construction, spectral embedding, and k-means clustering in an end-to-end manner, using optimal transport-based supervision and orthogonal re-parameterization for improved representation and discrimination.

Result: BootSC achieves state-of-the-art clustering metrics, including a 16% improvement in NMI on the ImageNet-Dogs dataset, surpassing prior methods.

Conclusion: BootSC effectively enhances spectral clustering by unifying its stages under a deep learning model, offering significant performance improvements and advancing clustering methodologies.

Abstract: Spectral clustering is a leading clustering method. Two of its major
shortcomings are the disjoint optimization process and the limited
representation capacity. To address these issues, we propose a deep spectral
clustering model (named BootSC), which jointly learns all stages of spectral
clustering -- affinity matrix construction, spectral embedding, and $k$-means
clustering -- using a single network in an end-to-end manner. BootSC leverages
effective and efficient optimal-transport-derived supervision to bootstrap the
affinity matrix and the cluster assignment matrix. Moreover, a
semantically-consistent orthogonal re-parameterization technique is introduced
to orthogonalize spectral embeddings, significantly enhancing the
discrimination capability. Experimental results indicate that BootSC achieves
state-of-the-art clustering performance. For example, it accomplishes a notable
16\% NMI improvement over the runner-up method on the challenging ImageNet-Dogs
dataset. Our code is available at https://github.com/spdj2271/BootSC.

*Ben Zhang,LuLu Yu,Lei Gao,Jing Liu,QuanJiang Guo,Hui Gao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces ViFP, a framework enhancing visual-language model reasoning by detecting false positives and improving reliability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the issue of false positive reasoning in visual-language models, where models provide correct answers but rely on incorrect reasoning paths, causing reliability concerns.

Method: ViFP leverages sub-question templates for core reasoning dimensions, multi-turn QA for improved paths, consistency analysis to detect FPs, and an adaptive CoT mechanism for logical accuracy.

Result: Experiments show ViFP boosts performance on A-OKVQA, OKVQA, and FVQA datasets, achieving up to a 5.4% accuracy increase and reducing false positives.

Conclusion: ViFP enhances reasoning reliability in visual-language models, improving both accuracy and logical soundness, validated by a new reliability metric VoC.

Abstract: In visual-language model (VLM) reasoning, false positive(FP) reasoning occurs
when a model generates a correct answer but follows an incorrect reasoning
path. Existing methods based on specific multi-step reasoning datasets and
reinforcement learning strategies, leading to high training costs and limited
generalization. In this work, we propose ViFP, a general framework for
enhancing visual reasoning reliability. It improves both answer accuracy and
reasoning soundness by detecting FPs. ViFP tackles the limitations of dataset
dependency and poor generalization by constructing sub-question templates
grounded in the core dimensions of visual reasoning, such as object
localization, characteristic description, and object discovery. ViFP then
builds effective reasoning paths via multi-turn QA to improve reasoning
accuracy. Meanwhile, ViFP dynamically analyzes the consistency of reasoning
path to identify potential FPs, and introduces a targeted chain-of-thought
(CoT) mechanism that adaptively guides both FP and non-FP samples. Thereby
reducing logical errors in the reasoning path while preserving accuracy.
Finally, we introduce a reliability evaluation metric-VoC, which integrates
answer accuracy and the FP rate, providing a quantitative tool to assess
whether a VLM not only answers correctly, but also reasons reliably. Our
experiments on closed-source VLMs show that ViFP consistently improves
performance across three datasets: A-OKVQA, OKVQA, and FVQA. On A-OKVQA, ViFP
improves accuracy by up to 5.4%, surpassing the previous state-of-the-art by
4.3%, and significantly reduces the number of FPs, validating its benefits in
enhancing reasoning reliability.

TL;DR: The authors introduce MMCAF-Net, a network for improving medical disease diagnosis accuracy using multimodal data fusion and achieving state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Medical disease diagnosis, especially of small lesions, suffers from challenges like data misalignment in multimodal systems. The authors aim to improve diagnostic reliability and accuracy.

Method: The MMCAF-Net uses a feature pyramid structure, 3D multi-scale convolutional attention modules, and a multi-scale cross-attention module to address dimensional discrepancies in multimodal data.

Result: MMCAF-Net demonstrated substantial improvements in diagnostic accuracy on the Lung-PET-CT-Dx dataset, outperforming existing state-of-the-art models.

Conclusion: The proposed MMCAF-Net effectively aligns and fuses multimodal data, such as medical imaging and electronic health records, proving its viability in enhancing disease diagnosis.

Abstract: The diagnosis of medical diseases faces challenges such as the misdiagnosis
of small lesions. Deep learning, particularly multimodal approaches, has shown
great potential in the field of medical disease diagnosis. However, the
differences in dimensionality between medical imaging and electronic health
record data present challenges for effective alignment and fusion. To address
these issues, we propose the Multimodal Multiscale Cross-Attention Fusion
Network (MMCAF-Net). This model employs a feature pyramid structure combined
with an efficient 3D multi-scale convolutional attention module to extract
lesion-specific features from 3D medical images. To further enhance multimodal
data integration, MMCAF-Net incorporates a multi-scale cross-attention module,
which resolves dimensional inconsistencies, enabling more effective feature
fusion. We evaluated MMCAF-Net on the Lung-PET-CT-Dx dataset, and the results
showed a significant improvement in diagnostic accuracy, surpassing current
state-of-the-art methods. The code is available at

*Josip Šarić,Ivan Martinović,Matej Kristan,Siniša Šegvić*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Open-vocabulary segmentation models, relying on language-image pretraining, have hit performance bottlenecks. This study identifies and decouples these issues, suggesting breakthroughs for future progress.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Open-vocabulary models have the potential to identify concepts beyond training taxonomy but face performance stagnation for nearly two years.

Method: The paper introduces oracle components leveraging groundtruth data to analyze bottlenecks in open-vocabulary segmentation.

Result: Validation experiments reveal empirical insights into failures of these models and identify areas for improvement.

Conclusion: Understanding bottlenecks in open-vocabulary segmentation can advance future research by addressing identified failures.

Abstract: Standard segmentation setups are unable to deliver models that can recognize
concepts outside the training taxonomy. Open-vocabulary approaches promise to
close this gap through language-image pretraining on billions of image-caption
pairs. Unfortunately, we observe that the promise is not delivered due to
several bottlenecks that have caused the performance to plateau for almost two
years. This paper proposes novel oracle components that identify and decouple
these bottlenecks by taking advantage of the groundtruth information. The
presented validation experiments deliver important empirical findings that
provide a deeper insight into the failures of open-vocabulary models and
suggest prominent approaches to unlock the future research.

### [177] [SplitGaussian: Reconstructing Dynamic Scenes via Visual Geometry Decomposition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04224)
*Jiahui Li,Shengeng Tang,Jingxuan He,Gang Huang,Zhangye Wang,Yantao Pan,Lechao Cheng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces "SplitGaussian," a framework for reconstructing dynamic 3D scenes from monocular videos by disentangling static and dynamic elements, significantly improving quality, stability, and motion separation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reconstructing dynamic 3D scenes from monocular video is difficult due to the limits in inferring motion, structure, and appearance. Existing methods struggle with motion leakage and temporal flickering due to coupled modeling of geometry and appearance.

Method: The proposed "SplitGaussian" framework explicitly splits scene representations into static and dynamic components. It decouples motion modeling from background geometry and applies deformations only to the dynamic branch, improving temporal and geometric fidelity.

Result: SplitGaussian improves rendering quality, geometric stability, and temporal consistency while addressing motion artifacts more effectively than previous state-of-the-art approaches.

Conclusion: Decoupling static and dynamic components in scene modeling leads to more stable, interpretable, and accurate reconstructions of dynamic 3D scenes from monocular video.

Abstract: Reconstructing dynamic 3D scenes from monocular video remains fundamentally
challenging due to the need to jointly infer motion, structure, and appearance
from limited observations. Existing dynamic scene reconstruction methods based
on Gaussian Splatting often entangle static and dynamic elements in a shared
representation, leading to motion leakage, geometric distortions, and temporal
flickering. We identify that the root cause lies in the coupled modeling of
geometry and appearance across time, which hampers both stability and
interpretability. To address this, we propose \textbf{SplitGaussian}, a novel
framework that explicitly decomposes scene representations into static and
dynamic components. By decoupling motion modeling from background geometry and
allowing only the dynamic branch to deform over time, our method prevents
motion artifacts in static regions while supporting view- and time-dependent
appearance refinement. This disentangled design not only enhances temporal
consistency and reconstruction fidelity but also accelerates convergence.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that SplitGaussian outperforms prior
state-of-the-art methods in rendering quality, geometric stability, and motion
separation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper reviews continual learning challenges and solutions for vision-language models (VLMs), offering a taxonomy and highlighting areas for improvement in benchmarks, datasets, and metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the challenges that VLMs face in learning continually from non-stationary data, including issues like catastrophic forgetting, cross-modal drift, and zero-shot capability erosion.

Method: The paper identifies three core failure modes and proposes a taxonomy of solutions: Multi-Modal Replay Strategies, Cross-Modal Regularization, and Parameter-Efficient Adaptation. It also reviews evaluation protocols, datasets, and metrics.

Result: The survey systematically categorizes solutions, analyzes current shortcomings in VLM-specific benchmarks, and proposes future directions for continual learning in multimodal systems.

Conclusion: This paper serves as a diagnostic guide for researchers to tackle challenges in lifelong VLM learning and provides resources to aid development in this field.

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have achieved impressive performance across
diverse multimodal tasks by leveraging large-scale pre-training. However,
enabling them to learn continually from non-stationary data remains a major
challenge, as their cross-modal alignment and generalization capabilities are
particularly vulnerable to catastrophic forgetting. Unlike traditional unimodal
continual learning (CL), VLMs face unique challenges such as cross-modal
feature drift, parameter interference due to shared architectures, and
zero-shot capability erosion. This survey offers the first focused and
systematic review of continual learning for VLMs (VLM-CL). We begin by
identifying the three core failure modes that degrade performance in VLM-CL.
Based on these, we propose a challenge-driven taxonomy that maps solutions to
their target problems: (1) \textit{Multi-Modal Replay Strategies} address
cross-modal drift through explicit or implicit memory mechanisms; (2)
\textit{Cross-Modal Regularization} preserves modality alignment during
updates; and (3) \textit{Parameter-Efficient Adaptation} mitigates parameter
interference with modular or low-rank updates. We further analyze current
evaluation protocols, datasets, and metrics, highlighting the need for better
benchmarks that capture VLM-specific forgetting and compositional
generalization. Finally, we outline open problems and future directions,
including continual pre-training and compositional zero-shot learning. This
survey aims to serve as a comprehensive and diagnostic reference for
researchers developing lifelong vision-language systems. All resources are

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LayerT2V is proposed for multi-object Text-to-Video (T2V) generation using a novel layered approach, enhancing control and generating coherent object motions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses challenges in controlling object motion trajectories, especially in multi-object T2V scenarios where existing methods suffer from performance degradation due to semantic conflicts and are typically designed for single-object motion.

Method: A new layered generation framework called LayerT2V is introduced that composites background and foreground objects layer by layer, assigning each object to a distinct layer for better control and coherence.

Result: LayerT2V outperforms SOTA methods with 1.4x improvement in mIoU and 4.5x improvement in AP50 metrics, effectively generating complex multi-object scenarios.

Conclusion: LayerT2V demonstrates a novel and effective approach for handling multi-object T2V tasks, overcoming limitations of existing methods and setting a new benchmark in the field.

Abstract: Controlling object motion trajectories in Text-to-Video (T2V) generation is a
challenging and relatively under-explored area, particularly in scenarios
involving multiple moving objects. Most community models and datasets in the
T2V domain are designed for single-object motion, limiting the performance of
current generative models in multi-object tasks. Additionally, existing motion
control methods in T2V either lack support for multi-object motion scenes or
experience severe performance degradation when object trajectories intersect,
primarily due to the semantic conflicts in colliding regions. To address these
limitations, we introduce LayerT2V, the first approach for generating video by
compositing background and foreground objects layer by layer. This layered
generation enables flexible integration of multiple independent elements within
a video, positioning each element on a distinct "layer" and thus facilitating
coherent multi-object synthesis while enhancing control over the generation
process. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of LayerT2V in
generating complex multi-object scenarios, showcasing 1.4x and 4.5x
improvements in mIoU and AP50 metrics over state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods.

*Qingyuan Li,Bo Zhang,Hui Kang,Tianhao Xu,Yulei Qian,Yuchen Xie,Lin Ma*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: FlashCommunication V2 tackles distributed training communication bottlenecks using novel techniques like bit splitting and spike reserving to allow efficient cross-GPU data transmission at arbitrary bit widths.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Distributed training and deployment of LLMs face critical communication bottlenecks, needing advanced solutions for efficient GPU communication.

Method: The paper introduces bit splitting to map irregular data widths for better hardware compatibility and a spike reserving technique to handle numerical outliers during low-bit quantization.

Result: FlashCommunication V2 achieves a max 3.2x speedup in AllReduce and 2x in All2All tasks, enhancing communication system efficiency across NVLink and PCIe architectures.

Conclusion: FlashCommunication V2 enhances flexibility and reduces resource utilization bottlenecks in distributed systems for LLM training and deployment through software-hardware co-design strategies.

Abstract: Nowadays, communication bottlenecks have emerged as a critical challenge in
the distributed training and deployment of large language models (LLMs). This
paper introduces FlashCommunication V2, a novel communication paradigm enabling
efficient cross-GPU transmission at arbitrary bit widths. Its core innovations
lie in the proposed bit splitting and spike reserving techniques, which address
the challenges of low-bit quantization. Bit splitting decomposes irregular bit
widths into basic units, ensuring compatibility with hardware capabilities and
thus enabling transmission at any bit width. Spike reserving, on the other
hand, retains numerical outliers (i.e., minima and maxima) as floating-point
numbers, which shrinks the dynamic numerical range and pushes the quantization
limits to 2-bit with acceptable losses. FlashCommunication V2 significantly
enhances the flexibility and resource utilization of communication systems.
Through meticulous software-hardware co-design, it delivers robust performance
and reduced overhead across both NVLink-based and PCIe-based architectures,
achieving a maximum 3.2$\times$ speedup in AllReduce and 2$\times$ in All2All
communication.

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: This paper addresses the scalability challenges in training large-scale deep learning recommendation models by introducing a novel two-dimensional sparse parallelism approach, enabling efficient training with up to 4K GPUs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To resolve efficiency and scalability issues arising due to the rapid growth in the complexity of deep learning recommendation models, particularly in training systems with sparse embedding tables.

Method: The paper proposes a two-dimensional parallelism strategy combining model and data parallelism, alongside a momentum-scaled row-wise AdaGrad algorithm to tackle performance demerits during training adjustments.

Result: Experiments validate the approach, demonstrating enhanced training efficiency and achieving nearly linear scalability on up to 4,000 GPUs without compromising model performance.

Conclusion: This two-dimensional sparse parallelism establishes a state-of-the-art benchmark by balancing scalability and performance for industrial-scale deep learning recommendation model training.

Abstract: The increasing complexity of deep learning recommendation models (DLRM) has
led to a growing need for large-scale distributed systems that can efficiently
train vast amounts of data. In DLRM, the sparse embedding table is a crucial
component for managing sparse categorical features. Typically, these tables in
industrial DLRMs contain trillions of parameters, necessitating model
parallelism strategies to address memory constraints. However, as training
systems expand with massive GPUs, the traditional fully parallelism strategies
for embedding table post significant scalability challenges, including
imbalance and straggler issues, intensive lookup communication, and heavy
embedding activation memory. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel
two-dimensional sparse parallelism approach. Rather than fully sharding tables
across all GPUs, our solution introduces data parallelism on top of model
parallelism. This enables efficient all-to-all communication and reduces peak
memory consumption. Additionally, we have developed the momentum-scaled
row-wise AdaGrad algorithm to mitigate performance losses associated with the
shift in training paradigms. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that the
proposed approach significantly enhances training efficiency while maintaining
model performance parity. It achieves nearly linear training speed scaling up
to 4K GPUs, setting a new state-of-the-art benchmark for recommendation model
training.

*Zhikui Chen,Muhammad Zeeshan Haider,Naiwen Luo,Shuo Yu,Xu Yuan,Yaochen Zhang,Tayyaba Noreen*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: The paper introduces a reputation-based partition scheme (RSPC) to enhance security, scalability, and privacy in crowdsensing applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Crowdsensing, a key method of data aggregation in smart systems, faces security vulnerabilities and scalability challenges due to its centralized management system.

Method: RSPC calculates optimal partition sizes based on node reputation values, divides nodes into disjoint partitions, ensures valid partitions, reorganizes them periodically, and implements a four-stage confirmation protocol for cross-partition transactions.

Result: Experiments demonstrate that RSPC achieves scalability, low latency, and high throughput in crowdsensing networks.

Conclusion: RSPC effectively mitigates security and scalability issues in crowdsensing while maintaining efficiency and network stability.

Abstract: With the popularity of smart terminals, such as the Internet of Things,
crowdsensing is an emerging data aggregation paradigm, which plays a pivotal
role in data-driven applications. There are some key issues in the development
of crowdsensing such as platform security and privacy protection. As the
crowdsensing is usually managed by a centralized platform, centralized
management will bring various security vulnerabilities and scalability issues.
To solve these issues, an effective reputation-based partition scheme (RSPC) is
proposed in this article. The partition scheme calculates the optimal partition
size by combining the node reputation value and divides the node into several
disjoint partitions according to the node reputation value. By selecting the
appropriate partition size, RSPC provides a mechanism to ensure that each
partition is valid, as long as themaximum permissible threshold for the failed
node is observed. At the same time, the RSPC reorganizes the network
periodically to avoid partition attacks. In addition, for cross-partition
transactions, this paper innovatively proposes a four-stage confirmation
protocol to ensure the efficient and safe completion of cross-partition
transactions. Finally, experiments show that RSPC improves scalability, low
latency, and high throughput for crowdsensing.

efficiency.

*Tayyaba Noreen,Qiufen Xia,Muhammad Zeeshan Haider*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Advanced DAG-based Ranking (ADR) protocol to enhance blockchain scalability and throughput by utilizing a DAG structure combined with a ranking mechanism.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to tackle the limitations of current blockchain systems, such as limited throughput, poor scalability, and high latency, which make them unsuitable for applications like IoT.

Method: The ADR protocol uses a directed acyclic graph (DAG) structure and a three-step approach: 1) Verifying nodes via public/private keys, 2) Creating a DAG ledger for block and transaction validation, and 3) Ranking nodes to filter out malicious actors and optimize network topology.

Result: Simulation on Amazon EC2 clusters with over 100 nodes shows that ADR outperforms existing DAG-based blockchains (e.g., IOTA, ByteBall) in transaction throughput and network liveness, even in the presence of malicious nodes.

Conclusion: The ADR protocol provides a scalable and efficient blockchain solution suitable for IoT applications by significantly improving performance metrics over traditional systems.

Abstract: In the past decade, blockchain has emerged as a promising solution for
building secure distributed ledgers and has attracted significant attention.
However, current blockchain systems suffer from limited throughput, poor
scalability, and high latency. Due to limitations in consensus mechanisms,
especially in managing node identities, blockchain is often considered
unsuitable for applications such as the Internet of Things (IoT). This paper
proposes the Advanced DAG-based Ranking (ADR) protocol to enhance blockchain
scalability and throughput. ADR employs a directed acyclic graph (DAG)
structure where nodes are positioned based on their rankings. Unlike
traditional chains, ADR allows honest nodes to write blocks and verify
transactions using a DAG-based topology. The protocol follows a three-step
approach to secure the network against double-spending and enhance performance.
First, it verifies nodes using their public and private keys before granting
entry. Second, it builds an advanced DAG ledger enabling block production and
transaction validation. Third, a ranking algorithm filters out malicious nodes,
ranks the remaining nodes based on performance, and arranges them
topologically. This process increases throughput and ensures robust
scalability. We evaluated ADR on Amazon EC2 clusters with over 100 nodes,
including scenarios with injected malicious nodes. Simulation results
demonstrate that ADR significantly improves transaction throughput and network
liveness compared to existing DAG-based blockchains such as IOTA and ByteBall,

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: The paper discusses bridging statistical computing (SC) with high-performance computing (HPC) through community adaptation and technical innovation to achieve scalable and fast statistical applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the gap between statistical computing methods and high-performance computing platforms and frameworks.

Method: The paper explores the history of statistical computing (SC), identifies challenges and opportunities, and provides a roadmap for integrating SC within the HPC environment.

Result: Proposes stronger collaborations between the SC and HPC communities to adapt and innovate statistical methods suitable for HPC technologies.

Conclusion: Integrating SC into HPC frameworks can lead to a thriving high-performance statistical computing community, enhancing scalability and efficiency.

Abstract: We recognize the emergence of a statistical computing community focused on
working with large computing platforms and producing software and applications
that exemplify high-performance statistical computing (HPSC). The statistical
computing (SC) community develops software that is widely used across
disciplines. However, it remains largely absent from the high-performance
computing (HPC) landscape, particularly on platforms such as those featured on
the Top500 or Green500 lists. Many disciplines already participate in HPC,
mostly centered around simulation science, although data-focused efforts under
the artificial intelligence (AI) label are gaining popularity. Bridging this
gap requires both community adaptation and technical innovation to align
statistical methods with modern HPC technologies. We can accelerate progress in
fast and scalable statistical applications by building strong connections
between the SC and HPC communities. We present a brief history of SC, a vision
for how its strengths can contribute to statistical science in the HPC
environment (such as HPSC), the challenges that remain, and the opportunities
currently available, culminating in a possible roadmap toward a thriving HPSC
community.

### [186] [SelectiveShield: Lightweight Hybrid Defense Against Gradient Leakage in Federated Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04265)
*Borui Li,Li Yan,Jianmin Liu*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: SelectiveShield is a defense framework for Federated Learning (FL) that targets gradient leakage risks by combining selective homomorphic encryption and adaptive differential privacy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Federated Learning is vulnerable to attacks that reconstruct sensitive user information, and existing defenses like DP and HE face challenges in balancing privacy, utility, and overhead, especially in heterogeneous environments.

Method: SelectiveShield uses Fisher information to identify sensitive parameters for protection via homomorphic encryption and applies adaptive differential privacy noise to non-critical parameters. Clients collaborate to agree on shared sensitive parameters.

Result: Experiments show SelectiveShield effectively reduces gradient leakage while preserving strong model performance.

Conclusion: SelectiveShield offers a scalable and practical solution for protecting privacy in federated learning without compromising model utility.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables collaborative model training on decentralized
data but remains vulnerable to gradient leakage attacks that can reconstruct
sensitive user information. Existing defense mechanisms, such as differential
privacy (DP) and homomorphic encryption (HE), often introduce a trade-off
between privacy, model utility, and system overhead, a challenge that is
exacerbated in heterogeneous environments with non-IID data and varying client
capabilities. To address these limitations, we propose SelectiveShield, a
lightweight hybrid defense framework that adaptively integrates selective
homomorphic encryption and differential privacy. SelectiveShield leverages
Fisher information to quantify parameter sensitivity, allowing clients to
identify critical parameters locally. Through a collaborative negotiation
protocol, clients agree on a shared set of the most sensitive parameters for
protection via homomorphic encryption. Parameters that are uniquely important
to individual clients are retained locally, fostering personalization, while
non-critical parameters are protected with adaptive differential privacy noise.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that SelectiveShield maintains strong model
utility while significantly mitigating gradient leakage risks, offering a
practical and scalable defense mechanism for real-world federated learning
deployments.

### [187] [S2M3: Split-and-Share Multi-Modal Models for Distributed Multi-Task Inference on the Edge](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04271)
*JinYi Yoon,JiHo Lee,Ting He,Nakjung Choi,Bo Ji*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: The paper introduces S2M3, a split-and-share architecture for efficient multi-task inference across edge devices, reducing resource usage significantly while maintaining performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation stems from the challenges posed by cloud-based AI for multi-modal applications, such as bandwidth, latency, and privacy issues, and the resource limitations faced by on-device AI for supporting multi-tasking.

Method: The method involves splitting multi-modal models into functional-level modules, sharing common modules across tasks, and addressing dependencies with a greedy module-level placement strategy that prioritizes compute-intensive components.

Result: Experiments across various tasks, benchmarks, and models showed that S2M3 reduces memory usage up to 62% and inference latency by up to 56.9%, while maintaining model accuracy and achieving optimal placement in 93.7% of cases.

Conclusion: S2M3 effectively enables efficient multi-task inference on edge devices, addressing resource constraints and reducing dependency on cloud-based AI, making it a viable solution for real-world applications.

Abstract: With the advancement of Artificial Intelligence (AI) towards multiple
modalities (language, vision, speech, etc.), multi-modal models have
increasingly been used across various applications (e.g., visual question
answering or image generation/captioning). Despite the success of AI as a
service for multi-modal applications, it relies heavily on clouds, which are
constrained by bandwidth, latency, privacy concerns, and unavailability under
network or server failures. While on-device AI becomes popular, supporting
multiple tasks on edge devices imposes significant resource challenges. To
address this, we introduce S2M3, a split-and-share multi-modal architecture for
multi-task inference on edge devices. Inspired by the general-purpose nature of
multi-modal models, which are composed of multiple modules (encoder, decoder,
classifier, etc.), we propose to split multi-modal models at functional-level
modules; and then share common modules to reuse them across tasks, thereby
reducing resource usage. To address cross-model dependency arising from module
sharing, we propose a greedy module-level placement with per-request parallel
routing by prioritizing compute-intensive modules. Through experiments on a
testbed consisting of 14 multi-modal models across 5 tasks and 10 benchmarks,
we demonstrate that S2M3 can reduce memory usage by up to 50% and 62% in
single-task and multi-task settings, respectively, without sacrificing
accuracy. Furthermore, S2M3 achieves optimal placement in 89 out of 95
instances (93.7%) while reducing inference latency by up to 56.9% on
resource-constrained devices, compared to cloud AI.

*Julius Irion,Philipp Wiesner,Jonathan Bader,Odej Kao*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: The paper proposes an optimization framework for integrating renewable energy resources in microgrids for data centers, addressing carbon emissions and power reliability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to bridge the gap in assessing microgrid sizing and composition for achieving long-term sustainability and reliability in data centers.

Method: An optimization framework is developed using Vessim, combined with renewable energy generation models from NREL's SAM, and employs multi-horizon black-box optimization for simulations.

Result: The framework effectively models interactions between workloads, renewable energy, and storage while capturing operational and embodied emissions.

Conclusion: The research provides tools to improve decision-making for data center energy system planning, focusing on sustainability and reliability.

Abstract: As computing energy demand continues to grow and electrical grid
infrastructure struggles to keep pace, an increasing number of data centers are
being planned with colocated microgrids that integrate on-site renewable
generation and energy storage. However, while existing research has examined
the tradeoffs between operational and embodied carbon emissions in the context
of renewable energy certificates, there is a lack of tools to assess how the
sizing and composition of microgrid components affects long-term sustainability
and power reliability.
  In this paper, we present a novel optimization framework that extends the
computing and energy system co-simulator Vessim with detailed renewable energy
generation models from the National Renewable Energy Laboratory's (NREL) System
Advisor Model (SAM). Our framework simulates the interaction between computing
workloads, on-site renewable production, and energy storage, capturing both
operational and embodied emissions. We use a multi-horizon black-box
optimization to explore efficient microgrid compositions and enable operators
to make more informed decisions when planning energy systems for data centers.

*Noor Islam S. Mohammad*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: The paper introduces a hybrid scheduling algorithm combining deep Reinforcement Learning (RL) and Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) to efficiently manage dynamic IoT-cloud workloads, improving latency, energy, and resource utilization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: IoT devices produce massive, dynamic data streams, requiring scalable scheduling in cloud systems to meet QoS demands. Existing methods fail to adapt properly to workload and network variability.

Method: The algorithm combines deep RL for adaptive task allocation and ACO for global resource optimization. Deep RL uses a model-free approach for real-time workload responsiveness, while ACO mitigates congestion and balances loads across cloud nodes.

Result: Experiments on synthetic IoT data show up to 18.4% reduction in response time, 12.7% improvement in resource utilization, and 9.3% lower energy consumption compared to benchmarks. SLA compliance was achieved with adaptive scheduling.

Conclusion: Integrating RL with swarm intelligence is effective for scalable and energy-efficient IoT data scheduling, making it a promising solution for future IoT-cloud environments.

Abstract: The rapid growth of Internet of Things (IoT) devices produces massive,
heterogeneous data streams, demanding scalable and efficient scheduling in
cloud environments to meet latency, energy, and Quality-of-Service (QoS)
requirements. Existing scheduling methods often lack adaptability to dynamic
workloads and network variability inherent in IoT-cloud systems. This paper
presents a novel hybrid scheduling algorithm combining deep Reinforcement
Learning (RL) and Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) to address these challenges.
The deep RL agent utilizes a model-free policy-gradient approach to learn
adaptive task allocation policies responsive to real-time workload fluctuations
and network states. Simultaneously, the ACO metaheuristic conducts a global
combinatorial search to optimize resource distribution, mitigate congestion,
and balance load across distributed cloud nodes. Extensive experiments on
large-scale synthetic IoT datasets, reflecting diverse workloads and QoS
constraints, demonstrate that the proposed method achieves up to 18.4%
reduction in average response time, 12.7% improvement in resource utilization,
and 9.3% decrease in energy consumption compared to leading heuristics and
RL-only baselines. Moreover, the algorithm ensures strict Service Level
Agreement (SLA) compliance through deadline-aware scheduling and dynamic
prioritization. The results confirm the effectiveness of integrating model-free
RL with swarm intelligence for scalable, energy-efficient IoT data scheduling,
offering a promising approach for next-generation IoT-cloud platforms.

*Chuan-Chi Lai,Yan-Lin Chen,Bo-Xin Liu,Chuan-Ming Liu*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: The paper proposes the EPUS algorithm to improve data processing efficiency for IoE applications via edge computing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: With IoE generating vast data, transmitting all data to the cloud has become costly and resource-intensive.

Method: The EPUS algorithm utilizes skyline candidate sets for pruning and edge processing nodes to minimize data sent to the cloud.

Result: Simulation results indicate EPUS reduces processing latency by over 50% for 2D data and performs well with high-dimensional data.

Conclusion: EPUS enhances IoE analytics with efficient data processing capabilities and reduced cloud dependency.

Abstract: Due to the Internet of Everything (IoE), data generated in our life become
larger. As a result, we need more effort to analyze the data and extract
valuable information. In the cloud computing environment, all data analysis is
done in the cloud, and the client only needs less computing power to handle
some simple tasks. However, with the rapid increase in data volume, sending all
data to the cloud via the Internet has become more expensive. The required
cloud computing resources have also become larger. To solve this problem, edge
computing is proposed. Edge is granted with more computation power to process
data before sending it to the cloud. Therefore, the data transmitted over the
Internet and the computing resources required by the cloud can be effectively
reduced. In this work, we proposed an Edge-assisted Parallel Uncertain Skyline
(EPUS) algorithm for emerging low-latency IoE analytic applications. We use the
concept of skyline candidate set to prune data that are less likely to become
the skyline data on the parallel edge computing nodes. With the candidate
skyline set, each edge computing node only sends the information required to
the server for updating the global skyline, which reduces the amount of data
that transfer over the internet. According to the simulation results, the
proposed method is better than two comparative methods, which reduces the
latency of processing two-dimensional data by more than 50%. For
high-dimensional data, the proposed EPUS method also outperforms the other
existing methods.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces PriCon, a novel framework for affective computing, which leverages contrastive learning and privileged information to enhance real-world model performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the challenge of transferring affective models from controlled laboratory settings (in-vitro) to uncontrolled real-world environments (in-vivo).

Method: The PriCon framework uses supervised contrastive learning (SCL) for pretraining and the Learning Using Privileged Information (LUPI) framework to train robust models.

Result: Experiments on RECOLA and AGAIN datasets show that PriCon outperforms traditional LUPI and end-to-end models, achieving performance comparable to models trained with full modalities during both training and testing.

Conclusion: PriCon offers a scalable, practical solution to bridge the gap between in-vitro and in-vivo affective modeling, showing promise for real-world applications in affective computing.

Abstract: Affective Computing (AC) has made significant progress with the advent of
deep learning, yet a persistent challenge remains: the reliable transfer of
affective models from controlled laboratory settings (in-vitro) to uncontrolled
real-world environments (in-vivo). To address this challenge we introduce the
Privileged Contrastive Pretraining (PriCon) framework according to which models
are first pretrained via supervised contrastive learning (SCL) and then act as
teacher models within a Learning Using Privileged Information (LUPI) framework.
PriCon both leverages privileged information during training and enhances the
robustness of derived affect models via SCL. Experiments conducted on two
benchmark affective corpora, RECOLA and AGAIN, demonstrate that models trained
using PriCon consistently outperform LUPI and end to end models. Remarkably, in
many cases, PriCon models achieve performance comparable to models trained with
access to all modalities during both training and testing. The findings
underscore the potential of PriCon as a paradigm towards further bridging the
gap between in-vitro and in-vivo affective modelling, offering a scalable and
practical solution for real-world applications.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PILOT-C is a new trajectory compression framework integrating frequency-domain physics modeling for higher compression and fidelity across multiple dimensions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The increasing volume of trajectory data from location-aware devices requires efficient compression methods. Existing solutions often focus only on 2D data, ignoring time synchronization and motion continuity.

Method: PILOT-C compresses trajectories in arbitrary dimensions using error-bounded optimization and frequency-domain physics modeling, compressing each spatial axis independently.

Result: PILOT-C outperforms state-of-the-art methods like CISED-W and SQUISH-E in compression ratio (by 19.2%-49%) and trajectory fidelity (error reduction by 32.6%).

Conclusion: PILOT-C demonstrates superior performance in compressing multi-dimensional trajectories while maintaining low computational complexity, making it a robust solution across diverse datasets, including 3D.

Abstract: Location-aware devices continuously generate massive volumes of trajectory
data, creating demand for efficient compression. Line simplification is a
common solution but typically assumes 2D trajectories and ignores time
synchronization and motion continuity. We propose PILOT-C, a novel trajectory
compression framework that integrates frequency-domain physics modeling with
error-bounded optimization. Unlike existing line simplification methods,
PILOT-C supports trajectories in arbitrary dimensions, including 3D, by
compressing each spatial axis independently. Evaluated on four real-world
datasets, PILOT-C achieves superior performance across multiple dimensions. In
terms of compression ratio, PILOT-C outperforms CISED-W, the current
state-of-the-art SED-based line simplification algorithm, by an average of
19.2%. For trajectory fidelity, PILOT-C achieves an average of 32.6% reduction
in error compared to CISED-W. Additionally, PILOT-C seamlessly extends to
three-dimensional trajectories while maintaining the same computational
complexity, achieving a 49% improvement in compression ratios over SQUISH-E,
the most efficient line simplification algorithm on 3D datasets.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces CX-Mind, a novel generative model for Chest X-ray diagnosis, using interleaved reasoning and curriculum-based reinforcement learning, outperforming existing models by a significant margin.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the inefficiencies and challenges (lengthy reasoning, sparse rewards, hallucinations) in existing multimodal large language models used for chest X-ray diagnostics.

Method: Developed CX-Mind, incorporating interleaved think-answer reasoning, curriculum-based reinforcement learning, verifiable rewards, and instruction-tuning with a large dataset (CX-Set). Optimization used the Group Relative Policy Optimization framework.

Result: CX-Mind outperformed existing models by an average of 25.1% in diagnostic accuracy. Real-world evaluations on the Rui-CXR dataset showed superior performance across 14 diseases, validated by multi-center expert reviews.

Conclusion: CX-Mind achieves significant advancements in diagnostic efficiency, accuracy, and clinical utility for multi-task CXR diagnosis, overcoming the limitations of prior models.

Abstract: Chest X-ray (CXR) imaging is one of the most widely used diagnostic
modalities in clinical practice, encompassing a broad spectrum of diagnostic
tasks. Recent advancements have seen the extensive application of
reasoning-based multimodal large language models (MLLMs) in medical imaging to
enhance diagnostic efficiency and interpretability. However, existing
multimodal models predominantly rely on "one-time" diagnostic approaches,
lacking verifiable supervision of the reasoning process. This leads to
challenges in multi-task CXR diagnosis, including lengthy reasoning, sparse
rewards, and frequent hallucinations. To address these issues, we propose
CX-Mind, the first generative model to achieve interleaved "think-answer"
reasoning for CXR tasks, driven by curriculum-based reinforcement learning and
verifiable process rewards (CuRL-VPR). Specifically, we constructed an
instruction-tuning dataset, CX-Set, comprising 708,473 images and 2,619,148
samples, and generated 42,828 high-quality interleaved reasoning data points
supervised by clinical reports. Optimization was conducted in two stages under
the Group Relative Policy Optimization framework: initially stabilizing basic
reasoning with closed-domain tasks, followed by transfer to open-domain
diagnostics, incorporating rule-based conditional process rewards to bypass the
need for pretrained reward models. Extensive experimental results demonstrate
that CX-Mind significantly outperforms existing medical and general-domain
MLLMs in visual understanding, text generation, and spatiotemporal alignment,
achieving an average performance improvement of 25.1% over comparable
CXR-specific models. On real-world clinical dataset (Rui-CXR), CX-Mind achieves
a mean recall@1 across 14 diseases that substantially surpasses the second-best
results, with multi-center expert evaluations further confirming its clinical
utility across multiple dimensions.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Large Language Models (LLMs) retain outdated and incorrect information due to pre-training data. The Latent Knowledge Scalpel (LKS) enables large-scale, precise edits to the models' latent knowledge without degrading their general capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of inaccurate or outdated information retention in LLMs during inference caused by pre-training limitations.

Method: The authors introduce Latent Knowledge Scalpel (LKS), a hypernetwork-based editing tool that modifies the latent knowledge of specific entities within LLMs, allowing for large-scale, precise edits.

Result: Using LKS, models like Llama-2 and Mistral successfully performed up to 10,000 simultaneous edits, preserving their general language abilities while effectively updating factual knowledge.

Conclusion: The study confirms the feasibility of latent knowledge editing in LLMs and demonstrates the capability of LKS to achieve simultaneous large-scale edits without compromising model performance.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often retain inaccurate or outdated information
from pre-training, leading to incorrect predictions or biased outputs during
inference. While existing model editing methods can address this challenge,
they struggle with editing large amounts of factual information simultaneously
and may compromise the general capabilities of the models. In this paper, our
empirical study demonstrates that it is feasible to edit the internal
representations of LLMs and replace the entities in a manner similar to editing
natural language inputs. Based on this insight, we introduce the Latent
Knowledge Scalpel (LKS), an LLM editor that manipulates the latent knowledge of
specific entities via a lightweight hypernetwork to enable precise and
large-scale editing. Experiments conducted on Llama-2 and Mistral show even
with the number of simultaneous edits reaching 10,000, LKS effectively performs
knowledge editing while preserving the general abilities of the edited LLMs.

TL;DR: This paper introduces GlaBoost, a multimodal gradient boosting framework that predicts glaucoma risk by integrating clinical, imaging, and textual data, achieving high accuracy and interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of existing unimodal and less interpretable methods for early glaucoma detection.

Method: GlaBoost fuses structured clinical features, fundus image embeddings, and textual descriptions using pretrained visual and language models, followed by classification with an enhanced XGBoost framework.

Result: GlaBoost achieved 98.71% validation accuracy, outperforming baseline models, with clinically consistent feature importance patterns identified.

Conclusion: GlaBoost provides an interpretable, accurate, and scalable diagnostic solution for glaucoma and has potential applications for other ophthalmic diseases.

Abstract: Early and accurate detection of glaucoma is critical to prevent irreversible
vision loss. However, existing methods often rely on unimodal data and lack
interpretability, limiting their clinical utility. In this paper, we present
GlaBoost, a multimodal gradient boosting framework that integrates structured
clinical features, fundus image embeddings, and expert-curated textual
descriptions for glaucoma risk prediction. GlaBoost extracts high-level visual
representations from retinal fundus photographs using a pretrained
convolutional encoder and encodes free-text neuroretinal rim assessments using
a transformer-based language model. These heterogeneous signals, combined with
manually assessed risk scores and quantitative ophthalmic indicators, are fused
into a unified feature space for classification via an enhanced XGBoost model.
Experiments conducted on a real-world annotated dataset demonstrate that
GlaBoost significantly outperforms baseline models, achieving a validation
accuracy of 98.71%. Feature importance analysis reveals clinically consistent
patterns, with cup-to-disc ratio, rim pallor, and specific textual embeddings
contributing most to model decisions. GlaBoost offers a transparent and
scalable solution for interpretable glaucoma diagnosis and can be extended to
other ophthalmic disorders.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenge of modeling high-dimensional systems from irregularly-timed observations, which traditional dimensionality reduction methods often oversimplify.

Method: Developing MMSFM, which uses simulation-free score and flow matching in a multi-marginal setting, with measure-valued splines for timing robustness and score matching for high-dimensional spaces.

Result: Validated using synthetic and benchmark datasets, showing adaptability to tasks like irregularly-timed gene expression modeling and image progression.

Conclusion: MMSFM effectively models high-dimensional, time-irregular systems while bypassing dimensionality reduction, proving versatile in various contexts.

Abstract: Modeling the evolution of high-dimensional systems from limited snapshot
observations at irregular time points poses a significant challenge in
quantitative biology and related fields. Traditional approaches often rely on
dimensionality reduction techniques, which can oversimplify the dynamics and
fail to capture critical transient behaviors in non-equilibrium systems. We
present Multi-Marginal Stochastic Flow Matching (MMSFM), a novel extension of
simulation-free score and flow matching methods to the multi-marginal setting,
enabling the alignment of high-dimensional data measured at non-equidistant
time points without reducing dimensionality. The use of measure-valued splines
enhances robustness to irregular snapshot timing, and score matching prevents
overfitting in high-dimensional spaces. We validate our framework on several
synthetic and benchmark datasets, including gene expression data collected at
uneven time points and an image progression task, demonstrating the method's
versatility.

TL;DR: The paper introduces LRTuckerRep, a model for data completion that combines global low-rank and local smoothness techniques for better performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address challenges in computational sciences where existing methods for multi-dimensional data completion are limited by efficiency issues, disruption of intrinsic data structures, and poor generalization.

Method: The proposed LRTuckerRep model integrates global low-rank approximations and local smoothness via a Tucker decomposition. It employs a weighted nuclear norm for low-rank encoding, a sparse Tucker core, and Laplacian-based regularization for smoothness. Iterative algorithms are developed to solve the optimization problem.

Result: LRTuckerRep outperforms existing baselines in image inpainting and traffic data imputation tasks, particularly under conditions with high missing data rates, showing superior accuracy and robustness.

Conclusion: LRTuckerRep effectively unifies global and local modeling techniques and offers a balanced, parameter-free approach for data completion across diverse applications.

Abstract: Multi-dimensional data completion is a critical problem in computational
sciences, particularly in domains such as computer vision, signal processing,
and scientific computing. Existing methods typically leverage either global
low-rank approximations or local smoothness regularization, but each suffers
from notable limitations: low-rank methods are computationally expensive and
may disrupt intrinsic data structures, while smoothness-based approaches often
require extensive manual parameter tuning and exhibit poor generalization. In
this paper, we propose a novel Low-Rank Tucker Representation (LRTuckerRep)
model that unifies global and local prior modeling within a Tucker
decomposition. Specifically, LRTuckerRep encodes low rankness through a
self-adaptive weighted nuclear norm on the factor matrices and a sparse Tucker
core, while capturing smoothness via a parameter-free Laplacian-based
regularization on the factor spaces. To efficiently solve the resulting
nonconvex optimization problem, we develop two iterative algorithms with
provable convergence guarantees. Extensive experiments on multi-dimensional
image inpainting and traffic data imputation demonstrate that LRTuckerRep
achieves superior completion accuracy and robustness under high missing rates
compared to baselines.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The prior elicitation process in Bayesian inference is subjective, manual, and lacks scalability, creating a bottleneck in advanced modeling.

Method: The paper integrates large language models (LLMs) with generative models like Gaussian Mixture Models to create valid priors and extends the framework to multi-agent systems using Logarithmic Opinion Pooling.

Result: LLMPrior translates unstructured data into tractable probability distributions, and the Fed-LLMPrior algorithm aggregates decentralized priors, handling heterogeneous contexts effectively.

Conclusion: The study introduces scalable and automated tools that lower the barrier to entry for Bayesian modeling and enhance robustness and scalability in decentralized settings.

Abstract: The specification of prior distributions is fundamental in Bayesian
inference, yet it remains a significant bottleneck. The prior elicitation
process is often a manual, subjective, and unscalable task. We propose a novel
framework which leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to automate and scale
this process. We introduce \texttt{LLMPrior}, a principled operator that
translates rich, unstructured contexts such as natural language descriptions,
data or figures into valid, tractable probability distributions. We formalize
this operator by architecturally coupling an LLM with an explicit, tractable
generative model, such as a Gaussian Mixture Model (forming a LLM based Mixture
Density Network), ensuring the resulting prior satisfies essential mathematical
properties. We further extend this framework to multi-agent systems where
Logarithmic Opinion Pooling is employed to aggregate prior distributions
induced by decentralized knowledge. We present the federated prior aggregation
algorithm, \texttt{Fed-LLMPrior}, for aggregating distributed,
context-dependent priors in a manner robust to agent heterogeneity. This work
provides the foundation for a new class of tools that can potentially lower the
barrier to entry for sophisticated Bayesian modeling.

### [200] [Explainable AI Methods for Neuroimaging: Systematic Failures of Common Tools, the Need for Domain-Specific Validation, and a Proposal for Safe Application](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02560)
*Nys Tjade Siegel,James H. Cole,Mohamad Habes,Stefan Haufe,Kerstin Ritter,Marc-André Schulz*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper evaluates the reliability of Explainable AI (XAI) methods for neuroimaging by testing them on 45,000 MRI scans. Widely-used methods GradCAM and Layer-wise Relevance Propagation perform poorly, while a simple gradient-based method SmoothGrad proves reliable.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation stems from the need for dependable interpretations of deep learning (DL) models in neuroimaging, where misinterpreted XAI methods can lead to incorrect conclusions.

Method: The study develops an XAI validation framework with controlled prediction tasks using real data to ensure known signal sources, enabling robust evaluation of XAI methods.

Result: Systematic testing reveals that GradCAM fails to localize predictive features, Layer-wise Relevance Propagation generates misleading artifacts, while SmoothGrad performs robustly across tasks.

Conclusion: The paper emphasizes the necessity of domain-specific adaptations for XAI methods in neuroimaging. It calls for re-evaluating prior studies using these methods and endorses SmoothGrad for its simplicity and reliability.

Abstract: Trustworthy interpretation of deep learning models is critical for
neuroimaging applications, yet commonly used Explainable AI (XAI) methods lack
rigorous validation, risking misinterpretation. We performed the first
large-scale, systematic comparison of XAI methods on ~45,000 structural brain
MRIs using a novel XAI validation framework. This framework establishes
verifiable ground truth by constructing prediction tasks with known signal
sources - from localized anatomical features to subject-specific clinical
lesions - without artificially altering input images. Our analysis reveals
systematic failures in two of the most widely used methods: GradCAM
consistently failed to localize predictive features, while Layer-wise Relevance
Propagation generated extensive, artifactual explanations that suggest
incompatibility with neuroimaging data characteristics. Our results indicate
that these failures stem from a domain mismatch, where methods with design
principles tailored to natural images require substantial adaptation for
neuroimaging data. In contrast, the simpler, gradient-based method SmoothGrad,
which makes fewer assumptions about data structure, proved consistently
accurate, suggesting its conceptual simplicity makes it more robust to this
domain shift. These findings highlight the need for domain-specific adaptation
and validation of XAI methods, suggest that interpretations from prior
neuroimaging studies using standard XAI methodology warrant re-evaluation, and
provide urgent guidance for practical application of XAI in neuroimaging.

*Debamita Ghosh,George K. Atia,Yue Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper tackles the sim-to-real gap in reinforcement learning by focusing on online distributionally robust RL, proposing an efficient algorithm with theoretical guarantees against worst-case conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Sim-to-real discrepancies in RL hinder real-world deployments, necessitating methods to enhance performance under mismatched conditions without relying on broad coverage datasets.

Method: The researchers introduce an algorithm for online distributionally robust RL leveraging $f$-divergence-based uncertainty sets and provide sublinear regret guarantees along with a minimax regret lower bound.

Result: The algorithm showcases robustness and efficiency in diverse environments, supported by both theoretical analysis and extensive experiments.

Conclusion: The proposed approach effectively handles unknown training environments in online RL settings, bridging the gap between theory and practical deployment with near-optimal performance guarantees.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) faces significant challenges in real-world
deployments due to the sim-to-real gap, where policies trained in simulators
often underperform in practice due to mismatches between training and
deployment conditions. Distributionally robust RL addresses this issue by
optimizing worst-case performance over an uncertainty set of environments and
providing an optimized lower bound on deployment performance. However, existing
studies typically assume access to either a generative model or offline
datasets with broad coverage of the deployment environment -- assumptions that
limit their practicality in unknown environments without prior knowledge. In
this work, we study the more realistic and challenging setting of online
distributionally robust RL, where the agent interacts only with a single
unknown training environment while aiming to optimize its worst-case
performance. We focus on general $f$-divergence-based uncertainty sets,
including Chi-Square and KL divergence balls, and propose a computationally
efficient algorithm with sublinear regret guarantees under minimal assumptions.
Furthermore, we establish a minimax lower bound on regret of online learning,
demonstrating the near-optimality of our approach. Extensive experiments across
diverse environments further confirm the robustness and efficiency of our
algorithm, validating our theoretical findings.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces a bio-inspired Spiking Neural Network architecture aimed at lifelong learning for intrusion detection, showcasing robust adaptability and energy efficiency on neuromorphic platforms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation stems from the brain's hierarchical and energy-efficient processing capabilities, aiming to develop an efficient and adaptive Network Intrusion Detection System capable of handling changing threats over time.

Method: The system integrates two types of SNNs: a static classifier for detecting potential intrusions and a dynamic classifier incorporating Grow When Required structural plasticity and Adaptive Spike-Timing-Dependent Plasticity for incremental learning.

Result: Evaluated on the UNSW-NB15 dataset, the architecture achieved 85.3% accuracy in continual learning and demonstrated reduced catastrophic forgetting and high operational sparsity.

Conclusion: The architecture holds promise for robust, adaptive threat detection with efficient energy use, making it suitable for deployment on neuromorphic hardware.

Abstract: Inspired by the brain's hierarchical processing and energy efficiency, this
paper presents a Spiking Neural Network (SNN) architecture for lifelong Network
Intrusion Detection System (NIDS). The proposed system first employs an
efficient static SNN to identify potential intrusions, which then activates an
adaptive dynamic SNN responsible for classifying the specific attack type.
Mimicking biological adaptation, the dynamic classifier utilizes Grow When
Required (GWR)-inspired structural plasticity and a novel Adaptive
Spike-Timing-Dependent Plasticity (Ad-STDP) learning rule. These bio-plausible
mechanisms enable the network to learn new threats incrementally while
preserving existing knowledge. Tested on the UNSW-NB15 benchmark in a continual
learning setting, the architecture demonstrates robust adaptation, reduced
catastrophic forgetting, and achieves $85.3$\% overall accuracy. Furthermore,
simulations using the Intel Lava framework confirm high operational sparsity,
highlighting the potential for low-power deployment on neuromorphic hardware.

### [203] [GTPO: Trajectory-Based Policy Optimization in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03772)
*Marco Simoni,Aleksandar Fontana,Giulio Rossolini,Andrea Saracino*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces GTPO as an improved policy optimization method addressing GRPO's limitations in language model training, ensuring stability and better performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the shortcomings of GRPO in language model training, which include conflicting gradient updates and policy collapse caused by negatively rewarded completions.

Method: GTPO mitigates conflicts by skipping negative updates for conflict tokens and emphasizing positive updates. It also prevents policy collapse by filtering completions based on entropy thresholds without relying on KL-divergence regularization.

Result: Experimental validation shows enhanced training stability and better performance for GTPO on benchmarks like GSM8K, MATH, and AIME 2024.

Conclusion: GTPO provides a more reliable and effective optimization strategy compared to GRPO, removing dependency on reference models and improving the efficiency of language model training.

Abstract: Policy-based optimizations are widely adopted today for the training and
alignment of language models, where one of the most recent and effective
approaches is Group-relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). In this paper, we
reveals and analyze two major limitations of GRPO: (i) tokens frequently appear
in completions with both positive and negative rewards, leading to conflicting
gradient updates that can reduce their output probability, even though can be
essential for maintaining proper structure; (ii) negatively rewarded
completions may penalize confident responses and shift model decisions toward
unlikely tokens, progressively flattening the output distribution and degrading
learning. To address these issues and provide a more stable and effective
policy optimization strategy, we introduce GTPO (Group-relative
Trajectory-based Policy Optimization), which identifies conflict tokens, tokens
appearing in the same position across completions with opposite rewards,
protects them by skipping negative updates, while amplifying positive ones. To
further prevent policy collapse, GTPO filters out completions whose entropy
exceeds a provable threshold. Unlike GRPO, GTPO does not rely on KL-divergence
regularization, eliminating the need for a reference model during training,
while still ensuring greater training stability and improved performance,
validated through multiple experiments on GSM8K, MATH and AIME 2024 benchmarks.

*Pavankumar Koratikere,Leifur Leifsson*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SNBO improves Bayesian Optimization by using neural networks without uncertainty estimation, achieving better results with less computational expense.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing scalability challenges of Bayesian Optimization in high-dimensional spaces and computational intensity, particularly for blackbox optimization.

Method: SNBO utilizes neural networks, separates exploration and exploitation criteria, and adapts sampling regions dynamically, avoiding computationally intensive model uncertainty estimation.

Result: SNBO achieved superior outcomes in optimization problems (10-102 dimensions) compared to state-of-the-art algorithms, with 40-60% fewer evaluations and significantly lower runtime.

Conclusion: SNBO offers an efficient and scalable blackbox optimization method, outperforming alternatives in computational efficiency and result quality.

Abstract: Bayesian Optimization (BO) is a widely used approach for blackbox
optimization that leverages a Gaussian process (GP) model and an acquisition
function to guide future sampling. While effective in low-dimensional settings,
BO faces scalability challenges in high-dimensional spaces and with large
number of function evaluations due to the computational complexity of GP
models. In contrast, neural networks (NNs) offer better scalability and can
model complex functions, which led to the development of NN-based BO
approaches. However, these methods typically rely on estimating model
uncertainty in NN prediction -- a process that is often computationally
intensive and complex, particularly in high dimensions. To address these
limitations, a novel method, called scalable neural network-based blackbox
optimization (SNBO), is proposed that does not rely on model uncertainty
estimation. Specifically, SNBO adds new samples using separate criteria for
exploration and exploitation, while adaptively controlling the sampling region
to ensure efficient optimization. SNBO is evaluated on a range of optimization
problems spanning from 10 to 102 dimensions and compared against four
state-of-the-art baseline algorithms. Across the majority of test problems,
SNBO attains function values better than the best-performing baseline
algorithm, while requiring 40-60% fewer function evaluations and reducing the
runtime by at least an order of magnitude.

*Rui Zhu,Yuexing Peng,Peng Wang,George C. Alexandropoulos,Wenbo Wang,Wei Xiang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper presents U-PINet, a physics-informed deep learning framework for efficient electromagnetic (EM) scattering modeling with reduced computational cost and improved accuracy compared to traditional and purely data-driven methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address scalability and computational inefficiencies in traditional EM scattering modeling methods and overcome the limitations of existing deep learning approaches by incorporating physical constraints.

Method: The authors propose U-PINet, a physics-informed, hierarchical framework using multiscale neural network architecture and sparse graph representations to model EM interactions efficiently and accurately.

Result: U-PINet effectively predicts surface current distributions and radar cross section tasks with high accuracy, reduced computational costs, and better robustness compared to traditional solvers and conventional deep learning models.

Conclusion: U-PINet combines physics-informed modeling with deep learning to achieve efficient, accurate, and consistent EM scattering predictions, paving the way for broader applications in computational EM.

Abstract: Electromagnetic (EM) scattering modeling is critical for radar remote
sensing, however, its inherent complexity introduces significant computational
challenges. Traditional numerical solvers offer high accuracy, but suffer from
scalability issues and substantial computational costs. Pure data-driven deep
learning approaches, while efficient, lack physical constraints embedding
during training and require extensive labeled data, limiting their
applicability and generalization. To overcome these limitations, we propose a
U-shaped Physics-Informed Network (U-PINet), the first fully
deep-learning-based, physics-informed hierarchical framework for computational
EM designed to ensure physical consistency while maximizing computational
efficiency. Motivated by the hierarchical decomposition strategy in EM solvers
and the inherent sparsity of local EM coupling, the U-PINet models the
decomposition and coupling of near- and far-field interactions through a
multiscale processing neural network architecture, while employing a
physics-inspired sparse graph representation to efficiently model both self-
and mutual- coupling among mesh elements of complex $3$-Dimensional (3D)
objects. This principled approach enables end-to-end multiscale EM scattering
modeling with improved efficiency, generalization, and physical consistency.
Experimental results showcase that the U-PINet accurately predicts surface
current distributions, achieving close agreement with traditional solver, while
significantly reducing computational time and outperforming conventional deep
learning baselines in both accuracy and robustness. Furthermore, our
evaluations on radar cross section prediction tasks confirm the feasibility of
the U-PINet for downstream EM scattering applications.

*Dhruv Sarkar,Nishant Pandey,Sayak Ray Chowdhury*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces the DP-NCB algorithm, which addresses both privacy and fairness in multi-armed bandit problems, offering $
\epsilon$-differential privacy and minimizing Nash regret.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multi-armed bandit algorithms are increasingly used in socially sensitive settings and need to address challenges like data privacy protection and fair treatment across decision rounds.

Method: The authors propose DP-NCB, which ensures $
\epsilon$-differential privacy and order-optimal Nash regret. The framework is general, operating under global and local privacy models, and does not require knowledge of the time horizon.

Result: The DP-NCB algorithm theoretically guarantees privacy and fairness while simulation results show it incurs lower Nash regret compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: DP-NCB establishes a unified framework for designing bandit algorithms that balance privacy and fairness, suitable for impactful applications in high-stakes contexts.

Abstract: Multi-armed bandit algorithms are fundamental tools for sequential
decision-making under uncertainty, with widespread applications across domains
such as clinical trials and personalized decision-making. As bandit algorithms
are increasingly deployed in these socially sensitive settings, it becomes
critical to protect user data privacy and ensure fair treatment across decision
rounds. While prior work has independently addressed privacy and fairness in
bandit settings, the question of whether both objectives can be achieved
simultaneously has remained largely open. Existing privacy-preserving bandit
algorithms typically optimize average regret, a utilitarian measure, whereas
fairness-aware approaches focus on minimizing Nash regret, which penalizes
inequitable reward distributions, but often disregard privacy concerns.
  To bridge this gap, we introduce Differentially Private Nash Confidence Bound
(DP-NCB)-a novel and unified algorithmic framework that simultaneously ensures
$\epsilon$-differential privacy and achieves order-optimal Nash regret,
matching known lower bounds up to logarithmic factors. The framework is
sufficiently general to operate under both global and local differential
privacy models, and is anytime, requiring no prior knowledge of the time
horizon. We support our theoretical guarantees with simulations on synthetic
bandit instances, showing that DP-NCB incurs substantially lower Nash regret
than state-of-the-art baselines. Our results offer a principled foundation for
designing bandit algorithms that are both privacy-preserving and fair, making
them suitable for high-stakes, socially impactful applications.

TL;DR: This paper introduces a Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN) to estimate heat flux in the EAST nuclear fusion device more efficiently than traditional grid-based Finite Element Method (FEM).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional FEM techniques are computationally inefficient, especially for real-time simulations during nuclear fusion experiments.

Method: The paper utilizes PINNs, integrating spatial coordinates and timestamps into a neural network. It calculates losses based on initial conditions, boundaries, and the heat conduction equation while sampling data points for better scenario fitting.

Result: Experiments demonstrate 40x faster computational efficiency compared to FEM, with comparable accuracy, under both uniform and non-uniform heating scenarios.

Conclusion: PINN is a powerful alternative, enabling fast and accurate real-time thermal conduction predictions for nuclear fusion experiments.

Abstract: Estimating heat flux in the nuclear fusion device EAST is a critically
important task. Traditional scientific computing methods typically model this
process using the Finite Element Method (FEM). However, FEM relies on
grid-based sampling for computation, which is computationally inefficient and
hard to perform real-time simulations during actual experiments. Inspired by
artificial intelligence-powered scientific computing, this paper proposes a
novel Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN) to address this challenge,
significantly accelerating the heat conduction estimation process while
maintaining high accuracy. Specifically, given inputs of different materials,
we first feed spatial coordinates and time stamps into the neural network, and
compute boundary loss, initial condition loss, and physical loss based on the
heat conduction equation. Additionally, we sample a small number of data points
in a data-driven manner to better fit the specific heat conduction scenario,
further enhancing the model's predictive capability. We conduct experiments
under both uniform and non-uniform heating conditions on the top surface.
Experimental results show that the proposed thermal conduction physics-informed
neural network achieves accuracy comparable to the finite element method, while
achieving $\times$40 times acceleration in computational efficiency. The
dataset and source code will be released on

Motivation: With the slowing of Moore's law and Dennard scaling, there is a need to rethink approaches to training models efficiently, minimizing data volume while maintaining accuracy.

Method: The authors propose a maximum entropy sampling method in their SICKLE framework, testing it on turbulence datasets and performing large-scale evaluations using the Frontier system.

Result: Subsampling through SICKLE improves model accuracy while significantly reducing energy consumption, achieving up to 38x reduction in some cases.

Conclusion: Intelligent subsampling like MaxEnt in the SICKLE framework offers a promising route to efficient training, benefiting both computational and energy costs.

Abstract: With the end of Moore's law and Dennard scaling, efficient training
increasingly requires rethinking data volume. Can we train better models with
significantly less data via intelligent subsampling? To explore this, we
develop SICKLE, a sparse intelligent curation framework for efficient learning,
featuring a novel maximum entropy (MaxEnt) sampling approach, scalable
training, and energy benchmarking. We compare MaxEnt with random and
phase-space sampling on large direct numerical simulation (DNS) datasets of
turbulence. Evaluating SICKLE at scale on Frontier, we show that subsampling as
a preprocessing step can improve model accuracy and substantially lower energy
consumption, with reductions of up to 38x observed in certain cases.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces SoilNet, a model for soil horizon classification using multimodal inputs and a hierarchical label system, addressing the challenges of imbalanced, complex data. It demonstrates effectiveness on a real-world dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Soil horizon classification faces challenges due to multimodal, multitask attributes and a complex hierarchical label taxonomy. Accurate classification is critical for monitoring soil health, which influences agriculture, climate resilience, and ecosystem stability.

Method: The paper presents SoilNet, a modular pipeline that integrates image and geotemporal metadata to predict depth markers for segmentation. Morphological features characterize each segment, and horizon labels are predicted via a multimodal concatenated feature vector using a graph-based label system.

Result: The model successfully classifies soil horizons on a real-world dataset, showing efficacy in dealing with large, imbalanced, and hierarchical labels.

Conclusion: SoilNet demonstrates the potential of multimodal, multitask approaches in solving complex empirical science issues like soil horizon classification while addressing hierarchical data challenges.

Abstract: While recent advances in foundation models have improved the state of the art
in many domains, some problems in empirical sciences could not benefit from
this progress yet. Soil horizon classification, for instance, remains
challenging because of its multimodal and multitask characteristics and a
complex hierarchically structured label taxonomy. Accurate classification of
soil horizons is crucial for monitoring soil health, which directly impacts
agricultural productivity, food security, ecosystem stability and climate
resilience. In this work, we propose $\textit{SoilNet}$ - a multimodal
multitask model to tackle this problem through a structured modularized
pipeline. Our approach integrates image data and geotemporal metadata to first
predict depth markers, segmenting the soil profile into horizon candidates.
Each segment is characterized by a set of horizon-specific morphological
features. Finally, horizon labels are predicted based on the multimodal
concatenated feature vector, leveraging a graph-based label representation to
account for the complex hierarchical relationships among soil horizons. Our
method is designed to address complex hierarchical classification, where the
number of possible labels is very large, imbalanced and non-trivially
structured. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on a real-world
soil profile dataset. All code and experiments can be found in our repository:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Distance-based classifiers are widely used, yet require improved interpretability for deriving insights effectively. Existing AI explanation methods rely on latent structures, which these classifiers lack.

Method: The authors uncover neural network-like latent structures within distance-based classifiers, enabling the use of techniques like Layer-wise Relevance Propagation (LRP) for explanation.

Result: Quantitative evaluations and two practical use cases illustrate the superiority of the proposed explanation method over baseline approaches.

Conclusion: The research enhances the explainability of distance-based models, making them more practical for scientific and industrial applications.

Abstract: Distance-based classifiers, such as k-nearest neighbors and support vector
machines, continue to be a workhorse of machine learning, widely used in
science and industry. In practice, to derive insights from these models, it is
also important to ensure that their predictions are explainable. While the
field of Explainable AI has supplied methods that are in principle applicable
to any model, it has also emphasized the usefulness of latent structures (e.g.
the sequence of layers in a neural network) to produce explanations. In this
paper, we contribute by uncovering a hidden neural network structure in
distance-based classifiers (consisting of linear detection units combined with
nonlinear pooling layers) upon which Explainable AI techniques such as
layer-wise relevance propagation (LRP) become applicable. Through quantitative
evaluations, we demonstrate the advantage of our novel explanation approach
over several baselines. We also show the overall usefulness of explaining
distance-based models through two practical use cases.

TL;DR: The paper introduces Bernoulli-LoRA, a novel probabilistic framework for parameter-efficient fine-tuning, unifying and extending LoRA approaches. Comprehensive theoretical analysis and experiments validate its efficacy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: With the exponential growth in model sizes, parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods like LoRA are crucial. However, existing methods lack rigorous theoretical understanding, motivating the development of Bernoulli-LoRA.

Method: Bernoulli-LoRA incorporates a probabilistic Bernoulli mechanism to dynamically select matrices for updates. The authors analyze various variants of the framework under non-convex optimization assumptions.

Result: The paper establishes convergence guarantees for multiple Bernoulli-LoRA variants and offers convergence rates for convex non-smooth functions. Experiments validate its practical and theoretical effectiveness across tasks.

Conclusion: Bernoulli-LoRA unifies and extends current LoRA methods, providing both theoretical insights and practical efficacy. It sets a foundation for developing robust parameter-efficient fine-tuning techniques.

Abstract: Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) has emerged as a crucial approach for
adapting large foundational models to specific tasks, particularly as model
sizes continue to grow exponentially. Among PEFT methods, Low-Rank Adaptation
(LoRA) (arXiv:2106.09685) stands out for its effectiveness and simplicity,
expressing adaptations as a product of two low-rank matrices. While extensive
empirical studies demonstrate LoRA's practical utility, theoretical
understanding of such methods remains limited. Recent work on RAC-LoRA
(arXiv:2410.08305) took initial steps toward rigorous analysis. In this work,
we introduce Bernoulli-LoRA, a novel theoretical framework that unifies and
extends existing LoRA approaches. Our method introduces a probabilistic
Bernoulli mechanism for selecting which matrix to update. This approach
encompasses and generalizes various existing update strategies while
maintaining theoretical tractability. Under standard assumptions from
non-convex optimization literature, we analyze several variants of our
framework: Bernoulli-LoRA-GD, Bernoulli-LoRA-SGD, Bernoulli-LoRA-PAGE,
Bernoulli-LoRA-MVR, Bernoulli-LoRA-QGD, Bernoulli-LoRA-MARINA, and
Bernoulli-LoRA-EF21, establishing convergence guarantees for each variant.
Additionally, we extend our analysis to convex non-smooth functions, providing
convergence rates for both constant and adaptive (Polyak-type) stepsizes.
Through extensive experiments on various tasks, we validate our theoretical
findings and demonstrate the practical efficacy of our approach. This work is a
step toward developing theoretically grounded yet practically effective PEFT
methods.

*Pengxi Liu,Yi Shen,Matthew M. Engelhard,Benjamin A. Goldstein,Michael J. Pencina,Nicoleta J. Economou-Zavlanos,Michael M. Zavlanos*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Fairness metrics in domains like healthcare and finance often face trade-offs between fairness and AUC performance. Fair Proportional Optimal Transport (FairPOT) selectively transforms risk score distributions across groups to balance this trade-off, attaining superior fairness outcomes with minor or positive effects on AUC.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High-stakes domains require fairness while evaluating risk scores, but enforcing fairness strictly can degrade AUC performance. Researchers aim to address this balance effectively.

Method: FairPOT uses optimal transport to align risk score distributions across groups by selectively transforming the top-lambda quantile scores within the disadvantaged group, allowing tunable trade-offs between fairness and AUC performance.

Result: Experiments show that FairPOT outperforms existing methods in fairness measures with minimal or positive impacts on AUC, both globally and in partial AUC evaluations.

Conclusion: FairPOT offers an effective, efficient, and adaptable framework that balances fairness and utility, especially for high-risk regions, making it suitable for real-world applications.

Abstract: Fairness metrics utilizing the area under the receiver operator
characteristic curve (AUC) have gained increasing attention in high-stakes
domains such as healthcare, finance, and criminal justice. In these domains,
fairness is often evaluated over risk scores rather than binary outcomes, and a
common challenge is that enforcing strict fairness can significantly degrade
AUC performance. To address this challenge, we propose Fair Proportional
Optimal Transport (FairPOT), a novel, model-agnostic post-processing framework
that strategically aligns risk score distributions across different groups
using optimal transport, but does so selectively by transforming a controllable
proportion, i.e., the top-lambda quantile, of scores within the disadvantaged
group. By varying lambda, our method allows for a tunable trade-off between
reducing AUC disparities and maintaining overall AUC performance. Furthermore,
we extend FairPOT to the partial AUC setting, enabling fairness interventions
to concentrate on the highest-risk regions. Extensive experiments on synthetic,
public, and clinical datasets show that FairPOT consistently outperforms
existing post-processing techniques in both global and partial AUC scenarios,
often achieving improved fairness with slight AUC degradation or even positive
gains in utility. The computational efficiency and practical adaptability of
FairPOT make it a promising solution for real-world deployment.

Motivation: The need for efficient norm estimation in matrix-free settings to apply these norms in practical domains like deep neural network training and recommender systems.

Method: The paper modifies Hutchinson's diagonal estimator and Hutch++ versions to develop randomized algorithms relying solely on matrix-vector multiplications.

Result: The algorithms are shown to improve Jacobian-based regularization in deep neural network training and reduce the impact of adversarial attacks in recommender systems.

Conclusion: The methods demonstrate both theoretical significance with complexity bounds and practical applicability in critical tasks.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose new randomized algorithms for estimating the
two-to-infinity and one-to-two norms in a matrix-free setting, using only
matrix-vector multiplications. Our methods are based on appropriate
modifications of Hutchinson's diagonal estimator and its Hutch++ version. We
provide oracle complexity bounds for both modifications. We further illustrate
the practical utility of our algorithms for Jacobian-based regularization in
deep neural network training on image classification tasks. We also demonstrate
that our methodology can be applied to mitigate the effect of adversarial
attacks in the domain of recommender systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To solve parameterized nonlinear PDEs more efficiently and accurately while reducing the energy and time required for training in comparison to existing operator learning models such as FNO and DeepONet.

Method: The model combines a variational autoencoder (VAE) for high-dimensional data encoding/decoding with a fully connected neural network for latent space mapping. It allows independent training of its encoder, decoder, and mapping network.

Result: VAE-DNN surpassed FNO and DeepONet in terms of accuracy and training efficiency for forward and inverse problem-solving on nonlinear diffusion equations in groundwater flow.

Conclusion: The proposed VAE-DNN model offers a novel approach to training surrogate models effectively, enabling significant improvements in performance and computational efficiency for solving complex nonlinear PDEs.

Abstract: We propose a trainable-by-parts surrogate model for solving forward and
inverse parameterized nonlinear partial differential equations. Like several
other surrogate and operator learning models, the proposed approach employs an
encoder to reduce the high-dimensional input $y(\bm{x})$ to a lower-dimensional
latent space, $\bm\mu_{\bm\phi_y}$. Then, a fully connected neural network is
used to map $\bm\mu_{\bm\phi_y}$ to the latent space, $\bm\mu_{\bm\phi_h}$, of
the PDE solution $h(\bm{x},t)$. Finally, a decoder is utilized to reconstruct
$h(\bm{x},t)$. The innovative aspect of our model is its ability to train its
three components independently. This approach leads to a substantial decrease
in both the time and energy required for training when compared to leading
operator learning models such as FNO and DeepONet. The separable training is
achieved by training the encoder as part of the variational autoencoder (VAE)
for $y(\bm{x})$ and the decoder as part of the $h(\bm{x},t)$ VAE. We refer to
this model as the VAE-DNN model. VAE-DNN is compared to the FNO and DeepONet
models for obtaining forward and inverse solutions to the nonlinear diffusion
equation governing groundwater flow in an unconfined aquifer. Our findings
indicate that VAE-DNN not only demonstrates greater efficiency but also
delivers superior accuracy in both forward and inverse solutions compared to
the FNO and DeepONet models.

*Amin Farajzadeh,Hongzhao Zheng,Sarah Dumoulin,Trevor Ha,Halim Yanikomeroglu,Amir Ghasemi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a spatio-temporal prediction framework for forecasting spectrum demand using crowdsourced KPIs and regulatory datasets, achieving better accuracy than traditional ITU models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve spectrum allocation, regulatory planning, and meet future wireless network demands like 5G, 6G, and IoT.

Method: Uses crowdsourced KPIs, advanced feature engineering, correlation analysis, and transfer learning to model spatial and temporal spectrum demand.

Result: Outperforms ITU models in prediction accuracy and provides more actionable forecasts.

Conclusion: The proposed methodology is robust and beneficial for policymakers to enhance spectrum management and planning.

Abstract: Accurate spectrum demand prediction is crucial for informed spectrum
allocation, effective regulatory planning, and fostering sustainable growth in
modern wireless communication networks. It supports governmental efforts,
particularly those led by the international telecommunication union (ITU), to
establish fair spectrum allocation policies, improve auction mechanisms, and
meet the requirements of emerging technologies such as advanced 5G, forthcoming
6G, and the internet of things (IoT). This paper presents an effective
spatio-temporal prediction framework that leverages crowdsourced user-side key
performance indicators (KPIs) and regulatory datasets to model and forecast
spectrum demand. The proposed methodology achieves superior prediction accuracy
and cross-regional generalizability by incorporating advanced feature
engineering, comprehensive correlation analysis, and transfer learning
techniques. Unlike traditional ITU models, which are often constrained by
arbitrary inputs and unrealistic assumptions, this approach exploits granular,
data-driven insights to account for spatial and temporal variations in spectrum
utilization. Comparative evaluations against ITU estimates, as the benchmark,
underscore our framework's capability to deliver more realistic and actionable
predictions. Experimental results validate the efficacy of our methodology,
highlighting its potential as a robust approach for policymakers and regulatory
bodies to enhance spectrum management and planning.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper addresses intelligent data subsampling for offline learning in data streams using an information-theoretic approach to reduce prediction uncertainty.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a need for efficient learning models that can process data streams while minimizing computational costs.

Method: An information-theoretic data subsampling method is proposed to reduce uncertainty in downstream predictions of interest.

Result: The proposed method outperforms a previously proposed information-theoretic approach on two widely studied problems.

Conclusion: The prediction-oriented subsampling approach is effective but requires careful model design for reliable performance.

Abstract: Data is often generated in streams, with new observations arriving over time.
A key challenge for learning models from data streams is capturing relevant
information while keeping computational costs manageable. We explore
intelligent data subsampling for offline learning, and argue for an
information-theoretic method centred on reducing uncertainty in downstream
predictions of interest. Empirically, we demonstrate that this
prediction-oriented approach performs better than a previously proposed
information-theoretic technique on two widely studied problems. At the same
time, we highlight that reliably achieving strong performance in practice
requires careful model design.

*David H. Mguni,Jing Dong,Wanrong Yang,Ziquan Liu,Muhammad Salman Haleem,Baoxiang Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a reinforcement learning framework for Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus (T1DM) treatment decision-making, combining impulse and switching control modalities to improve safety and efficacy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of managing physiological variables within clinically safe zones for chronic conditions like T1DM using RL, which traditionally struggles with delayed and heterogeneous intervention effects.

Method: The authors propose a constrained Markov decision process augmented with physiological state features, unifying impulse control for fast interventions and switching control for long-acting treatments, incorporating realistic insulin decay models.

Result: The framework demonstrated significant improvements in a stylized T1DM control task, reducing blood glucose level violations from 22.4% to as low as 10.8%.

Conclusion: This study sets the groundwork for safe and temporally-aware RL approaches in healthcare, though the framework is not intended for immediate clinical deployment.

Abstract: Managing physiological variables within clinically safe target zones is a
central challenge in healthcare, particularly for chronic conditions such as
Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus (T1DM). Reinforcement learning (RL) offers promise for
personalising treatment, but struggles with the delayed and heterogeneous
effects of interventions. We propose a novel RL framework to study and support
decision-making in T1DM technologies, such as automated insulin delivery. Our
approach captures the complex temporal dynamics of treatment by unifying two
control modalities: \textit{impulse control} for discrete, fast-acting
interventions (e.g., insulin boluses), and \textit{switching control} for
longer-acting treatments and regime shifts. The core of our method is a
constrained Markov decision process augmented with physiological state
features, enabling safe policy learning under clinical and resource
constraints. The framework incorporates biologically realistic factors,
including insulin decay, leading to policies that better reflect real-world
therapeutic behaviour. While not intended for clinical deployment, this work
establishes a foundation for future safe and temporally-aware RL in healthcare.
We provide theoretical guarantees of convergence and demonstrate empirical
improvements in a stylised T1DM control task, reducing blood glucose level
violations from 22.4\% (state-of-the-art) to as low as 10.8\%.

*William Solow,Sandhya Saisubramanian*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a hybrid model combining multi-task learning and a recurrent neural network to enhance predictions of crop phenology.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate grape phenology predictions are crucial for optimized vineyard management like irrigation and fertilization.

Method: A hybrid approach incorporating multi-task learning predicts parameters of a differentiable biophysical model, improving prediction accuracy across cultivars.

Result: The presented method outperformed traditional biophysical models and baseline deep learning in predicting phenological stages and crop states.

Conclusion: This hybrid modeling approach enhances robustness and precision for vineyard management applications.

Abstract: Accurate prediction of grape phenology is essential for timely vineyard
management decisions, such as scheduling irrigation and fertilization, to
maximize crop yield and quality. While traditional biophysical models
calibrated on historical field data can be used for season-long predictions,
they lack the precision required for fine-grained vineyard management. Deep
learning methods are a compelling alternative but their performance is hindered
by sparse phenology datasets, particularly at the cultivar level. We propose a
hybrid modeling approach that combines multi-task learning with a recurrent
neural network to parameterize a differentiable biophysical model. By using
multi-task learning to predict the parameters of the biophysical model, our
approach enables shared learning across cultivars while preserving biological
structure, thereby improving the robustness and accuracy of predictions.
Empirical evaluation using real-world and synthetic datasets demonstrates that
our method significantly outperforms both conventional biophysical models and
baseline deep learning approaches in predicting phenological stages, as well as
other crop state variables such as cold-hardiness and wheat yield.

### [219] [Active Learning and Transfer Learning for Anomaly Detection in Time-Series Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03921)
*John D. Kelleher,Matthew Nicholson,Rahul Agrahari,Clare Conran*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper evaluates the effectiveness of combining active learning with transfer learning for anomaly detection in cross-domain time-series data, noting that while these methods are effective, improvements plateau as more data is added.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore how active learning and transfer learning can collectively enhance anomaly detection in cross-domain time-series data, addressing gaps in understanding clustering impacts and long-term performance improvements.

Method: A combination of active learning and transfer learning is used for anomaly detection, with experiments designed to isolate the effects of clustering, data sampling, and the interactions between methods.

Result: Findings suggest clustering minimally impacts performance, active learning moderately improves model performance, and transfer learning sees diminishing returns as data points increase.

Conclusion: Active learning effectively enhances model performance but at a slowing rate, suggesting limitations in its long-term scalability and effectiveness in selecting highly impactful data points.

Abstract: This paper examines the effectiveness of combining active learning and
transfer learning for anomaly detection in cross-domain time-series data. Our
results indicate that there is an interaction between clustering and active
learning and in general the best performance is achieved using a single cluster
(in other words when clustering is not applied). Also, we find that adding new
samples to the training set using active learning does improve model
performance but that in general, the rate of improvement is slower than the
results reported in the literature suggest. We attribute this difference to an
improved experimental design where distinct data samples are used for the
sampling and testing pools. Finally, we assess the ceiling performance of
transfer learning in combination with active learning across several datasets
and find that performance does initially improve but eventually begins to tail
off as more target points are selected for inclusion in training. This tail-off
in performance may indicate that the active learning process is doing a good
job of sequencing data points for selection, pushing the less useful points
towards the end of the selection process and that this tail-off occurs when
these less useful points are eventually added. Taken together our results
indicate that active learning is effective but that the improvement in model
performance follows a linear flat function concerning the number of points
selected and labelled.

### [220] [Next Generation Equation-Free Multiscale Modelling of Crowd Dynamics via Machine Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03926)
*Hector Vargas Alvarez,Dimitrios G. Patsatzis,Lucia Russo,Ioannis Kevrekidis,Constantinos Siettos*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper presents a novel approach combining manifold and machine learning techniques to bridge microscopic and macroscopic modelling scales in crowd dynamics for accurate and efficient simulation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the challenge of linking microscopic individual behavior to macroscopic crowd dynamics in a systematic and computationally efficient way.

Method: A four-stage framework is proposed: 1) KDE converts pedestrian positions into density fields; 2) Manifold learning maps density fields to latent space via POD; 3) Machine learning models (LSTMs and MVARs) learn reduced-order dynamics in latent space; 4) Reconstruct density fields in high-dimensional space via SVD.

Result: Using Social Force Model data, the proposed approach demonstrated high accuracy, robustness, and generalizability in simulating crowd dynamics efficiently.

Conclusion: The method provides a fast and effective solution for crowd dynamics modeling, accurately capturing density evolution without relying on macroscopic PDEs.

Abstract: Bridging the microscopic and the macroscopic modelling scales in crowd
dynamics constitutes an important, open challenge for systematic numerical
analysis, optimization, and control. We propose a combined manifold and machine
learning approach to learn the discrete evolution operator for the emergent
crowd dynamics in latent spaces from high-fidelity agent-based simulations. The
proposed framework builds upon our previous works on next-generation
Equation-free algorithms on learning surrogate models for high-dimensional and
multiscale systems. Our approach is a four-stage one, explicitly conserving the
mass of the reconstructed dynamics in the high-dimensional space. In the first
step, we derive continuous macroscopic fields (densities) from discrete
microscopic data (pedestrians' positions) using KDE. In the second step, based
on manifold learning, we construct a map from the macroscopic ambient space
into the latent space parametrized by a few coordinates based on POD of the
corresponding density distribution. The third step involves learning
reduced-order surrogate ROMs in the latent space using machine learning
techniques, particularly LSTMs networks and MVARs. Finally, we reconstruct the
crowd dynamics in the high-dimensional space in terms of macroscopic density
profiles. We demonstrate that the POD reconstruction of the density
distribution via SVD conserves the mass. With this "embed->learn in latent
space->lift back to the ambient space" pipeline, we create an effective
solution operator of the unavailable macroscopic PDE for the density evolution.
For our illustrations, we use the Social Force Model to generate data in a
corridor with an obstacle, imposing periodic boundary conditions. The numerical
results demonstrate high accuracy, robustness, and generalizability, thus
allowing for fast and accurate modelling/simulation of crowd dynamics from
agent-based simulations.

*Simon Lepage,Jeremie Mary,David Picard*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper explores whether transformers can learn to predict Markov chain transitions solely based on context, finding size thresholds for effective learning and introducing methods for robust predictions across different Markov chain structures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understand whether transformers, trained only on next token prediction, can infer algorithmic behaviors such as estimating Markov chain transition probabilities instead of memorizing data.

Method: Random transition matrices are used to create Markov chains for training transformers in next token prediction tasks, systematically testing model size and encoding complexity.

Result: Transformers are capable of context-based transition estimation above a certain size and training set threshold, with improved results using more complex state encoding.

Conclusion: Here, it is demonstrated that transformers can learn underlying Markov chain structures when sufficiently scaled and that encoding strategies enhance robustness to unseen Markov structures.

Abstract: We investigate the capacity of transformers to learn algorithms involving
their context while solely being trained using next token prediction. We set up
Markov chains with random transition matrices and we train transformers to
predict the next token. Matrices used during training and test are different
and we show that there is a threshold in transformer size and in training set
size above which the model is able to learn to estimate the transition
probabilities from its context instead of memorizing the training patterns.
Additionally, we show that more involved encoding of the states enables more
robust prediction for Markov chains with structures different than those seen
during training.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: BubbleONet is a model for predicting bubble radius dynamics using physics-informed deep learning principles, offering computational efficiency compared to traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to create a computationally efficient surrogate model to simulate bubble dynamics, addressing the high computational costs of traditional numerical solvers.

Method: The paper leverages the physics-informed deep operator network (PI-DeepONet), enhanced with the Rowdy adaptive activation function to address spectral bias, and evaluates performance using a variety of test cases and training techniques.

Result: BubbleONet accurately models bubble dynamics under multiple scenarios, demonstrating strong potential as an efficient alternative to standard numerical methods.

Conclusion: BubbleONet shows promise as a computationally efficient and accurate surrogate model for operator learning in bubble dynamics modeling.

Abstract: This paper introduces BubbleONet, an operator learning model designed to map
pressure profiles from an input function space to corresponding bubble radius
responses. BubbleONet is built upon the physics-informed deep operator network
(PI-DeepONet) framework, leveraging DeepONet's powerful universal approximation
capabilities for operator learning alongside the robust physical fidelity
provided by the physics-informed neural networks. To mitigate the inherent
spectral bias in deep learning, BubbleONet integrates the Rowdy adaptive
activation function, enabling improved representation of high-frequency
features. The model is evaluated across various scenarios, including: (1)
Rayleigh-Plesset equation based bubble dynamics with a single initial radius,
(2) Keller-Miksis equation based bubble dynamics with a single initial radius,
and (3) Keller-Miksis equation based bubble dynamics with multiple initial
radii. Moreover, the performance of single-step versus two-step training
techniques for BubbleONet is investigated. The results demonstrate that
BubbleONet serves as a promising surrogate model for simulating bubble
dynamics, offering a computationally efficient alternative to traditional
numerical solvers.

### [223] [Dynamic User-controllable Privacy-preserving Few-shot Sensing Framework](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03989)
*Ajesh Koyatan Chathoth,Shuhao Yu,Stephen Lee*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces PrivCLIP, a framework for dynamic user-controllable privacy in IMU sensor data, leveraging multimodal contrastive learning to align sensor data with natural language and enabling few-shot privacy preservation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Modern sensing systems, such as smartphones and wearables, generate continuous data from IMU sensors that can inadvertently expose user behaviors. Existing privacy-preserving approaches rely on static labels or extensive private data, making them less adaptable and limiting user control.

Method: PrivCLIP employs multimodal contrastive learning to align IMU sensor data with natural language descriptions in a shared embedding space. Users can categorize activities (sensitive, non-sensitive, neutral), and the system uses a language-guided sanitizer and a motion generation module (IMU-GPT) to modify sensitive activities.

Result: PrivCLIP significantly outperforms baseline methods in protecting privacy while preserving the utility of sensor data. Experiments were conducted using multiple human activity recognition datasets.

Conclusion: PrivCLIP represents a dynamic, few-shot, and user-controllable privacy framework for IMU sensor data that improves adaptability and offers superior balance between privacy protection and data utility.

Abstract: User-controllable privacy is important in modern sensing systems, as privacy
preferences can vary significantly from person to person and may evolve over
time. This is especially relevant in devices equipped with Inertial Measurement
Unit (IMU) sensors, such as smartphones and wearables, which continuously
collect rich time-series data that can inadvertently expose sensitive user
behaviors. While prior work has proposed privacy-preserving methods for sensor
data, most rely on static, predefined privacy labels or require large
quantities of private training data, limiting their adaptability and user
agency. In this work, we introduce PrivCLIP, a dynamic, user-controllable,
few-shot privacy-preserving sensing framework. PrivCLIP allows users to specify
and modify their privacy preferences by categorizing activities as sensitive
(black-listed), non-sensitive (white-listed), or neutral (gray-listed).
Leveraging a multimodal contrastive learning approach, PrivCLIP aligns IMU
sensor data with natural language activity descriptions in a shared embedding
space, enabling few-shot detection of sensitive activities. When a
privacy-sensitive activity is identified, the system uses a language-guided
activity sanitizer and a motion generation module (IMU-GPT) to transform the
original data into a privacy-compliant version that semantically resembles a
non-sensitive activity. We evaluate PrivCLIP on multiple human activity
recognition datasets and demonstrate that it significantly outperforms baseline
methods in terms of both privacy protection and data utility.

*Zhan Su,Fengran Mo,Guojun Liang,Jinghan Zhang,Bingbing Wen,Prayag Tiwari,Jian-Yun Nie*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces TC-LoRA, which reduces task interference in multi-task settings by clustering text samples and using tensor factorization to improve performance in LLM adaptations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Task interference in merging LoRA adapters for multi-task settings hampers downstream performance of large language models.

Method: Cluster training samples based on text similarity and use Canonical Polyadic decomposition to disentangle task-specific and shared parameters across adapters.

Result: TC-LoRA leads to improved accuracy in zero-shot reasoning and other skills (e.g., +1.4% accuracy on Phi-3, +2.3% on Mistral-7B).

Conclusion: TC-LoRA effectively minimizes task interference and enhances adaptation of LLMs in diverse and complex tasks.

Abstract: Despite the success of the monolithic dense paradigm of large language models
(LLMs), the LoRA adapters offer an efficient solution by fine-tuning small
task-specific modules and merging them with the base model. However, in
multi-task settings, merging LoRA adapters trained on heterogeneous sources
frequently causes \textit{task interference}, degrading downstream performance.
To address this, we propose a tensorized clustered LoRA (TC-LoRA) library
targeting to address the task interference at the \textit{text-level} and
\textit{parameter-level}. At the \textit{text-level}, we cluster the training
samples in the embedding space to capture input-format similarities, then train
a specialized LoRA adapter for each cluster. At the \textit{parameter-level},
we introduce a joint Canonical Polyadic (CP) decomposition that disentangles
task-specific and shared factors across LoRA adapters. This joint factorization
preserves essential knowledge while reducing cross-task interference. Extensive
experiments on out-of-domain zero-shot and skill-composition tasks-including
reasoning, question answering, and coding. Compared to strong SVD-based
baselines, TC-LoRA achieves +1.4\% accuracy on Phi-3 and +2.3\% on Mistral-7B
(+2.3\%), demonstrating the effectiveness of TC-LoRA in LLM adaptation.

*Hyungbin Kim,Incheol Baek,Yon Dohn Chung*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces Decoupled Contrastive Learning for Federated Learning (DCFL), a method to address data heterogeneity in federated learning by decoupling contrastive loss into alignment and uniformity components.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the performance degradation of federated learning caused by data heterogeneity across clients, particularly focusing on the limitations of existing contrastive learning approaches that rely on infeasible assumptions in the federated setting.

Method: The authors propose DCFL, which decouples the contrastive loss into alignment and uniformity components, allowing separate calibration of attraction and repulsion forces without relying on infinite negative sample assumptions.

Result: DCFL achieves better alignment between positive samples and improved uniformity among negative samples. It outperforms state-of-the-art contrastive learning and federated learning methods on benchmarks like CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and Tiny-ImageNet.

Conclusion: DCFL is a robust solution for federated learning environments with limited data per client, addressing the limitations of existing methods and delivering significant performance improvements.

Abstract: Federated learning is a distributed machine learning paradigm that allows
multiple participants to train a shared model by exchanging model updates
instead of their raw data. However, its performance is degraded compared to
centralized approaches due to data heterogeneity across clients. While
contrastive learning has emerged as a promising approach to mitigate this, our
theoretical analysis reveals a fundamental conflict: its asymptotic assumptions
of an infinite number of negative samples are violated in finite-sample regime
of federated learning. To address this issue, we introduce Decoupled
Contrastive Learning for Federated Learning (DCFL), a novel framework that
decouples the existing contrastive loss into two objectives. Decoupling the
loss into its alignment and uniformity components enables the independent
calibration of the attraction and repulsion forces without relying on the
asymptotic assumptions. This strategy provides a contrastive learning method
suitable for federated learning environments where each client has a small
amount of data. Our experimental results show that DCFL achieves stronger
alignment between positive samples and greater uniformity between negative
samples compared to existing contrastive learning methods. Furthermore,
experimental results on standard benchmarks, including CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and
Tiny-ImageNet, demonstrate that DCFL consistently outperforms state-of-the-art
federated learning methods.

TL;DR: The paper surveys TensorFlow vs. PyTorch in terms of usability, performance, deployment, and community support. It finds PyTorch excels in research while TensorFlow is stronger for production.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To help practitioners understand trade-offs between TensorFlow and PyTorch for varied usage scenarios.

Method: The paper reviews programming paradigms, benchmarks for training/inference speed, deployment options, community adoption, and application use cases.

Result: TensorFlow is better for production ecosystems, while PyTorch is preferred for research due to its flexibility.

Conclusion: Both frameworks are capable but suited to different needs; choosing effectively relies on understanding their specific strengths and weaknesses.

Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive comparative survey of TensorFlow and
PyTorch, the two leading deep learning frameworks, focusing on their usability,
performance, and deployment trade-offs. We review each framework's programming
paradigm and developer experience, contrasting TensorFlow's graph-based (now
optionally eager) approach with PyTorch's dynamic, Pythonic style. We then
compare model training speeds and inference performance across multiple tasks
and data regimes, drawing on recent benchmarks and studies. Deployment
flexibility is examined in depth - from TensorFlow's mature ecosystem
(TensorFlow Lite for mobile/embedded, TensorFlow Serving, and JavaScript
support) to PyTorch's newer production tools (TorchScript compilation, ONNX
export, and TorchServe). We also survey ecosystem and community support,
including library integrations, industry adoption, and research trends (e.g.,
PyTorch's dominance in recent research publications versus TensorFlow's broader
tooling in enterprise). Applications in computer vision, natural language
processing, and other domains are discussed to illustrate how each framework is
used in practice. Finally, we outline future directions and open challenges in
deep learning framework design, such as unifying eager and graph execution,
improving cross-framework interoperability, and integrating compiler
optimizations (XLA, JIT) for improved speed. Our findings indicate that while
both frameworks are highly capable for state-of-the-art deep learning, they
exhibit distinct trade-offs: PyTorch offers simplicity and flexibility favored
in research, whereas TensorFlow provides a fuller production-ready ecosystem -
understanding these trade-offs is key for practitioners selecting the
appropriate tool. We include charts, code snippets, and more than 20 references
to academic papers and official documentation to support this comparative
analysis

*Shengchao Chen,Guodong Long,Jing Jiang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces an approach named Federated Dataset Learning (FeDaL) to address dataset-wise heterogeneity in Time Series Foundation Models using the concept of federated learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Time series models suffer from dataset-wise heterogeneity, leading to poor generalization across diverse domains. The paper aims to address these domain biases that degrade model performance.

Method: The authors propose FeDaL, which employs federated learning to divide heterogeneous time series data into generalized shared knowledge and personalized preserved knowledge. They integrate Domain Bias Elimination (DBE) and Global Bias Elimination (GBE) mechanisms for enhanced cross-dataset representation.

Result: FeDaL demonstrates robust generalization on eight distinct tasks, surpassing 54 baseline methods in performance. It also evaluates scaling behavior under decentralized setups, measuring factors like data volume and client count.

Conclusion: FeDaL offers a solution for overcoming domain biases by using federated learning in Time Series Foundation Models, providing improved generalization across datasets and tasks.

Abstract: Dataset-wise heterogeneity introduces significant domain biases that
fundamentally degrade generalization on Time Series Foundation Models (TSFMs),
yet this challenge remains underexplored. This paper rethink the development of
TSFMs using the paradigm of federated learning. We propose a novel Federated
Dataset Learning (FeDaL) approach to tackle heterogeneous time series by
learning dataset-agnostic temporal representations. Specifically, the
distributed architecture of federated learning is a nature solution to
decompose heterogeneous TS datasets into shared generalized knowledge and
preserved personalized knowledge. Moreover, based on the TSFM architecture,
FeDaL explicitly mitigates both local and global biases by adding two
complementary mechanisms: Domain Bias Elimination (DBE) and Global Bias
Elimination (GBE). FeDaL`s cross-dataset generalization has been extensively
evaluated in real-world datasets spanning eight tasks, including both
representation learning and downstream time series analysis, against 54
baselines. We further analyze federated scaling behavior, showing how data
volume, client count, and join rate affect model performance under
decentralization.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance existing multi-horizon time series forecasting models like the Temporal Fusion Transformer (TFT) using quantum computing for improved predictive capabilities.

Method: The authors developed the QTFT, a hybrid quantum-classical model leveraging a variational quantum algorithm, deployable on current noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices.

Result: Experimental results showed QTFT either outperforms or matches the classical TFT in terms of training and test losses on forecasting datasets.

Conclusion: QTFT offers a viable quantum-enhanced alternative to classical forecasting models, demonstrating potential applicability on existing quantum hardware.

Abstract: The Temporal Fusion Transformer (TFT), proposed by Lim et al.
[\textit{International Journal of Forecasting}, 2021], is a state-of-the-art
attention-based deep neural network architecture specifically designed for
multi-horizon time series forecasting. It has demonstrated significant
performance improvements over existing benchmarks. In this work, we propose a
Quantum Temporal Fusion Transformer (QTFT), a quantum-enhanced hybrid
quantum-classical architecture that extends the capabilities of the classical
TFT framework. Our results demonstrate that QTFT is successfully trained on the
forecasting datasets and is capable of accurately predicting future values. In
particular, our experimental results display that in certain test cases, the
model outperforms its classical counterpart in terms of both training and test
loss, while in the remaining cases, it achieves comparable performance. A key
advantage of our approach lies in its foundation on a variational quantum
algorithm, enabling implementation on current noisy intermediate-scale quantum
(NISQ) devices without strict requirements on the number of qubits or circuit
depth.

*Joel Walsh,Siddarth Mamidanna,Benjamin Nye,Mark Core,Daniel Auerbach*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper evaluates fine-tuning approaches for Large Language Models in Automated Short Answer Grading, focusing on both open-weight and closed-model methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improving the efficiency and accessibility of Automated Short Answer Grading leveraging LLMs with fewer computational and data requirements.

Method: Assessment of fine-tuning and few-shot prompting using OpenAI's closed models and Llama's open-weight models, along with synthetic training data seeding.

Result: Fine-tuning shows limited utility for open-weight Llama models but performs better than few-shot prompting for closed OpenAI models. Synthetic data augmentations improve performance significantly.

Conclusion: Fine-tuning holds promise but depends on the model type, domain, and data quantity, with synthetic data improving results dramatically in some setups.

Abstract: Research to improve Automated Short Answer Grading has recently focused on
Large Language Models (LLMs) with prompt engineering and no- or few-shot
prompting to achieve best results. This is in contrast to the fine-tuning
approach, which has historically required large-scale compute clusters
inaccessible to most users. New closed-model approaches such as OpenAI's
fine-tuning service promise results with as few as 100 examples, while methods
using open weights such as quantized low-rank adaptive (QLORA) can be used to
fine-tune models on consumer GPUs. We evaluate both of these fine-tuning
methods, measuring their interaction with few-shot prompting for automated
short answer grading (ASAG) with structured (JSON) outputs. Our results show
that finetuning with small amounts of data has limited utility for Llama
open-weight models, but that fine-tuning methods can outperform few-shot
baseline instruction-tuned LLMs for OpenAI's closed models. While our
evaluation set is limited, we find some evidence that the observed benefits of
finetuning may be impacted by the domain subject matter. Lastly, we observed
dramatic improvement with the LLama 3.1 8B-Instruct open-weight model by
seeding the initial training examples with a significant amount of cheaply
generated synthetic training data.

*Tuan Nguyen,Khoa D Doan,Kok-Seng Wong*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces FLAT, a backdoor attack in Federated Learning (FL) using a latent-driven conditional autoencoder, enabling flexible and evasive triggers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current backdoor attacks in FL are limited to fixed-pattern or single-target triggers, reducing their adaptability and increasing their detectability.

Method: FLAT employs a latent-driven conditional autoencoder to generate diverse, adaptive triggers, allowing attackers to target arbitrary patterns without retraining.

Result: Experiments demonstrate FLAT's high attack success rates and robustness against advanced defense mechanisms in FL environments.

Conclusion: The study highlights the need for innovative defense strategies to counter sophisticated and flexible backdoor attacks like FLAT.

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) is vulnerable to backdoor attacks, yet most existing
methods are limited by fixed-pattern or single-target triggers, making them
inflexible and easier to detect. We propose FLAT (FL Arbitrary-Target Attack),
a novel backdoor attack that leverages a latent-driven conditional autoencoder
to generate diverse, target-specific triggers as needed. By introducing a
latent code, FLAT enables the creation of visually adaptive and highly variable
triggers, allowing attackers to select arbitrary targets without retraining and
to evade conventional detection mechanisms. Our approach unifies attack
success, stealth, and diversity within a single framework, introducing a new
level of flexibility and sophistication to backdoor attacks in FL. Extensive
experiments show that FLAT achieves high attack success and remains robust
against advanced FL defenses. These results highlight the urgent need for new
defense strategies to address latent-driven, multi-target backdoor threats in
federated settings.

### [231] [Adversarial Fair Multi-View Clustering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04071)
*Mudi Jiang,Jiahui Zhou,Lianyu Hu,Xinying Liu,Zengyou He,Zhikui Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper presents an adversarial fair multi-view clustering (AFMVC) framework to ensure fairness in clustering by removing sensitive attribute information and aligning clustering assignments with a fairness-invariant consensus.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper is motivated by the need to address fairness concerns in multi-view clustering, an area that has largely overlooked fairness despite its critical importance in human-centered applications.

Method: The proposed method, AFMVC, employs adversarial training to remove sensitive attribute information from feature representations and aligns clustering assignments with a fairness-invariant consensus distribution using KL divergence.

Result: Experimental results show that AFMVC outperforms existing methods in fairness while maintaining competitive clustering performance.

Conclusion: AFMVC provides a theoretically sound and experimentally validated framework for fair multi-view clustering, balancing fairness and clustering consistency effectively.

Abstract: Cluster analysis is a fundamental problem in data mining and machine
learning. In recent years, multi-view clustering has attracted increasing
attention due to its ability to integrate complementary information from
multiple views. However, existing methods primarily focus on clustering
performance, while fairness-a critical concern in human-centered
applications-has been largely overlooked. Although recent studies have explored
group fairness in multi-view clustering, most methods impose explicit
regularization on cluster assignments, relying on the alignment between
sensitive attributes and the underlying cluster structure. However, this
assumption often fails in practice and can degrade clustering performance. In
this paper, we propose an adversarial fair multi-view clustering (AFMVC)
framework that integrates fairness learning into the representation learning
process. Specifically, our method employs adversarial training to fundamentally
remove sensitive attribute information from learned features, ensuring that the
resulting cluster assignments are unaffected by it. Furthermore, we
theoretically prove that aligning view-specific clustering assignments with a
fairness-invariant consensus distribution via KL divergence preserves
clustering consistency without significantly compromising fairness, thereby
providing additional theoretical guarantees for our framework. Extensive
experiments on data sets with fairness constraints demonstrate that AFMVC
achieves superior fairness and competitive clustering performance compared to
existing multi-view clustering and fairness-aware clustering methods.

### [232] [Model Inversion Attacks on Vision-Language Models: Do They Leak What They Learn?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04097)
*Ngoc-Bao Nguyen,Sy-Tuyen Ho,Koh Jun Hao,Ngai-Man Cheung*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores the vulnerability of vision-language models (VLMs) to model inversion (MI) attacks, showing that private visual training data can be leaked using novel token-based and sequence-based attack methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to investigate the understudied privacy vulnerabilities in VLMs, which are becoming widely used in critical areas, despite prior focus on unimodal neural networks.

Method: The authors develop and evaluate new MI attack strategies tailored for VLMs' generative token-based structure, including TMI, TMI-C, SMI, and SMI-AW.

Result: Experiments show that sequence-based methods, especially SMI-AW, outperform token-based methods in attack accuracy. Human evaluation confirms a high attack accuracy of 75.31% for reconstructed images, proving the susceptibility of VLMs to data leakage.

Conclusion: VLMs, when subjected to MI attacks, are at significant risk of leaking private training data, raising privacy concerns for their use in sensitive fields like healthcare and finance.

Abstract: Model inversion (MI) attacks pose significant privacy risks by reconstructing
private training data from trained neural networks. While prior works have
focused on conventional unimodal DNNs, the vulnerability of vision-language
models (VLMs) remains underexplored. In this paper, we conduct the first study
to understand VLMs' vulnerability in leaking private visual training data. To
tailored for VLMs' token-based generative nature, we propose a suite of novel
token-based and sequence-based model inversion strategies. Particularly, we
propose Token-based Model Inversion (TMI), Convergent Token-based Model
Inversion (TMI-C), Sequence-based Model Inversion (SMI), and Sequence-based
Model Inversion with Adaptive Token Weighting (SMI-AW). Through extensive
experiments and user study on three state-of-the-art VLMs and multiple
datasets, we demonstrate, for the first time, that VLMs are susceptible to
training data leakage. The experiments show that our proposed sequence-based
methods, particularly SMI-AW combined with a logit-maximization loss based on
vocabulary representation, can achieve competitive reconstruction and
outperform token-based methods in attack accuracy and visual similarity.
Importantly, human evaluation of the reconstructed images yields an attack
accuracy of 75.31\%, underscoring the severity of model inversion threats in
VLMs. Notably we also demonstrate inversion attacks on the publicly released
VLMs. Our study reveals the privacy vulnerability of VLMs as they become
increasingly popular across many applications such as healthcare and finance.

*Jinghang Han,Jiawei Chen,Hang Shao,Hao Ma,Mingcheng Li,Xintian Shen,Lihao Zheng,Wei Chen,Tao Wei,Lihua Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a consistency-aware policy optimization framework tailored for reinforcement learning in Large Language Models (LLMs) to address issues with group-based advantage degeneracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The main motivation is to resolve the problem of vanishing gradients caused by intra-group response consistency in reinforcement learning, thereby improving training efficiency and downstream reasoning performance of LLMs.

Method: The authors introduce a framework that uses a structured global reward based on reasoning outcome consistency and a global loss function. They also implement an entropy-based blending mechanism to balance local advantage estimation and global optimization dynamically.

Result: The proposed method achieves substantial performance improvements across several mathematical reasoning benchmarks, demonstrating its robustness and wide applicability.

Conclusion: The approach successfully tackles challenges in reinforcement learning for LLMs by enhancing learning signals through consistency-aware rewards and dynamic optimization techniques. This advancement underscores its potential in improving reasoning tasks.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning has significantly enhanced the reasoning capabilities
of Large Language Models (LLMs) in complex problem-solving tasks. Recently, the
introduction of DeepSeek R1 has inspired a surge of interest in leveraging
rule-based rewards as a low-cost alternative for computing advantage functions
and guiding policy optimization. However, a common challenge observed across
many replication and extension efforts is that when multiple sampled responses
under a single prompt converge to identical outcomes, whether correct or
incorrect, the group-based advantage degenerates to zero. This leads to
vanishing gradients and renders the corresponding samples ineffective for
learning, ultimately limiting training efficiency and downstream performance.
To address this issue, we propose a consistency-aware policy optimization
framework that introduces a structured global reward based on outcome
consistency, the global loss based on it ensures that, even when model outputs
show high intra-group consistency, the training process still receives
meaningful learning signals, which encourages the generation of correct and
self-consistent reasoning paths from a global perspective. Furthermore, we
incorporate an entropy-based soft blending mechanism that adaptively balances
local advantage estimation with global optimization, enabling dynamic
transitions between exploration and convergence throughout training. Our method
introduces several key innovations in both reward design and optimization
strategy. We validate its effectiveness through substantial performance gains
on multiple mathematical reasoning benchmarks, highlighting the proposed
framework's robustness and general applicability. Code of this work has been
released at https://github.com/hijih/copo-code.git.

*Md Shazid Islam,A S M Jahid Hasan,Md Saydur Rahman,Md Saiful Islam Sajol*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper addresses the challenge of predicting solar power generation across varying geographic locations affected by domain shift using a semi-supervised deep domain adaptation framework.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate solar generation prediction is hindered by domain shift caused by varying geographic and weather conditions, making it difficult to build location-agnostic machine learning models.

Method: The authors propose a semi-supervised deep domain adaptation framework involving training a deep convolutional neural network on source domain data and adapting it to the target domain through a source-free teacher-student model configuration.

Result: Their method improves prediction accuracy by up to 11.36%, 6.65%, and 4.92% for California, Florida, and New York, respectively, using only 20% labeled data from the target domain.

Conclusion: The semi-supervised approach effectively addresses domain shift and allows accurate solar generation predictions with minimal labeled data in target domains.

Abstract: Accurate solar generation prediction is essential for proper estimation of
renewable energy resources across diverse geographic locations. However,
geographical and weather features vary from location to location which
introduces domain shift - a major bottleneck to develop location-agnostic
prediction model. As a result, a machine-learning model which can perform well
to predict solar power in one location, may exhibit subpar performance in
another location. Moreover, the lack of properly labeled data and storage
issues make the task even more challenging. In order to address domain shift
due to varying weather conditions across different meteorological regions, this
paper presents a semi-supervised deep domain adaptation framework, allowing
accurate predictions with minimal labeled data from the target location. Our
approach involves training a deep convolutional neural network on a source
location's data and adapting it to the target location using a source-free,
teacher-student model configuration. The teacher-student model leverages
consistency and cross-entropy loss for semi-supervised learning, ensuring
effective adaptation without any source data requirement for prediction. With
annotation of only $20 \%$ data in the target domain, our approach exhibits an
improvement upto $11.36 \%$, $6.65 \%$, $4.92\%$ for California, Florida and
New York as target domain, respectively in terms of accuracy in predictions
with respect to non-adaptive approach.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper presents an improved pipeline for generating molecular structures from mass spectra using MIST for encoding and MolForge as a pretrained decoder, achieving a tenfold accuracy improvement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of generating accurate molecular structures from mass spectra by improving the decoding of molecular fingerprints.

Method: Combining MIST for mass spectra encoding and pretrained MolForge for molecular fingerprint-to-structure decoding, with the introduction of a thresholding step on fingerprint probabilities.

Result: A tenfold accuracy improvement over previous methods, achieving 28% correct top-1 and 36% correct top-10 molecular structure generation.

Conclusion: The pipeline sets a strong baseline for future research in molecular generation from mass spectra.

Abstract: A common approach to the \emph{de novo} molecular generation problem from
mass spectra involves a two-stage pipeline: (1) encoding mass spectra into
molecular fingerprints, followed by (2) decoding these fingerprints into
molecular structures. In our work, we adopt
\textsc{MIST}~\citep{MISTgoldmanAnnotatingMetaboliteMass2023} as the encoder
and \textsc{MolForge}~\citep{ucakReconstructionLosslessMolecular2023} as the
decoder, leveraging pretraining to enhance performance. Notably, pretraining
\textsc{MolForge} proves especially effective, enabling it to serve as a robust
fingerprint-to-structure decoder. Additionally, instead of passing the
probability of each bit in the fingerprint, thresholding the probabilities as a
step function helps focus the decoder on the presence of substructures,
improving recovery of accurate molecular structures even when the fingerprints
predicted by \textsc{MIST} only moderately resembles the ground truth in terms
of Tanimoto similarity. This combination of encoder and decoder results in a
tenfold improvement over previous state-of-the-art methods, generating top-1
28\% / top-10 36\% of molecular structures correctly from mass spectra. We
position this pipeline as a strong baseline for future research in \emph{de
novo} molecule elucidation from mass spectra.

*Chengcheng Yan,Jiawei Xu,Zheng Peng,Qingsong Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SAMT is a deep learning optimization method that updates network layers alternately, combined with trainable adaptive step sizes, reducing computational overhead and improving training stability and generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address unstable convergence and high computational costs in training deep neural networks using conventional optimization methods like stochastic gradient descent.

Method: Proposed SAMT, a block-wise alternating minimization approach combined with adaptive trainable step sizes tailored to each layer via meta-learning techniques.

Result: SAMT demonstrated better generalization performance and required fewer parameter updates compared to existing state-of-the-art methods in extensive experiments.

Conclusion: SAMT improves stability and efficiency for neural network optimization, offering a robust alternative to traditional methods such as SGD while achieving theoretical convergence guarantees.

Abstract: The training of deep neural networks is inherently a nonconvex optimization
problem, yet standard approaches such as stochastic gradient descent (SGD)
require simultaneous updates to all parameters, often leading to unstable
convergence and high computational cost. To address these issues, we propose a
novel method, Stochastic Alternating Minimization with Trainable Step Sizes
(SAMT), which updates network parameters in an alternating manner by treating
the weights of each layer as a block. By decomposing the overall optimization
into sub-problems corresponding to different blocks, this block-wise
alternating strategy reduces per-step computational overhead and enhances
training stability in nonconvex settings. To fully leverage these benefits,
inspired by meta-learning, we proposed a novel adaptive step size strategy to
incorporate into the sub-problem solving steps of alternating updates. It
supports different types of trainable step sizes, including but not limited to
scalar, element-wise, row-wise, and column-wise, enabling adaptive step size
selection tailored to each block via meta-learning. We further provide a
theoretical convergence guarantee for the proposed algorithm, establishing its
optimization soundness. Extensive experiments for multiple benchmarks
demonstrate that SAMT achieves better generalization performance with fewer
parameter updates compared to state-of-the-art methods, highlighting its
effectiveness and potential in neural network optimization.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Causal Reward Adjustment (CRA) to tackle reward hacking in external reasoning systems used for complex tasks by correcting confounding semantic features.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation of this paper is to address reward hacking in external reasoning systems, where high scores are assigned to logically incorrect reasoning paths, causing erroneous outcomes.

Method: The method involves training sparse autoencoders to extract interpretable features from PRM activations and applying backdoor adjustments to mitigate the confounding effects.

Result: Experiments on mathematical problem-solving datasets show that CRA successfully reduces reward hacking and enhances model accuracy without retraining the PRM or altering the policy model.

Conclusion: CRA is an effective approach to adjust rewards in reasoning systems, improving correctness and reliability without system overhaul.

Abstract: External reasoning systems combine language models with process reward models
(PRMs) to select high-quality reasoning paths for complex tasks such as
mathematical problem solving. However, these systems are prone to reward
hacking, where high-scoring but logically incorrect paths are assigned high
scores by the PRMs, leading to incorrect answers. From a causal inference
perspective, we attribute this phenomenon primarily to the presence of
confounding semantic features. To address it, we propose Causal Reward
Adjustment (CRA), a method that mitigates reward hacking by estimating the true
reward of a reasoning path. CRA trains sparse autoencoders on the PRM's
internal activations to recover interpretable features, then corrects
confounding by using backdoor adjustment. Experiments on math solving datasets
demonstrate that CRA mitigates reward hacking and improves final accuracy,
without modifying the policy model or retraining PRM.

TL;DR: This paper introduces symmetric divergences to offline RL frameworks, addressing challenges with analytic policies and numerical issues through Taylor expansions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance behavior regularization policy optimization (BRPO) by integrating symmetric divergences, which have been relatively unexplored in offline RL.

Method: The authors use Taylor series of $f$-divergence to address analytical policy creation and numerical stability issues, resulting in the Symmetric $f$ Actor-Critic algorithm.

Result: The proposed S$f$-AC algorithm demonstrated competitive performance in distribution approximation and MuJoCo benchmarks.

Conclusion: Symmetric divergences can be effectively utilized in BRPO algorithms, showing promise in advancing offline RL frameworks.

Abstract: This paper introduces symmetric divergences to behavior regularization policy
optimization (BRPO) to establish a novel offline RL framework. Existing methods
focus on asymmetric divergences such as KL to obtain analytic regularized
policies and a practical minimization objective. We show that symmetric
divergences do not permit an analytic policy as regularization and can incur
numerical issues as loss. We tackle these challenges by the Taylor series of
$f$-divergence. Specifically, we prove that an analytic policy can be obtained
with a finite series. For loss, we observe that symmetric divergences can be
decomposed into an asymmetry and a conditional symmetry term, Taylor-expanding
the latter alleviates numerical issues. Summing together, we propose Symmetric
$f$ Actor-Critic (S$f$-AC), the first practical BRPO algorithm with symmetric
divergences. Experimental results on distribution approximation and MuJoCo
verify that S$f$-AC performs competitively.

Motivation: Recent findings suggest lightweight models can perform well and improving data quality may be a more impactful direction for AutoML in time series forecasting.

Method: The authors developed DCATS, which optimizes data cleaning using metadata to enhance forecasting performance.

Result: Experiments show DCATS reduces prediction error by 6% across models in traffic volume forecasting.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates the importance of data-centric methodologies in advancing AutoML for time series predictions.

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) powered agents have emerged as effective planners
for Automated Machine Learning (AutoML) systems. While most existing AutoML
approaches focus on automating feature engineering and model architecture
search, recent studies in time series forecasting suggest that lightweight
models can often achieve state-of-the-art performance. This observation led us
to explore improving data quality, rather than model architecture, as a
potentially fruitful direction for AutoML on time series data. We propose
DCATS, a Data-Centric Agent for Time Series. DCATS leverages metadata
accompanying time series to clean data while optimizing forecasting
performance. We evaluated DCATS using four time series forecasting models on a
large-scale traffic volume forecasting dataset. Results demonstrate that DCATS
achieves an average 6% error reduction across all tested models and time
horizons, highlighting the potential of data-centric approaches in AutoML for

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper presents a deep learning method for automating Doppler angle estimation in ultrasounds to improve blood velocity measurement accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Incorrect angle estimation in Doppler ultrasound is a significant source of error in blood velocity measurements. The paper aims to address this with an automated solution to improve accuracy and workflow.

Method: The study used 2100 human carotid ultrasound images and employed five pre-trained models to extract features. A custom shallow network was designed to estimate the Doppler angle, with results compared against human-observer measurements.

Result: The best-performing model achieved a mean absolute error (MAE) below clinical error thresholds, making it suitable for avoiding misclassification of normal and stenotic velocities.

Conclusion: The proposed deep learning approach has the potential for clinical integration within commercial ultrasound imaging systems, enhancing automation and diagnostic accuracy.

Abstract: Angle estimation is an important step in the Doppler ultrasound clinical
workflow to measure blood velocity. It is widely recognized that incorrect
angle estimation is a leading cause of error in Doppler-based blood velocity
measurements. In this paper, we propose a deep learning-based approach for
automated Doppler angle estimation. The approach was developed using 2100 human
carotid ultrasound images including image augmentation. Five pre-trained models
were used to extract images features, and these features were passed to a
custom shallow network for Doppler angle estimation. Independently,
measurements were obtained by a human observer reviewing the images for
comparison. The mean absolute error (MAE) between the automated and manual
angle estimates ranged from 3.9{\deg} to 9.4{\deg} for the models evaluated.
Furthermore, the MAE for the best performing model was less than the acceptable
clinical Doppler angle error threshold thus avoiding misclassification of
normal velocity values as a stenosis. The results demonstrate potential for
applying a deep-learning based technique for automated ultrasound Doppler angle
estimation. Such a technique could potentially be implemented within the
imaging software on commercial ultrasound scanners.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces T3Time, a novel trimodal framework for multivariate time series forecasting, which improves performance by dynamically prioritizing features and leveraging cross-modal alignments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study addresses limitations in current Transformer-based and LLM-based methods for MTSF, including rigid inductive biases, inadequate inter-variable interactions, and static fusion strategies that hinder adaptability across different forecast horizons.

Method: T3Time integrates three branches: time, spectral, and prompt, incorporating frequency encoding and a gating mechanism for adaptive feature prioritization. It also proposes dynamic aggregation of cross-modal alignment heads to optimize feature importance.

Result: Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets reveal that T3Time outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, reducing MSE by an average of 3.28% and MAE by 2.29%. It exhibits strong generalization in few-shot learning settings, achieving significant performance improvements with as little as 5-10% of training data.

Conclusion: T3Time effectively addresses shortcomings in MTSF methods, providing significant accuracy improvements and adaptability for various forecasting horizons, particularly in data-scarce scenarios.

Abstract: Multivariate time series forecasting (MTSF) seeks to model temporal dynamics
among variables to predict future trends. Transformer-based models and large
language models (LLMs) have shown promise due to their ability to capture
long-range dependencies and patterns. However, current methods often rely on
rigid inductive biases, ignore intervariable interactions, or apply static
fusion strategies that limit adaptability across forecast horizons. These
limitations create bottlenecks in capturing nuanced, horizon-specific
relationships in time-series data. To solve this problem, we propose T3Time, a
novel trimodal framework consisting of time, spectral, and prompt branches,
where the dedicated frequency encoding branch captures the periodic structures
along with a gating mechanism that learns prioritization between temporal and
spectral features based on the prediction horizon. We also proposed a mechanism
which adaptively aggregates multiple cross-modal alignment heads by dynamically
weighting the importance of each head based on the features. Extensive
experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that our model consistently
outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving an average reduction of 3.28%
in MSE and 2.29% in MAE. Furthermore, it shows strong generalization in
few-shot learning settings: with 5% training data, we see a reduction in MSE
and MAE by 4.13% and 1.91%, respectively; and with 10% data, by 3.62% and 1.98%
on average. Code - https://github.com/monaf-chowdhury/T3Time/

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Large language models (LLMs) can be adapted for general machine learning tasks via the framework Mockingbird, achieving acceptable results but still requiring domain-specific documents and expert feedback for optimal performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the potential of using LLMs beyond chat bots and into general machine learning applications.

Method: The Mockingbird framework instructs LLMs to role-play functions and reflect on their mistakes to iteratively improve.

Result: Mockingbird demonstrates that LLMs can perform adequately on common machine learning tasks, but self-reflection alone cannot surpass outcomes guided by domain expertise or human feedback.

Conclusion: While LLMs show promise in general machine learning, their effectiveness is limited without external domain-specific guidance and expert inputs.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are now being used with increasing frequency as
chat bots, tasked with the summarizing information or generating text and code
in accordance with user instructions. The rapid increase in reasoning
capabilities and inference speed of LLMs has revealed their remarkable
potential for applications extending beyond the domain of chat bots to general
machine learning tasks. This work is conducted out of the curiosity about such
potential. In this work, we propose a framework Mockingbird to adapt LLMs to
general machine learning tasks and evaluate its performance and scalability on
several general machine learning tasks. The core concept of this framework is
instructing LLMs to role-play functions and reflect on its mistakes to improve
itself. Our evaluation and analysis result shows that LLM-driven machine
learning methods, such as Mockingbird, can achieve acceptable results on common
machine learning tasks; however, solely reflecting on its own currently cannot
outperform the effect of domain-specific documents and feedback from human
experts.

*George Bredis,Stanislav Dereka,Viacheslav Sinii,Ruslan Rakhimov,Daniil Gavrilov*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Vision-Language Decoupled Actor-Critic (VL-DAC) is a novel reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm that enables vision-language models (VLMs) to learn language-conditioned actions with generalization to real-world tasks, based on affordable training in synthetic simulators.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current vision-language models lack the ability to convert raw visual inputs into coherent language-conditioned actions, essential for interactive multimodal agents. Existing RL methods have limitations in generalization and rely on brittle hyperparameters or dense-reward environments.

Method: VL-DAC decouples the actor-critic process by applying PPO updates to action tokens and learning value only at the environment-step level. This novel arrangement removes unstable weighting terms, leading to faster and more reliable convergence.

Result: Training a single VLM with VL-DAC in simple simulators achieved notable improvements in agentic control (+50% on BALROG), spatial planning (+5% on VSI-Bench), and web navigation (+2% on VisualWebBench), without compromising general image understanding.

Conclusion: VL-DAC demonstrates that a lightweight and hyperparameter-free RL algorithm can successfully train VLMs in inexpensive synthetic environments, yielding measurable improvements in real-world performance on diverse benchmarks.

Abstract: Interactive multimodal agents must convert raw visual observations into
coherent sequences of language-conditioned actions -- a capability that current
vision-language models (VLMs) still lack. Earlier reinforcement-learning (RL)
efforts could, in principle, endow VLMs with such skills, but they have seldom
tested whether the learned behaviours generalize beyond their training
simulators, and they depend either on brittle hyperparameter tuning or on
dense-reward environments with low state variability. We introduce
Vision-Language Decoupled Actor-Critic (VL-DAC), a lightweight,
hyperparameter-free RL algorithm. VL-DAC applies PPO updates to action tokens
while learning value only at the environment-step level: an arrangement, to our
knowledge, not previously explored for large VLMs or LLMs. This simple
decoupling removes unstable weighting terms and yields faster, more reliable
convergence. Training a single VLM with VL-DAC in one inexpensive simulator at
a time (MiniWorld, Gym-Cards, ALFWorld, or WebShop) already produces policies
that generalize widely: +50\% relative on BALROG (game-centric agentic
control), +5\% relative on the hardest part of VSI-Bench (spatial planning),
and +2\% on VisualWebBench (web navigation), all without degrading general
image understanding accuracy. These results provide the first evidence that a
simple RL algorithm can train VLMs entirely in cheap synthetic worlds while
delivering measurable gains on real-image agentic, spatial-reasoning, and
web-navigation benchmarks.

### [245] [WSS-CL: Weight Saliency Soft-Guided Contrastive Learning for Efficient Machine Unlearning Image Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04308)
*Thang Duc Tran,Thai Hoang Le*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes a novel machine unlearning method for image classification using weight saliency techniques, which improves unlearning efficacy while minimizing performance loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current machine unlearning methods struggle with precise unlearning, stability, and applicability across multiple domains, necessitating new approaches.

Method: The method, called WSS-CL, performs unlearning via a two-phase process: a forgetting stage using Kullback-Leibler divergence for logit space modification, and adversarial fine-tuning through contrastive learning in feature space.

Result: Experimental evaluations show that WSS-CL significantly enhances unlearning quality and reduces performance degradation compared to state-of-the-art techniques.

Conclusion: WSS-CL demonstrates its practicality for both supervised and self-supervised machine learning scenarios, offering a promising improvement in efficient model unlearning.

Abstract: Machine unlearning, the efficient deletion of the impact of specific data in
a trained model, remains a challenging problem. Current machine unlearning
approaches that focus primarily on data-centric or weight-based strategies
frequently encounter challenges in achieving precise unlearning, maintaining
stability, and ensuring applicability across diverse domains. In this work, we
introduce a new two-phase efficient machine unlearning method for image
classification, in terms of weight saliency, leveraging weight saliency to
focus the unlearning process on critical model parameters. Our method is called
weight saliency soft-guided contrastive learning for efficient machine
unlearning image classification (WSS-CL), which significantly narrows the
performance gap with "exact" unlearning. First, the forgetting stage maximizes
kullback-leibler divergence between output logits and aggregated pseudo-labels
for efficient forgetting in logit space. Next, the adversarial fine-tuning
stage introduces contrastive learning in a self-supervised manner. By using
scaled feature representations, it maximizes the distance between the forgotten
and retained data samples in the feature space, with the forgotten and the
paired augmented samples acting as positive pairs, while the retained samples
act as negative pairs in the contrastive loss computation. Experimental
evaluations reveal that our proposed method yields much-improved unlearning
efficacy with negligible performance loss compared to state-of-the-art
approaches, indicative of its usability in supervised and self-supervised
settings.

### [246] [Forgetting: A New Mechanism Towards Better Large Language Model Fine-tuning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04329)
*Ali Taheri Ghahrizjani,Alireza Taban,Qizhou Wang,Shanshan Ye,Abdolreza Mirzaei,Tongliang Liu,Bo Han*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a supervised fine-tuning approach for large language models that explicitly differentiates between useful (positive) and misleading (negative) tokens, aiming to improve model performance by training on the former and forgetting the latter.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation behind the paper is to address the dependency of supervised fine-tuning on high volumes and quality of training data, which can lead to inefficiencies or performance degradation when these conditions are not met.

Method: The method involves categorizing tokens into positive and negative classes within training data and employing forgetting mechanisms for negative tokens, ensuring the model focuses on learning meaningful and relevant information.

Result: Experiments on established benchmarks demonstrate that the forgetting mechanism enhances overall model performance and fosters more diverse responses.

Conclusion: Token categorization and forgetting mechanisms enable better supervised fine-tuning of large language models by improving their learning precision and output diversity.

Abstract: Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) plays a critical role for pretrained large
language models (LLMs), notably enhancing their capacity to acquire
domain-specific knowledge while preserving or potentially augmenting their
general-purpose capabilities. However, the efficacy of SFT hinges on data
quality as well as data volume, otherwise it may result in limited performance
gains or even degradation relative to the associated baselines. To mitigate
such reliance, we suggest categorizing tokens within each corpus into two parts
-- positive and negative tokens -- based on whether they are useful to improve
model performance. Positive tokens can be trained in common ways, whereas
negative tokens, which may lack essential semantics or be misleading, should be
explicitly forgotten. Overall, the token categorization facilitate the model to
learn less informative message, and the forgetting process shapes a knowledge
boundary to guide the model on what information to learn more precisely. We
conduct experiments on well-established benchmarks, finding that this
forgetting mechanism not only improves overall model performance and also
facilitate more diverse model responses.

*Zihan Liu,Jiayi Wen,Shouhong Tan,Zhirun Zheng,Cheng Huang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PrivDFS introduces distributed feature sharing for privacy-preserving machine learning by partitioning client data across multiple independent servers, mitigating the trade-off between privacy and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses privacy concerns in cloud-based Machine Learning as a Service, where current methods either suffer from high computational overhead or vulnerability to inversion attacks.

Method: The proposed PrivDFS partitions input features into multiple balanced shares distributed to independent servers, combined with adversarial training and user-specific keys to enhance privacy and resiliency to attacks.

Result: PrivDFS demonstrated high privacy with reduced client computation (up to 100x improvement) and no accuracy loss on benchmarks such as CIFAR-10 and CelebA, even against robust attacks.

Conclusion: PrivDFS achieves an efficient balance between strong privacy protections and computational efficiency, advancing privacy-preserving machine learning in practical scenarios.

Abstract: Cloud-based Machine Learning as a Service (MLaaS) raises serious privacy
concerns when handling sensitive client data. Existing Private Inference (PI)
methods face a fundamental trade-off between privacy and efficiency:
cryptographic approaches offer strong protection but incur high computational
overhead, while efficient alternatives such as split inference expose
intermediate features to inversion attacks. We propose PrivDFS, a new paradigm
for private inference that replaces a single exposed representation with
distributed feature sharing. PrivDFS partitions input features on the client
into multiple balanced shares, which are distributed to non-colluding,
non-communicating servers for independent partial inference. The client
securely aggregates the servers' outputs to reconstruct the final prediction,
ensuring that no single server observes sufficient information to compromise
input privacy. To further strengthen privacy, we propose two key extensions:
PrivDFS-AT, which uses adversarial training with a diffusion-based proxy
attacker to enforce inversion-resistant feature partitioning, and PrivDFS-KD,
which leverages user-specific keys to diversify partitioning policies and
prevent query-based inversion generalization. Experiments on CIFAR-10 and
CelebA demonstrate that PrivDFS achieves privacy comparable to deep split
inference while cutting client computation by up to 100 times with no accuracy
loss, and that the extensions remain robust against both diffusion-based
in-distribution and adaptive attacks.

*Zahra Ebrahimi,Raheleh Salehi,Nassir Navab,Carsten Marr,Ario Sadafi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes a novel continual learning method specifically designed for multiple instance learning (MIL), focusing on single-cell-based hematologic disease diagnosis like leukemia.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Continual learning methods face challenges with MIL scenarios, particularly in maintaining performance without catastrophic forgetting when applied to evolving data streams in labs and clinics.

Method: The method is rehearsal-based, selectively storing instances from various data bags using instance attention scores and their proximity to bag and class mean vectors to ensure a diverse and representative sample from past tasks.

Result: The proposed method outperformed existing state-of-the-art continual learning techniques in a real-world context using leukemia lab data, demonstrating its suitability for class incremental learning scenarios in dynamic datasets.

Conclusion: This study provides the first continual learning solution for MIL, enabling the adaptation of machine learning models to temporal shifts in data distributions in clinical and laboratory settings.

Abstract: The dynamic environment of laboratories and clinics, with streams of data
arriving on a daily basis, requires regular updates of trained machine learning
models for consistent performance. Continual learning is supposed to help train
models without catastrophic forgetting. However, state-of-the-art methods are
ineffective for multiple instance learning (MIL), which is often used in
single-cell-based hematologic disease diagnosis (e.g., leukemia detection).
Here, we propose the first continual learning method tailored specifically to
MIL. Our method is rehearsal-based over a selection of single instances from
various bags. We use a combination of the instance attention score and distance
from the bag mean and class mean vectors to carefully select which samples and
instances to store in exemplary sets from previous tasks, preserving the
diversity of the data. Using the real-world input of one month of data from a
leukemia laboratory, we study the effectiveness of our approach in a class
incremental scenario, comparing it to well-known continual learning methods. We
show that our method considerably outperforms state-of-the-art methods,
providing the first continual learning approach for MIL. This enables the
adaptation of models to shifting data distributions over time, such as those
caused by changes in disease occurrence or underlying genetic alterations.

*Hao Zhang,Aining Jia,Weifeng Bu,Yushu Cai,Kai Sheng,Hao Chen,Xin He*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FlexQ is a novel INT6 quantization framework for LLMs offering near-FP16 accuracy and enhanced inference efficiency, addressing limitations in existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To reduce the significant memory and computational costs of large language models while maintaining accuracy and improving inference efficiency.

Method: FlexQ employs post-training INT6 quantization, combining uniform 6-bit weight quantization with adaptive 8-bit activations using layer-wise sensitivity analysis. It incorporates specialized GPU kernel optimizations for efficient matrix multiplication.

Result: FlexQ achieves near-FP16 accuracy with minimal perplexity increase, delivering a 1.39x speedup over ABQ-LLM and 1.33x inference acceleration alongside 1.21x memory savings compared to SmoothQuant.

Conclusion: FlexQ successfully bridges the gap between efficiency and accuracy, providing a cost-effective solution for deploying LLMs without requiring native hardware support for INT6.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate exceptional performance but entail
significant memory and computational costs, restricting their practical
deployment. While existing INT4/INT8 quantization reduces these costs, they
often degrade accuracy or lack optimal efficiency. INT6 quantization offers a
superior trade-off between model accuracy and inference efficiency, but lacks
hardware support in modern GPUs, forcing emulation via higher-precision
arithmetic units that limit acceleration.
  In this paper, we propose FlexQ, a novel post-training INT6 quantization
framework combining algorithmic innovation with system-level optimizations.
FlexQ employs uniform 6-bit weight quantization across all layers, with
adaptive retention of 8-bit activations in layers identified through layer-wise
sensitivity analysis. To maximize hardware efficiency, we develop a specialized
high-performance GPU kernel supporting matrix multiplication for W6A6 and W6A8
representations via Binary Tensor Core (BTC) equivalents, effectively bypassing
the lack of native INT6 tensor cores. Evaluations on LLaMA models show FlexQ
maintains near-FP16 accuracy, with perplexity increases of no more than 0.05.
The proposed kernel achieves an average 1.39$\times$ speedup over ABQ-LLM on
LLaMA-2-70B linear layers. End-to-end, FlexQ delivers 1.33$\times$ inference
acceleration and 1.21$\times$ memory savings over SmoothQuant. Code is released

*Md Raisul Kibria,Sébastien Lafond,Janan Arslan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper reviews explainability in multimodal AI models (2020–2024) and discusses gaps, challenges, and provides recommendations to improve explainability and evaluation practices.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Interpretability in multimodal AI systems is crucial for transparency, accountability, and responsible deployment, especially as these models grow in complexity and real-world application.

Method: A systematic literature review, analyzing multimodal explainability techniques across dimensions like architecture, modalities, explanation strategies, and evaluations (2020–2024).

Result: Vision-language and language-only models dominate explainability research. Evaluation methods are inconsistent and lack domain-specific considerations. Current approaches fail to fully capture cross-modality interactions.

Conclusion: Recommendations are provided for creating more systematic, robust, and transparent evaluation and reporting practices to advance explainability and accountability in multimodal AI research.

Abstract: Multimodal learning has witnessed remarkable advancements in recent years,
particularly with the integration of attention-based models, leading to
significant performance gains across a variety of tasks. Parallel to this
progress, the demand for explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) has spurred
a growing body of research aimed at interpreting the complex decision-making
processes of these models. This systematic literature review analyzes research
published between January 2020 and early 2024 that focuses on the
explainability of multimodal models. Framed within the broader goals of XAI, we
examine the literature across multiple dimensions, including model
architecture, modalities involved, explanation algorithms and evaluation
methodologies. Our analysis reveals that the majority of studies are
concentrated on vision-language and language-only models, with attention-based
techniques being the most commonly employed for explanation. However, these
methods often fall short in capturing the full spectrum of interactions between
modalities, a challenge further compounded by the architectural heterogeneity
across domains. Importantly, we find that evaluation methods for XAI in
multimodal settings are largely non-systematic, lacking consistency,
robustness, and consideration for modality-specific cognitive and contextual
factors. Based on these findings, we provide a comprehensive set of
recommendations aimed at promoting rigorous, transparent, and standardized
evaluation and reporting practices in multimodal XAI research. Our goal is to
support future research in more interpretable, accountable, and responsible
mulitmodal AI systems, with explainability at their core.

*Biao Hu,Guoyin Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CMCFAE is a novel generative model combining cloud model theory with Wasserstein Auto-Encoder, effectively modeling complex data distributions and enhancing performance in reconstruction, latent space structure, and sample diversity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations of standard Gaussian priors and divergence measures in autoencoder-based generative models, specifically homogenization in reconstructed samples.

Method: Integrates cloud model characteristics as priors into the WAE framework, proposing a new regularizer that leverages cloud model theory for latent space structuring.

Result: Improved performance in reconstruction quality, better latent space structuring, and enhanced sample diversity, demonstrated on datasets like MNIST, FashionMNIST, CIFAR-10, and CelebA.

Conclusion: CMCFAE successfully merges cloud model theory with MMD-based regularization, offering a flexible latent space representation and establishing a new direction for generative model development.

Abstract: We introduce Cloud Model Characteristic Function Auto-Encoder (CMCFAE), a
novel generative model that integrates the cloud model into the Wasserstein
Auto-Encoder (WAE) framework. By leveraging the characteristic functions of the
cloud model to regularize the latent space, our approach enables more accurate
modeling of complex data distributions. Unlike conventional methods that rely
on a standard Gaussian prior and traditional divergence measures, our method
employs a cloud model prior, providing a more flexible and realistic
representation of the latent space, thus mitigating the homogenization observed
in reconstructed samples. We derive the characteristic function of the cloud
model and propose a corresponding regularizer within the WAE framework.
Extensive quantitative and qualitative evaluations on MNIST, FashionMNIST,
CIFAR-10, and CelebA demonstrate that CMCFAE outperforms existing models in
terms of reconstruction quality, latent space structuring, and sample
diversity. This work not only establishes a novel integration of cloud model
theory with MMD-based regularization but also offers a promising new
perspective for enhancing autoencoder-based generative models.

### [252] [Automatic LLM Red Teaming](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04451)
*Roman Belaire,Arunesh Sinha,Pradeep Varakantham*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel strategy for AI systems to identify vulnerabilities in Large Language Models (LLMs) using a hierarchical Reinforcement Learning approach for multi-turn adversarial dialogues instead of brittle templates or single-turn tests.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation behind this work is to address the limitations of current methods in red teaming LLMs that fail to account for complex, interactive adversarial dialogues and to improve the robustness of AI systems.

Method: The authors formalize the red teaming process as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) and employ hierarchical Reinforcement Learning to train generative agents for coherent multi-turn attack strategies based on token-level harm rewards.

Result: The paper achieves a state-of-the-art performance in identifying vulnerabilities in LLMs by reframing the red teaming approach as a dynamic, trajectory-based process.

Conclusion: The research highlights that dynamic, multi-turn, and trajectory-based red teaming is crucial for robust AI deployment and provides a scalable framework for strengthening LLM integrity.

Abstract: Red teaming is critical for identifying vulnerabilities and building trust in
current LLMs. However, current automated methods for Large Language Models
(LLMs) rely on brittle prompt templates or single-turn attacks, failing to
capture the complex, interactive nature of real-world adversarial dialogues. We
propose a novel paradigm: training an AI to strategically `break' another AI.
By formalizing red teaming as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) and employing a
hierarchical Reinforcement Learning (RL) framework, we effectively address the
inherent sparse reward and long-horizon challenges. Our generative agent learns
coherent, multi-turn attack strategies through a fine-grained, token-level harm
reward, enabling it to uncover subtle vulnerabilities missed by existing
baselines. This approach sets a new state-of-the-art, fundamentally reframing
LLM red teaming as a dynamic, trajectory-based process (rather than a one-step
test) essential for robust AI deployment.

### [253] [Small transformer architectures for task switching](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04461)
*Claudius Gros*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper studies how different attention-based and traditional architectures perform in a 'task switching' scenario involving interspersed control tokens. Transformers, LSTMs, and MLPs show only modest accuracy, but the cisformer and extensive attention models achieve high performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to explore the efficacy of attention-based models for small-scale tasks where traditional approaches often outperform newer architectures, focusing on 'task switching' problems.

Method: The authors evaluate various models, including standard transformers, LSTMs, MLPs, cisformers, and extensive attention models, on a 'task switching' problem involving subtasks like increment, addition, reverse copy, and context.

Result: Transformers, LSTMs, and MLPs show similar limited prediction accuracy, while the cisformer model combined with extensive attention achieves remarkable accuracy of around 95%.

Conclusion: Attention mechanisms can be enhanced and better understood by comparing different architectural formulations in complex, small-scale scenarios like task-switching.

Abstract: The rapid progress seen in terms of large-scale generative AI is largely
based on the attention mechanism. It is conversely non-trivial to conceive
small-scale applications for which attention-based architectures outperform
traditional approaches, such as multi-layer perceptrons or recurrent networks.
We examine this problem in the context of 'task switching'. In this framework
models work on ongoing token sequences with the current task being determined
by stochastically interspersed control tokens. We show that standard
transformers cannot solve a basic task switching reference model based on
finite domain arithmetics which contains subtasks dedicated to increment /
addition / reverse copy / context (IARC). We show that transformers, long
short-term memory recurrent networks (LSTM), and plain multi-layer perceptrons
(MLPs) achieve similar, but only modest prediction accuracies. We enlarge our
comparative study by including an extension of the standard transformer
architecture to its non-translational invariant counterpart, the cisformer, and
an alternative attention mechanism, extensive attention. A combination of the
latter is found to be the only model able to achieve considerable performance
levels, of around 95%. Our results indicate that the workings of attention can
be understood better, and even improved, when comparing qualitatively different
formulations in task-switching settings.

*Enyu Zhou,Kai Sheng,Hao Chen,Xin He*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a new speculative decoding framework called CARD that separates the drafting and verification stages to improve inference efficiency in large language model (LLM) acceleration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing speculative decoding (SD) methods are hindered by inefficiency due to the sequential 'draft-then-verify' paradigm and wastage caused by discarding candidate sequences with any rejected token, leading to suboptimal inference performance.

Method: The proposed framework, CARD, uses a 'query-and-correct' paradigm. A cache-based approach allows the draft model to populate a shared cache for candidate tokens, while the target model simultaneously corrects the generation direction without sequential dependency.

Result: CARD achieves up to a 4.83x speedup over vanilla decoding and requires no fine-tuning of either the draft or target models.

Conclusion: The CARD framework provides a significant efficiency boost for LLM inference by decoupling drafting and verifying processes, setting a new standard in speculative decoding.

Abstract: Speculative decoding (SD), where an extra draft model first provides multiple
draft tokens and the original target model then verifies these tokens in
parallel, has shown great power for LLM inference acceleration. However,
existing SD methods must adhere to the 'draft-then-verify' paradigm, which
forces drafting and verification processes to execute sequentially during SD,
resulting in inefficient inference performance and limiting the size of the
draft model. Furthermore, once a single token in the candidate sequence is
rejected during the drafting process, all subsequent candidate tokens must be
discarded, leading to inefficient drafting. To address these challenges, we
propose a cache-based parallel speculative decoding framework employing a
'query-and-correct' paradigm. Specifically, CARD decouples drafting and
verification: the draft model generates candidate tokens to populate a shared
cache, while the target model concurrently rectifies the draft model's
generation direction. This effectively enables the target model to perform
inference at speed approaching that of the draft model. Our approach achieves
up to 4.83 speedup over vanilla decoding without requiring fine-tuning of
either the draft or target models. Our code is available at

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: GFocal introduces a Transformer-based neural operator effectively tackling PDEs with multiscale problems using simultaneous global and local feature learning and fusion.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing transformer-based methods lack coordinated learning between local and global physical features, compromising their accuracy and long-term stability in multiscale problems.

Method: GFocal utilizes Nyström attention-based global blocks for capturing broad correlations, slices-based focal blocks for extracting local features, and convolution-based gating for dynamic multiscale fusion.

Result: GFocal achieves a 15.2% relative performance gain on five out of six benchmarks while excelling in complex industry-scale simulations like aerodynamics.

Conclusion: GFocal demonstrates the feasibility and superiority of simultaneous global-local learning for neural operators, showing potential for real-world engineering simulations.

Abstract: Transformer-based neural operators have emerged as promising surrogate
solvers for partial differential equations, by leveraging the effectiveness of
Transformers for capturing long-range dependencies and global correlations,
profoundly proven in language modeling. However, existing methodologies
overlook the coordinated learning of interdependencies between local physical
details and global features, which are essential for tackling multiscale
problems, preserving physical consistency and numerical stability in long-term
rollouts, and accurately capturing transitional dynamics. In this work, we
propose GFocal, a Transformer-based neural operator method that enforces
simultaneous global and local feature learning and fusion. Global correlations
and local features are harnessed through Nystr\"{o}m attention-based
\textbf{g}lobal blocks and slices-based \textbf{focal} blocks to generate
physics-aware tokens, subsequently modulated and integrated via
convolution-based gating blocks, enabling dynamic fusion of multiscale
information. GFocal achieves accurate modeling and prediction of physical
features given arbitrary geometries and initial conditions. Experiments show
that GFocal achieves state-of-the-art performance with an average 15.2\%
relative gain in five out of six benchmarks and also excels in industry-scale
simulations such as aerodynamics simulation of automotives and airfoils.

TL;DR: The paper introduces FedHiP, a Federated Learning framework utilizing closed-form, gradient-free solutions to combat data heterogeneity and improve client personalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address performance degradation in Personalized Federated Learning caused by data heterogeneity and reliance on gradient-based updates.

Method: The FedHiP framework includes a self-supervised pre-training phase for feature extraction, followed by a gradient-free analytic classifier for training, supporting local and global personalization.

Result: FedHiP demonstrates superior accuracy on benchmarks, outperforming existing methods by at least 5.79%-20.97%.

Conclusion: FedHiP provides a heterogeneity-invariant solution to Personalized Federated Learning using closed-form solutions, achieving significant performance gains and robustness to non-IID data.

Abstract: Lately, Personalized Federated Learning (PFL) has emerged as a prevalent
paradigm to deliver personalized models by collaboratively training while
simultaneously adapting to each client's local applications. Existing PFL
methods typically face a significant challenge due to the ubiquitous data
heterogeneity (i.e., non-IID data) across clients, which severely hinders
convergence and degrades performance. We identify that the root issue lies in
the long-standing reliance on gradient-based updates, which are inherently
sensitive to non-IID data. To fundamentally address this issue and bridge the
research gap, in this paper, we propose a Heterogeneity-invariant Personalized
Federated learning scheme, named FedHiP, through analytical (i.e., closed-form)
solutions to avoid gradient-based updates. Specifically, we exploit the trend
of self-supervised pre-training, leveraging a foundation model as a frozen
backbone for gradient-free feature extraction. Following the feature extractor,
we further develop an analytic classifier for gradient-free training. To
support both collective generalization and individual personalization, our
FedHiP scheme incorporates three phases: analytic local training, analytic
global aggregation, and analytic local personalization. The closed-form
solutions of our FedHiP scheme enable its ideal property of heterogeneity
invariance, meaning that each personalized model remains identical regardless
of how non-IID the data are distributed across all other clients. Extensive
experiments on benchmark datasets validate the superiority of our FedHiP
scheme, outperforming the state-of-the-art baselines by at least 5.79%-20.97%
in accuracy.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper investigates the effectiveness of wall insulation on reducing gas consumption using English housing data, revealing heterogeneous impacts across energy burden groups.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the effectiveness and equity of domestic energy efficiency interventions in reducing costs and mitigating climate impacts.

Method: A causal machine learning model applied to nationally representative data to evaluate average and conditional effects of wall insulation.

Result: On average, wall insulation reduces gas demand by up to 19%, with significant savings for low energy burden groups and little impact on high burden groups.

Conclusion: While wall insulation interventions are beneficial overall, their effects are unequal across households. Energy policy needs to integrate both climate and equity considerations.

Abstract: Reducing domestic energy demand is central to climate mitigation and fuel
poverty strategies, yet the impact of energy efficiency interventions is highly
heterogeneous. Using a causal machine learning model trained on nationally
representative data of the English housing stock, we estimate average and
conditional treatment effects of wall insulation on gas consumption, focusing
on distributional effects across energy burden subgroups. While interventions
reduce gas demand on average (by as much as 19 percent), low energy burden
groups achieve substantial savings, whereas those experiencing high energy
burdens see little to no reduction. This pattern reflects a
behaviourally-driven mechanism: households constrained by high costs-to-income
ratios (e.g. more than 0.1) reallocate savings toward improved thermal comfort
rather than lowering consumption. Far from wasteful, such responses represent
rational adjustments in contexts of prior deprivation, with potential
co-benefits for health and well-being. These findings call for a broader
evaluation framework that accounts for both climate impacts and the equity
implications of domestic energy policy.

### [258] [Hierarchical Scoring for Machine Learning Classifier Error Impact Evaluation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04489)
*Erin Lanus,Daniel Wolodkin,Laura J. Freeman*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces hierarchical scoring metrics for machine learning models, allowing partial credit for predictions based on their distance from ground truth, providing finer-grained performance evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional evaluation methods for ML models treat all misclassifications equally, which does not reflect the nuanced impact of different types of errors. Hierarchical metrics aim to address this limitation by incorporating relationships among class labels.

Method: The authors develop hierarchical scoring metrics using scoring trees that represent relationships among class labels. They test these metrics on an abstract use case using different weighting strategies.

Result: Results show that hierarchical scoring metrics capture the severity and type of errors with finer granularity. Scoring trees prove adjustable, enabling tailored evaluation of errors.

Conclusion: Hierarchical scoring metrics provide a nuanced and flexible approach to evaluate ML models based on the type and impact of errors, rather than a simple error count.

Abstract: A common use of machine learning (ML) models is predicting the class of a
sample. Object detection is an extension of classification that includes
localization of the object via a bounding box within the sample.
Classification, and by extension object detection, is typically evaluated by
counting a prediction as incorrect if the predicted label does not match the
ground truth label. This pass/fail scoring treats all misclassifications as
equivalent. In many cases, class labels can be organized into a class taxonomy
with a hierarchical structure to either reflect relationships among the data or
operator valuation of misclassifications. When such a hierarchical structure
exists, hierarchical scoring metrics can return the model performance of a
given prediction related to the distance between the prediction and the ground
truth label. Such metrics can be viewed as giving partial credit to predictions
instead of pass/fail, enabling a finer-grained understanding of the impact of
misclassifications. This work develops hierarchical scoring metrics varying in
complexity that utilize scoring trees to encode relationships between class
labels and produce metrics that reflect distance in the scoring tree. The
scoring metrics are demonstrated on an abstract use case with scoring trees
that represent three weighting strategies and evaluated by the kind of errors
discouraged. Results demonstrate that these metrics capture errors with finer
granularity and the scoring trees enable tuning. This work demonstrates an
approach to evaluating ML performance that ranks models not only by how many
errors are made but by the kind or impact of errors. Python implementations of
the scoring metrics will be available in an open-source repository at time of
publication.

*Abi Aryan,Zac Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a framework, "Causal Reflection," to improve LLMs and RL agents by enabling better causal reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs and RL agents struggle with causal reasoning, limiting their ability to robustly navigate environments with delayed and nonlinear effects.

Method: The authors propose "Causal Reflection," which dynamically models causality (state, action, time, and perturbation) and introduces a "Reflect" mechanism to adjust internal models by generating causal hypotheses.

Result: The framework enhances the agent's ability to self-correct and understand causality, and leverages LLMs for structured inference and explanation.

Conclusion: Causal Reflection creates agents capable of adaptive, self-corrective behavior with a deeper understanding of causality, opening paths for handling complex, evolving environments.

Abstract: While LLMs exhibit impressive fluency and factual recall, they struggle with
robust causal reasoning, often relying on spurious correlations and brittle
patterns. Similarly, traditional Reinforcement Learning agents also lack causal
understanding, optimizing for rewards without modeling why actions lead to
outcomes. We introduce Causal Reflection, a framework that explicitly models
causality as a dynamic function over state, action, time, and perturbation,
enabling agents to reason about delayed and nonlinear effects. Additionally, we
define a formal Reflect mechanism that identifies mismatches between predicted
and observed outcomes and generates causal hypotheses to revise the agent's
internal model. In this architecture, LLMs serve not as black-box reasoners,
but as structured inference engines translating formal causal outputs into
natural language explanations and counterfactuals. Our framework lays the
theoretical groundwork for Causal Reflective agents that can adapt,
self-correct, and communicate causal understanding in evolving environments.

### [260] [PRISM: Lightweight Multivariate Time-Series Classification through Symmetric Multi-Resolution Convolutional Layers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04503)
*Federico Zucchi,Thomas Lampert*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PRISM, a convolutional-based feature extractor, provides accurate solutions for multivariate time-series classification with lower complexity and computational cost than existing CNN or Transformer models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multivariate time-series classification suffers from resource-heavy models with limited frequency diversity and extensive parameter demands.

Method: PRISM uses symmetric finite-impulse-response (FIR) filters per channel to achieve multi-resolution frequency embeddings, avoiding inter-channel convolutions.

Result: PRISM matches or outperforms leading CNN and Transformer models across diverse benchmarks, achieving this with significantly fewer parameters and FLOPs.

Conclusion: By combining classical signal processing insights with modern deep learning methods, PRISM delivers both accuracy and resource efficiency for time-series classification.

Abstract: Multivariate time-series classification is pivotal in domains ranging from
wearable sensing to biomedical monitoring. Despite recent advances,
Transformer- and CNN-based models often remain computationally heavy, offer
limited frequency diversity, and require extensive parameter budgets. We
propose PRISM (Per-channel Resolution-Informed Symmetric Module), a
convolutional-based feature extractor that applies symmetric
finite-impulse-response (FIR) filters at multiple temporal scales,
independently per channel. This multi-resolution, per-channel design yields
highly frequency-selective embeddings without any inter-channel convolutions,
greatly reducing model size and complexity. Across human-activity, sleep-stage
and biomedical benchmarks, PRISM, paired with lightweight classification heads,
matches or outperforms leading CNN and Transformer baselines, while using
roughly an order of magnitude fewer parameters and FLOPs. By uniting classical
signal processing insights with modern deep learning, PRISM offers an accurate,
resource-efficient solution for multivariate time-series classification.

### [261] [Channel-Independent Federated Traffic Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04517)
*Mo Zhang,Xiaoyu Li,Bin Xu,Meng Chen,Yongshun Gong*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper addresses inefficiencies in federated traffic prediction methods, specifically their high communication overhead, by introducing Fed-CI—a framework that eliminates inter-client communication and relies on local data processing. Fed-CI achieves better accuracy with reduced communication costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Challenges with existing traffic prediction methods arise due to privacy constraints, high communication overhead, and resource consumption as data volumes grow.

Method: The proposed technique, Channel-Independent Paradigm (CIP), enables local traffic prediction without requiring inter-client communication. Fed-CI uses CIP to ensure privacy compliance while enhancing efficiency.

Result: Fed-CI outperformed traditional methods in experiments, showing significant accuracy improvements (8% in RMSE, 14% in MAE, 16% in MAPE) and reduced communication overhead across various datasets.

Conclusion: Fed-CI ensures efficient and accurate federated traffic prediction with reduced communication requirements, making it scalable and compliant with privacy regulations.

Abstract: In recent years, traffic prediction has achieved remarkable success and has
become an integral component of intelligent transportation systems. However,
traffic data is typically distributed among multiple data owners, and privacy
constraints prevent the direct utilization of these isolated datasets for
traffic prediction. Most existing federated traffic prediction methods focus on
designing communication mechanisms that allow models to leverage information
from other clients in order to improve prediction accuracy. Unfortunately, such
approaches often incur substantial communication overhead, and the resulting
transmission delays significantly slow down the training process. As the volume
of traffic data continues to grow, this issue becomes increasingly critical,
making the resource consumption of current methods unsustainable. To address
this challenge, we propose a novel variable relationship modeling paradigm for
federated traffic prediction, termed the Channel-Independent Paradigm(CIP).
Unlike traditional approaches, CIP eliminates the need for inter-client
communication by enabling each node to perform efficient and accurate
predictions using only local information. Based on the CIP, we further develop
Fed-CI, an efficient federated learning framework, allowing each client to
process its own data independently while effectively mitigating the information
loss caused by the lack of direct data sharing among clients. Fed-CI
significantly reduces communication overhead, accelerates the training process,
and achieves state-of-the-art performance while complying with privacy
regulations. Extensive experiments on multiple real-world datasets demonstrate
that Fed-CI consistently outperforms existing methods across all datasets and
federated settings. It achieves improvements of 8%, 14%, and 16% in RMSE, MAE,
and MAPE, respectively, while also substantially reducing communication costs.

### [262] [Privacy Risk Predictions Based on Fundamental Understanding of Personal Data and an Evolving Threat Landscape](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04542)
*Haoran Niu,K. Suzanne Barber*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The study examines privacy risks by analyzing 5,000 identity theft cases, building a graph-based model to predict the likelihood of linked personal data exposures using graph neural networks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of protecting personal information by understanding the privacy risks associated with the exposure of certain types of personally identifiable information (PII).

Method: The research constructs an Identity Ecosystem graph to model PII relationships and develops a prediction framework that applies graph theory and graph neural networks to assess the risk of cascading disclosures.

Result: The framework successfully predicts whether the exposure of one identity attribute can lead to the disclosure of another, providing key insights into privacy risk dynamics.

Conclusion: The graph-based approach effectively identifies and predicts pathways of PII exposure, offering a tool to improve privacy protection strategies.

Abstract: It is difficult for individuals and organizations to protect personal
information without a fundamental understanding of relative privacy risks. By
analyzing over 5,000 empirical identity theft and fraud cases, this research
identifies which types of personal data are exposed, how frequently exposures
occur, and what the consequences of those exposures are. We construct an
Identity Ecosystem graph--a foundational, graph-based model in which nodes
represent personally identifiable information (PII) attributes and edges
represent empirical disclosure relationships between them (e.g., the
probability that one PII attribute is exposed due to the exposure of another).
Leveraging this graph structure, we develop a privacy risk prediction framework
that uses graph theory and graph neural networks to estimate the likelihood of
further disclosures when certain PII attributes are compromised. The results
show that our approach effectively answers the core question: Can the
disclosure of a given identity attribute possibly lead to the disclosure of
another attribute?

### [263] [GP and LLMs for Program Synthesis: No Clear Winners](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03966)
*Jose Guadalupe Hernandez,Anil Kumar Saini,Gabriel Ketron,Jason H. Moore*

Main category: cs.NE

TL;DR: This paper compares Genetic Programming (PushGP) and GPT-4o in solving programming tasks using examples, textual descriptions, or both.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to explore and compare the effectiveness of differing approaches—examples-only, text-only, and combined data-text—used by GP and LLM in programming task synthesis.

Method: They used tasks from the PSB2 benchmark suite and tested PushGP and GPT-4o with various prompt styles and training set sizes, analyzing success rates and program similarities.

Result: PushGP and GPT-4o combined with data-text prompts solved 23 out of 25 tasks, and performance was affected by the specificity of prompt styles and training set size.

Conclusion: No single program synthesizer dominated, demonstrating the complementary strengths of optimization techniques between PushGP and LLMs.

Abstract: Genetic programming (GP) and large language models (LLMs) differ in how
program specifications are provided: GP uses input-output examples, and LLMs
use text descriptions. In this work, we compared the ability of PushGP and
GPT-4o to synthesize computer programs for tasks from the PSB2 benchmark suite.
We used three prompt variants with GPT-4o: input-output examples (data-only),
textual description of the task (text-only), and a combination of both textual
descriptions and input-output examples (data-text). Additionally, we varied the
number of input-output examples available for building programs. For each
synthesizer and task combination, we compared success rates across all program
synthesizers, as well as the similarity between successful GPT-4o synthesized
programs. We found that the combination of PushGP and GPT-4o with data-text
prompting led to the greatest number of tasks solved (23 of the 25 tasks), even
though several tasks were solved exclusively by only one of the two
synthesizers. We also observed that PushGP and GPT-4o with data-only prompting
solved fewer tasks with the decrease in the training set size, while the
remaining synthesizers saw no decrease. We also detected significant
differences in similarity between the successful programs synthesized for
GPT-4o with text-only and data-only prompting. With there being no dominant
program synthesizer, this work highlights the importance of different
optimization techniques used by PushGP and LLMs to synthesize programs.

### [264] [STARE: Predicting Decision Making Based on Spatio-Temporal Eye Movements](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04148)
*Moshe Unger,Alexander Tuzhilin,Michel Wedel*

Main category: cs.NE

TL;DR: The study introduces the STARE architecture, a Deep Learning model for predicting consumer behavior from eye-tracking data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There are currently no foundational models to predict consumer behaviors based on eye-movement time series.

Method: STARE employs a novel tokenization strategy to represent spatio-temporal eye-tracking data, leveraging the Chronos foundation model with co-/cross-attention mechanisms.

Result: STARE is evaluated against state-of-the-art alternatives using multiple datasets focused on consumer choice behavior prediction.

Conclusion: This work lays the groundwork for DL architectures that align visual attention dynamics with neurophysiological properties of eye movements.

Abstract: The present work proposes a Deep Learning architecture for the prediction of
various consumer choice behaviors from time series of raw gaze or eye fixations
on images of the decision environment, for which currently no foundational
models are available. The architecture, called STARE (Spatio-Temporal Attention
Representation for Eye Tracking), uses a new tokenization strategy, which
involves mapping the x- and y- pixel coordinates of eye-movement time series on
predefined, contiguous Regions of Interest. That tokenization makes the
spatio-temporal eye-movement data available to the Chronos, a time-series
foundation model based on the T5 architecture, to which co-attention and/or
cross-attention is added to capture directional and/or interocular influences
of eye movements. We compare STARE with several state-of-the art alternatives
on multiple datasets with the purpose of predicting consumer choice behaviors
from eye movements. We thus make a first step towards developing and testing DL
architectures that represent visual attention dynamics rooted in the
neurophysiology of eye movements.

### [265] [TDSNNs: Competitive Topographic Deep Spiking Neural Networks for Visual Cortex Modeling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04270)
*Deming Zhou,Yuetong Fang,Zhaorui Wang,Renjing Xu*

Main category: cs.NE

TL;DR: The study introduces a novel loss function for spiking neural networks (SNNs) to enhance biological fidelity and computational performance, replicating the topographic organization of the primate visual cortex.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current deep artificial neural networks (ANNs) fail to account for temporal dynamics, resulting in diminished object recognition performance and reduced biological realism compared to the primate visual cortex.

Method: The method involves utilizing spiking neural networks and an innovative Spatio-Temporal Constraints (STC) loss function to achieve hierarchical spatial functional organization similar to the primate visual cortex.

Result: The proposed approach retains ImageNet top-1 accuracy and outperforms other topographic ANNs in brain-likeness while effectively processing temporal information and improving model robustness.

Conclusion: Topographic deep spiking neural networks (TDSNNs) strike a balance between computational efficiency and brain-like behavior, offering insights for neuroscience and developing robust deep learning models.

Abstract: The primate visual cortex exhibits topographic organization, where
functionally similar neurons are spatially clustered, a structure widely
believed to enhance neural processing efficiency. While prior works have
demonstrated that conventional deep ANNs can develop topographic
representations, these models largely neglect crucial temporal dynamics. This
oversight often leads to significant performance degradation in tasks like
object recognition and compromises their biological fidelity. To address this,
we leverage spiking neural networks (SNNs), which inherently capture
spike-based temporal dynamics and offer enhanced biological plausibility. We
propose a novel Spatio-Temporal Constraints (STC) loss function for topographic
deep spiking neural networks (TDSNNs), successfully replicating the
hierarchical spatial functional organization observed in the primate visual
cortex from low-level sensory input to high-level abstract representations. Our
results show that STC effectively generates representative topographic features
across simulated visual cortical areas. While introducing topography typically
leads to significant performance degradation in ANNs, our spiking architecture
exhibits a remarkably small performance drop (No drop in ImageNet top-1
accuracy, compared to a 3\% drop observed in TopoNet, which is the
best-performing topographic ANN so far) and outperforms topographic ANNs in
brain-likeness. We also reveal that topographic organization facilitates
efficient and stable temporal information processing via the spike mechanism in
TDSNNs, contributing to model robustness. These findings suggest that TDSNNs
offer a compelling balance between computational performance and brain-like
features, providing not only a framework for interpreting neural science
phenomena but also novel insights for designing more efficient and robust deep
learning models.

TL;DR: This paper introduces "Astromorphic Transformers," integrating neuron-synapse-astrocyte interactions to improve machine learning models in tasks like image classification, sentiment analysis, and natural language generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Astrocytes are an overlooked yet crucial component in brain-inspired neuromorphic computing. The study aims to incorporate astrocyte behaviors for creating more robust machine learning methods.

Method: The authors use bioplausible modeling of Hebbian and presynaptic plasticities in neuron-astrocyte networks. They map these biological computations to self-attention mechanisms in Transformers, evaluating their performance on multiple datasets.

Result: Their approach, Astromorphic Transformers, outperforms conventional models in sentiment analysis (IMDB), image classification (CIFAR10), and natural language generation (WikiText-2) tasks, offering better accuracy, learning speed, and perplexity.

Conclusion: Astromorphic Transformers hold promise for advancing machine learning by integrating bio-realistic neuron-astrocyte interactions, demonstrating improved stability, generalization, and computational efficiency across diverse tasks.

Abstract: Preliminary attempts at incorporating the critical role of astrocytes - cells
that constitute more than 50\% of human brain cells - in brain-inspired
neuromorphic computing remain in infancy. This paper seeks to delve deeper into
various key aspects of neuron-synapse-astrocyte interactions to mimic
self-attention mechanisms in Transformers. The cross-layer perspective explored
in this work involves bioplausible modeling of Hebbian and presynaptic
plasticities in neuron-astrocyte networks, incorporating effects of
non-linearities and feedback along with algorithmic formulations to map the
neuron-astrocyte computations to self-attention mechanism and evaluating the
impact of incorporating bio-realistic effects from the machine learning
application side. Our analysis on sentiment and image classification tasks
(IMDB and CIFAR10 datasets) highlights the advantages of Astromorphic
Transformers, offering improved accuracy and learning speed. Furthermore, the
model demonstrates strong natural language generation capabilities on the
WikiText-2 dataset, achieving better perplexity compared to conventional
models, thus showcasing enhanced generalization and stability across diverse
machine learning tasks.

### [267] [If-T: A Benchmark for Type Narrowing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03830)
*Hanwen Guo,Ben Greenman*

Main category: cs.PL

TL;DR: The paper introduces If-T, a language-agnostic benchmark to analyze type narrowing systems based on precision and performance criteria. It evaluates the ability of these systems to validate correct code and reject incorrect code across multiple typecheckers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Dynamic code often relies on runtime tests instead of datatype-driven designs, complicating static type systems in dynamic languages. The paper seeks to address the lack of standards and clarity surrounding type narrowing systems.

Method: The benchmark, If-T, evaluates type narrowing systems using simple programs across core dimensions derived from literature, language documentation, and experiments. It features both positive and negative examples for typechecking scenarios.

Result: Implementing If-T on five typecheckers reveals differences in capabilities, such as logical implication tracking and handling user-defined narrowing predicates. It highlights trade-offs between systems with varying complexity.

Conclusion: If-T helps researchers and designers measure the benefits and limitations of different type narrowing systems, facilitating better future designs that balance precision, usability, and performance.

Abstract: **Context:** The design of static type systems that can validate
dynamically-typed programs (**gradually**) is an ongoing challenge. A key
difficulty is that dynamic code rarely follows datatype-driven design. Programs
instead use runtime tests to narrow down the proper usage of incoming data.
Type systems for dynamic languages thus need a **type narrowing** mechanism
that refines the type environment along individual control paths based on
dominating tests, a form of flow-sensitive typing. In order to express
refinements, the type system must have some notion of sets and subsets. Since
set-theoretic types are computationally and ergonomically complex, the need for
type narrowing raises design questions about how to balance precision and
performance. **Inquiry:** To date, the design of type narrowing systems has
been driven by intuition, past experience, and examples from users in various
language communities. There is no standard that captures desirable and
undesirable behaviors. Prior formalizations of narrowing are also significantly
more complex than a standard type system, and it is unclear how the extra
complexity pays off in terms of concrete examples. This paper addresses the
problems through If-T, a language-agnostic **design benchmark** for type
narrowing that characterizes the abilities of implementations using simple
programs that draw attention to fundamental questions. Unlike a traditional
performance-focused benchmark, If-T measures a narrowing system's ability to
validate correct code and reject incorrect code. Unlike a test suite, systems
are not required to fully conform to If-T. Deviations are acceptable provided
they are justified by well-reasoned design considerations, such as compile-time
performance. **Approach:** If-T is guided by the literature on type narrowing,
the documentation of gradual languages such as TypeScript, and experiments with
typechecker implementations. We have identified a set of core technical
dimensions for type narrowing. For each dimension, the benchmark contains a set
of topics and (at least) two characterizing programs per topic: one that should
typecheck and one that should not typecheck. **Knowledge:** If-T provides a
baseline to measure type narrowing systems. For researchers, it provides
criteria to categorize future designs via its collection of positive and
negative examples. For language designers, the benchmark demonstrates the
payoff of typechecker complexity in terms of concrete examples. Designers can
use the examples to decide whether supporting a particular example is
worthwhile. Both the benchmark and its implementations are freely available
online. **Grounding:** We have implemented the benchmark for five typecheckers:
TypeScript, Flow, Typed Racket, mypy, and Pyright. The results highlight
important differences, such as the ability to track logical implications among
program variables and typechecking for user-defined narrowing predicates.
**Importance:** Type narrowing is essential for gradual type systems, but the
tradeoffs between systems with different complexity have been unclear. If-T
clarifies these tradeoffs by illustrating the benefits and limitations of each
level of complexity. With If-T as a way to assess implementations in a fair,
cross-language manner, future type system designs can strive for a better
balance among precision, annotation burden, and performance.

### [268] [A Type System for Data Privacy Compliance in Active Object Languages](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03831)
*Chinmayi Prabhu Baramashetru,Paola Giannini,Silvia Lizeth Tapia Tarifa,Olaf Owe*

Main category: cs.PL

TL;DR: The paper proposes a language-based framework that integrates GDPR compliance into programming systems through type checking, inference, and runtime constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of systematically integrating GDPR privacy principles, ensuring systems honor user consent and sensitive data constraints.

Method: A type system is designed for tracking authorized data flows and automating runtime GDPR compliance checks. The approach combines static and runtime techniques within an active object language.

Result: The approach successfully demonstrates compliance verification for GDPR requirements such as user consent and purpose limitation, supported by a soundness proof and examples.

Conclusion: This work offers a systematic, automated method for privacy-aware system design, advancing GDPR-compliant programming frameworks, with applications in critical domains like healthcare and finance.

Abstract: Data protection laws such as GDPR aim to give users unprecedented control
over their personal data. Compliance with these regulations requires
systematically considering information flow and interactions among entities
handling sensitive data. Privacy-by-design principles advocate embedding data
protection into system architectures as a default. However, translating these
abstract principles into concrete, explicit methods remains a significant
challenge. This paper addresses this gap by proposing a language-based approach
to privacy integration, combining static and runtime techniques. By employing
type checking and type inference in an active object language, the framework
enables the tracking of authorised data flows and the automatic generation of
constraints checked at runtime based on user consent. This ensures that
personal data is processed in compliance with GDPR constraints. The key
contribution of this work is a type system that gather the compliance checks
and the changes to users consent and integrates data privacy compliance
verification into system execution. The paper demonstrates the feasibility of
this approach through a soundness proof and several examples, illustrating how
the proposed language addresses common GDPR requirements, such as user consent,
purpose limitation, and data subject rights. This work advances the state of
the art in privacy-aware system design by offering a systematic and automated
method for integrating GDPR compliance into programming languages. This
capability has implications for building trustworthy systems in domains such as
healthcare or finance, where data privacy is crucial.

### [269] [Generating Inputs for Grammar Mining using Dynamic Symbolic Execution](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03832)
*Andreas Pointner,Josef Pichler,Herbert Prähofer*

Main category: cs.PL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a method to automatically generate inputs for grammar mining by combining Dynamic Symbolic Execution with novel mechanisms, producing grammars with high precision and recall, even for edge cases.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Maintaining accurate specifications for software components that parse structured input is difficult due to software evolution and incomplete available input data, leading to the need for effective grammar mining methods.

Method: The authors extend Dynamic Symbolic Execution with iterative expansion of inputs and a three-phase structured input generation to address its limitations in structured parsers.

Result: The proposed method achieves results comparable to state-of-the-art grammar miners and successfully identifies subtle features and edge cases in 11 benchmark applications.

Conclusion: The approach automates and improves grammar mining, reducing manual effort while increasing the robustness and comprehensiveness of generated grammars, benefiting software engineering tasks.

Abstract: A vast number of software systems include components that parse and process
structured input. In addition to programming languages, which are analyzed by
compilers or interpreters, there are numerous components that process
standardized or proprietary data formats of varying complexity. Even if such
components were initially developed and tested based on a specification, such
as a grammar, numerous modifications and adaptations over the course of
software evolution can make it impossible to precisely determine which inputs
they actually accept. In this situation, grammar mining can be used to
reconstruct the specification in the form of a grammar. Established approaches
already produce useful results, provided that sufficient input data is
available to fully cover the input language. However, achieving this
completeness is a major challenge. In practice, only input data recorded during
the operation of the software systems is available. If this data is used for
grammar mining, the resulting grammar reflects only the actual processed inputs
but not the complete grammar of the input language accepted by the software
component. As a result, edge cases or previously supported features that no
longer appear in the available input data are missing from the generated
grammar. This work addresses this challenge by introducing a novel approach for
the automatic generation of inputs for grammar mining. Although input
generators have already been used for fuzz testing, it remains unclear whether
they are also suitable for grammar miners. Building on the grammar miner Mimid,
this work presents a fully automated approach to input generation. The approach
leverages Dynamic Symbolic Execution (DSE) and extends it with two mechanisms
to overcome the limitations of DSE regarding structured input parsers. First,
the search for new inputs is guided by an iterative expansion that starts with
a single-character input and gradually extends it. Second, input generation is
structured into a novel three-phase approach, which separates the generation of
inputs for parser functions. The proposed method was evaluated against a
diverse set of eleven benchmark applications from the existing literature.
Results demonstrate that the approach achieves precision and recall for
extracted grammars close to those derived from state-of-the-art grammar miners
such as Mimid. Notably, it successfully uncovers subtle features and edge cases
in parsers that are typically missed by such grammar miners. The effectiveness
of the method is supported by empirical evidence, showing that it can achieve
high performance in various domains without requiring prior input samples. This
contribution is significant for researchers and practitioners in software
engineering, offering an automated, scalable, and precise solution for grammar
mining. By eliminating the need for manual input generation, the approach not
only reduces workload but also enhances the robustness and comprehensiveness of
the extracted grammars. Following this approach, software engineers can
reconstruct specification from existing (legacy) parsers.

### [270] [Weak Memory Model Formalisms: Introduction and Survey](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04115)
*Roger C. Su,Robert J. Colvin*

Main category: cs.PL

TL;DR: This paper is a survey of weak memory models, focusing on their specification, execution effects, tools, and formal reasoning approaches using operational and axiomatic semantics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Weak memory models arise due to microarchitecture features and compiler transformations, creating challenges for concurrent programming in critical software systems. A thorough formalization is essential for safety and security.

Method: The authors introduce formal representations (operational and axiomatic semantics) using simplified x86 examples, and survey hardware features, historical developments, computability, and future directions.

Result: The survey provides comprehensive insights into the field, discussing the tools, inference systems, and theoretical and practical aspects of weak memory models.

Conclusion: Understanding and improving weak memory model specifications is crucial for developing reliable low-level software and advancing concurrency tools and methodologies.

Abstract: Memory consistency models define the order in which accesses to shared memory
in a concurrent system may be observed to occur. Such models are a necessity
since program order is not a reliable indicator of execution order, due to
microarchitectural features or compiler transformations. Concurrent
programming, already a challenging task, is thus made even harder when weak
memory effects must be addressed. A rigorous specification of weak memory
models is therefore essential to make this problem tractable for developers of
safety- and security-critical, low-level software.
  In this paper we survey the field of formalisations of weak memory models,
including their specification, their effects on execution, and tools and
inference systems for reasoning about code. To assist the discussion we also
provide an introduction to two styles of formal representation found commonly
in the literature (using a much simplified version of Intel's x86 as the
example): a step-by-step construction of traces of the system (operational
semantics); and with respect to relations between memory events (axiomatic
semantics). The survey covers some long-standing hardware features that lead to
observable weak behaviours, a description of historical developments in
practice and in theory, an overview of computability and complexity results,
and outlines current and future directions in the field.

*Sanghun Jung,Daehoon Gwak,Byron Boots,James Hays*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper proposes a Neural Process-based method for real-time terrain elevation modeling that enhances accuracy in estimating sharp geometry changes and predictive uncertainties using sensor data and a computationally efficient attention mechanism.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurately modeling terrain elevation in real-time with quantified uncertainties is crucial for off-road navigation to ensure safe and reliable maneuver strategies.

Method: The method integrates Neural Processes for elevation modeling, employs semantic features from LiDAR and cameras for better interpolation/extrapolation, and introduces a local ball-query attention mechanism for reduced computational complexity.

Result: Evaluation on diverse off-road datasets (trails, deserts, hills) showed superior performance, improving accuracy and efficiency compared to baselines.

Conclusion: The proposed Neural Process-based approach effectively addresses limitations of existing methods and demonstrates significant potential for terrain modeling in complex off-road environments.

Abstract: Terrain elevation modeling for off-road navigation aims to accurately
estimate changes in terrain geometry in real-time and quantify the
corresponding uncertainties. Having precise estimations and uncertainties plays
a crucial role in planning and control algorithms to explore safe and reliable
maneuver strategies. However, existing approaches, such as Gaussian Processes
(GPs) and neural network-based methods, often fail to meet these needs. They
are either unable to perform in real-time due to high computational demands,
underestimating sharp geometry changes, or harming elevation accuracy when
learned with uncertainties. Recently, Neural Processes (NPs) have emerged as a
promising approach that integrates the Bayesian uncertainty estimation of GPs
with the efficiency and flexibility of neural networks. Inspired by NPs, we
propose an effective NP-based method that precisely estimates sharp elevation
changes and quantifies the corresponding predictive uncertainty without losing
elevation accuracy. Our method leverages semantic features from LiDAR and
camera sensors to improve interpolation and extrapolation accuracy in
unobserved regions. Also, we introduce a local ball-query attention mechanism
to effectively reduce the computational complexity of global attention by 17\%
while preserving crucial local and spatial information. We evaluate our method
on off-road datasets having interesting geometric features, collected from
trails, deserts, and hills. Our results demonstrate superior performance over
baselines and showcase the potential of neural processes for effective and
expressive terrain modeling in complex off-road environments.

TL;DR: CP-Gen introduces a novel method to generate robot demonstration data using constraints derived from a single expert trajectory, resulting in significant improvements in manipulation tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Robust robot manipulation requires large-scale demonstration data, but acquiring such data is expensive and time-consuming.

Method: CP-Gen decomposes expert demonstrations into free-space motions and robot skills, forms keypoint-trajectory constraints, and generates new demonstrations by transforming object geometry and pose while optimizing the robot's configurations.

Result: Experimental evaluations show CP-Gen-trained policies outperform baselines, achieving a 77% success rate across simulation and real-world tasks.

Conclusion: CP-Gen empowers robots to generalize better using constrained data generation, paving the way for efficient training and enhanced real-world task generalization.

Abstract: Large-scale demonstration data has powered key breakthroughs in robot
manipulation, but collecting that data remains costly and time-consuming. We
present Constraint-Preserving Data Generation (CP-Gen), a method that uses a
single expert trajectory to generate robot demonstrations containing novel
object geometries and poses. These generated demonstrations are used to train
closed-loop visuomotor policies that transfer zero-shot to the real world and
generalize across variations in object geometries and poses. Similar to prior
work using pose variations for data generation, CP-Gen first decomposes expert
demonstrations into free-space motions and robot skills. But unlike those
works, we achieve geometry-aware data generation by formulating robot skills as
keypoint-trajectory constraints: keypoints on the robot or grasped object must
track a reference trajectory defined relative to a task-relevant object. To
generate a new demonstration, CP-Gen samples pose and geometry transforms for
each task-relevant object, then applies these transforms to the object and its
associated keypoints or keypoint trajectories. We optimize robot joint
configurations so that the keypoints on the robot or grasped object track the
transformed keypoint trajectory, and then motion plan a collision-free path to
the first optimized joint configuration. Experiments on 16 simulation tasks and
four real-world tasks, featuring multi-stage, non-prehensile and
tight-tolerance manipulation, show that policies trained using CP-Gen achieve
an average success rate of 77%, outperforming the best baseline that achieves
an average of 50%.

Abstract: This paper presents a method for optimizing the sliding mode control (SMC)
parameter for a robot manipulator applying a genetic algorithm (GA). The
objective of the SMC is to achieve precise and consistent tracking of the
trajectory of the robot manipulator under uncertain and disturbed conditions.
However, the system effectiveness and robustness depend on the choice of the
SMC parameters, which is a difficult and crucial task. To solve this problem, a
genetic algorithm is used to locate the optimal values of these parameters that
gratify the capability criteria. The proposed method is efficient compared with
the conventional SMC and Fuzzy-SMC. The simulation results show that the
genetic algorithm with SMC can achieve better tracking capability and reduce
the chattering effect.

TL;DR: This paper introduces the SCOUT system for continuous, in-vivo monitoring of enteric methane emissions in livestock, outperforming traditional methods in accuracy and data retention.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the limitations of current ambient sampling methods for methane measurements in livestock, including low data retention, environmental interference, and limited temporal resolution.

Method: The SCOUT system uses a closed-loop gas recirculation design for high-resolution monitoring of ruminal methane concentrations. It was validated on two cannulated Simmental heifers using contrasting diets and compared against traditional ambient sniffer systems.

Result: SCOUT achieved an 82% data retention rate compared to 17% for traditional systems and captured methane concentrations 100-1000 times higher than ambient methods. Strong correlations were observed during cross-platform validation with biologically relevant temporal windows.

Conclusion: SCOUT marks a transformative step in precision livestock management, enabling accurate methane emission phenotyping, essential for sustainable agriculture and genetic selection programs while providing new biological insights.

Abstract: Accurate measurement of enteric methane emissions remains a critical
bottleneck for advancing livestock sustainability through genetic selection and
precision management. Existing ambient sampling approaches suffer from low data
retention rates, environmental interference, and limited temporal resolution.
We developed SCOUT (Smart Cannula-mounted Optical Unit for Trace-methane), the
first robust in-vivo sensing system enabling continuous, high-resolution
monitoring of ruminal methane concentrations through an innovative closed-loop
gas recirculation design. We conducted comprehensive validation with two
cannulated Simmental heifers under contrasting dietary treatments, with
cross-platform comparison against established ambient sniffer systems. SCOUT
achieved exceptional performance with 82% data retention compared to 17% for
conventional sniffer systems, while capturing methane concentrations 100-1000x
higher than ambient approaches. Cross-platform validation demonstrated strong
scale-dependent correlations, with optimal correlation strength (r = -0.564
$\pm$ 0.007) at biologically relevant 40-minute windows and 100% statistical
significance. High-frequency monitoring revealed novel behavior-emission
coupling, including rapid concentration changes (14.5 $\pm$ 11.3k ppm)
triggered by postural transitions within 15 minutes, insights previously
inaccessible through existing technologies. The SCOUT system represents a
transformative advancement, enabling accurate, continuous emission phenotyping
essential for genomic selection programs and sustainable precision livestock
management. This validation framework establishes new benchmarks for
agricultural sensor performance while generating unprecedented biological
insights into ruminal methane dynamics, contributing essential tools for
sustainable livestock production in climate-conscious agricultural systems.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces DRIVE, a framework for modeling human-like driving constraints and trajectory planning, achieving high compliance and generalization across diverse scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of implicit, context-dependent soft constraints in autonomous driving for safer and socially compliant operations.

Method: Proposing DRIVE, which combines exponential-family likelihood modeling for rule estimation and convex optimization-based planning for trajectory generation.

Result: Validated on datasets (inD, highD, RoundD), DRIVE achieves 0.0% soft constraint violations, smoother trajectories, and robust generalization.

Conclusion: DRIVE efficiently models dynamic driving constraints, ensuring compliance, smoothness, and adaptability, making it suitable for real-world autonomous driving.

Abstract: Understanding and adhering to soft constraints is essential for safe and
socially compliant autonomous driving. However, such constraints are often
implicit, context-dependent, and difficult to specify explicitly. In this work,
we present DRIVE, a novel framework for Dynamic Rule Inference and Verified
Evaluation that models and evaluates human-like driving constraints from expert
demonstrations. DRIVE leverages exponential-family likelihood modeling to
estimate the feasibility of state transitions, constructing a probabilistic
representation of soft behavioral rules that vary across driving contexts.
These learned rule distributions are then embedded into a convex
optimization-based planning module, enabling the generation of trajectories
that are not only dynamically feasible but also compliant with inferred human
preferences. Unlike prior approaches that rely on fixed constraint forms or
purely reward-based modeling, DRIVE offers a unified framework that tightly
couples rule inference with trajectory-level decision-making. It supports both
data-driven constraint generalization and principled feasibility verification.
We validate DRIVE on large-scale naturalistic driving datasets, including inD,
highD, and RoundD, and benchmark it against representative inverse constraint
learning and planning baselines. Experimental results show that DRIVE achieves
0.0% soft constraint violation rates, smoother trajectories, and stronger
generalization across diverse driving scenarios. Verified evaluations further
demonstrate the efficiency, explanability, and robustness of the framework for
real-world deployment.

### [277] [Improving Tactile Gesture Recognition with Optical Flow](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04338)
*Shaohong Zhong,Alessandro Albini,Giammarco Caroleo,Giorgio Cannata,Perla Maiolino*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper improves gesture recognition accuracy in HRI by augmenting tactile images with optical flow data to highlight contact dynamics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Gesture recognition systems often struggle to differentiate between gestures with similar tactile images based solely on pressure distribution data.

Method: The authors proposed augmenting tactile images with dense optical flow data to emphasize the dynamic contact features.

Result: Using augmented tactile images, the classifier achieved a 9% higher accuracy in distinguishing gestures.

Conclusion: Integrating optical flow information in tactile gesture classification enhances performance, providing a simple yet effective improvement.

Abstract: Tactile gesture recognition systems play a crucial role in Human-Robot
Interaction (HRI) by enabling intuitive communication between humans and
robots. The literature mainly addresses this problem by applying machine
learning techniques to classify sequences of tactile images encoding the
pressure distribution generated when executing the gestures. However, some
gestures can be hard to differentiate based on the information provided by
tactile images alone. In this paper, we present a simple yet effective way to
improve the accuracy of a gesture recognition classifier. Our approach focuses
solely on processing the tactile images used as input by the classifier. In
particular, we propose to explicitly highlight the dynamics of the contact in
the tactile image by computing the dense optical flow. This additional
information makes it easier to distinguish between gestures that produce
similar tactile images but exhibit different contact dynamics. We validate the
proposed approach in a tactile gesture recognition task, showing that a
classifier trained on tactile images augmented with optical flow information
achieved a 9% improvement in gesture classification accuracy compared to one
trained on standard tactile images.

*Morten Roed Frederiksen,Kasper Støy,Maja Matarić*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper introduces a pocket-sized tactile companion robot aimed at reducing anxiety in children without prior training, showing significant heart rate reduction during interaction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current relaxation techniques for children with anxiety require prior training, creating limitations in their immediate application during stressful situations.

Method: A tactile companion robot employing a tactile game was tested through a 14-day pilot study with 2 children and a main study with 18 children, both using a within-subjects design to measure heart rate changes during interaction.

Result: Interacting with the robot significantly reduced participants' heart rate compared to non-use, demonstrating consistent calming effects.

Conclusion: Tactile companion robots could be effectively integrated into therapeutic practices to enhance relaxation techniques without requiring prior training.

Abstract: Children diagnosed with anxiety disorders are taught a range of strategies to
navigate situations of heightened anxiety. Techniques such as deep breathing
and repetition of mantras are commonly employed, as they are known to be
calming and reduce elevated heart rates. Although these strategies are often
effective, their successful application relies on prior training of the
children for successful use when faced with challenging situations. This paper
investigates a pocket-sized companion robot designed to offer a relaxation
technique requiring no prior training, with a focus on immediate impact on the
user's heart rate. The robot utilizes a tactile game to divert the user's
attention, thereby promoting relaxation. We conducted two studies with children
who were not diagnosed with anxiety: a 14-day pilot study with two children
(age 8) and a main study with 18 children (ages 7-8). Both studies employed a
within-subjects design and focused on measuring heart rate during tactile
interaction with the robot and during non-use. Interacting with the robot was
found to significantly lower the study participants' heart rate (p$<$0.01)
compared to the non-use condition, indicating a consistent calming effect
across all participants. These results suggest that tactile companion robots
have the potential to enhance the therapeutic value of relaxation techniques.

*Eric R. Damm,Eli S. Lancaster,Felix A. Sanchez,Kiana Bronder,Jason M. Gregory,Thomas M. Howard*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The study introduces three methods to integrate stochastic controller behavior into the Kinodynamic Efficiently Adaptive State Lattice (KEASL) planner, showing reduced collision likelihood in robotic motion planning experiments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the problem of errors in motion planning models caused by real-world physics and uncertainties in controller trajectory execution, particularly in off-road environments.

Method: The researchers developed three methods to incorporate stochastic behaviors into the recombinant search space of the KEASL planner. They conducted experiments on an Unmanned Ground Vehicle (UGV) in off-road scenarios with varying perception systems and complexity levels.

Result: The data demonstrated that adding stochastic controller behavior led to more conservative robot trajectories and lowered a robot's predicted collision risks. However, this approach also saw trade-offs in planning success rates when compared to traditional methods with expanded obstacle representation.

Conclusion: Incorporating stochastic sampling significantly reduces collision likelihood at the cost of planning efficiency, providing new insights for motion planning in uncertain and unstructured environments.

Abstract: Mobile robot motion planners rely on theoretical models to predict how the
robot will move through the world. However, when deployed on a physical robot,
these models are subject to errors due to real-world physics and uncertainty in
how the lower-level controller follows the planned trajectory. In this work, we
address this problem by presenting three methods of incorporating stochastic
controller behavior into the recombinant search space of the Kinodynamic
Efficiently Adaptive State Lattice (KEASL) planner. To demonstrate this work,
we analyze the results of experiments performed on a Clearpath Robotics Warthog
Unmanned Ground Vehicle (UGV) in an off-road, unstructured environment using
two different perception algorithms, and performed an ablation study using a
full spectrum of simulated environment map complexities. Analysis of the data
found that incorporating stochastic controller sampling into KEASL leads to
more conservative trajectories that decrease predicted collision likelihood
when compared to KEASL without sampling. When compared to baseline planning
with expanded obstacle footprints, the predicted likelihood of collisions
becomes more comparable, but reduces the planning success rate for baseline
search.

*Yujia Lu,Chong Wei,Lu Ma*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper presents a hybrid trajectory planning framework for autonomous highway driving to achieve collision-free and efficient motion in fast-changing scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High collision risks on highways due to fast-changing environments and limited reaction time demand reliable trajectory planning methods.

Method: The framework consists of a graph neural network (GNN) to predict velocity profiles and a mixed-integer quadratic programming (MIQP) optimization to enforce collision avoidance with linear vehicle geometry approximation.

Result: The method generates smooth, collision-free trajectories with success rates over 97% and average planning times of 54 ms in complex real-world scenarios.

Conclusion: The hybrid approach combines adaptability and formal guarantees, enabling real-time autonomous highway driving with high reliability and efficiency.

Abstract: Autonomous highway driving presents a high collision risk due to
fast-changing environments and limited reaction time, necessitating reliable
and efficient trajectory planning. This paper proposes a hybrid trajectory
planning framework that integrates the adaptability of learning-based methods
with the formal safety guarantees of optimization-based approaches. The
framework features a two-layer architecture: an upper layer employing a graph
neural network (GNN) trained on real-world highway data to predict human-like
longitudinal velocity profiles, and a lower layer utilizing path optimization
formulated as a mixed-integer quadratic programming (MIQP) problem. The primary
contribution is the lower-layer path optimization model, which introduces a
linear approximation of discretized vehicle geometry to substantially reduce
computational complexity, while enforcing strict spatiotemporal non-overlapping
constraints to formally guarantee collision avoidance throughout the planning
horizon. Experimental results demonstrate that the planner generates highly
smooth, collision-free trajectories in complex real-world emergency scenarios,
achieving success rates exceeding 97% with average planning times of 54 ms,
thereby confirming real-time capability.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Behavior-Adaptive Path Planning (BAPP) framework for multi-robot hazard mapping in high-risk environments, outperforming traditional approaches by employing behavior-adaptive strategies sensitive to risk and uncertainty.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the issues with autonomous hazard mapping by robots in challenging environments where high risk and communication denial pose critical challenges.

Method: Developing a behavior-adaptive planning framework using Behavioral Entropy (BE) and proposing the BAPP framework with tunable risk-sensitivity. It includes two planning algorithms: BAPP-TID and BAPP-SIG.

Result: BAPP consistently outperformed Shannon entropy-based and random strategies by achieving faster entropy reduction and better survivability while maintaining information gain. It also demonstrated scalability in multi-robot deployments.

Conclusion: Behavior-adaptive planning offers robust, risk-sensitive strategies for multi-robot exploration in failure-prone environments, proving its effectiveness in both single- and multi-robot scenarios.

Abstract: We address the challenge of multi-robot autonomous hazard mapping in
high-risk, failure-prone, communication-denied environments such as
post-disaster zones, underground mines, caves, and planetary surfaces. In these
missions, robots must explore and map hazards while minimizing the risk of
failure due to environmental threats or hardware limitations. We introduce a
behavior-adaptive, information-theoretic planning framework for multi-robot
teams grounded in the concept of Behavioral Entropy (BE), that generalizes
Shannon entropy (SE) to capture diverse human-like uncertainty evaluations.
Building on this formulation, we propose the Behavior-Adaptive Path Planning
(BAPP) framework, which modulates information gathering strategies via a
tunable risk-sensitivity parameter, and present two planning algorithms:
BAPP-TID for intelligent triggering of high-fidelity robots, and BAPP-SIG for
safe deployment under high risk. We provide theoretical insights on the
informativeness of the proposed BAPP framework and validate its effectiveness
through both single-robot and multi-robot simulations. Our results show that
the BAPP stack consistently outperforms Shannon-based and random strategies:
BAPP-TID accelerates entropy reduction, while BAPP-SIG improves robot
survivability with minimal loss in information gain. In multi-agent
deployments, BAPP scales effectively through spatial partitioning, mobile base
relocation, and role-aware heterogeneity. These findings underscore the value
of behavior-adaptive planning for robust, risk-sensitive exploration in
complex, failure-prone environments.

TL;DR: This paper introduces $NavA^3$, a hierarchical framework for tackling long-horizon navigation tasks in real-world environments using high-level human instructions and spatial-aware navigation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the gap in current navigation methods that fail to accommodate open-ended scenarios and high-level human instructions in real-world embodied navigation tasks.

Method: $NavA^3$ employs a hierarchical policy combining a global reasoning layer using Reasoning-VLM and a local spatial-aware object affordance model trained on a large dataset for precise object localization and navigation.

Result: $NavA^3$ achieves state-of-the-art results in navigation tasks across various robots and environments, demonstrating its ability to handle complex, long-horizon tasks effectively.

Conclusion: The proposed $NavA^3$ framework lays the groundwork for universal embodied navigation and outperforms existing methods in handling high-level and spatially complex navigation queries.

Abstract: Embodied navigation is a fundamental capability of embodied intelligence,
enabling robots to move and interact within physical environments. However,
existing navigation tasks primarily focus on predefined object navigation or
instruction following, which significantly differs from human needs in
real-world scenarios involving complex, open-ended scenes. To bridge this gap,
we introduce a challenging long-horizon navigation task that requires
understanding high-level human instructions and performing spatial-aware object
navigation in real-world environments. Existing embodied navigation methods
struggle with such tasks due to their limitations in comprehending high-level
human instructions and localizing objects with an open vocabulary. In this
paper, we propose $NavA^3$, a hierarchical framework divided into two stages:
global and local policies. In the global policy, we leverage the reasoning
capabilities of Reasoning-VLM to parse high-level human instructions and
integrate them with global 3D scene views. This allows us to reason and
navigate to regions most likely to contain the goal object. In the local
policy, we have collected a dataset of 1.0 million samples of spatial-aware
object affordances to train the NaviAfford model (PointingVLM), which provides
robust open-vocabulary object localization and spatial awareness for precise
goal identification and navigation in complex environments. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that $NavA^3$ achieves SOTA results in navigation
performance and can successfully complete longhorizon navigation tasks across
different robot embodiments in real-world settings, paving the way for
universal embodied navigation. The dataset and code will be made available.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current autonomous driving systems underperform in rare high-risk scenarios and complex interactions due to a lack of real-world data for these situations.

Method: The authors created a simulated dataset called HASS that covers 13 high-risk edge-case categories and designed components like Scenario-aware Prompt Engineering (SPE) and an Image-to-Ego Encoder (I2E Encoder) to train models using this dataset.

Result: RoboTron-Sim improves driving performance in challenging scenarios by about 50% and achieves state-of-the-art results in real-world open-loop planning, as tested on the nuScenes dataset.

Conclusion: The approach effectively bridges the gap between simulated scenarios and real-world application, enhancing autonomous driving systems' ability to handle critical high-risk situations.

Abstract: Collecting real-world data for rare high-risk scenarios, long-tailed driving
events, and complex interactions remains challenging, leading to poor
performance of existing autonomous driving systems in these critical
situations. In this paper, we propose RoboTron-Sim that improves real-world
driving in critical situations by utilizing simulated hard cases. First, we
develop a simulated dataset called Hard-case Augmented Synthetic Scenarios
(HASS), which covers 13 high-risk edge-case categories, as well as balanced
environmental conditions such as day/night and sunny/rainy. Second, we
introduce Scenario-aware Prompt Engineering (SPE) and an Image-to-Ego Encoder
(I2E Encoder) to enable multimodal large language models to effectively learn
real-world challenging driving skills from HASS, via adapting to environmental
deviations and hardware differences between real-world and simulated scenarios.
Extensive experiments on nuScenes show that RoboTron-Sim improves driving
performance in challenging scenarios by around 50%, achieving state-of-the-art
results in real-world open-loop planning. Qualitative results further
demonstrate the effectiveness of RoboTron-Sim in better managing rare high-risk

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to solve open-world semantic navigation challenges by enabling robots to locate target objects in novel environments using natural language specifications.

Method: The system employs foundation models paired with Open Scene Graph schemas to hierarchically organize spatial memory. These schemas are auto-generated using semantic labels of environments, enabling zero-shot adaptation.

Result: The system demonstrates state-of-the-art performance on ObjectNav benchmarks, achieving generalization across diverse goals, environments, and robot types.

Conclusion: OSG Navigator provides a robust modular system for open-world navigation, offering enhanced adaptability and performance without prior training in novel environments.

Abstract: How can we build general-purpose robot systems for open-world semantic
navigation, e.g., searching a novel environment for a target object specified
in natural language? To tackle this challenge, we introduce OSG Navigator, a
modular system composed of foundation models, for open-world Object-Goal
Navigation (ObjectNav). Foundation models provide enormous semantic knowledge
about the world, but struggle to organise and maintain spatial information
effectively at scale. Key to OSG Navigator is the Open Scene Graph
representation, which acts as spatial memory for OSG Navigator. It organises
spatial information hierarchically using OSG schemas, which are templates, each
describing the common structure of a class of environments. OSG schemas can be
automatically generated from simple semantic labels of a given environment,
e.g., "home" or "supermarket". They enable OSG Navigator to adapt zero-shot to
new environment types. We conducted experiments using both Fetch and Spot
robots in simulation and in the real world, showing that OSG Navigator achieves
state-of-the-art performance on ObjectNav benchmarks and generalises zero-shot
over diverse goals, environments, and robot embodiments.

TL;DR: This paper investigates the performance trade-offs of hierarchical multi-agent frameworks in multi-robot healthcare scenarios, focusing on coordination failures and improving system reliability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MARS has potential for real-world applications, but its deployment is limited due to challenges in agent coordination and physical task constraints, necessitating practical studies to close this gap.

Method: Two studies were conducted: Study 1 used CrewAI to analyze and categorize coordination failures, and Study 2 employed AutoGen to test communication structures and reasoning models.

Result: Findings highlight key coordination challenges, trade-offs between reasoning models, and the tension between autonomy and system stability.

Conclusion: The analysis suggests that edge-case testing is essential for enhancing reliability and safety, offering insights and resources for advancing MARS development in real-world settings.

Abstract: Multi-agent robotic systems (MARS) build upon multi-agent systems by
integrating physical and task-related constraints, increasing the complexity of
action execution and agent coordination. However, despite the availability of
advanced multi-agent frameworks, their real-world deployment on robots remains
limited, hindering the advancement of MARS research in practice. To bridge this
gap, we conducted two studies to investigate performance trade-offs of
hierarchical multi-agent frameworks in a simulated real-world multi-robot
healthcare scenario. In Study 1, using CrewAI, we iteratively refine the
system's knowledge base, to systematically identify and categorize coordination
failures (e.g., tool access violations, lack of timely handling of failure
reports) not resolvable by providing contextual knowledge alone. In Study 2,
using AutoGen, we evaluate a redesigned bidirectional communication structure
and further measure the trade-offs between reasoning and non-reasoning models
operating within the same robotic team setting. Drawing from our empirical
findings, we emphasize the tension between autonomy and stability and the
importance of edge-case testing to improve system reliability and safety for
future real-world deployment. Supplementary materials, including codes, task

*Hashini Gunatilake,John Grundy,Rashina Hoda,Ingo Mueller*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper introduces 17 actionable empathy guidelines and a prioritization framework to help software engineering (SE) teams integrate empathy effectively.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To emphasize the importance of empathy in improving teamwork, communication, and decision-making in software engineering.

Method: The authors developed 17 empathy guidelines based on prior research and examined their real-world applications, challenges, and strategies through practitioner input. They also proposed a framework to prioritize and adopt these guidelines.

Result: The paper offers insights into practical ways to embed empathy into SE practices, supported by strategies for overcoming challenges in implementation.

Conclusion: Empathy can enhance SE practices, and the guidelines and prioritization framework enable practitioners to foster empathy in their workflows for better outcomes.

Abstract: Empathy is a powerful yet often overlooked element in software engineering
(SE), supporting better teamwork, smoother communication, and effective
decision-making. In our previous study, we identified a range of practitioner
strategies for fostering empathy in SE contexts. Building on these insights,
this paper introduces 17 actionable empathy guidelines designed to support
practitioners, teams, and organisations. We also explore how these guidelines
can be implemented in practice by examining real-world applications,
challenges, and strategies to overcome them shared by software practitioners.
To support adoption, we present a visual prioritisation framework that
categorises the guidelines based on perceived importance, ease of
implementation, and willingness to adopt. The findings offer practical and
flexible suggestions for integrating empathy into everyday SE work, helping
teams move from principles to sustainable action.

### [288] [Evaluating Software Supply Chain Security in Research Software](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03856)
*Richard Hegewald,Rebecca Beyer*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper evaluates the security of research software repositories, revealing vulnerabilities and providing actionable recommendations for improvement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Focuses on the underexplored topic of securing research software to protect scientific integrity and reproducibility, especially given its vulnerability to supply chain attacks.

Method: Analyzes 3,248 peer-reviewed research software repositories using the OpenSSF Scorecard to assess security practices.

Result: The study finds weak average security scores of 3.5/10, highlighting gaps such as lack of signed releases and branch protection.

Conclusion: Offers low-effort recommendations to improve research software security and safeguard scientific integrity.

Abstract: The security of research software is essential for ensuring the integrity and
reproducibility of scientific results. However, research software security is
still largely unexplored. Due to its dependence on open source components and
distributed development practices, research software is particularly vulnerable
to supply chain attacks. This study analyses 3,248 high-quality, largely
peer-reviewed research software repositories using the OpenSSF Scorecard. We
find a generally weak security posture with an average score of 3.5/10.
Important practices, such as signed releases and branch protection, are rarely
implemented. Finally, we present actionable, low-effort recommendations that
can help research teams improve software security and mitigate potential
threats to scientific integrity.

### [289] [From App Features to Explanation Needs: Analyzing Correlations and Predictive Potential](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03881)
*Martin Obaidi,Kushtrim Qengaj,Jakob Droste,Hannah Deters,Marc Herrmann,Jil Klünder,Elisa Schmid,Kurt Schneider*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The study explores if explanation needs from user reviews can be predicted by app metadata but finds mostly weak predictive power.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable better early-stage development and large-scale requirements mining by predicting explanation needs from app metadata.

Method: Analyzed 4,495 app reviews enriched with metadata using correlation analysis and linear regression models, validated with a smaller manually labeled dataset.

Result: Weak correlations were found between metadata and explanation needs with limited predictive power, especially for Security & Privacy and System Behavior.

Conclusion: Explanation needs are context-dependent and cannot be reliably inferred from app metadata; developers should incorporate direct user feedback.

Abstract: In today's digitized world, software systems must support users in
understanding both how to interact with a system and why certain behaviors
occur. This study investigates whether explanation needs, classified from user
reviews, can be predicted based on app properties, enabling early consideration
during development and large-scale requirements mining. We analyzed a gold
standard dataset of 4,495 app reviews enriched with metadata (e.g., app
version, ratings, age restriction, in-app purchases). Correlation analyses
identified mostly weak associations between app properties and explanation
needs, with moderate correlations only for specific features such as app
version, number of reviews, and star ratings. Linear regression models showed
limited predictive power, with no reliable forecasts across configurations.
Validation on a manually labeled dataset of 495 reviews confirmed these
findings. Categories such as Security & Privacy and System Behavior showed
slightly higher predictive potential, while Interaction and User Interface
remained most difficult to predict. Overall, our results highlight that
explanation needs are highly context-dependent and cannot be precisely inferred
from app metadata alone. Developers and requirements engineers should therefore
supplement metadata analysis with direct user feedback to effectively design
explainable and user-centered software systems.

Method: Analyzing GitHub Copilot's chat interface, evaluating its explanations, code generation, and collaborative programming support through a human-centered framework.

Result: Test results showed insights into Copilot's ability to meet human-centered requirements in automated programming.

Conclusion: Implications for improving Copilot's adaptability and effectiveness in addressing human requirements in software development workflows.

Abstract: The rapid adoption of Artificial Intelligence(AI) programming assistants such
as GitHub Copilot introduces new challenges in how these software tools address
human needs. Many existing evaluation frameworks address technical aspects such
as code correctness and efficiency, but often overlook crucial human factors
that affect the successful integration of AI assistants in software development
workflows. In this study, I analyzed GitHub Copilot's interaction with users
through its chat interface, measured Copilot's ability to adapt explanations
and code generation to user expertise levels, and assessed its effectiveness in
facilitating collaborative programming experiences. I established a
human-centered requirements framework with clear metrics to evaluate these
qualities in GitHub Copilot chat. I discussed the test results and their
implications for future analysis of human requirements in automated
programming.

TL;DR: The study benchmarks ChatGPT, Copilot, Gemini, and DeepSeek against 150 LeetCode problems, revealing differences in performance metrics such as execution time, memory usage, and complexity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Motivated by the growing integration of LLMs into software development workflows, the study seeks to systematically evaluate and compare their performance to guide developers.

Method: The researchers evaluated four LLMs (ChatGPT, Copilot, Gemini, and DeepSeek) on 150 LeetCode problems of varying difficulties, assessing performance based on execution time, memory usage, and algorithmic complexity.

Result: ChatGPT consistently performed well in execution time and memory usage, while Copilot and DeepSeek showed variable results as tasks grew complex. Gemini was more efficient on simpler problems but struggled with complex tasks.

Conclusion: The study provides developers with actionable insights about the strengths and weaknesses of various LLMs, aiding in their selection for specific development tasks.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) like ChatGPT, Copilot, Gemini, and DeepSeek are
transforming software engineering by automating key tasks, including code
generation, testing, and debugging. As these models become integral to
development workflows, a systematic comparison of their performance is
essential for optimizing their use in real world applications. This study
benchmarks these four prominent LLMs on one hundred and fifty LeetCode problems
across easy, medium, and hard difficulties, generating solutions in Java and
Python. We evaluate each model based on execution time, memory usage, and
algorithmic complexity, revealing significant performance differences. ChatGPT
demonstrates consistent efficiency in execution time and memory usage, while
Copilot and DeepSeek show variability as task complexity increases. Gemini,
although effective on simpler tasks, requires more attempts as problem
difficulty rises. Our findings provide actionable insights into each model's
strengths and limitations, offering guidance for developers selecting LLMs for
specific coding tasks and providing insights on the performance and complexity
of GPT-like generated solutions.

### [292] [Model Compression vs. Adversarial Robustness: An Empirical Study on Language Models for Code](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03949)
*Md. Abdul Awal,Mrigank Rochan,Chanchal K. Roy*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper investigates the impact of model compression techniques on the adversarial robustness of transformer-based language models for code. It finds that compressed models often exhibit reduced robustness under attacks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address the overlooked impact of model compression techniques on the adversarial robustness of language models for code, which is critical for reliable and secure software analytics.

Method: The authors conducted an evaluation using three popular language models for code across three software analytics tasks, applying six metrics and four classical adversarial attacks to assess the robustness of compressed models.

Result: Compressed models generally retained performance similar to their uncompressed counterparts but showed significantly lower robustness when exposed to adversarial attacks.

Conclusion: Compressed models face a trade-off between smaller size and reduced adversarial robustness, highlighting the need for advanced compression strategies tailored for security-critical use cases.

Abstract: Transformer-based language models for code have shown remarkable performance
in various software analytics tasks, but their adoption is hindered by high
computational costs, slow inference speeds, and substantial environmental
impact. Model compression techniques such as pruning, quantization, and
knowledge distillation have gained traction in addressing these challenges.
However, the impact of these strategies on the robustness of compressed
language models for code in adversarial scenarios remains poorly understood.
Understanding how these compressed models behave under adversarial attacks is
essential for their safe and effective deployment in real-world applications.
To bridge this knowledge gap, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation of how
common compression strategies affect the adversarial robustness of compressed
models. We assess the robustness of compressed versions of three widely used
language models for code across three software analytics tasks, using six
evaluation metrics and four commonly used classical adversarial attacks. Our
findings indicate that compressed models generally maintain comparable
performance to their uncompressed counterparts. However, when subjected to
adversarial attacks, compressed models exhibit significantly reduced
robustness. These results reveal a trade-off between model size reduction and
adversarial robustness, underscoring the need for careful consideration when
deploying compressed models in security-critical software applications. Our
study highlights the need for further research into compression strategies that
strike a balance between computational efficiency and adversarial robustness,
which is essential for deploying reliable language models for code in
real-world software applications.

*Sangwon Hyun,Hyunjun Kim,Jinhyuk Jang,Hyojin Choi,M. Ali Babar*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper investigates productive prompting techniques in Human-LLM Interactions for code generation, addressing gaps in real-world workflows by analyzing features impacting productivity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore productive prompting techniques and address limitations in previous studies focusing on well-known patterns and function-level practices in Human-LLM Interactions.

Method: A user study with 36 participants solving project-level benchmarks while interacting with a GPT assistant using specific prompts, complemented by analysis of screen recordings and chat logs.

Result: Three HLI features significantly impact code generation productivity, five guidelines to improve productivity, and a taxonomy of 29 errors with mitigation strategies.

Conclusion: The study provides valuable insights into enhancing Human-LLM code generation productivity with practical guidelines and error mitigation strategies.

Abstract: The application of Large Language Models (LLMs) is growing in the productive
completion of Software Engineering tasks. Yet, studies investigating the
productive prompting techniques often employed a limited problem space,
primarily focusing on well-known prompting patterns and mainly targeting
function-level SE practices. We identify significant gaps in real-world
workflows that involve complexities beyond class-level (e.g., multi-class
dependencies) and different features that can impact Human-LLM Interactions
(HLIs) processes in code generation. To address these issues, we designed an
experiment that comprehensively analyzed the HLI features regarding the code
generation productivity. Our study presents two project-level benchmark tasks,
extending beyond function-level evaluations. We conducted a user study with 36
participants from diverse backgrounds, asking them to solve the assigned tasks
by interacting with the GPT assistant using specific prompting patterns. We
also examined the participants' experience and their behavioral features during
interactions by analyzing screen recordings and GPT chat logs. Our statistical
and empirical investigation revealed (1) that three out of 15 HLI features
significantly impacted the productivity in code generation; (2) five primary
guidelines for enhancing productivity for HLI processes; and (3) a taxonomy of
29 runtime and logic errors that can occur during HLI processes, along with
suggested mitigation plans.

### [294] [EVOC2RUST: A Skeleton-guided Framework for Project-Level C-to-Rust Translation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04295)
*Chaofan Wang,Tingrui Yu,Jie Wang,Dong Chen,Wenrui Zhang,Yuling Shi,Xiaodong Gu,Beijun Shen*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper proposes EvoC2Rust, a framework to translate C projects to Rust safely and efficiently, outperforming prior rule-based and LLM-based methods in accuracy and code safety.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Rust's compile-time safety benefits make it crucial for transitioning legacy C codebases in safety-critical systems, but existing methods for this conversion struggle with accuracy or scalability.

Method: EvoC2Rust uses a skeleton-guided approach with three evolutionary stages: module decomposition and skeleton generation, incremental function translation, and compilation error repair.

Result: EvoC2Rust achieves significant improvements over prior methods: 17.24% better syntax accuracy, 14.32% better semantic accuracy, and a 96.79% higher code safety rate, with high compilation and test pass rates.

Conclusion: EvoC2Rust offers an automated solution for project-level C-to-Rust translation, combining rule-based and LLM-based techniques effectively.

Abstract: Rust's compile-time safety guarantees make it ideal for safety-critical
systems, creating demand for translating legacy C codebases to Rust. While
various approaches have emerged for this task, they face inherent trade-offs:
rule-based solutions face challenges in meeting code safety and idiomaticity
requirements, while LLM-based solutions often fail to generate semantically
equivalent Rust code, due to the heavy dependencies of modules across the
entire codebase. Recent studies have revealed that both solutions are limited
to small-scale programs. In this paper, we propose EvoC2Rust, an automated
framework for converting entire C projects to equivalent Rust ones. EvoC2Rust
employs a skeleton-guided translation strategy for project-level translation.
The pipeline consists of three evolutionary stages: 1) it first decomposes the
C project into functional modules, employs a feature-mapping-enhanced LLM to
transform definitions and macros and generates type-checked function stubs,
which form a compilable Rust skeleton; 2) it then incrementally translates the
function, replacing the corresponding stub placeholder; 3) finally, it repairs
compilation errors by integrating LLM and static analysis. Through evolutionary
augmentation, EvoC2Rust combines the advantages of both rule-based and
LLM-based solutions. Our evaluation on open-source benchmarks and six
industrial projects demonstrates EvoC2Rust's superior performance in
project-level C-to-Rust translation. On average, it achieves 17.24% and 14.32%
improvements in syntax and semantic accuracy over the LLM-based approaches,
along with a 96.79% higher code safety rate than the rule-based tools. At the
module level, EvoC2Rust reaches 92.25% compilation and 89.53% test pass rates
on industrial projects, even for complex codebases and long functions.

remains complex due to fundamental differences between the two platforms. We
present Vanilla-Converter, a command-line tool that facilitates the migration
of BPMN models from Camunda 7 to Camunda 8. Vanilla-Converter automates the
transformation process, supports a wide range of BPMN elements, and produces a
transformed model and a detailed transformation log indicating automatic
changes and remaining manual conversion tasks. The tool's effectiveness is
demonstrated through three case studies with real industrially used Camunda 7
models, confirming its ability to convert these models into valid and
executable Camunda 8 models.

### [296] [Breaking New Ground in Software Defect Prediction: Introducing Practical and Actionable Metrics with Superior Predictive Power for Enhanced Decision-Making](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04408)
*Carlos Andrés Ramírez Cataño,Makoto Itoh*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This study demonstrates how developer coding habits, framed through human error theory, can improve method-level software defect prediction beyond current state-of-the-art metrics such as code and commit history metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the under-researched area of software defect prediction using non-software metrics, particularly those related to human error and developer behavior.

Method: The paper introduces a framework for human-error-based metrics, compares their prediction performance against state-of-the-art metrics, and analyzes their predictive importance using data from 21 large-scale open-source software projects.

Result: The proposed human-error-based metrics outperform traditional code and history metrics in average prediction performance, and they enhance explainability, practicality, and actionability for defect prediction.

Conclusion: The study significantly advances defect prediction by leveraging developer coding habits within a human-error framework, enabling actionable insights and demonstrating the influence of human behavior on software defects.

Abstract: Software defect prediction using code metrics has been extensively researched
over the past five decades. However, prediction harnessing non-software metrics
is under-researched. Considering that the root cause of software defects is
often attributed to human error, human factors theory might offer key
forecasting metrics for actionable insights. This paper explores automated
software defect prediction at the method level based on the developers' coding
habits. First, we propose a framework for deciding the metrics to conduct
predictions. Next, we compare the performance of our metrics to that of the
code and commit history metrics shown by research to achieve the highest
performance to date. Finally, we analyze the prediction importance of each
metric. As a result of our analyses of twenty-one critical infrastructure
large-scale open-source software projects, we have presented: (1) a human
error-based framework with metrics useful for defect prediction at method
level; (2) models using our proposed metrics achieve better average prediction
performance than the state-of-the-art code metrics and history measures; (3)
the prediction importance of all metrics distributes differently with each of
the novel metrics having better average importance than code and history
metrics; (4) the novel metrics dramatically enhance the explainability,
practicality, and actionability of software defect prediction models,
significantly advancing the field. We present a systematic approach to
forecasting defect-prone software methods via a human error framework. This
work empowers practitioners to act on predictions, empirically demonstrating
how developer coding habits contribute to defects in software systems.

### [297] [Large Language Models Versus Static Code Analysis Tools: A Systematic Benchmark for Vulnerability Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04448)
*Damian Gnieciak,Tomasz Szandala*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This study compares traditional static code analysis tools and large language models in detecting vulnerabilities within C# projects.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to improve software safety by understanding the strengths and weaknesses of both rule-based static tools and modern language models in automated code analysis.

Method: It evaluates six tools (three static models and three LLMs) using ten C# projects with embedded vulnerabilities, measuring metrics like accuracy, recall, latency, and developer effort.

Result: Language models outperform traditional tools in F1 scores, averaging higher recall, but have higher false positives and imprecise issue locations.

Conclusion: Language models are effective for broad vulnerability detection but should be combined with static tools in a hybrid approach for high-assurance code audits.

Abstract: Modern software relies on a multitude of automated testing and quality
assurance tools to prevent errors, bugs and potential vulnerabilities. This
study sets out to provide a head-to-head, quantitative and qualitative
evaluation of six automated approaches: three industry-standard rule-based
static code-analysis tools (SonarQube, CodeQL and Snyk Code) and three
state-of-the-art large language models hosted on the GitHub Models platform
(GPT-4.1, Mistral Large and DeepSeek V3). Using a curated suite of ten
real-world C# projects that embed 63 vulnerabilities across common categories
such as SQL injection, hard-coded secrets and outdated dependencies, we measure
classical detection accuracy (precision, recall, F-score), analysis latency,
and the developer effort required to vet true positives. The language-based
scanners achieve higher mean F-1 scores,0.797, 0.753 and 0.750, than their
static counterparts, which score 0.260, 0.386 and 0.546, respectively. LLMs'
advantage originates from superior recall, confirming an ability to reason
across broader code contexts. However, this benefit comes with substantial
trade-offs: DeepSeek V3 exhibits the highest false-positive ratio, all language
models mislocate issues at line-or-column granularity due to tokenisation
artefacts. Overall, language models successfully rival traditional static
analysers in finding real vulnerabilities. Still, their noisier output and
imprecise localisation limit their standalone use in safety-critical audits. We
therefore recommend a hybrid pipeline: employ language models early in
development for broad, context-aware triage, while reserving deterministic
rule-based scanners for high-assurance verification. The open benchmark and
JSON-based result harness released with this paper lay a foundation for
reproducible, practitioner-centric research into next-generation automated code
security.

*Hashini Gunatilake,John Grundy,Rashina Hoda,Ingo Mueller*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper investigates the role and manifestations of empathy in software engineering (SE), using interviews and surveys to gather data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Empathy is important in SE for collaboration and communication, but its presence and influence in practice are not well-understood.

Method: Conducted 22 interviews and a large-scale survey with 116 SE practitioners.

Result: The study identifies how empathy is expressed, factors influencing empathy, and SE activities associated with empathy. Practical insights are also provided.

Conclusion: Understanding empathy's role can enhance SE practices; the paper offers guidance for integrating empathy into SE processes.

Abstract: Empathy plays a crucial role in software engineering (SE), influencing
collaboration, communication, and decision-making. While prior research has
highlighted the importance of empathy in SE, there is limited understanding of
how empathy manifests in SE practice, what motivates SE practitioners to
demonstrate empathy, and the factors that influence empathy in SE work. Our
study explores these aspects through 22 interviews and a large scale survey
with 116 software practitioners. Our findings provide insights into the
expression of empathy in SE, the drivers behind empathetic practices, SE
activities where empathy is perceived as useful or not, and the other factors
that influence empathy. In addition, we offer practical implications for SE
practitioners and researchers, offering a deeper understanding of how to
effectively integrate empathy into SE processes.

### [299] [Controllable Surface Diffusion Generative Model for Neurodevelopmental Trajectories](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03706)
*Zhenshan Xie,Levente Baljer,M. Jorge Cardoso,Emma Robinson*

Main category: q-bio.NC

TL;DR: The paper introduces a graph-diffusion network to simulate cortical neurodevelopment in preterm birth cases, addressing challenges with individualized predictions and preserving morphological details.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Preterm birth disrupts normal neurodevelopment, leading to cognitive and behavioral risks. Accurate early predictions are difficult due to the wide range of outcomes.

Method: The authors developed a graph-diffusion network that utilizes cortical surface data to simulate individualized cortical maturation while addressing limitations of preserving cortical folding patterns and morphological variations.

Result: The model successfully preserved subject-specific cortical morphology and achieved a simulation accuracy that fooled an independent age regression network (prediction accuracy: 0.85 ± 0.62).

Conclusion: This novel approach effectively models cortical maturation in a subject-specific way, aiding in the identification of biomarkers for neurodevelopmental risks in preterm births.

Abstract: Preterm birth disrupts the typical trajectory of cortical neurodevelopment,
increasing the risk of cognitive and behavioral difficulties. However, outcomes
vary widely, posing a significant challenge for early prediction. To address
this, individualized simulation offers a promising solution by modeling
subject-specific neurodevelopmental trajectories, enabling the identification
of subtle deviations from normative patterns that might act as biomarkers of
risk. While generative models have shown potential for simulating
neurodevelopment, prior approaches often struggle to preserve subject-specific
cortical folding patterns or to reproduce region-specific morphological
variations. In this paper, we present a novel graph-diffusion network that
supports controllable simulation of cortical maturation. Using cortical surface
data from the developing Human Connectome Project (dHCP), we demonstrate that
the model maintains subject-specific cortical morphology while modeling
cortical maturation sufficiently well to fool an independently trained age
regression network, achieving a prediction accuracy of $0.85 \pm 0.62$.

### [300] [Cognitive Effort in the Two-Step Task: An Active Inference Drift-Diffusion Model Approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04435)
*Alvaro Garrido Perez,Viktor Lemoine,Amrapali Pednekar,Yara Khaluf,Pieter Simoens*

Main category: q-bio.NC

TL;DR: The study introduces a novel combination of Active Inference (AIF) and Drift-Diffusion Model (DDM) to unify cognitive effort arising from habit violation and value discriminability. Tested on a behavioral dataset in the two-step task, the model showed promise but highlighted limitations in experimental design.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to bridge the gap between high-level Bayesian Brain theories and mechanistic models to achieve a unified understanding of cognitive effort. This effort arises from competing influences, such as habits and subjective value assessments.

Method: Researchers integrated Active Inference (AIF) with the Drift-Diffusion Model (DDM), tested it using a behavioral dataset from the two-step task, and analyzed model predictions against an information-theoretic definition of cognitive effort.

Result: The AIF-DDM successfully captured second-stage reaction times but failed to model first-stage dynamics, likely due to experimental design rather than inherent flaws in the theory.

Conclusion: Integrating DDM improved parameter recovery and demonstrated potential for measuring cognitive effort more accurately. The study suggests modifications to the two-step task to isolate such cognitive effort better in future experimental setups.

Abstract: High-level theories rooted in the Bayesian Brain Hypothesis often frame
cognitive effort as the cost of resolving the conflict between habits and
optimal policies. In parallel, evidence accumulator models (EAMs) provide a
mechanistic account of how effort arises from competition between the
subjective values of available options. Although EAMs have been combined with
frameworks like Reinforcement Learning to bridge the gap between high-level
theories and process-level mechanisms, relatively less attention has been paid
to their implications for a unified notion of cognitive effort. Here, we
combine Active Inference (AIF) with the Drift-Diffusion Model (DDM) to
investigate whether the resulting AIF-DDM can simultaneously account for effort
arising from both habit violation and value discriminability. To our knowledge,
this is the first time AIF has been combined with an EAM. We tested the AIF-DDM
on a behavioral dataset from the two-step task and compared its predictions to
an information-theoretic definition of cognitive effort based on AIF. The
model's predictions successfully accounted for second-stage reaction times but
failed to capture the dynamics of the first stage. We argue the latter
discrepancy likely stems from the experimental design rather than a fundamental
flaw in the model's assumptions about cognitive effort. Accordingly, we propose
several modifications of the two-step task to better measure and isolate
cognitive effort. Finally, we found that integrating the DDM significantly
improved parameter recovery, which could help future studies to obtain more
reliable parameter estimates.

### [301] [Reliable Programmatic Weak Supervision with Confidence Intervals for Label Probabilities](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03896)
*Verónica Álvarez,Santiago Mazuelas,Steven An,Sanjoy Dasgupta*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper introduces a programmatic weak supervision methodology that enhances the reliability of label predictions and provides confidence intervals for probabilistic labels.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate dataset labeling is typically expensive and time-consuming, and weak labeling functions often yield unreliable predictions due to unknown interdependences and varied behavior.

Method: The proposed method utilizes uncertainty sets of distributions to integrate weak labeling functions effectively without restrictions on their behavior, offering confidence intervals for label probabilities.

Result: Experiments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate improved prediction reliability and practical use of confidence intervals, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: The methodology significantly advances weak supervision by improving prediction reliability and introducing user-accessible confidence measures for label probabilities.

Abstract: The accurate labeling of datasets is often both costly and time-consuming.
Given an unlabeled dataset, programmatic weak supervision obtains probabilistic
predictions for the labels by leveraging multiple weak labeling functions (LFs)
that provide rough guesses for labels. Weak LFs commonly provide guesses with
assorted types and unknown interdependences that can result in unreliable
predictions. Furthermore, existing techniques for programmatic weak supervision
cannot provide assessments for the reliability of the probabilistic predictions
for labels. This paper presents a methodology for programmatic weak supervision
that can provide confidence intervals for label probabilities and obtain more
reliable predictions. In particular, the methods proposed use uncertainty sets
of distributions that encapsulate the information provided by LFs with
unrestricted behavior and typology. Experiments on multiple benchmark datasets
show the improvement of the presented methods over the state-of-the-art and the
practicality of the confidence intervals presented.

Motivation: To improve reinforcement learning for infinite-horizon average-cost MDPs by leveraging structural properties like partial orders for better inference and efficiency, particularly addressing challenges in domains like operations research.

Method: An epoch-based RL algorithm that utilizes a partial order over policy classes, enabling counterfactual inference without extra environment interaction. The algorithm is analyzed to achieve a regret bound dependent only on the partial order's width.

Result: The algorithm achieves a regret bound of $O(\sqrt{w \log(|\Theta|) T})$, independent of state and action space sizes. It performs well in operations research domains like inventory control and queuing systems.

Conclusion: The proposed framework provides new theoretical guarantees and strong empirical results in operations research without needing extra assumptions, demonstrating the practicality of leveraging partial orders in reinforcement learning.

Abstract: We propose an epoch-based reinforcement learning algorithm for
infinite-horizon average-cost Markov decision processes (MDPs) that leverages a
partial order over a policy class. In this structure, $\pi' \leq \pi$ if data
collected under $\pi$ can be used to estimate the performance of $\pi'$,
enabling counterfactual inference without additional environment interaction.
Leveraging this partial order, we show that our algorithm achieves a regret
bound of $O(\sqrt{w \log(|\Theta|) T})$, where $w$ is the width of the partial
order. Notably, the bound is independent of the state and action space sizes.
We illustrate the applicability of these partial orders in many domains in
operations research, including inventory control and queuing systems. For each,
we apply our framework to that problem, yielding new theoretical guarantees and
strong empirical results without imposing extra assumptions such as convexity
in the inventory model or specialized arrival-rate structure in the queuing
model.

### [303] [Negative binomial regression and inference using a pre-trained transformer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04111)
*Valentine Svensson*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: A pre-trained transformer model was tested for estimating negative binomial regression parameters, showing improved parameter accuracy and speed over traditional methods, but simpler method-of-moments estimates proved even faster and effective.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address computational challenges in accurate estimation of negative binomial regression parameters for analyzing over-dispersed count data, especially in large-scale applications.

Method: The study trained a pre-trained transformer model using synthetic data to learn parameter estimation by inverting the count-generation process. Comparisons were made between transformer, maximum likelihood optimization, and method-of-moments approaches.

Result: The transformer method outperformed maximum likelihood optimization in parameter accuracy and speed (20 times faster). Surprisingly, method-of-moments estimates provided similar accuracy to maximum likelihood but were 1,000 times faster, with better calibration and statistical power.

Conclusion: While transformer models show promise, method-of-moments estimation is the most efficient technique in terms of speed, accuracy, and test quality for this specific application.

Abstract: Negative binomial regression is essential for analyzing over-dispersed count
data in in comparative studies, but parameter estimation becomes
computationally challenging in large screens requiring millions of comparisons.
We investigate using a pre-trained transformer to produce estimates of negative
binomial regression parameters from observed count data, trained through
synthetic data generation to learn to invert the process of generating counts
from parameters. The transformer method achieved better parameter accuracy than
maximum likelihood optimization while being 20 times faster. However,
comparisons unexpectedly revealed that method of moment estimates performed as
well as maximum likelihood optimization in accuracy, while being 1,000 times
faster and producing better-calibrated and more powerful tests, making it the
most efficient solution for this application.

### [304] [Deep Neural Network-Driven Adaptive Filtering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04258)
*Qizhen Wang,Gang Wang,Ying-Chang Liang*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper introduces a deep neural network-based framework addressing generalization in adaptive filtering by using direct gradient acquisition rather than traditional cost function designs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the limitations of existing adaptive filtering frameworks in generalizing across diverse data scenarios, especially in non-Gaussian settings.

Method: The framework employs a deep neural network as a universal nonlinear operator embedded within the AF system to map filtering residuals directly to learning gradients, utilizing maximum likelihood as an implicit cost function.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate exceptional generalization performance across a range of non-Gaussian scenarios. Additionally, mean value and mean square stability analyses support the algorithm’s robustness.

Conclusion: The DNN-driven approach offers a paradigm shift in AF system design, making it inherently data-driven with improved generalization capabilities validated theoretically and numerically.

Abstract: This paper proposes a deep neural network (DNN)-driven framework to address
the longstanding generalization challenge in adaptive filtering (AF). In
contrast to traditional AF frameworks that emphasize explicit cost function
design, the proposed framework shifts the paradigm toward direct gradient
acquisition. The DNN, functioning as a universal nonlinear operator, is
structurally embedded into the core architecture of the AF system, establishing
a direct mapping between filtering residuals and learning gradients. The
maximum likelihood is adopted as the implicit cost function, rendering the
derived algorithm inherently data-driven and thus endowed with exemplary
generalization capability, which is validated by extensive numerical
experiments across a spectrum of non-Gaussian scenarios. Corresponding mean
value and mean square stability analyses are also conducted in detail.

### [305] [The Relative Instability of Model Comparison with Cross-validation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04409)
*Alexandre Bayle,Lucas Janson,Lester Mackey*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: Cross-validation confidence intervals may not be valid for comparing the test error difference between two algorithms, even when both algorithms are individually stable.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the gap in understanding relative stability, a key component for ensuring valid confidence intervals when comparing two algorithms using cross-validation.

Method: The paper analyzes the soft-thresholded least squares algorithm and its comparison through theoretical proofs and empirical evaluations within sparse linear models.

Result: Relative stability fails to hold for comparing two soft-thresholded least squares algorithms, and cross-validation confidence intervals were found invalid in empirical tests.

Conclusion: Caution is advised when using cross-validation to compare the performance differences of two algorithms, even if both exhibit individual stability.

Abstract: Existing work has shown that cross-validation (CV) can be used to provide an
asymptotic confidence interval for the test error of a stable machine learning
algorithm, and existing stability results for many popular algorithms can be
applied to derive positive instances where such confidence intervals will be
valid. However, in the common setting where CV is used to compare two
algorithms, it becomes necessary to consider a notion of relative stability
which cannot easily be derived from existing stability results, even for simple
algorithms. To better understand relative stability and when CV provides valid
confidence intervals for the test error difference of two algorithms, we study
the soft-thresholded least squares algorithm, a close cousin of the Lasso. We
prove that while stability holds when assessing the individual test error of
this algorithm, relative stability fails to hold when comparing the test error
of two such algorithms, even in a sparse low-dimensional linear model setting.
Additionally, we empirically confirm the invalidity of CV confidence intervals
for the test error difference when either soft-thresholding or the Lasso is
used. In short, caution is needed when quantifying the uncertainty of CV
estimates of the performance difference of two machine learning algorithms,
even when both algorithms are individually stable.

Method: Implemented 13 uncertainty quantification approaches on ResNet and Vision Transformer architectures, extending certain methods for the multi-label domain.

Result: The study highlights how effectively different methods estimate uncertainty and differentiate between epistemic and aleatoric uncertainties.

Conclusion: Specific methods and architectures have distinct strengths and weaknesses in the context of medical imaging uncertainty quantification.

Abstract: Reliable uncertainty quantification is crucial for trustworthy
decision-making and the deployment of AI models in medical imaging. While prior
work has explored the ability of neural networks to quantify predictive,
epistemic, and aleatoric uncertainties using an information-theoretical
approach in synthetic or well defined data settings like natural image
classification, its applicability to real life medical diagnosis tasks remains
underexplored. In this study, we provide an extensive uncertainty
quantification benchmark for multi-label chest X-ray classification using the
MIMIC-CXR-JPG dataset. We evaluate 13 uncertainty quantification methods for
convolutional (ResNet) and transformer-based (Vision Transformer) architectures
across a wide range of tasks. Additionally, we extend Evidential Deep Learning,
HetClass NNs, and Deep Deterministic Uncertainty to the multi-label setting.
Our analysis provides insights into uncertainty estimation effectiveness and
the ability to disentangle epistemic and aleatoric uncertainties, revealing
method- and architecture-specific strengths and limitations.

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper develops a framework for metric learning using RKHS, offering new theoretical insights including generalization guarantees and sample complexity bounds. Experiments confirm the findings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Metric learning based on triplet comparisons is essential for applications like image retrieval and recommendation systems, but lacks theoretical foundations, particularly in nonlinear RKHS settings.

Method: The authors propose a general RKHS-based metric learning framework and derive mathematical guarantees such as generalization bounds and sample complexity estimates.

Result: They validate the theoretical results through simulations and experiments on real datasets, showing promise for nonlinear metric learning in RKHS.

Conclusion: The study advances metric learning theory by extending it to general RKHS settings and demonstrating its practical relevance through real-world datasets.

Abstract: Metric learning from a set of triplet comparisons in the form of "Do you
think item h is more similar to item i or item j?", indicating similarity and
differences between items, plays a key role in various applications including
image retrieval, recommendation systems, and cognitive psychology. The goal is
to learn a metric in the RKHS that reflects the comparisons. Nonlinear metric
learning using kernel methods and neural networks have shown great empirical
promise. While previous works have addressed certain aspects of this problem,
there is little or no theoretical understanding of such methods. The exception
is the special (linear) case in which the RKHS is the standard Euclidean space
$\mathbb{R}^d$; there is a comprehensive theory for metric learning in
$\mathbb{R}^d$. This paper develops a general RKHS framework for metric
learning and provides novel generalization guarantees and sample complexity
bounds. We validate our findings through a set of simulations and experiments
on real datasets. Our code is publicly available at

*Hiroki Kojima,Ivan Yevenko,Takashi Ikegami*

Main category: nlin.CG

TL;DR: The paper explores Asymptotic Lenia, a partial differential equations-based variant of Lenia, to derive conditions for glider patterns and optimize these patterns using gradient descent methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate Lenia's formulation as Asymptotic Lenia and advance understanding of its pattern formations, particularly gliders.

Method: The authors derive the 'Glider Equation' analytically and apply gradient descent techniques to optimize glider configurations. They further introduce equations to generalize gliders' characteristics across different speeds.

Result: Stable and novel glider configurations are discovered, including faster-moving variants, and relationships between Asymptotic Lenia and neural field models are identified.

Conclusion: The approach effectively expands the search space for discovering diverse and novel glider patterns, establishes mathematical connections to neural field models, and enables new exploration directions for continuous dynamical systems.

Abstract: Lenia is a continuous extension of Conway's Game of Life that exhibits rich
pattern formations including self-propelling structures called gliders. In this
paper, we focus on Asymptotic Lenia, a variant formulated as partial
differential equations. By utilizing this mathematical formulation, we
analytically derive the conditions for glider patterns, which we term the
``Glider Equation.'' We demonstrate that by using this equation as a loss
function, gradient descent methods can successfully discover stable glider
configurations. This approach enables the optimization of update rules to find
novel gliders with specific properties, such as faster-moving variants. We also
derive a velocity-free equation that characterizes gliders of any speed,
expanding the search space for novel patterns. While many optimized patterns
result in transient gliders that eventually destabilize, our approach
effectively identifies diverse pattern formations that would be difficult to
discover through traditional methods. Finally, we establish connections between
Asymptotic Lenia and neural field models, highlighting mathematical
relationships that bridge these systems and suggesting new directions for
analyzing pattern formation in continuous dynamical systems.

### [309] [Relationship between Perceived Maneuverability and Involuntary Eye Movements under Systematically Varied Time Constants of Ride-on Machinery](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03717)
*Muhammad Akmal Bin Mohammed Zaffir,Daisuke Sakai,Yuki Sato,Takahiro Wada*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: This study examined how ride-on machine dynamics affect involuntary eye movements, maneuverability perception, and cognitive load in human operators.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper explores how systematic variations in machine dynamics impact involuntary eye movements, perceived maneuverability, and cognitive load to improve understanding of operator-machine interaction.

Method: Participants operated a yaw-rotational platform with manipulated time constants between joystick input and machine response while fixating on a visual target. Eye movements were tracked, and subjective ratings of maneuverability and cognitive load were collected.

Result: Increased time constants reduced perceived maneuverability and eye movement accuracy while elevating cognitive load. Moderate positive correlations were observed between maneuverability scores and involuntary eye movement metrics.

Conclusion: Dynamic properties of ride-on machines significantly impact eye movement accuracy, perceived maneuverability, and cognitive load, pointing to considerations for machine design to optimize human-machine interactions.

Abstract: Studies suggest that involuntary eye movements exhibit greater stability
during active motion compared to passive motion, and this effect may also apply
to the operation of ride-on machinery. Moreover, a study suggested that
experimentally manipulating the sense of agency (SoA) by introducing delays may
influence the stability of involuntary eye movements. Although a preliminary
investigation examined involuntary eye movements and perceived maneuverability
under two distinct machine dynamics with preserved SoA, it remains unclear how
systematic variations in motion dynamics influence these factors. Therefore,
the purpose of the present research was to investigate whether systematic
variations in the dynamic properties of a ride-on machine, where the perceived
maneuverability is modulated, influence the accuracy of involuntary eye
movements in human operators. Participants rode a yaw-rotational platform whose
time constant from joystick input to motor torque of a rotational machine was
systematically manipulated. During the operation, eye movements were recorded
while participants fixated on a visual target. After each condition,
participants provided subjective ratings of maneuverability and cognitive load.
As the platform's time constant increased, the perceived maneuverability scores
decreased while the cognitive loads increased. Concurrently, involuntary eye
movement accuracy decreased. Moderate to weak positive correlations emerged
between the perceived maneuverability scores and the eye movement gain and
accuracy, while a weak negative correlation was found with cognitive load.

"Think First, Verify Always" (TFVA) protocol, which repositions humans as
'Firewall Zero', the first line of defense against AI-enabled threats. The
protocol is grounded in five operational principles: Awareness, Integrity,

TL;DR: Introduces a two-stage digital combining scheme for mmWave MIMO systems in mobile UE scenarios to reduce computational complexity while maintaining spectral efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Growing challenges in handling large baseband sample volumes in wideband point-to-point millimeter-wave MIMO systems with mobile user equipment.

Method: Proposes a two-stage digital combining scheme where the first stage performs dimension reduction leveraging channel geometry, and the second stage adapts combining to small-scale fading. Developed a pilot-based channel estimation method and analyzed digital precoding/combining.

Result: Numerical tests show the proposed method surpasses hybrid beamforming in spectral efficiency, even under imperfect channel estimation scenarios.

Conclusion: Two-stage fully digital transceivers enhance processing efficiency and performance, making them promising for future wideband mmWave MIMO systems.

Abstract: This paper considers a millimeter-wave wideband point-to-point MIMO system
with fully digital transceivers at the base station and the user equipment
(UE), focusing on mobile UE scenarios. A main challenge when building a digital
UE combining is the large volume of baseband samples to handle. To mitigate
computational and hardware complexity, we propose a novel two-stage digital
combining scheme at the UE. The first stage reduces the $N_{\text{r}}$ received
signals to $N_{\text{c}}$ streams before baseband processing, leveraging
channel geometry for dimension reduction and updating at the beam coherence
time, which is longer than the channel coherence time of the small-scale
fading. By contrast, the second-stage combining is updated per fading
realization. We develop a pilot-based channel estimation framework for this
hardware setup based on maximum likelihoodestimation in both uplink and
downlink. Digital precoding and combining designs are proposed, and a spectral
efficiency expression that incorporates imperfect channel knowledge is derived.
The numerical results demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms hybrid
beamforming, showcasing the attractiveness of using two-stage fully digital
transceivers in future systems.

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: The paper develops a machine learning framework using wearable sensors for non-invasive and real-time detection of Autonomic Dysreflexia (AD), a severe condition in spinal cord injury patients.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address the limitations of current AD monitoring methods, which are invasive or rely on subjective symptom reporting, by developing a more practical, non-invasive, and accurate detection system.

Method: The researchers used multimodal wearable sensors to collect physiological data and employed machine learning techniques, including BorutaSHAP for feature selection and a stacked ensemble meta-model, to detect AD. Cross-validation was used to ensure generalizability.

Result: The Nearest Centroid ensemble model achieved the best performance (Macro F1=0.77±0.03), with HR achieving the highest AUC (0.93). HR- and ECG-derived features were found to be most significant for AD detection.

Conclusion: The proposed method shows potential for robust, explainable, and practical AD detection in daily life, paving the way for personalized and real-time monitoring for SCI patients.

Abstract: Autonomic Dysreflexia (AD) is a potentially life-threatening condition
characterized by sudden, severe blood pressure (BP) spikes in individuals with
spinal cord injury (SCI). Early, accurate detection is essential to prevent
cardiovascular complications, yet current monitoring methods are either
invasive or rely on subjective symptom reporting, limiting applicability in
daily file. This study presents a non-invasive, explainable machine learning
framework for detecting AD using multimodal wearable sensors. Data were
collected from 27 individuals with chronic SCI during urodynamic studies,
including electrocardiography (ECG), photoplethysmography (PPG), bioimpedance
(BioZ), temperature, respiratory rate (RR), and heart rate (HR), across three
commercial devices. Objective AD labels were derived from synchronized
cuff-based BP measurements. Following signal preprocessing and feature
extraction, BorutaSHAP was used for robust feature selection, and SHAP values
for explainability. We trained modality- and device-specific weak learners and
aggregated them using a stacked ensemble meta-model. Cross-validation was
stratified by participants to ensure generalizability. HR- and ECG-derived
features were identified as the most informative, particularly those capturing
rhythm morphology and variability. The Nearest Centroid ensemble yielded the
highest performance (Macro F1 = 0.77+/-0.03), significantly outperforming
baseline models. Among modalities, HR achieved the highest area under the curve
(AUC = 0.93), followed by ECG (0.88) and PPG (0.86). RR and temperature
features contributed less to overall accuracy, consistent with missing data and
low specificity. The model proved robust to sensor dropout and aligned well
with clinical AD events. These results represent an important step toward
personalized, real-time monitoring for individuals with SCI.

Main category: cs.DB

TL;DR: The paper introduces Raqlet, a framework for translating recursive queries across relational, graph, and deductive systems, while offering consistent semantics and performance optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the inconsistency and fragmentation in recursive querying across different database systems and standards.

Method: Raqlet uses intermediate representations (IRs) to translate queries from one paradigm (e.g., Cypher, SQL/PGQ) to another (e.g., Datalog or recursive SQL), leveraging well-defined semantics.

Result: Raqlet enables cross-paradigm query translation, static analysis, and performance transformations, providing a consistent reference for language standards.

Conclusion: Raqlet facilitates portable recursive querying, rapid prototyping, and formal reasoning across diverse query engines while supporting database standards and optimizations.

Abstract: We introduce Raqlet, a source-to-source compilation framework that addresses
the fragmentation of recursive querying engines spanning relational (recursive
SQL), graph (Cypher, GQL), and deductive (Datalog) systems. Recent standards
such as SQL:2023's SQL/PGQ and the GQL standard provide a common foundation for
querying graph data within relational and graph databases; however, real-world
support remains inconsistent across systems. Raqlet bridges this gap by
translating recursive queries across paradigms through leveraging intermediate
representations (IRs) grounded in well-defined semantics; it translates Cypher
or SQL/PGQ to PGIR (inspired by Cypher), then into DLIR (inspired by Datalog),
and finally to SQIR (inspired by recursive SQL). Raqlet provides a shared
semantic basis that can serve as a golden reference implementation for language
standards, while supporting static analysis and transformations (e.g.,
magic-set transformation) for performance tuning. Our vision is to make Raqlet
a robust platform that enables rapid cross-paradigm prototyping, portable
recursive queries, and formal reasoning about recursion even when targeting
diverse query execution engines.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Generative models, particularly their application in recommender systems (Gen-RecSys), aim to enhance accuracy, diversity, and personalization for dynamic user experiences.

Method: The paper offers a taxonomy of Deep Generative Models categories (ID-driven, LLMs, multimodal) and analyzes their architectural and technical advancements.

Result: The taxonomy helps researchers navigate generative model applications in domains like multimodal content generation and conversational AI.

Conclusion: The study underscores the importance of evaluating generative models to address risks, aiming to push advancements in recommender systems and AI applications forward.

Abstract: Generative models are a class of AI models capable of creating new instances
of data by learning and sampling from their statistical distributions. In
recent years, these models have gained prominence in machine learning due to
the development of approaches such as generative adversarial networks (GANs),
variational autoencoders (VAEs), and transformer-based architectures such as
GPT. These models have applications across various domains, such as image
generation, text synthesis, and music composition. In recommender systems,
generative models, referred to as Gen-RecSys, improve the accuracy and
diversity of recommendations by generating structured outputs, text-based
interactions, and multimedia content. By leveraging these capabilities,
Gen-RecSys can produce more personalized, engaging, and dynamic user
experiences, expanding the role of AI in eCommerce, media, and beyond.
  Our book goes beyond existing literature by offering a comprehensive
understanding of generative models and their applications, with a special focus
on deep generative models (DGMs) and their classification. We introduce a
taxonomy that categorizes DGMs into three types: ID-driven models, large
language models (LLMs), and multimodal models. Each category addresses unique
technical and architectural advancements within its respective research area.
This taxonomy allows researchers to easily navigate developments in Gen-RecSys
across domains such as conversational AI and multimodal content generation.
Additionally, we examine the impact and potential risks of generative models,
emphasizing the importance of robust evaluation frameworks.

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: This study explores privacy vulnerabilities in LLM-powered recommender systems, showcasing how personal data can be reconstructed from model outputs via inversion attacks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional recommender systems struggle with cold start users/items and privacy vulnerabilities. The study investigates these weaknesses in cutting-edge LLM-powered systems.

Method: The researchers implemented and optimized the vec2text framework using a novel Similarity Guided Refinement technique to reconstruct textual prompts from model output logits.

Result: Experiments demonstrated accurate reconstruction of user data from model outputs, including 65% of user interactions and correct inference of demographic attributes like age and gender in 87% of cases.

Conclusion: LLM-powered recommender systems are critically vulnerable to privacy leakage, necessitating efforts to safeguard user data against inversion attacks.

Abstract: The large language model (LLM) powered recommendation paradigm has been
proposed to address the limitations of traditional recommender systems, which
often struggle to handle cold start users or items with new IDs. Despite its
effectiveness, this study uncovers that LLM empowered recommender systems are
vulnerable to reconstruction attacks that can expose both system and user
privacy. To examine this threat, we present the first systematic study on
inversion attacks targeting LLM empowered recommender systems, where
adversaries attempt to reconstruct original prompts that contain personal
preferences, interaction histories, and demographic attributes by exploiting
the output logits of recommendation models. We reproduce the vec2text framework
and optimize it using our proposed method called Similarity Guided Refinement,
enabling more accurate reconstruction of textual prompts from model generated
logits. Extensive experiments across two domains (movies and books) and two
representative LLM based recommendation models demonstrate that our method
achieves high fidelity reconstructions. Specifically, we can recover nearly 65
percent of the user interacted items and correctly infer age and gender in 87
percent of the cases. The experiments also reveal that privacy leakage is
largely insensitive to the victim model's performance but highly dependent on
domain consistency and prompt complexity. These findings expose critical

### [317] [A Social Data-Driven System for Identifying Estate-related Events and Topics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03711)
*Wenchuan Mu,Menglin Li,Kwan Hui Lim*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: The paper introduces a system that detects and categorizes estate-related issues from social media, while inferring geolocation for untagged posts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Social media provides a rich source of information about estate-related issues but lacks structured frameworks for identification, classification, and localization of such events.

Method: The authors developed a language model-powered system incorporating hierarchical classification for relevant filtering and categorization, along with a transformer-based module for geolocation inference.

Result: The system successfully identifies and classifies estate-related topics from social media and predicts posting locations for untagged posts at the point-of-interest level.

Conclusion: This system enables timely and actionable insights for urban management and situational awareness through the integration of classification and geolocation techniques.

Abstract: Social media platforms such as Twitter and Facebook have become deeply
embedded in our everyday life, offering a dynamic stream of localized news and
personal experiences. The ubiquity of these platforms position them as valuable
resources for identifying estate-related issues, especially in the context of
growing urban populations. In this work, we present a language model-based
system for the detection and classification of estate-related events from
social media content. Our system employs a hierarchical classification
framework to first filter relevant posts and then categorize them into
actionable estate-related topics. Additionally, for posts lacking explicit
geotags, we apply a transformer-based geolocation module to infer posting
locations at the point-of-interest level. This integrated approach supports
timely, data-driven insights for urban management, operational response and
situational awareness.

*Nachiket U. Bapat,Randy C. Paffenroth,Raghvendra V. Cowlagi*

Main category: eess.SY

TL;DR: The paper explores using generative AI models (GAN and VAE variants) to simulate operational data for aircraft guidance systems in scenarios with scarce real-world datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Systems like aircraft and spacecraft are costly to test in real-world scenarios, necessitating efficient methods to reduce reliance on expensive experiments while addressing discrepancies between real-world and simulated data.

Method: The authors train generative AI models using a few hundred examples and governing equations, designing loss functions based on Hamiltonian invariance for optimal control system applications.

Result: VAE-based models successfully synthesize data consistent with governing laws and training data, outperforming GANs in scenarios with limited data availability.

Conclusion: Generative AI models, especially VAE variants, show promise in aerospace engineering by producing accurate simulation data that adheres to physical laws, even with limited training examples.

Abstract: Systems like aircraft and spacecraft are expensive to operate in the real
world. The design, validation, and testing for such systems therefore relies on
a combination of mathematical modeling, abundant numerical simulations, and a
relatively small set of real-world experiments. Due to modeling errors,
simplifications, and uncertainties, the data synthesized by simulation models
often does not match data from the system's real-world operation. We consider
the broad research question of whether this model mismatch can be significantly
reduced by generative artificial intelligence models (GAIMs). Unlike text- or
image-processing, where generative models have attained recent successes, GAIM
development for aerospace engineering applications must not only train with
scarce operational data, but their outputs must also satisfy governing
equations based on natural laws, e.g., conservation laws. The scope of this
paper primarily focuses on two case studies of optimally controlled systems
that are commonly understood and employed in aircraft guidance, namely:
minimum-time navigation in a wind field and minimum-exposure navigation in a
threat field. We report GAIMs that are trained with a relatively small set, of
the order of a few hundred, of examples and with underlying governing
equations. By focusing on optimally controlled systems, we formulate training
loss functions based on invariance of the Hamiltonian function along system
trajectories. We investigate three GAIM architectures, namely: the generative
adversarial network (GAN) and two variants of the variational autoencoder
(VAE). We provide architectural details and thorough performance analyses of
these models. The main finding is that our new models, especially the VAE-based
models, are able to synthesize data that satisfy the governing equations and
are statistically similar to the training data despite small volumes of
training data.

TL;DR: The study uses interpretable machine learning to identify and quantify significant periodic patterns in human mobility data, revealing insights into urban dynamics and the impact of COVID-19 on mobility regularity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To uncover temporal regularities in human mobility for understanding urban dynamics and supporting decision-making processes and applications in urban systems.

Method: The study employs a sparse autoregression-based framework to detect and quantify dominant positive auto-correlations in time series data, applied to human mobility datasets like metro passenger flow and ridesharing trips.

Result: The framework reveals weekly periodicity in human mobility data and shows the impact of COVID-19 on mobility regularity, with significant findings regarding recovery trends and disparities between NYC and Chicago.

Conclusion: Sparse autoregression provides interpretable insights into human mobility patterns, showcasing the potential of interpretable machine learning for analyzing real-world mobility data and understanding urban systems.

Abstract: Uncovering the temporal regularity of human mobility is crucial for
discovering urban dynamics and has implications for various decision-making
processes and urban system applications. This study formulates the periodicity
quantification problem in complex and multidimensional human mobility data as a
sparse identification of dominant positive auto-correlations in time series
autoregression, allowing one to discover and quantify significant periodic
patterns such as weekly periodicity from a data-driven and interpretable
machine learning perspective. We apply our framework to real-world human
mobility data, including metro passenger flow in Hangzhou, China and
ridesharing trips in New York City (NYC) and Chicago, USA, revealing the
interpretable weekly periodicity across different spatial locations over past
several years. In particular, our analysis of ridesharing data from 2019 to
2024 demonstrates the disruptive impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on mobility
regularity and the subsequent recovery trends, highlighting differences in the
recovery pattern percentages and speeds between NYC and Chicago. We explore
that both NYC and Chicago experienced a remarkable reduction of weekly
periodicity in 2020, and the recovery of mobility regularity in NYC is faster
than Chicago. The interpretability of sparse autoregression provides insights
into the underlying temporal patterns of human mobility, offering a valuable
tool for understanding urban systems. Our findings highlight the potential of
interpretable machine learning to unlock crucial insights from real-world
mobility data.

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: The paper discusses a shift toward autonomous AI decision-makers in corporate environments, addressing the need for ethical and legal frameworks through an innovative reference model.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The development of AI technologies in corporate management is outpacing the creation of adequate legal and ethical guidelines, creating a need for structured frameworks.

Method: The proposed methodology includes a reference model incorporating computational law, algorithmic frameworks, dedicated operational contexts, synthetic data training, game theory, and the emphasis on explainable AI.

Result: The research demonstrates how these elements ensure fair, transparent, and ethical operations for autonomous AI systems in corporate environments.

Conclusion: The study concludes the necessity of robust frameworks like computational law and explainable AI to enable trustworthy, ethical autonomous decision-making in corporate settings.

Abstract: The study addresses the paradigm shift in corporate management, where AI is
moving from a decision support tool to an autonomous decision-maker, with some
AI systems already appointed to leadership roles in companies. A central
problem identified is that the development of AI technologies is far outpacing
the creation of adequate legal and ethical guidelines.
  The research proposes a "reference model" for the development and
implementation of autonomous AI systems in corporate management. This model is
based on a synthesis of several key components to ensure legitimate and ethical
decision-making. The model introduces the concept of "computational law" or
"algorithmic law". This involves creating a separate legal framework for AI
systems, with rules and regulations translated into a machine-readable,
algorithmic format to avoid the ambiguity of natural language. The paper
emphasises the need for a "dedicated operational context" for autonomous AI
systems, analogous to the "operational design domain" for autonomous vehicles.
This means creating a specific, clearly defined environment and set of rules
within which the AI can operate safely and effectively. The model advocates for
training AI systems on controlled, synthetically generated data to ensure
fairness and ethical considerations are embedded from the start. Game theory is
also proposed as a method for calculating the optimal strategy for the AI to
achieve its goals within these ethical and legal constraints. The provided
analysis highlights the importance of explainable AI (XAI) to ensure the
transparency and accountability of decisions made by autonomous systems. This
is crucial for building trust and for complying with the "right to
explanation".

policy concern. This paper offers a comparative analysis of AI-related
regulatory and ethical frameworks across key global regions, including the
European Union, United Kingdom, United States, China, and Gulf Cooperation
Council (GCC) countries. It maps how core trustworthiness principles, such as
transparency, fairness, accountability, data privacy, and human oversight are
embedded in regional legislation and AI governance structures. Special emphasis
is placed on the evolving landscape in the GCC, where countries are rapidly
advancing national AI strategies and education-sector innovation. To support
this development, the paper introduces a Compliance-Centered AI Governance
Framework tailored to the GCC context. This includes a tiered typology and
institutional checklist designed to help regulators, educators, and developers
align AI adoption with both international norms and local values. By
synthesizing global best practices with region-specific challenges, the paper
contributes practical guidance for building legally sound, ethically grounded,

Conclusion: Co-locating quantum and HPC systems is promising for enhancing hybrid algorithm efficiency and tackling large-scale problems, highlighting potential industrial application benefits.

Abstract: We conducted a systematic survey of emerging quantum-HPC platforms, which
integrate quantum computers and High-Performance Computing (HPC) systems

Conclusion: Integrating malleability and workflow strategies presents a promising solution for efficient hybrid HPC-quantum workloads.

Abstract: The integration of quantum computers within classical High-Performance

Motivation: The study aims to address the computational cost of simulating large macromolecular systems using molecular dynamics by exploring deep learning solutions.

Method: The authors developed MD-LLM-1 by fine-tuning the Mistral 7B model to predict protein conformations from molecular dynamics data, focusing on T4 lysozyme and Mad2 protein systems.

Result: MD-LLM-1 demonstrated the ability to predict new conformational states of proteins beyond those used in training, indicating an understanding of protein conformational landscapes.

Conclusion: MD-LLM-1 showcases the potential of leveraging LLMs in molecular dynamics to predict protein states, although it doesn't yet model thermodynamics and kinetics explicitly.

Abstract: Molecular dynamics (MD) is a powerful approach for modelling molecular
systems, but it remains computationally intensive on spatial and time scales of
many macromolecular systems of biological interest. To explore the
opportunities offered by deep learning to address this problem, we introduce a
Molecular Dynamics Large Language Model (MD-LLM) framework to illustrate how
LLMs can be leveraged to learn protein dynamics and discover states not seen in
training. By applying MD-LLM-1, the first implementation of this approach,
obtained by fine-tuning Mistral 7B, to the T4 lysozyme and Mad2 protein
systems, we show that training on one conformational state enables the
prediction of other conformational states. These results indicate that MD-LLM-1
can learn the principles for the exploration of the conformational landscapes
of proteins, although it is not yet modeling explicitly their thermodynamics

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To handle scenarios where agents in MAPF face malfunctions, which disrupt optimal schedules and make full replanning computationally infeasible.

Method: Propose protocols for dynamic schedule adaptation, focusing on local coordination among agents and computation shifting to network nodes in a secondary protocol for robustness.

Result: Demonstrates that the primary protocol limits makespan increases after k malfunctions to k additional turns, with practical scalability and resilience achieved by both protocols.

Conclusion: The introduced protocols provide an efficient and scalable solution to maintain resilient multiagent navigation despite agent failures.

Abstract: In Multiagent Path Finding (MAPF), the goal is to compute efficient,
collision-free paths for multiple agents navigating a network from their
sources to targets, minimizing the schedule's makespan-the total time until all
agents reach their destinations. We introduce a new variant that formally
models scenarios where some agents may experience delays due to malfunctions,
posing significant challenges for maintaining optimal schedules.
  Recomputing an entirely new schedule from scratch after each malfunction is
often computationally infeasible. To address this, we propose a framework for
dynamic schedule adaptation that does not rely on full replanning. Instead, we
develop protocols enabling agents to locally coordinate and adjust their paths
on the fly. We prove that following our primary communication protocol, the
increase in makespan after k malfunctions is bounded by k additional turns,
effectively limiting the impact of malfunctions on overall efficiency.
Moreover, recognizing that agents may have limited computational capabilities,
we also present a secondary protocol that shifts the necessary computations
onto the network's nodes, ensuring robustness without requiring enhanced agent
processing power. Our results demonstrate that these protocols provide a
practical, scalable approach to resilient multiagent navigation in the face of
agent failures.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI-based systems have shown promise in diagnosing respiratory diseases using sound data, but label and data scarcity hinder their performance and applicability beyond well-researched diseases like COVID-19.

Method: The authors propose CoughViT, a pre-training framework utilizing masked data modeling to generate general-purpose cough sound representations. This approach enables self-supervised learning to overcome label scarcity.

Result: CoughViT's representations match or outperform current supervised audio representations in enhancing performance on downstream tasks across three key cough classification tasks.

Conclusion: CoughViT demonstrates the potential of self-supervised cough sound representation learning to address data scarcity issues, making it a robust tool for improving respiratory disease diagnostics in limited data scenarios.

Abstract: Physicians routinely assess respiratory sounds during the diagnostic process,
providing insight into the condition of a patient's airways. In recent years,
AI-based diagnostic systems operating on respiratory sounds, have demonstrated
success in respiratory disease detection. These systems represent a crucial
advancement in early and accessible diagnosis which is essential for timely
treatment. However, label and data scarcity remain key challenges, especially
for conditions beyond COVID-19, limiting diagnostic performance and reliable
evaluation. In this paper, we propose CoughViT, a novel pre-training framework
for learning general-purpose cough sound representations, to enhance diagnostic
performance in tasks with limited data. To address label scarcity, we employ
masked data modelling to train a feature encoder in a self-supervised learning
manner. We evaluate our approach against other pre-training strategies on three

TL;DR: This study explores whether interpretable deep learning models are more robust against adversarial perturbations compared to black-box models, using music emotion recognition (MER) as a case study.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses deep learning models' vulnerability to adversarial perturbations and explores whether focusing on interpretable features can mitigate this issue.

Method: The study compared the robustness of interpretable, black-box, and adversarially trained deep learning models on adversarial examples, specifically in the context of music emotion recognition (MER).

Result: The research found that interpretable models can be as robust as adversarially trained models but with lower computational cost, outperforming black-box counterparts in robustness.

Conclusion: Inherently interpretable deep models offer a robust and computationally efficient alternative to adversarial training for enhancing model robustness.

Abstract: One of the desired key properties of deep learning models is the ability to
generalise to unseen samples. When provided with new samples that are
(perceptually) similar to one or more training samples, deep learning models
are expected to produce correspondingly similar outputs. Models that succeed in
predicting similar outputs for similar inputs are often called robust. Deep
learning models, on the other hand, have been shown to be highly vulnerable to
minor (adversarial) perturbations of the input, which manage to drastically
change a model's output and simultaneously expose its reliance on spurious
correlations. In this work, we investigate whether inherently interpretable
deep models, i.e., deep models that were designed to focus more on meaningful
and interpretable features, are more robust to irrelevant perturbations in the
data, compared to their black-box counterparts. We test our hypothesis by
comparing the robustness of an interpretable and a black-box music emotion
recognition (MER) model when challenged with adversarial examples. Furthermore,
we include an adversarially trained model, which is optimised to be more
robust, in the comparison. Our results indicate that inherently more
interpretable models can indeed be more robust than their black-box
counterparts, and achieve similar levels of robustness as adversarially trained
models, at lower computational cost.

Result: The paper critically reviews datasets, evaluation frameworks, and state-of-the-art methods, while addressing challenges like data variability, annotation scarcity, and model interpretability.

Conclusion: The study concludes with promising directions such as ultra-widefield imaging and reinforcement learning to develop more interpretable and clinically robust AI systems in ophthalmology.

Abstract: Visual impairment represents a major global health challenge, with multimodal
imaging providing complementary information that is essential for accurate
ophthalmic diagnosis. This comprehensive survey systematically reviews the
latest advances in multimodal deep learning methods in ophthalmology up to the
year 2025. The review focuses on two main categories: task-specific multimodal
approaches and large-scale multimodal foundation models. Task-specific
approaches are designed for particular clinical applications such as lesion
detection, disease diagnosis, and image synthesis. These methods utilize a
variety of imaging modalities including color fundus photography, optical
coherence tomography, and angiography. On the other hand, foundation models
combine sophisticated vision-language architectures and large language models
pretrained on diverse ophthalmic datasets. These models enable robust
cross-modal understanding, automated clinical report generation, and decision
support. The survey critically examines important datasets, evaluation metrics,
and methodological innovations including self-supervised learning,
attention-based fusion, and contrastive alignment. It also discusses ongoing
challenges such as variability in data, limited annotations, lack of
interpretability, and issues with generalizability across different patient
populations. Finally, the survey outlines promising future directions that
emphasize the use of ultra-widefield imaging and reinforcement learning-based
reasoning frameworks to create intelligent, interpretable, and clinically

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: The paper develops a method for retinal vessel segmentation that integrates artery and vein classification, achieving state-of-the-art (SOTA) results by introducing novel loss functions to improve prediction accuracy and consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for retinal vessel segmentation and artery/vein classification treat the tasks separately, overlooking the intrinsic relationships between vessel structures. Manual methods are also resource-intensive and inconsistent, necessitating an automated and holistic approach.

Method: The authors propose a Channel-Coupled Vessel Consistency Loss to ensure coherence between different vessel structures (artery, vein, overall vessel) and introduce an intra-image pixel-level contrastive loss to extract fine-grained features for accurate A/V classification.

Result: The method achieves SOTA results on three public A/V classification datasets: RITE, LES-AV, and HRF.

Conclusion: The proposed approach successfully integrates vessel segmentation with A/V classification, overcoming limitations of existing methods and demonstrating its effectiveness on multiple benchmark datasets.

Abstract: Retinal vessel segmentation plays a vital role in analyzing fundus images for
the diagnosis of systemic and ocular diseases. Building on this, classifying
segmented vessels into arteries and veins (A/V) further enables the extraction
of clinically relevant features such as vessel width, diameter and tortuosity,
which are essential for detecting conditions like diabetic and hypertensive
retinopathy. However, manual segmentation and classification are
time-consuming, costly and inconsistent. With the advancement of Convolutional
Neural Networks, several automated methods have been proposed to address this
challenge, but there are still some issues. For example, the existing methods
all treat artery, vein and overall vessel segmentation as three separate binary
tasks, neglecting the intrinsic coupling relationships between these anatomical
structures. Considering artery and vein structures are subsets of the overall
retinal vessel map and should naturally exhibit prediction consistency with it,
we design a novel loss named Channel-Coupled Vessel Consistency Loss to enforce
the coherence and consistency between vessel, artery and vein predictions,
avoiding biasing the network toward three simple binary segmentation tasks.
Moreover, we also introduce a regularization term named intra-image pixel-level
contrastive loss to extract more discriminative feature-level fine-grained
representations for accurate retinal A/V classification. SOTA results have been
achieved across three public A/V classification datasets including RITE, LES-AV
and HRF. Our code will be available upon acceptance.

TL;DR: The paper proposes an automated system for detecting bone fractures using a modified VGG-19 model, achieving high accuracy and interpretability via Grad-CAM.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges of time-consuming and error-prone X-ray interpretations and limitations in current deep learning methods, which lack interpretability and accuracy.

Method: Utilizes a modified VGG-19 model with preprocessing techniques like CLAHE, Otsu's thresholding, and Canny edge detection, combined with Grad-CAM for model interpretability. The framework is deployed as a real-time web application.

Result: The modified VGG-19 model achieves 99.78% classification accuracy and an AUC score of 1.00, delivering fast diagnostic feedback within 0.5 seconds.

Conclusion: The proposed framework provides a reliable, fast, and interpretable solution for bone fracture detection, supporting efficient diagnostics and improved patient care.

Abstract: Early and accurate detection of the bone fracture is paramount to initiating
treatment as early as possible and avoiding any delay in patient treatment and
outcomes. Interpretation of X-ray image is a time consuming and error prone
task, especially when resources for such interpretation are limited by lack of
radiology expertise. Additionally, deep learning approaches used currently,
typically suffer from misclassifications and lack interpretable explanations to
clinical use. In order to overcome these challenges, we propose an automated
framework of bone fracture detection using a VGG-19 model modified to our
needs. It incorporates sophisticated preprocessing techniques that include
Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization (CLAHE), Otsu's thresholding,
and Canny edge detection, among others, to enhance image clarity as well as to
facilitate the feature extraction. Therefore, we use Grad-CAM, an Explainable
AI method that can generate visual heatmaps of the model's decision making
process, as a type of model interpretability, for clinicians to understand the
model's decision making process. It encourages trust and helps in further
clinical validation. It is deployed in a real time web application, where
healthcare professionals can upload X-ray images and get the diagnostic
feedback within 0.5 seconds. The performance of our modified VGG-19 model
attains 99.78\% classification accuracy and AUC score of 1.00, making it
exceptionally good. The framework provides a reliable, fast, and interpretable
solution for bone fracture detection that reasons more efficiently for
diagnoses and better patient care.

### [334] [Boosting Vision Semantic Density with Anatomy Normality Modeling for Medical Vision-language Pre-training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03742)
*Weiwei Cao,Jianpeng Zhang,Zhongyi Shui,Sinuo Wang,Zeli Chen,Xi Li,Le Lu,Xianghua Ye,Tingbo Liang,Qi Zhang,Ling Zhang*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: The paper enhances vision-language pre-training (VLP) for medical diagnostics by boosting the semantic density of medical images, leading to improved alignment with diagnostic reports and achieving state-of-the-art results across multiple datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the semantic density gap caused by low signal-to-noise ratios (SNR) in medical images compared to high SNR in medical reports, which hinders effective alignment for medical diagnostic applications.

Method: The authors enhance visual semantics through disease-level contrastive learning and anatomical normality modeling. They use VQ-VAE to reconstruct normal embeddings and detect abnormal signals via distribution shifts, improving the model’s ability to capture diagnostic-relevant information.

Result: The method achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot performance on chest and abdominal CT datasets, with an average AUC of 84.9% across 54 diseases in 15 organs, significantly outperforming prior methods.

Conclusion: Boosting vision semantic density is an effective strategy to bridge the alignment gap in vision-language pre-training for medical diagnostics, with superior performance and transfer learning capabilities demonstrated on diverse datasets.

Abstract: Vision-language pre-training (VLP) has great potential for developing
multifunctional and general medical diagnostic capabilities. However, aligning
medical images with a low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) to reports with a high
SNR presents a semantic density gap, leading to visual alignment bias. In this
paper, we propose boosting vision semantic density to improve alignment
effectiveness. On one hand, we enhance visual semantics through disease-level
vision contrastive learning, which strengthens the model's ability to
differentiate between normal and abnormal samples for each anatomical
structure. On the other hand, we introduce an anatomical normality modeling
method to model the distribution of normal samples for each anatomy, leveraging
VQ-VAE for reconstructing normal vision embeddings in the latent space. This
process amplifies abnormal signals by leveraging distribution shifts in
abnormal samples, enhancing the model's perception and discrimination of
abnormal attributes. The enhanced visual representation effectively captures
the diagnostic-relevant semantics, facilitating more efficient and accurate
alignment with the diagnostic report. We conduct extensive experiments on two
chest CT datasets, CT-RATE and Rad-ChestCT, and an abdominal CT dataset,
MedVL-CT69K, and comprehensively evaluate the diagnosis performance across
multiple tasks in the chest and abdominal CT scenarios, achieving
state-of-the-art zero-shot performance. Notably, our method achieved an average
AUC of 84.9% across 54 diseases in 15 organs, significantly surpassing existing
methods. Additionally, we demonstrate the superior transfer learning
capabilities of our pre-trained model. Code is available at

*Sarah Grube,Sören Grünhagen,Sarah Latus,Michael Meyling,Alexander Schlaefer*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: This paper explores the use of deep learning to predict shear wave velocities from ultrasound data, assessing the necessity of pre-processing and its impact.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Develop a reliable and standardized approach for analyzing tissue elasticity using ultrasound shear wave elastography.

Method: Evaluate how varying degrees of ultrasound pre-processing influence the predictions of a 3D convolutional neural network on shear wave velocities.

Result: Statistically significant differences in elasticity groups were observed, irrespective of image pre-processing; deep learning showed potential even with raw data.

Conclusion: Deep learning can reduce reliance on traditional image pre-processing in ultrasound shear wave elastography, expediting clinical elasticity diagnostics.

Abstract: Estimating the elasticity of soft tissue can provide useful information for
various diagnostic applications. Ultrasound shear wave elastography offers a
non-invasive approach. However, its generalizability and standardization across
different systems and processing pipelines remain limited. Considering the
influence of image processing on ultrasound based diagnostics, recent
literature has discussed the impact of different image processing steps on
reliable and reproducible elasticity analysis. In this work, we investigate the
need of ultrasound pre-processing steps for deep learning-based ultrasound
shear wave elastography. We evaluate the performance of a 3D convolutional
neural network in predicting shear wave velocities from spatio-temporal
ultrasound images, studying different degrees of pre-processing on the input
images, ranging from fully beamformed and filtered ultrasound images to raw
radiofrequency data. We compare the predictions from our deep learning approach
to a conventional time-of-flight method across four gelatin phantoms with
different elasticity levels. Our results demonstrate statistically significant
differences in the predicted shear wave velocity among all elasticity groups,
regardless of the degree of pre-processing. Although pre-processing slightly
improves performance metrics, our results show that the deep learning approach
can reliably differentiate between elasticity groups using raw, unprocessed
radiofrequency data. These results show that deep learning-based approaches
could reduce the need for and the bias of traditional ultrasound pre-processing
steps in ultrasound shear wave elastography, enabling faster and more reliable
clinical elasticity assessments.

TL;DR: The paper introduces M$^3$HL, a new augmentation method and hierarchical consistency framework for semi-supervised medical image segmentation, achieving state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Explore better CutMix-like approaches for medical image segmentation, focusing on flexibility and feature-level consistency.

Method: M$^3$ for dynamic masking in data augmentation and HL for enforcing hierarchical feature consistency between images.

Result: The method achieves superior performance compared to existing approaches on ACDC and LA datasets.

Conclusion: M$^3$HL effectively fuses information from labeled and unlabeled images, improving segmentation tasks by leveraging advanced masking and feature consistency techniques.

Abstract: Data augmentation methods inspired by CutMix have demonstrated significant
potential in recent semi-supervised medical image segmentation tasks. However,
these approaches often apply CutMix operations in a rigid and inflexible
manner, while paying insufficient attention to feature-level consistency
constraints. In this paper, we propose a novel method called Mutual Mask Mix
with High-Low level feature consistency (M$^3$HL) to address the aforementioned
challenges, which consists of two key components: 1) M$^3$: An enhanced data
augmentation operation inspired by the masking strategy from Masked Image
Modeling (MIM), which advances conventional CutMix through dynamically
adjustable masks to generate spatially complementary image pairs for
collaborative training, thereby enabling effective information fusion between
labeled and unlabeled images. 2) HL: A hierarchical consistency regularization
framework that enforces high-level and low-level feature consistency between
unlabeled and mixed images, enabling the model to better capture discriminative
feature representations.Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on
widely adopted medical image segmentation benchmarks including the ACDC and LA
datasets. Source code is available at https://github.com/PHPJava666/M3HL

### [337] [When Deep Learning Fails: Limitations of Recurrent Models on Stroke-Based Handwriting for Alzheimer's Disease Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03773)
*Emanuele Nardone,Tiziana D'Alessandro,Francesco Fontanella,Claudio De Stefano*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: The paper evaluates the effectiveness of deep learning models (LSTM, GRU, RNN) versus traditional machine learning approaches for detecting Alzheimer's disease through handwriting analysis, showing traditional methods outperform deep learning due to architectural incompatibility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to develop a non-invasive method for detecting Alzheimer's disease using handwriting analysis, avoiding expensive and invasive procedures like neuroimaging.

Method: Researchers used handwriting data from 34 tasks performed by healthy controls and Alzheimer's patients to compare recurrent neural networks and traditional ensemble machine learning models. Stroke-level features were extracted and used as input data.

Result: Deep learning models showed poor specificity and high variance compared to traditional ensemble methods, which achieved higher accuracy and balanced metrics.

Conclusion: Deep learning architectures struggled due to incompatibilities with feature-based stroke data, despite their complexity. Traditional machine learning methods are currently more effective, and the study highlights critical directions for improving data representation.

Abstract: Alzheimer's disease detection requires expensive neuroimaging or invasive
procedures, limiting accessibility. This study explores whether deep learning
can enable non-invasive Alzheimer's disease detection through handwriting
analysis. Using a dataset of 34 distinct handwriting tasks collected from
healthy controls and Alzheimer's disease patients, we evaluate and compare
three recurrent neural architectures (LSTM, GRU, RNN) against traditional
machine learning models. A crucial distinction of our approach is that the
recurrent models process pre-extracted features from discrete strokes, not raw
temporal signals. This violates the assumption of a continuous temporal flow
that recurrent networks are designed to capture. Results reveal that they
exhibit poor specificity and high variance. Traditional ensemble methods
significantly outperform all deep architectures, achieving higher accuracy with
balanced metrics. This demonstrates that recurrent architectures, designed for
continuous temporal sequences, fail when applied to feature vectors extracted
from ambiguously segmented strokes. Despite their complexity, deep learning
models cannot overcome the fundamental disconnect between their architectural
assumptions and the discrete, feature-based nature of stroke-level handwriting
data. Although performance is limited, the study highlights several critical
issues in data representation and model compatibility, pointing to valuable
directions for future research.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: ASTRA is an automated system that improves the safety of AI coding assistants by finding and addressing vulnerabilities using adaptive probing and knowledge-graph-guided testing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The increasing use of AI-powered coding assistants, such as GitHub Copilot, brings safety concerns, particularly in critical domains like cybersecurity.

Method: ASTRA operates in three stages: building domain-specific knowledge graphs, probing vulnerabilities in the target model via spatial and temporal exploration, and generating test cases to enhance model alignment.

Result: ASTRA uncovers 11-66% more vulnerabilities compared to existing tools and achieves 17% better model alignment through its generated test cases.

Conclusion: ASTRA proves effective in systematically identifying and mitigating safety flaws in AI coding assistants, offering practical benefits for safer AI system development.

Abstract: AI coding assistants like GitHub Copilot are rapidly transforming software
development, but their safety remains deeply uncertain-especially in
high-stakes domains like cybersecurity. Current red-teaming tools often rely on
fixed benchmarks or unrealistic prompts, missing many real-world
vulnerabilities. We present ASTRA, an automated agent system designed to
systematically uncover safety flaws in AI-driven code generation and security
guidance systems. ASTRA works in three stages: (1) it builds structured
domain-specific knowledge graphs that model complex software tasks and known
weaknesses; (2) it performs online vulnerability exploration of each target
model by adaptively probing both its input space, i.e., the spatial
exploration, and its reasoning processes, i.e., the temporal exploration,
guided by the knowledge graphs; and (3) it generates high-quality
violation-inducing cases to improve model alignment. Unlike prior methods,
ASTRA focuses on realistic inputs-requests that developers might actually
ask-and uses both offline abstraction guided domain modeling and online domain
knowledge graph adaptation to surface corner-case vulnerabilities. Across two
major evaluation domains, ASTRA finds 11-66% more issues than existing
techniques and produces test cases that lead to 17% more effective alignment
training, showing its practical value for building safer AI systems.

*Borui Li,Li Yan,Junhao Han,Jianmin Liu,Lei Yu*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: SenseCrypt introduces a novel approach to optimize Homomorphic Encryption (HE) for Federated Learning (FL), addressing its overhead and adaptation challenges, particularly in cross-device scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Homomorphic Encryption is crucial for securing Federated Learning but suffers from high overhead, client straggling, and poor adaptation in scenarios with diverse data and system capabilities.

Method: SenseCrypt employs sensitivity-based clustering, a straggler-free scoring mechanism for parameter encryption ratios, and multi-objective optimization to adapt the encryption strategy to each client.

Result: The framework ensures data security, maintains model accuracy comparable to IID scenarios, and significantly reduces training time by 58.4%-88.7% compared to traditional HE methods.

Conclusion: SenseCrypt effectively balances security and efficiency in FL, making it highly adaptable for heterogeneous cross-device applications while addressing HE performance bottlenecks.

Abstract: Homomorphic Encryption (HE) prevails in securing Federated Learning (FL), but
suffers from high overhead and adaptation cost. Selective HE methods, which
partially encrypt model parameters by a global mask, are expected to protect
privacy with reduced overhead and easy adaptation. However, in cross-device
scenarios with heterogeneous data and system capabilities, traditional
Selective HE methods deteriorate client straggling, and suffer from degraded HE
overhead reduction performance. Accordingly, we propose SenseCrypt, a
Sensitivity-guided selective Homomorphic EnCryption framework, to adaptively
balance security and HE overhead per cross-device FL client. Given the
observation that model parameter sensitivity is effective for measuring
clients' data distribution similarity, we first design a privacy-preserving
method to respectively cluster the clients with similar data distributions.
Then, we develop a scoring mechanism to deduce the straggler-free ratio of
model parameters that can be encrypted by each client per cluster. Finally, for
each client, we formulate and solve a multi-objective model parameter selection
optimization problem, which minimizes HE overhead while maximizing model
security without causing straggling. Experiments demonstrate that SenseCrypt
ensures security against the state-of-the-art inversion attacks, while
achieving normal model accuracy as on IID data, and reducing training time by
58.4%-88.7% as compared to traditional HE methods.

TL;DR: This paper explores adversarial attacks on Text-to-Image (T2I) models to bypass safety mechanisms under black-box settings, proposing a new gradient-based prompt learning attack framework (PLA).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate and address the vulnerabilities of T2I models in generating Not-Safe-For-Work (NSFW) content under the constraints of black-box settings.

Method: The authors developed a novel gradient-based prompt learning attack framework (PLA) that utilizes multimodal similarities to facilitate adversarial training in black-box T2I models.

Result: The proposed PLA method successfully bypasses safety mechanisms such as prompt filters and post-hoc safety checkers in black-box T2I models, outperforming state-of-the-art methods with a high success rate.

Conclusion: T2I models are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, and the PLA framework demonstrates the effectiveness of gradient-based strategies even in black-box settings for compromising safety mechanisms.

Abstract: Text-to-Image (T2I) models have gained widespread adoption across various
applications. Despite the success, the potential misuse of T2I models poses
significant risks of generating Not-Safe-For-Work (NSFW) content. To
investigate the vulnerability of T2I models, this paper delves into adversarial
attacks to bypass the safety mechanisms under black-box settings. Most previous
methods rely on word substitution to search adversarial prompts. Due to limited
search space, this leads to suboptimal performance compared to gradient-based
training. However, black-box settings present unique challenges to training
gradient-driven attack methods, since there is no access to the internal
architecture and parameters of T2I models. To facilitate the learning of
adversarial prompts in black-box settings, we propose a novel prompt learning
attack framework (PLA), where insightful gradient-based training tailored to
black-box T2I models is designed by utilizing multimodal similarities.
Experiments show that our new method can effectively attack the safety
mechanisms of black-box T2I models including prompt filters and post-hoc safety
checkers with a high success rate compared to state-of-the-art methods.

*Naoki Awaya,Yuliang Xu,Li Ma*

Main category: stat.ME

TL;DR: The paper introduces additive tree models for estimating density ratios using a new balancing loss function, enabling enhancements in supervised training, optimization, and Bayesian inference methodologies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to accurately estimate density ratio functions to analyze differences between two probability distributions, with particular focus on uncertainty quantification and handling complex, high-dimensional distributions.

Method: The authors propose additive tree models combined with a unique balancing loss function, which facilitates training using tree boosting and Bayesian additive regression trees (BART), leveraging optimization and Bayesian inference techniques.

Result: The proposed models demonstrate high accuracy and unique capabilities in uncertainty quantification, especially for applications like assessing generative models for microbiome data.

Conclusion: The novel additive tree models and balancing loss function provide significant advancements in density ratio estimation with robust uncertainty quantification, proving versatile for high-dimensional and complex applications.

Abstract: The ratio of two densities characterizes their differences. We consider
learning the density ratio given i.i.d. observations from each of the two
distributions. We propose additive tree models for the density ratio along with
efficient algorithms for training these models using a new loss function called
the balancing loss. With this loss, additive tree models for the density ratio
can be trained using algorithms original designed for supervised learning.
Specifically, they can be trained from both an optimization perspective that
parallels tree boosting and from a (generalized) Bayesian perspective that
parallels Bayesian additive regression trees (BART). For the former, we present
two boosting algorithms -- one based on forward-stagewise fitting and the other
based on gradient boosting, both of which produce a point estimate for the
density ratio function. For the latter, we show that due to the loss function's
resemblance to an exponential family kernel, the new loss can serve as a
pseudo-likelihood for which conjugate priors exist, thereby enabling effective
generalized Bayesian inference on the density ratio using backfitting samplers
designed for BART. The resulting uncertainty quantification on the inferred
density ratio is critical for applications involving high-dimensional and
complex distributions in which uncertainty given limited data can often be
substantial. We provide insights on the balancing loss through its close
connection to the exponential loss in binary classification and to the
variational form of f-divergence, in particular that of the squared Hellinger
distance. Our numerical experiments demonstrate the accuracy of the proposed
approach while providing unique capabilities in uncertainty quantification. We
demonstrate the application of our method in a case study involving assessing
the quality of generative models for microbiome compositional data.

Main category: stat.ME

TL;DR: This paper introduces a Generative Flexible Latent Structure Regression (GFLSR) model that enables inference and analysis for linear continuous latent structure methods, while generalizing existing approaches like Partial Least Squares (PLS), termed Generative-PLS.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing linear continuous latent structure methods lack model inference, a generative perspective, and identifiable parameters, limiting their use as algorithms rather than comprehensive models.

Method: The paper proposes a novel generative model structure (GFLSR) that unifies various latent variable methods under a recursive framework, allowing both parameter convergence analysis and residual inspection. It also introduces a specialized model (Generative-PLS) and a bootstrap algorithm for uncertainty estimation.

Result: Simulation studies and a real-world application confirm the validity and practicality of the Generative-PLS approach within the GFLSR framework.

Conclusion: The GFLSR structure not only provides a foundation for inference and uncertainty estimation but also generalizes existing methods, offering a new perspective for all linear continuous latent variable methods.

Abstract: Latent structure methods, specifically linear continuous latent structure
methods, are a type of fundamental statistical learning strategy. They are
widely used for dimension reduction, regression and prediction, in the fields
of chemometrics, economics, social science and etc. However, due to the lack of
model inference, generative form, and unidentifiable parameters, most of these
methods are always used as an algorithm, instead of a model. This paper
proposed a Generative Flexible Latent Structure Regression (GFLSR) model
structure to address this problem. Moreover, we show that most linear
continuous latent variable methods can be represented under the proposed
framework. The recursive structure allows potential model inference and
residual analysis. Then, the traditional Partial Least Squares (PLS) is
focused; we show that the PLS can be specialised in the proposed model
structure, named Generative-PLS. With a model structure, we analyse the
convergence of the parameters and the latent variables. Under additional
distribution assumptions, we show that the proposed model structure can lead to
model inference without solving the probabilistic model. Additionally, we
proposed a novel bootstrap algorithm that enables uncertainty on parameters and
on prediction for new datasets. A simulation study and a Real-world dataset are
used to verify the proposed Generative-PLS model structure. Although the
traditional PLS is a special case, this proposed GFLSRM structure leads to a
potential inference structure for all the linear continuous latent variable
methods.

Conclusion: This approach enhances precision and computational efficiency in diverse data science tasks, showcasing the versatility of sparse matrix operations on generalized algebraic structures.

Abstract: Multiplication of a sparse matrix with another (dense or sparse) matrix is a
fundamental operation that captures the computational patterns of many data

  In many application scenarios, the matrix multiplication takes places on an
arbitrary algebraic semiring where the scalar operations are overloaded with
user-defined functions with certain properties or a more general heterogenous
algebra where even the domains of the input matrices can be different. Here, we
provide a unifying treatment of the sparse matrix-matrix operation and its rich

TL;DR: The paper discusses zero-trust architecture (ZTA) as a solution to security vulnerabilities in distributed systems, emphasizing the importance of policy design and verification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the increasing vulnerability of traditional security architectures to distributed attacks and their limitations in handling distributed networks involving agentic AI and IoT.

Method: The authors explore challenges of designing ZTA policies for distributed networks, propose solutions, use UPPAAL for formal policy verification, and analyze aspects like accountability and responsibility in system security.

Result: The paper identifies key issues in ZTA policy design, demonstrates the applicability of formal verification using UPPAAL, and highlights accountability for enhancing security in distributed networks.

Conclusion: Zero-trust distributed networks (ZTDN) can mitigate security risks, but success heavily depends on robust policy design, verification processes, and integrating accountability measures.

Abstract: Traditional security architectures are becoming more vulnerable to
distributed attacks due to significant dependence on trust. This will further
escalate when implementing agentic AI within the systems, as more components
must be secured over a similar distributed space. These scenarios can be
observed in consumer technologies, such as the dense Internet of things (IoT).
Here, zero-trust architecture (ZTA) can be seen as a potential solution, which
relies on a key principle of not giving users explicit trust, instead always
verifying their privileges whenever a request is made. However, the overall
security in ZTA is managed through its policies, and unverified policies can
lead to unauthorized access. Thus, this paper explores challenges and solutions
for ZTA policy design in the context of distributed networks, which is referred
to as zero-trust distributed networks (ZTDN). This is followed by a case-study
on formal verification of policies using UPPAAL. Subsequently, the importance
of accountability and responsibility in the system's security is discussed.
