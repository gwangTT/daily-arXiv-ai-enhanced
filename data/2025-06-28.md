Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper emphasizes the importance of AI safety and outlines a framework categorizing research areas into Development, Assessment, and Control.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI advancements are sparking debates on safety concerns, making it critical to build a trusted ecosystem for innovation and public confidence.

Method: Insights are built around discussions at the 2025 Singapore Conference on AI, synthesizing themes into a defense-in-depth framework for AI safety research.

Result: The paper leverages findings from the conference to consolidate AI safety research into three domains: Development, Assessment, and Control.

Conclusion: A structured framework is established to address AI safety challenges comprehensively, ensuring advancements while mitigating risks.

Abstract: Rapidly improving AI capabilities and autonomy hold significant promise of
transformation, but are also driving vigorous debate on how to ensure that AI
is safe, i.e., trustworthy, reliable, and secure. Building a trusted ecosystem
is therefore essential -- it helps people embrace AI with confidence and gives
maximal space for innovation while avoiding backlash.
  The "2025 Singapore Conference on AI (SCAI): International Scientific
Exchange on AI Safety" aimed to support research in this space by bringing
together AI scientists across geographies to identify and synthesise research
priorities in AI safety. This resulting report builds on the International AI
Safety Report chaired by Yoshua Bengio and backed by 33 governments. By
adopting a defence-in-depth model, this report organises AI safety research
domains into three types: challenges with creating trustworthy AI systems
(Development), challenges with evaluating their risks (Assessment), and
challenges with monitoring and intervening after deployment (Control).

### [2] [MAGPIE: A dataset for Multi-AGent contextual PrIvacy Evaluation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20737)
*Gurusha Juneja,Alon Albalak,Wenyue Hua,William Yang Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper investigates whether LLM-based agents can understand and preserve contextual privacy during collaboration. It finds that current models like GPT-4 and Claude struggle significantly with understanding and protecting privacy in high-stakes, multi-turn scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The widespread deployment of LLM-based agents in tasks requiring collaboration raises the need for ensuring privacy, especially when agents operate in domains involving proprietary tools and sensitive data.

Method: The authors propose a benchmark called MAGPIE, comprising 158 real-life scenarios across 15 domains, to test contextual privacy understanding in collaborative tasks. They evaluate state-of-the-art LLMs on their privacy preservation capabilities in both single- and multi-turn conversations.

Result: The study finds that current models misclassify private data as shareable in 25.2% to 43.6% of cases. They disclose private information in 59.9% to 50.5% of scenarios despite explicit privacy instructions. Furthermore, multi-agent systems fail to complete tasks in 71% of scenarios.

Conclusion: Current state-of-the-art LLMs lack sufficient alignment for contextual privacy preservation and collaborative task-solving, emphasizing the need for advancements in privacy-sensitive AI development.

Abstract: The proliferation of LLM-based agents has led to increasing deployment of
inter-agent collaboration for tasks like scheduling, negotiation, resource
allocation etc. In such systems, privacy is critical, as agents often access
proprietary tools and domain-specific databases requiring strict
confidentiality. This paper examines whether LLM-based agents demonstrate an
understanding of contextual privacy. And, if instructed, do these systems
preserve inference time user privacy in non-adversarial multi-turn
conversation. Existing benchmarks to evaluate contextual privacy in LLM-agents
primarily assess single-turn, low-complexity tasks where private information
can be easily excluded. We first present a benchmark - MAGPIE comprising 158
real-life high-stakes scenarios across 15 domains. These scenarios are designed
such that complete exclusion of private data impedes task completion yet
unrestricted information sharing could lead to substantial losses. We then
evaluate the current state-of-the-art LLMs on (a) their understanding of
contextually private data and (b) their ability to collaborate without
violating user privacy. Empirical experiments demonstrate that current models,
including GPT-4o and Claude-2.7-Sonnet, lack robust understanding of contextual
privacy, misclassifying private data as shareable 25.2\% and 43.6\% of the
time. In multi-turn conversations, these models disclose private information in
59.9\% and 50.5\% of cases even under explicit privacy instructions.
Furthermore, multi-agent systems fail to complete tasks in 71\% of scenarios.
These results underscore that current models are not aligned towards both
contextual privacy preservation and collaborative task-solving.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM-powered applications are sensitive to user prompts, and crafting effective prompts, especially in niche domains, is challenging.

Method: The solution integrates contextual query analysis, knowledge grounding, hierarchical skill organization, adaptive skill ranking, and prompt synthesis using templates bolstered by few-shot learning.

Result: Experiments on real-world datasets show the system delivers highly relevant and actionable prompt suggestions, validated by automated and expert assessments.

Conclusion: The proposed system effectively enhances the quality of domain-specific prompts, proving both practical and reliable.

Abstract: LLM-powered applications are highly susceptible to the quality of user
prompts, and crafting high-quality prompts can often be challenging especially
for domain-specific applications. This paper presents a novel dynamic
context-aware prompt recommendation system for domain-specific AI applications.
Our solution combines contextual query analysis, retrieval-augmented knowledge
grounding, hierarchical skill organization, and adaptive skill ranking to
generate relevant and actionable prompt suggestions.
  The system leverages behavioral telemetry and a two-stage hierarchical
reasoning process to dynamically select and rank relevant skills, and
synthesizes prompts using both predefined and adaptive templates enhanced with
few-shot learning. Experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that our
approach achieves high usefulness and relevance, as validated by both automated
and expert evaluations.

### [4] [Beyond Reactive Safety: Risk-Aware LLM Alignment via Long-Horizon Simulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20949)
*Chenkai Sun,Denghui Zhang,ChengXiang Zhai,Heng Ji*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes a framework to predict and evaluate the societal implications of language model recommendations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study addresses the need to understand the long-term impacts of AI-generated suggestions in high-stakes areas like public policy and healthcare.

Method: A proof-of-concept framework is created to project societal impacts of language model advice over time, along with a dataset of 100 indirect harm scenarios to test awareness of non-obvious adverse outcomes.

Result: The approach shows over 20% improvement on the custom dataset and achieves a 70% average win rate against strong baselines in existing safety benchmarks.

Conclusion: The framework presents a promising direction for developing safer language model-based agents in societal systems.

Abstract: Given the growing influence of language model-based agents on high-stakes
societal decisions, from public policy to healthcare, ensuring their beneficial
impact requires understanding the far-reaching implications of their
suggestions. We propose a proof-of-concept framework that projects how
model-generated advice could propagate through societal systems on a
macroscopic scale over time, enabling more robust alignment. To assess the
long-term safety awareness of language models, we also introduce a dataset of
100 indirect harm scenarios, testing models' ability to foresee adverse,
non-obvious outcomes from seemingly harmless user prompts. Our approach
achieves not only over 20% improvement on the new dataset but also an average
win rate exceeding 70% against strong baselines on existing safety benchmarks
(AdvBench, SafeRLHF, WildGuardMix), suggesting a promising direction for safer
agents.

### [5] [Unveiling Causal Reasoning in Large Language Models: Reality or Mirage?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21215)
*Haoang Chi,He Li,Wenjing Yang,Feng Liu,Long Lan,Xiaoguang Ren,Tongliang Liu,Bo Han*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Current LLMs exhibit only surface-level causal reasoning (level-1) due to embedded causal knowledge but lack human-like (level-2) reasoning. A new benchmark, CausalProbe-2024, highlights their limitations. The proposed G^2-Reasoner improves their abilities by integrating general knowledge and goal-oriented prompts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to understand and advance the causal reasoning capabilities of LLMs, addressing their limitations in performing genuine, human-like causal reasoning.

Method: The study introduces CausalProbe-2024 to evaluate LLMs and develops G^2-Reasoner, a method that uses general knowledge and goal-oriented prompts to enhance reasoning capabilities.

Result: CausalProbe-2024 reveals LLMs struggle with level-2 causal reasoning. G^2-Reasoner helps them perform significantly better, especially in novel and counterfactual scenarios.

Conclusion: LLMs currently lack genuine causal reasoning but can be improved with strategies like G^2-Reasoner to move towards level-2 reasoning.

Abstract: Causal reasoning capability is critical in advancing large language models
(LLMs) toward strong artificial intelligence. While versatile LLMs appear to
have demonstrated capabilities in understanding contextual causality and
providing responses that obey the laws of causality, it remains unclear whether
they perform genuine causal reasoning akin to humans. However, current evidence
indicates the contrary. Specifically, LLMs are only capable of performing
shallow (level-1) causal reasoning, primarily attributed to the causal
knowledge embedded in their parameters, but they lack the capacity for genuine
human-like (level-2) causal reasoning. To support this hypothesis,
methodologically, we delve into the autoregression mechanism of
transformer-based LLMs, revealing that it is not inherently causal.
Empirically, we introduce a new causal Q&A benchmark called CausalProbe-2024,
whose corpora are fresh and nearly unseen for the studied LLMs. The LLMs
exhibit a significant performance drop on CausalProbe-2024 compared to earlier
benchmarks, indicating the fact that they primarily engage in level-1 causal
reasoning. To bridge the gap towards level-2 causal reasoning, we draw
inspiration from the fact that human reasoning is usually facilitated by
general knowledge and intended goals. We propose G^2-Reasoner, a method that
incorporates general knowledge and goal-oriented prompts into LLMs' causal
reasoning processes. Experiments demonstrate that G^2-Reasoner significantly
enhances LLMs' causal reasoning capability, particularly in fresh and
counterfactual contexts. This work sheds light on a new path for LLMs to
advance towards genuine causal reasoning, going beyond level-1 and making
strides towards level-2.

### [6] [World-aware Planning Narratives Enhance Large Vision-Language Model Planner](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21230)
*Junhao Shi,Zhaoye Fei,Siyin Wang,Qipeng Guo,Jingjing Gong,Xipeng QIu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces a framework called World-Aware Planning Narrative Enhancement (WAP) to improve Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) for embodied planning tasks, achieving significant gains on complex benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome challenges LVLMs face in unfamiliar environments and long-horizon planning, relying on disconnected instruction contexts.

Method: The WAP framework enhances LVLMs with four cognitive capabilities: visual modeling, spatial reasoning, functional abstraction, and syntactic grounding. It employs curriculum learning based on raw visual observations.

Result: Experiments show significant improvements on the EB-ALFRED benchmark, with Qwen2.5-VL improving task success rates by 60.7 points, surpassing proprietary models like GPT-4o.

Conclusion: Integrating environmental context into LVLM planning enhances commonsense reasoning and long-term task execution, outperforming proprietary alternatives.

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) show promise for embodied planning tasks
but struggle with complex scenarios involving unfamiliar environments and
multi-step goals. Current approaches rely on environment-agnostic imitation
learning that disconnects instructions from environmental contexts, causing
models to struggle with context-sensitive instructions and rely on
supplementary cues rather than visual reasoning during long-horizon
interactions. In this work, we propose World-Aware Planning Narrative
Enhancement (WAP), a framework that infuses LVLMs with comprehensive
environmental understanding through four cognitive capabilities (visual
appearance modeling, spatial reasoning, functional abstraction, and syntactic
grounding) while developing and evaluating models using only raw visual
observations through curriculum learning. Evaluations on the EB-ALFRED
benchmark demonstrate substantial improvements, with Qwen2.5-VL achieving a
60.7 absolute improvement in task success rates, particularly in commonsense
reasoning (+60.0) and long-horizon planning (+70.0). Notably, our enhanced
open-source models outperform proprietary systems like GPT-4o and
Claude-3.5-Sonnet by a large margin.

### [7] [IXAII: An Interactive Explainable Artificial Intelligence Interface for Decision Support Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21310)
*Pauline Speckmann,Mario Nadj,Christian Janiesch*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces IXAII, an interactive explainable AI system offering explanations using LIME, SHAP, Anchors, and DiCE for diverse user groups with customizable options. It was evaluated positively by both experts and lay users.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Many existing explainable AI methods are static and do not account for user perspectives, limiting their effectiveness in real-world scenarios.

Method: Developed IXAII, an interactive system combining four state-of-the-art explainable AI methods. Tailored views were created for five distinct user groups, with customizable contents and formats. Evaluation was conducted through interviews with both experts and lay users.

Result: The feedback demonstrated that IXAII, with its interactivity and multiple visualization options, was found helpful in increasing transparency and usability of AI explanations.

Conclusion: By integrating explainability techniques with user interactivity and practical usability, the paper highlights a novel approach to enhance human-AI interaction and transparency in AI systems.

Abstract: Although several post-hoc methods for explainable AI have been developed,
most are static and neglect the user perspective, limiting their effectiveness
for the target audience. In response, we developed the interactive explainable
intelligent system called IXAII that offers explanations from four explainable
AI methods: LIME, SHAP, Anchors, and DiCE. Our prototype provides tailored
views for five user groups and gives users agency over the explanations'
content and their format. We evaluated IXAII through interviews with experts
and lay users. Our results indicate that IXAII, which provides different
explanations with multiple visualization options, is perceived as helpful to
increase transparency. By bridging the gaps between explainable AI methods,
interactivity, and practical implementation, we provide a novel perspective on
AI explanation practices and human-AI interaction.

### [8] [Active Inference AI Systems for Scientific Discovery](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21329)
*Karthik Duraisamy*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper discusses the limitations of current AI systems in scientific discovery and proposes an active inference framework to bridge gaps in abstraction, reasoning, and reality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Despite advancements in AI, its application to transformative scientific discovery remains constrained by weaknesses in reasoning, experimental grounding, and architectural inefficiencies.

Method: The paper proposes building AI systems with causal self-supervised foundation models, neuro-symbolic planners, persistent knowledge graphs, and closed-loop interaction with simulators and labs, complemented by human judgment.

Result: AI architectures combining simulation, causal reasoning, continuous calibration, and human intervention can yield systems capable of generating hypotheses grounded both conceptually and empirically.

Conclusion: Reducing gaps between abstraction, reasoning, and reality in AI systems, while integrating human judgment, is crucial for their success in driving scientific discovery.

Abstract: The rapid evolution of artificial intelligence has led to expectations of
transformative scientific discovery, yet current systems remain fundamentally
limited by their operational architectures, brittle reasoning mechanisms, and
their separation from experimental reality. Building on earlier work, we
contend that progress in AI-driven science now depends on closing three
fundamental gaps -- the abstraction gap, the reasoning gap, and the reality gap
-- rather than on model size/data/test time compute. Scientific reasoning
demands internal representations that support simulation of actions and
response, causal structures that distinguish correlation from mechanism, and
continuous calibration. We define active inference AI systems for scientific
discovery as those that (i) maintain long-lived research memories grounded in
causal self-supervised foundation models, (ii) symbolic or neuro-symbolic
planners equipped with Bayesian guardrails, (iii) grow persistent knowledge
graphs where thinking generates novel conceptual nodes, reasoning establishes
causal edges, and real-world interaction prunes false connections while
strengthening verified pathways, and (iv) refine their internal representations
through closed-loop interaction with both high-fidelity simulators and
automated laboratories - an operational loop where mental simulation guides
action and empirical surprise reshapes understanding. In essence, we outline an
architecture where discovery arises from the interplay between internal models
that enable counterfactual reasoning and external validation that grounds
hypotheses in reality. It is also argued that the inherent ambiguity in
feedback from simulations and experiments, and underlying uncertainties makes
human judgment indispensable, not as a temporary scaffold but as a permanent
architectural component.

### [9] [TableMoE: Neuro-Symbolic Routing for Structured Expert Reasoning in Multimodal Table Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21393)
*Junwen Zhang,Pu Chen,Yin Zhang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: TableMoE tackles challenges in multimodal table understanding under degraded conditions using a neuro-symbolic Mixture-of-Experts architecture, with superior results compared to existing models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current multimodal large language models struggle with real-world complex table structures (WildStruct) due to issues like visual degradation, symbolic density, and structural complexity.

Method: The proposed TableMoE architecture employs Neuro-Symbolic Routing to classify and route table elements to specialized experts (e.g., Table-to-HTML). It uses a novel pretraining dataset of 1.2M aligned table datasets.

Result: TableMoE outperforms state-of-the-art models on new challenging WildStruct benchmarks designed to replicate real-world table complexities.

Conclusion: TableMoE demonstrates improved performance and robustness by incorporating neuro-symbolic reasoning for multimodal table understanding.

Abstract: Multimodal understanding of tables in real-world contexts is challenging due
to the complexity of structure, symbolic density, and visual degradation (blur,
skew, watermarking, incomplete structures or fonts, multi-span or
hierarchically nested layouts). Existing multimodal large language models
(MLLMs) struggle with such WildStruct conditions, resulting in limited
performance and poor generalization. To address these challenges, we propose
TableMoE, a neuro-symbolic Mixture-of-Connector-Experts (MoCE) architecture
specifically designed for robust, structured reasoning over multimodal table
data. TableMoE features an innovative Neuro-Symbolic Routing mechanism, which
predicts latent semantic token roles (e.g., header, data cell, axis, formula)
and dynamically routes table elements to specialized experts (Table-to-HTML,
Table-to-JSON, Table-to-Code) using a confidence-aware gating strategy informed
by symbolic reasoning graphs. To facilitate effective alignment-driven
pretraining, we introduce the large-scale TableMoE-Align dataset, consisting of
1.2M table-HTML-JSON-code quadruples across finance, science, biomedicine and
industry, utilized exclusively for model pretraining. For evaluation, we curate
and release four challenging WildStruct benchmarks: WMMFinQA, WMMTatQA,
WMMTabDialog, and WMMFinanceMath, designed specifically to stress-test models
under real-world multimodal degradation and structural complexity. Experimental
results demonstrate that TableMoE significantly surpasses existing
state-of-the-art models. Extensive ablation studies validate each core
component, emphasizing the critical role of Neuro-Symbolic Routing and
structured expert alignment. Through qualitative analyses, we further showcase
TableMoE's interpretability and enhanced robustness, underscoring the
effectiveness of integrating neuro-symbolic reasoning for multimodal table
understanding.

### [10] [Spatial Mental Modeling from Limited Views](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21458)
*Baiqiao Yin,Qineng Wang,Pingyue Zhang,Jianshu Zhang,Kangrui Wang,Zihan Wang,Jieyu Zhang,Keshigeyan Chandrasegaran,Han Liu,Ranjay Krishna,Saining Xie,Manling Li,Jiajun Wu,Li Fei-Fei*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces MindCube, a benchmark to evaluate Vision Language Models' (VLMs) ability to construct spatial mental models for understanding unseen spaces. Existing models perform poorly, but the proposed strategies significantly improve their accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The researchers aim to address the gap in VLMs' ability to form spatial mental models like humans, which is crucial for reasoning about unseen spaces, perspectives, and motion.

Method: The paper evaluates VLMs using the MindCube benchmark and implements three approaches: introducing intermediate unseen views, reasoning chains in natural language, and cognitive maps. The 'map-then-reason' approach was particularly effective, complemented by reinforcement learning.

Result: Using MindCube, VLMs improved accuracy from 37.8% to 60.8% with the 'map-then-reason' strategy. Adding reinforcement learning further boosted performance to 70.7%, showing substantial advancement.

Conclusion: Structured spatial mental models and reasoning processes allow VLMs to better understand unseen spaces, demonstrating that the scaffolding approach is key to achieving these improvements.

Abstract: Can Vision Language Models (VLMs) imagine the full scene from just a few
views, like humans do? Humans form spatial mental models, internal
representations of unseen space, to reason about layout, perspective, and
motion. Our new MindCube benchmark with 21,154 questions across 3,268 images
exposes this critical gap, where existing VLMs exhibit near-random performance.
Using MindCube, we systematically evaluate how well VLMs build robust spatial
mental models through representing positions (cognitive mapping), orientations
(perspective-taking), and dynamics (mental simulation for "what-if" movements).
We then explore three approaches to help VLMs approximate spatial mental
models, including unseen intermediate views, natural language reasoning chains,
and cognitive maps. The significant improvement comes from a synergistic
approach, "map-then-reason", that jointly trains the model to first generate a
cognitive map and then reason upon it. By training models to reason over these
internal maps, we boosted accuracy from 37.8% to 60.8% (+23.0%). Adding
reinforcement learning pushed performance even further to 70.7% (+32.9%). Our
key insight is that such scaffolding of spatial mental models, actively
constructing and utilizing internal structured spatial representations with
flexible reasoning processes, significantly improves understanding of
unobservable space.

*Tin Dizdarević,Ravi Hammond,Tobias Gessler,Anisoara Calinescu,Jonathan Cook,Matteo Gallici,Andrei Lupu,Jakob Nicolaus Foerster*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces AH2AC2, a framework for evaluating human-AI interaction in the cooperative card game Hanabi using human proxy agents instead of costly human tests.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The challenge of seamless human-AI collaboration, particularly in scenarios requiring theory of mind and coordinated action.

Method: Creation of human proxy agents based on a large-scale human gameplay dataset, limiting available data to 3,079 games, and supporting evaluations using a controlled system.

Result: Baseline results are established in two- and three-player Hanabi scenarios, facilitated by human proxy agents.

Conclusion: The framework enables reproducible and cost-effective evaluations for human-AI coordination, fostering the development of efficient methods. Open-source code and dataset are shared.

Abstract: Achieving seamless coordination between AI agents and humans is crucial for
real-world applications, yet it remains a significant open challenge. Hanabi is
a cooperative card game featuring imperfect information, constrained
communication, theory of mind requirements, and coordinated action -- making it
an ideal testbed for human-AI coordination. However, its use for human-AI
interaction has been limited by the challenges of human evaluation. In this
work, we introduce the Ad-Hoc Human-AI Coordination Challenge (AH2AC2) to
overcome the constraints of costly and difficult-to-reproduce human
evaluations. We develop \textit{human proxy agents} on a large-scale human
dataset that serve as robust, cheap, and reproducible human-like evaluation
partners in AH2AC2. To encourage the development of data-efficient methods, we
open-source a dataset of 3,079 games, deliberately limiting the amount of
available human gameplay data. We present baseline results for both two- and
three- player Hanabi scenarios. To ensure fair evaluation, we host the proxy
agents through a controlled evaluation system rather than releasing them
publicly. The code is available at

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper addresses shortcomings in evaluating agentic search systems, presenting a benchmark and framework to assess real-time web browsing. It evaluates leading systems and highlights promising results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Agentic search systems capable of real-time web synthesis challenge existing evaluation methods, necessitating tools and benchmarks for their assessment.

Method: The authors introduce Mind2Web 2, consisting of 130 high-quality tasks, and propose the Agent-as-a-Judge framework using tree-structured rubrics for automated evaluation of answers.

Result: Evaluation revealed OpenAI Deep Research performs at 50–70% of human capability with considerable time efficiency, alongside insights from error analysis.

Conclusion: Mind2Web 2 lays groundwork for improving agentic search systems and their evaluation, advancing efficiency and accuracy in autonomous web searching methods.

Abstract: Agentic search such as Deep Research systems, where large language models
autonomously browse the web, synthesize information, and return comprehensive
citation-backed answers, represents a major shift in how users interact with
web-scale information. While promising greater efficiency and cognitive
offloading, the growing complexity and open-endedness of agentic search have
outpaced existing evaluation benchmarks and methodologies, which largely assume
short search horizons and static answers. In this paper, we introduce Mind2Web
2, a benchmark of 130 realistic, high-quality, and long-horizon tasks that
require real-time web browsing and extensive information synthesis, constructed
with over 1,000 hours of human labor. To address the challenge of evaluating
time-varying and complex answers, we propose a novel Agent-as-a-Judge
framework. Our method constructs task-specific judge agents based on a
tree-structured rubric design to automatically assess both answer correctness
and source attribution. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation of nine frontier
agentic search systems and human performance, along with a detailed error
analysis to draw insights for future development. The best-performing system,
OpenAI Deep Research, can already achieve 50-70% of human performance while
spending half the time, showing a great potential. Altogether, Mind2Web 2
provides a rigorous foundation for developing and benchmarking the next
generation of agentic search systems.

TL;DR: This paper introduces PsyLite, a lightweight psychological counseling AI model with enhanced reasoning, counseling, and safety abilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address safety issues, scenario handling, and deployment challenges in AI-driven psychological counseling models.

Method: PsyLite was trained with a two-stage strategy (hybrid data fine-tuning and preference optimization) and deployed with customized workflows.

Result: PsyLite demonstrated significant improvements in professionalism (+47.6%) and safety (+2.4%) compared to baseline models, while supporting operation on low-resource hardware.

Conclusion: PsyLite effectively advances lightweight, safe, and professional AI psychological counseling applications, enabling deployment in resource-limited environments.

Abstract: With the rapid development of digital technology, AI-driven psychological
counseling has gradually become an important research direction in the field of
mental health. However, existing models still have deficiencies in dialogue
safety, detailed scenario handling, and lightweight deployment. To address
these issues, this study proposes PsyLite, a lightweight psychological
counseling large language model agent developed based on the base model
InternLM2.5-7B-chat. Through a two-stage training strategy (hybrid distillation
data fine-tuning and ORPO preference optimization), PsyLite enhances the
model's deep-reasoning ability, psychological counseling ability, and safe
dialogue ability. After deployment using Ollama and Open WebUI, a custom
workflow is created with Pipelines. An innovative conditional RAG is designed
to introduce crosstalk humor elements at appropriate times during psychological
counseling to enhance user experience and decline dangerous requests to
strengthen dialogue safety. Evaluations show that PsyLite outperforms the
baseline models in the Chinese general evaluation (CEval), psychological
counseling professional evaluation (CPsyCounE), and dialogue safety evaluation
(SafeDialBench), particularly in psychological counseling professionalism
(CPsyCounE score improvement of 47.6\%) and dialogue safety (\safe{} score
improvement of 2.4\%). Additionally, the model uses quantization technology
(GGUF q4\_k\_m) to achieve low hardware deployment (5GB memory is sufficient
for operation), providing a feasible solution for psychological counseling
applications in resource-constrained environments.

Main category: cs.AR

TL;DR: The paper proposes a secure, hybrid solution for FPGA security using remote attestation, post-quantum cryptography, and blockchain, achieving only 2% overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rise of 5G, increasing reliance on edge computing, vulnerabilities of FPGAs in unprotected environments, and threats from quantum computing demand robust security measures.

Method: A hybrid hardware-software approach is proposed combining remote attestation, post-quantum cryptography algorithms, and blockchain for storing security evidence.

Result: The secure FPGA configuration process introduces only 2% performance overhead compared to non-PQC methods across two FPGA families.

Conclusion: The proposed method enhances FPGA security by integrating post-quantum cryptography and blockchain, demonstrating its feasibility and low performance impact.

Abstract: The advent of 5G and beyond has brought increased performance networks,
facilitating the deployment of services closer to the user. To meet performance
requirements such services require specialized hardware, such as Field
Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs). However, FPGAs are often deployed in
unprotected environments, leaving the user's applications vulnerable to
multiple attacks. With the rise of quantum computing, which threatens the
integrity of widely-used cryptographic algorithms, the need for a robust
security infrastructure is even more crucial. In this paper we introduce a
hybrid hardware-software solution utilizing remote attestation to securely
configure FPGAs, while integrating Post-Quantum Cryptographic (PQC) algorithms
for enhanced security. Additionally, to enable trustworthiness across the whole
edge computing continuum, our solution integrates a blockchain infrastructure,
ensuring the secure storage of any security evidence. We evaluate the proposed
secure configuration process under different PQC algorithms in two FPGA
families, showcasing only 2% overheard compared to the non PQC approach.

### [15] [Accelerating GNN Training through Locality-aware Dropout and Merge](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21414)
*Gongjian Sun,Mingyu Yan,Dengke Han,Runzhen Xue,Duo Wang,Xiaochun Ye,Dongrui Fan*

Main category: cs.AR

TL;DR: LiGNN introduces hardware-based methods to enhance data locality in Graph Neural Network (GNN) training by employing locality-aware feature dropout and optimized DRAM access strategies, improving performance without sacrificing accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address inefficiencies in neighbor aggregation during graph learning due to irregular DRAM accesses degrading performance in GNNs.

Method: LiGNN uses a locality-aware feature dropout mechanism and DRAM-level memory access merging strategies specific to GNN operations to reduce irregular data accesses and enhance efficiency.

Result: The proposed method achieves a 1.48~3.02x speedup, reduces DRAM accesses by 34%~55%, and lowers DRAM row activations by 59%~82%, while retaining model accuracy under a 0.5 dropout rate.

Conclusion: LiGNN effectively tackles the hardware inefficiencies in training GNNs by significantly improving data locality and execution speed with minimal cost and no compromise on accuracy.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have demonstrated significant success in graph
learning and are widely adopted across various critical domains. However, the
irregular connectivity between vertices leads to inefficient neighbor
aggregation, resulting in substantial irregular and coarse-grained DRAM
accesses. This lack of data locality presents significant challenges for
execution platforms, ultimately degrading performance. While previous
accelerator designs have leveraged on-chip memory and data access scheduling
strategies to address this issue, they still inevitably access features at
irregular addresses from DRAM. In this work, we propose LiGNN, a hardware-based
solution that improves data locality by applying dropout and merge techniques
during neighbor aggregation to accelerate GNN training. Unlike conventional
algorithm-level dropout methods that primarily aim to improve accuracy while
overlooking hardware costs, LiGNN introduces a locality-aware feature dropout
mechanism. This approach selectively drops node features with data locality
awareness, effectively reducing irregular DRAM accesses without compromising
model accuracy. Moreover, by leveraging detailed knowledge of memory layout and
organization-including critical alignment constraints-LiGNN strategically
merges memory accesses during neighbor aggregation at the DRAM row level,
guided by GNN-level semantics. This optimization significantly improves data
locality with minimal additional cost. Under the commonly adopted 0.5 dropout
rate, LiGNN outperforms state-of-the-art methods, delivering a 1.48~3.02x
speedup, reducing DRAM accesses by 34%~55%, and lowering DRAM row activations
by 59%~82%, all while maintaining model accuracy.

*Maryam Ghane,Amir M. Hajisadeghi,Hamid R. Zarandi*

Main category: cs.AR

TL;DR: OptGM, a gate merging technique, mitigates NBTI effects in digital circuits by restructuring critical nodes, showcasing significant improvements in circuit reliability and performance in benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address and reduce the negative bias temperature instability (NBTI) effects in digital circuits, which degrade reliability and performance over time.

Method: The OptGM method identifies NBTI-critical nodes with high signal probabilities. It merges the sensitizer and sensitive gates into a complex gate to eliminate critical nodes while preserving original logic.

Result: Simulation results indicate OptGM reduced NBTI-critical transistors by 89.29%, NBTI-induced delay by 23.87%, and total transistor count by 6.47%, with an average performance per cost improvement of 12.8%.

Conclusion: OptGM is effective in mitigating NBTI effects, enhancing circuit reliability and performance with minimal resource overhead, making it viable for practical circuit design.

Abstract: This paper presents OptGM, an optimized gate merging method designed to
mitigate negative bias temperature instability (NBTI) in digital circuits.
First, the proposed approach effectively identifies NBTI-critical internal
nodes, defined as those with a signal probability exceeding a predefined
threshold. Next, based on the proposed optimized algorithm, the sensitizer gate
(which drives the critical node) and the sensitive gate (which is fed by it)
are merged into a new complex gate. This complex gate preserves the original
logic while eliminating NBTI-critical nodes. Finally, to evaluate the
effectiveness of OptGM, we assess it on several combinational and sequential
benchmark circuits. Simulation results demonstrate that, on average, the number
of NBTI-critical transistors (i.e., PMOS transistors connected to critical
nodes), NBTI-induced delay degradation, and the total transistor count are
reduced by 89.29%, 23.87%, and 6.47%, respectively. Furthermore, OptGM enhances
performance per cost (PPC) by 12.8% on average, with minimal area overhead.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper addresses the limitations of current tabular QA systems in handling probabilistic questions by introducing a new benchmark (LUCARIO) and a hybrid framework for probabilistic reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current NL2SQL systems excel in answering direct factual questions but struggle with probabilistic questions requiring reasoning under uncertainty.

Method: The paper proposes inducing Bayesian Networks from tables, translating natural language queries into probabilistic ones, and employing large language models (LLMs) for answer generation.

Result: Empirical results show the proposed method outperforms baselines, showcasing significant improvements in probabilistic QA.

Conclusion: The hybrid symbolic-neural reasoning approach effectively tackles probabilistic questions, advancing the capabilities of tabular QA systems.

Abstract: Current approaches for question answering (QA) over tabular data, such as
NL2SQL systems, perform well for factual questions where answers are directly
retrieved from tables. However, they fall short on probabilistic questions
requiring reasoning under uncertainty. In this paper, we introduce a new
benchmark LUCARIO and a framework for probabilistic QA over large tabular data.
Our method induces Bayesian Networks from tables, translates natural language
queries into probabilistic queries, and uses large language models (LLMs) to
generate final answers. Empirical results demonstrate significant improvements
over baselines, highlighting the benefits of hybrid symbolic-neural reasoning.

### [18] [Multi-lingual Functional Evaluation for Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20793)
*Victor Ojewale,Inioluwa Deborah Raji,Suresh Venkatasubramanian*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces multi-lingual functional benchmarks to better evaluate the performance and robustness of large language models across different languages, revealing discrepancies in performance between static benchmarks and functional ones.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the inadequacy of static benchmarks (e.g., Belebele, M-MMLU) in measuring the practical and robust performance of large language models in multi-lingual contexts.

Method: The researchers created new benchmarks (CL-GSM Symbolic and CL-IFEval) by translating functional benchmark templates from English into five languages: French, Spanish, Hindi, Arabic, and Yoruba, representing different levels of NLP resource availability.

Result: Results indicate static benchmarks vary in capturing functional performance, with notable performance drops observed when comparing M-GSM to CL-GSM Symbolic and Belebele to CL-IFEval. The study also highlights significant variability in language-specific robustness, with Arabic and English performing more consistently.

Conclusion: Existing multi-lingual evaluation methods are insufficient for assessing functional performance and robustness. The proposed benchmarks better capture these factors and reveal significant language-specific performance disparities in current models.

Abstract: Multi-lingual competence in large language models is often evaluated via
static data benchmarks such as Belebele, M-MMLU and M-GSM. However, these
evaluations often fail to provide an adequate understanding of the practical
performance and robustness of models across multi-lingual settings. In
response, we create multi-lingual functional benchmarks -- Cross-Lingual Grade
School Math Symbolic (CL-GSM Symbolic) and Cross-Lingual Instruction-Following
Eval (CL-IFEval)-- by translating existing functional benchmark templates from
English to five additional languages that span the range of resources available
for NLP: French, Spanish, Hindi, Arabic and Yoruba. Our results reveal that
some static multi-lingual benchmarks capture functional performance much more
closely than others (i.e. across models, there is a 24%, 17% and 18% decrease
in performance between M-GSM and CL-GSM Symbolic in English, French and Spanish
respectively; similarly there's a 15 - 24% performance drop across languages
between Belebele and CL-IFEval, and only a 0.5% to 3% performance drop between
M-MMLU and CL-IFEval). Similarly, we find that model robustness across
languages varies significantly, with certain languages (eg. Arabic, English)
being the most consistently well performing across evaluation iterations.

### [19] [The Ideation-Execution Gap: Execution Outcomes of LLM-Generated versus Human Research Ideas](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20803)
*Chenglei Si,Tatsunori Hashimoto,Diyi Yang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper investigates whether AI-generated research ideas lead to better outcomes after execution and finds that human-generated ideas outperform AI's when executed.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to understand if AI-generated research ideas, which have been considered novel, translate into superior scientific outcomes once executed.

Method: 43 expert researchers were recruited to execute research ideas, either AI-generated or human-written, spending over 100 hours on each. Results were judged blindly by NLP reviewers, comparing idea scores pre- and post-execution.

Result: LLM-generated ideas saw more significant score reductions after execution compared to human-written ones. In many metrics, executed human ideas even outperformed LLM-generations.

Conclusion: Current LLMs face challenges in producing practically effective research ideas, revealing a gap between ideation and successful execution.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise in accelerating the
scientific research pipeline. A key capability for this process is the ability
to generate novel research ideas, and prior studies have found settings in
which LLM-generated research ideas were judged as more novel than human-expert
ideas. However, a good idea should not simply appear to be novel, it should
also result in better research after being executed. To test whether
AI-generated ideas lead to better research outcomes, we conduct an execution
study by recruiting 43 expert researchers to execute randomly-assigned ideas,
either written by experts or generated by an LLM. Each expert spent over 100
hours implementing the idea and wrote a 4-page short paper to document the
experiments. All the executed projects are then reviewed blindly by expert NLP
researchers. Comparing the review scores of the same ideas before and after
execution, the scores of the LLM-generated ideas decrease significantly more
than expert-written ideas on all evaluation metrics (novelty, excitement,
effectiveness, and overall; p < 0.05), closing the gap between LLM and human
ideas observed at the ideation stage. When comparing the aggregated review
scores from the execution study, we even observe that for many metrics there is
a flip in rankings where human ideas score higher than LLM ideas. This
ideation-execution gap highlights the limitations of current LLMs in generating
truly effective research ideas and the challenge of evaluating research ideas
in the absence of execution outcomes.

*Chinmay Gondhalekar,Urjitkumar Patel,Fang-Chun Yeh*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces MultiFinRAG, a retrieval-augmented generation framework tailored for financial question answering across text, tables, and images, achieving significant accuracy improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing solutions for answering questions in financial documents struggle due to token limitations, layout loss, and fragmented cross-modal reasoning.

Method: MultiFinRAG groups multimodal content into batches, processes them with a quantized multimodal LLM, embeds outputs with modality-aware similarity thresholds, and uses dynamic tiered fallback strategies to handle diverse contexts effectively.

Result: The proposed framework achieved a 19% higher accuracy than ChatGPT-4o on financial QA tasks requiring multimodal reasoning, despite utilizing commodity hardware.

Conclusion: MultiFinRAG advances financial QA by enabling efficient and accurate cross-modal reasoning using lightweight resources, outperforming similar models significantly.

Abstract: Financial documents--such as 10-Ks, 10-Qs, and investor presentations--span
hundreds of pages and combine diverse modalities, including dense narrative
text, structured tables, and complex figures. Answering questions over such
content often requires joint reasoning across modalities, which strains
traditional large language models (LLMs) and retrieval-augmented generation
(RAG) pipelines due to token limitations, layout loss, and fragmented
cross-modal context. We introduce MultiFinRAG, a retrieval-augmented generation
framework purpose-built for financial QA. MultiFinRAG first performs multimodal
extraction by grouping table and figure images into batches and sending them to
a lightweight, quantized open-source multimodal LLM, which produces both
structured JSON outputs and concise textual summaries. These outputs, along
with narrative text, are embedded and indexed with modality-aware similarity
thresholds for precise retrieval. A tiered fallback strategy then dynamically
escalates from text-only to text+table+image contexts when necessary, enabling
cross-modal reasoning while reducing irrelevant context. Despite running on
commodity hardware, MultiFinRAG achieves 19 percentage points higher accuracy
than ChatGPT-4o (free-tier) on complex financial QA tasks involving text,
tables, images, and combined multimodal reasoning.

### [21] [Uncovering Hidden Violent Tendencies in LLMs: A Demographic Analysis via Behavioral Vignettes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20822)
*Quintin Myers,Yanjun Gao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper investigates large language models' (LLMs) ability to handle morally ambiguous real-world scenarios by evaluating them using a validated social science instrument. It reveals divergence between LLMs' generated text and their underlying preferences for violence, as well as demographic biases.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address the underexplored capacity of LLMs to reason in morally ambiguous, real-world scenarios, focusing on their role in detecting and responding to online violent content.

Method: The authors use the Violent Behavior Vignette Questionnaire (VBVQ) and introduce persona-based prompts varying race, age, and geographic identity in a zero-shot evaluation of six LLMs developed in different geopolitical and organizational contexts.

Result: The analysis finds that LLMs exhibit divergence between generated text and internal violent response preferences, and that their violent tendencies vary across demographics, often contradicting established research in criminology and psychology.

Conclusion: LLMs demonstrate biases and inconsistencies in reasoning about morally ambiguous scenarios, underscoring the need for more nuanced and robust development approaches to ensure fair and accurate applications in sensitive contexts.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly proposed for detecting and
responding to violent content online, yet their ability to reason about morally
ambiguous, real-world scenarios remains underexamined. We present the first
study to evaluate LLMs using a validated social science instrument designed to
measure human response to everyday conflict, namely the Violent Behavior
Vignette Questionnaire (VBVQ). To assess potential bias, we introduce
persona-based prompting that varies race, age, and geographic identity within
the United States. Six LLMs developed across different geopolitical and
organizational contexts are evaluated under a unified zero-shot setting. Our
study reveals two key findings: (1) LLMs surface-level text generation often
diverges from their internal preference for violent responses; (2) their
violent tendencies vary across demographics, frequently contradicting
established findings in criminology, social science, and psychology.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores challenges in applying end-to-end fact-checking to medical claims and advocates approaching it as an interactive communication problem.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address medical communication issues by developing systems for fact-checking medical claims, especially given the complexity of evidence-based medicine and its impact on public health.

Method: The authors conducted a study to analyze how clinical experts validate real-world medical claims from social media using synthesized medical evidence.

Result: The study revealed challenges in connecting claims to evidence, interpreting ambiguous and underspecified claims, and handling subjective veracity labels.

Conclusion: The paper argues that medical fact-checking should focus on interactive communication rather than simply aiming for an end-to-end automated process.

Abstract: Technological progress has led to concrete advancements in tasks that were
regarded as challenging, such as automatic fact-checking. Interest in adopting
these systems for public health and medicine has grown due to the high-stakes
nature of medical decisions and challenges in critically appraising a vast and
diverse medical literature. Evidence-based medicine connects to every
individual, and yet the nature of it is highly technical, rendering the medical
literacy of majority users inadequate to sufficiently navigate the domain. Such
problems with medical communication ripens the ground for end-to-end
fact-checking agents: check a claim against current medical literature and
return with an evidence-backed verdict. And yet, such systems remain largely
unused. To understand this, we present the first study examining how clinical
experts verify real claims from social media by synthesizing medical evidence.
In searching for this upper-bound, we reveal fundamental challenges in
end-to-end fact-checking when applied to medicine: Difficulties connecting
claims in the wild to scientific evidence in the form of clinical trials;
ambiguities in underspecified claims mixed with mismatched intentions; and
inherently subjective veracity labels. We argue that fact-checking should be
approached and evaluated as an interactive communication problem, rather than
an end-to-end process.

*Zhengyan Shi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces methods to efficiently adapt language models (LMs) to downstream tasks by leveraging unlabelled data, parameter-efficient fine-tuning, improved supervised strategies, and novel evaluation techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Adapting large and complex language models to specific tasks is challenging, often leading to inefficiencies, overfitting, and high computational costs, which limit their application in real-world tasks.

Method: The paper proposes new strategies for extracting task-relevant knowledge from unlabelled data, a parameter-efficient fine-tuning method, improved supervised fine-tuning approaches, and novel evaluation benchmarks.

Result: Extensive empirical studies demonstrate enhanced robustness, efficiency, and generalization of language models across diverse NLP tasks.

Conclusion: The proposed methods significantly improve the adaptability of LMs, advancing the field toward robust and efficient artificial general intelligence.

Abstract: Language models (LMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in NLP, yet
adapting them efficiently and robustly to specific tasks remains challenging.
As their scale and complexity grow, fine-tuning LMs on labelled data often
underutilizes available unlabelled data, leads to overfitting on small
task-specific sets, and imposes significant computational costs. These
limitations hamper their application to the open-ended landscape of real-world
language tasks.
  This thesis proposes a series of methods to better adapt LMs to downstream
applications. First, we explore strategies for extracting task-relevant
knowledge from unlabelled data, introducing a novel continued pre-training
technique that outperforms state-of-the-art semi-supervised approaches. Next,
we present a parameter-efficient fine-tuning method that substantially reduces
memory and compute costs while maintaining competitive performance. We also
introduce improved supervised fine-tuning methods that enable LMs to better
follow instructions, especially when labelled data is scarce, enhancing their
performance across a range of NLP tasks, including open-ended generation.
Finally, we develop new evaluation methods and benchmarks, such as multi-hop
spatial reasoning tasks, to assess LM capabilities and adaptation more
comprehensively.
  Through extensive empirical studies across diverse NLP tasks, our results
demonstrate that these approaches substantially improve LM robustness,
efficiency, and generalization, making them more adaptable to a broad range of
applications. These advances mark a significant step towards more robust and
efficient LMs, bringing us closer to the goal of artificial general
intelligence.

TL;DR: The study presents FineWeb2, a new and scalable multilingual dataset curation pipeline, addressing the challenges in building high-quality multilingual datasets for large language model training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To introduce a scalable and adaptive solution for curating multilingual datasets for training large language models, overcoming difficulties such as language-specific filtering and deduplication.

Method: The pipeline is based on FineWeb technology, automatically adaptable for various languages. It includes evaluation on nine languages and offers a rebalancing approach to enhance dataset quality and model performance.

Result: The pipeline produced higher-performing non-English corpora compared to prior datasets, successfully scaled to over 1000 languages, producing a 20TB multilingual dataset (FineWeb2).

Conclusion: FineWeb2 and its associated code demonstrate a significant advancement in multilingual dataset curation, facilitating the development of more effective multilingual language models.

Abstract: Pre-training state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs) requires vast
amounts of clean and diverse text data. While the open development of large
high-quality English pre-training datasets has seen substantial recent
progress, training performant multilingual LLMs remains a challenge, in large
part due to the inherent difficulty of tailoring filtering and deduplication
pipelines to a large number of languages. In this work, we introduce a new
pre-training dataset curation pipeline based on FineWeb that can be
automatically adapted to support any language. We extensively ablate our
pipeline design choices on a set of nine diverse languages, guided by a set of
meaningful and informative evaluation tasks that were chosen through a novel
selection process based on measurable criteria. Ultimately, we show that our
pipeline can be used to create non-English corpora that produce more performant
models than prior datasets. We additionally introduce a straightforward and
principled approach to rebalance datasets that takes into consideration both
duplication count and quality, providing an additional performance uplift.
Finally, we scale our pipeline to over 1000 languages using almost 100 Common
Crawl snapshots to produce FineWeb2, a new 20 terabyte (5 billion document)
multilingual dataset which we release along with our pipeline, training, and
evaluation codebases.

TL;DR: KaLM-Embedding-V2 is a compact yet highly effective text embedding model achieving top-tier performance on MTEB benchmarks, with innovations in architecture, training techniques, and dataset diversity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation behind this research is to develop a compact text embedding model that performs as well as or better than significantly larger models, making it versatile and resource-efficient for general-purpose text embedding tasks.

Method: The model innovations include removing the causal attention mask, using a bidirectional transformer with mean-pooling, applying a multi-stage training pipeline (pre-training, fine-tuning, and parameter averaging), employing a focal-style reweighting mechanism, and integrating an online hard-negative mixing strategy. Additionally, they utilized an extensive dataset for both pre-training and fine-tuning.

Result: KaLM-Embedding-V2 demonstrates exceptional performance, outperforming equivalently sized models and competing with models that are up to 26 times larger on the MTEB Chinese and English benchmarks.

Conclusion: This paper establishes KaLM-Embedding-V2 as a new benchmark for compact embedding models, showing that a combination of architectural modifications, advanced training techniques, and dataset diversity can lead to remarkable efficiency and performance.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose KaLM-Embedding-V2, a versatile and compact
embedding model, which achieves impressive performance in general-purpose text
embedding tasks by leveraging superior training techniques and data. Our key
innovations include: (1) To better align the architecture with representation
learning, we remove the causal attention mask and adopt a fully bidirectional
transformer with simple yet effective mean-pooling to produce fixed-length
embeddings; (2) We employ a multi-stage training pipeline: (i) pre-training on
large-scale weakly supervised open-source corpora; (ii) fine-tuning on
high-quality retrieval and non-retrieval datasets; and (iii) model-soup
parameter averaging for robust generalization. Besides, we introduce a
focal-style reweighting mechanism that concentrates learning on difficult
samples and an online hard-negative mixing strategy to continuously enrich hard
negatives without expensive offline mining; (3) We collect over 20 categories
of data for pre-training and 100 categories of data for fine-tuning, to boost
both the performance and generalization of the embedding model. Extensive
evaluations on the Massive Text Embedding Benchmark (MTEB) Chinese and English
show that our model significantly outperforms others of comparable size, and
competes with 3x, 14x, 18x, and 26x larger embedding models, setting a new

### [26] [Can Gradient Descent Simulate Prompting?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20989)
*Eric Zhang,Leshem Choshen,Jacob Andreas*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper investigates making fine-tuning of language models as effective as prompting by introducing a meta-training approach leveraging gradient-based techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of fine-tuning compared to prompting in generalization and reasoning, and improve effectiveness of incorporating new information into language models.

Method: The researchers propose a meta-training method based on gradient-based meta-learning, where the model uses its own prompted predictions as targets for training, eliminating the reliance on ground-truth labels.

Result: The proposed method enables gradient updates to emulate prompt conditioning, achieving improved performance on tasks like the reversal curse and single-update question answering.

Conclusion: Gradient descent, when properly initialized, can be highly expressive for capturing long-context dependencies and enhancing generalization, paving the way for improved gradient-based learning methods in LMs.

Abstract: There are two primary ways of incorporating new information into a language
model (LM): changing its prompt or changing its parameters, e.g. via
fine-tuning. Parameter updates incur no long-term storage cost for model
changes. However, for many model updates, prompting is significantly more
effective: prompted models can generalize robustly from single examples and
draw logical inferences that do not occur under standard fine-tuning. Can
models be modified so that fine-tuning does emulate prompting? This paper
describes a method for meta-training LMs such that gradient updates emulate the
effects of conditioning on new information. Our approach uses tools from
gradient-based meta-learning but uses an LM's own prompted predictions as
targets, eliminating the need for ground-truth labels. Subsequent gradient
descent training recovers some (and occasionally all) of prompted model
performance -- showing improvement on the ``reversal curse'' tasks, and
answering questions about text passages after a single gradient update. These
results suggest that, with appropriate initialization, gradient descent can be
surprisingly expressive. Our results suggest new avenues for long-context
modeling and offer insight into the generalization capabilities of
gradient-based learning.

Motivation: The increasing demand for human-like personalities in LLMs has highlighted limitations in current models, particularly due to their reliance on the Big Five framework and inability to control trait intensity.

Method: The authors extended the Machine Personality Inventory (MPI) to use the 16PF model and introduced the SAC framework, which employs adjective-based semantic anchoring and evaluates traits using five intensity factors: Frequency, Depth, Threshold, Effort, and Willingness.

Result: Their approach achieved more consistent, controllable personality expressions and showed systematic, psychologically coherent interactions between different personality traits.

Conclusion: This research provides an advanced method for nuanced personality simulation in LLMs, supporting improved applications in areas like healthcare, education, and interviews.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have gained significant traction across a wide
range of fields in recent years. There is also a growing expectation for them
to display human-like personalities during interactions. To meet this
expectation, numerous studies have proposed methods for modelling LLM
personalities through psychometric evaluations. However, most existing models
face two major limitations: they rely on the Big Five (OCEAN) framework, which
only provides coarse personality dimensions, and they lack mechanisms for
controlling trait intensity. In this paper, we address this gap by extending
the Machine Personality Inventory (MPI), which originally used the Big Five
model, to incorporate the 16 Personality Factor (16PF) model, allowing
expressive control over sixteen distinct traits. We also developed a structured
framework known as Specific Attribute Control (SAC) for evaluating and
dynamically inducing trait intensity in LLMs. Our method introduces
adjective-based semantic anchoring to guide trait intensity expression and
leverages behavioural questions across five intensity factors:
\textit{Frequency}, \textit{Depth}, \textit{Threshold}, \textit{Effort}, and
\textit{Willingness}. Through experimentation, we find that modelling intensity
as a continuous spectrum yields substantially more consistent and controllable
personality expression compared to binary trait toggling. Moreover, we observe
that changes in target trait intensity systematically influence closely related
traits in psychologically coherent directions, suggesting that LLMs internalize
multi-dimensional personality structures rather than treating traits in
isolation. Our work opens new pathways for controlled and nuanced human-machine
interactions in domains such as healthcare, education, and interviewing
processes, bringing us one step closer to truly human-like social machines.

Abstract: Advanced intelligent systems, particularly Large Language Models (LLMs), are
significantly reshaping financial practices through advancements in Natural
Language Processing (NLP). However, the extent to which these models
effectively capture and apply domain-specific financial knowledge remains
uncertain. Addressing a critical gap in the expansive Indian financial context,
this paper introduces CA-Ben, a Chartered Accountancy benchmark specifically
designed to evaluate the financial, legal, and quantitative reasoning
capabilities of LLMs. CA-Ben comprises structured question-answer datasets
derived from the rigorous examinations conducted by the Institute of Chartered
Accountants of India (ICAI), spanning foundational, intermediate, and advanced
CA curriculum stages. Six prominent LLMs i.e. GPT 4o, LLAMA 3.3 70B, LLAMA 3.1

### [30] [A Semi-supervised Scalable Unified Framework for E-commerce Query Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21049)
*Chunyuan Yuan,Chong Zhang,Zheng Fang,Ming Pang,Xue Jiang,Changping Peng,Zhangang Lin,Ching Law*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a Semi-supervised Scalable Unified Framework (SSUF) to improve e-commerce query classification by addressing issues like lack of context and inefficient task unification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: E-commerce query classification tasks suffer from short queries with insufficient context, over-reliance on users' posterior behaviors, and the absence of a unified framework for subtasks, leading to inefficiency.

Method: The authors design SSUF, which includes modules for knowledge-enhancement (world knowledge for query representation), label-enhancement (label semantics and semi-supervised signals), and structure-enhancement (label relation modeling). Input features can be customized per subtask.

Result: The SSUF framework significantly outperforms state-of-the-art models in both offline and online A/B testing.

Conclusion: SSUF provides a unified, scalable, and effective approach for query classification, solving key limitations in existing systems while demonstrating superior performance.

Abstract: Query classification, including multiple subtasks such as intent and category
prediction, is vital to e-commerce applications. E-commerce queries are usually
short and lack context, and the information between labels cannot be used,
resulting in insufficient prior information for modeling. Most existing
industrial query classification methods rely on users' posterior click behavior
to construct training samples, resulting in a Matthew vicious cycle.
Furthermore, the subtasks of query classification lack a unified framework,
leading to low efficiency for algorithm optimization.
  In this paper, we propose a novel Semi-supervised Scalable Unified Framework
(SSUF), containing multiple enhanced modules to unify the query classification
tasks. The knowledge-enhanced module uses world knowledge to enhance query
representations and solve the problem of insufficient query information. The
label-enhanced module uses label semantics and semi-supervised signals to
reduce the dependence on posterior labels. The structure-enhanced module
enhances the label representation based on the complex label relations. Each
module is highly pluggable, and input features can be added or removed as
needed according to each subtask. We conduct extensive offline and online A/B
experiments, and the results show that SSUF significantly outperforms the
state-of-the-art models.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces MT2-CSD, a detailed dataset for multi-turn stance detection in conversations, and proposes LLM-CRAN, a model leveraging large language models, which significantly outperforms baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional stance detection methods focus on isolated instances, failing to capture the complexity of multi-party social media discussions due to a lack of suitable datasets.

Method: The authors created MT2-CSD, the largest dataset for multi-target, multi-turn conversational stance detection, and developed LLM-CRAN, a model that uses large language models for better conversational context understanding.

Result: LLM-CRAN achieved significantly superior performance compared to baseline models when tested on the MT2-CSD dataset.

Conclusion: LLM-CRAN and the MT2-CSD dataset together advance research in conversational stance detection by addressing real-world conversational complexities and outperforming existing benchmarks.

Abstract: In the realm of contemporary social media, automatic stance detection is
pivotal for opinion mining, as it synthesizes and examines user perspectives on
contentious topics to uncover prevailing trends and sentiments. Traditional
stance detection research often targets individual instances, thereby limiting
its capacity to model multi-party discussions typical in real social media
scenarios. This shortcoming largely stems from the scarcity of datasets that
authentically capture the dynamics of social media interactions, hindering
advancements in conversational stance detection. In this paper, we introduce
MT2-CSD, a comprehensive dataset for multi-target, multi-turn conversational
stance detection. To the best of our knowledge, MT2-CSD is the largest dataset
available for this purpose, comprising 24,457 annotated instances and
exhibiting the greatest conversational depth, thereby presenting new challenges
for stance detection. To address these challenges, we propose the Large
Language model enhanced Conversational Relational Attention Network (LLM-CRAN),
which exploits the reasoning capabilities of LLMs to improve conversational
understanding. We conduct extensive experiments to evaluate the efficacy of
LLM-CRAN on the MT2-CSD dataset. The experimental results indicate that
LLM-CRAN significantly outperforms strong baseline models in the task of
conversational stance detection.

*Papa Séga Wade,Mihai Andries,Ioannis Kanellos,Thierry Moudenc*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This research proposes a chunk-based approach integrating self-supervised learning models and a CNN-BiLSTM framework for fluency assessment in non-native speech, improving evaluation metrics significantly.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Automated fluency assessment increasingly faces challenges in accurately analyzing rhythm, pauses, and disfluencies for non-native speakers.

Method: The authors use breath-group segmentation with Silero-VAD, multi-SSL embedding fusion via weighted mechanisms, and a hierarchical CNN-BiLSTM to assess speech fluency while addressing over-segmentation and feature imbalance.

Result: The approach achieves significant improvement (2.8–4.2 F1-score and 4.0–6.2 Pearson points) across Avalinguo and Speechocean762 datasets, outperforming single SSL and Pyannote.audio-based baselines.

Conclusion: A chunk-based approach with multi-SSL fusion offers a robust solution for fluency evaluation, but further generalization to diverse dialects and prosodies is recommended.

Abstract: Automatic fluency assessment (AFA) remains challenging, particularly in
capturing speech rhythm, pauses, and disfluencies in non-native speakers. We
introduce a chunk-based approach integrating self-supervised learning (SSL)
models (Wav2Vec2, HuBERT, and WavLM) selected for their complementary strengths
in phonetic, prosodic, and noisy speech modeling, with a hierarchical
CNN-BiLSTM framework. Speech is segmented into breath-group chunks using Silero
voice activity detection (Silero-VAD), enabling fine-grained temporal analysis
while mitigating over-segmentation artifacts. SSL embeddings are fused via a
learnable weighted mechanism, balancing acoustic and linguistic features, and
enriched with chunk-level fluency markers (e.g., speech rate, pause durations,
n-gram repetitions). The CNN-BiLSTM captures local and long-term dependencies
across chunks. Evaluated on Avalinguo and Speechocean762, our approach improves
F1-score by 2.8 and Pearson correlation by 6.2 points over single SSL baselines
on Speechocean762, with gains of 4.2 F1-score and 4.0 Pearson points on
Avalinguo, surpassing Pyannote.audio-based segmentation baselines. These
findings highlight chunk-based multi-SSL fusion for robust fluency evaluation,
though future work should explore generalization to dialects with irregular
prosody.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes DALR, a method enhancing multimodal sentence representations through fine-grained cross-modal alignment and intra-modal ranking distillation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in multimodal sentence representation, such as cross-modal misalignment and intra-modal semantic divergence, which degrade representation quality.

Method: They introduce DALR, featuring a consistency learning module for soft cross-modal alignment and ranking distillation to capture intricate sentence relationships beyond binary labels.

Result: Comprehensive experiments on semantic textual similarity (STS) and transfer tasks show that DALR consistently surpasses state-of-the-art baselines.

Conclusion: DALR effectively addresses key challenges, improving the quality of multimodal sentence representations, and outperforms existing methods.

Abstract: Previous multimodal sentence representation learning methods have achieved
impressive performance. However, most approaches focus on aligning images and
text at a coarse level, facing two critical challenges:cross-modal misalignment
bias and intra-modal semantic divergence, which significantly degrade sentence
representation quality. To address these challenges, we propose DALR
(Dual-level Alignment Learning for Multimodal Sentence Representation). For
cross-modal alignment, we propose a consistency learning module that softens
negative samples and utilizes semantic similarity from an auxiliary task to
achieve fine-grained cross-modal alignment. Additionally, we contend that
sentence relationships go beyond binary positive-negative labels, exhibiting a
more intricate ranking structure. To better capture these relationships and
enhance representation quality, we integrate ranking distillation with global
intra-modal alignment learning. Comprehensive experiments on semantic textual
similarity (STS) and transfer (TR) tasks validate the effectiveness of our
approach, consistently demonstrating its superiority over state-of-the-art
baselines.

Motivation: The work addresses challenges in CQA, including underutilizing external knowledge, incorporating dynamic QA contexts, and deploying memory mechanisms effectively in industrial applications.

Method: It proposes ComRAG, which integrates static knowledge with dynamic QA history using a centroid-based memory mechanism for retrieval, generation, and storage optimization.

Result: ComRAG outperforms baselines on three datasets, improving vector similarity by up to 25.9%, reducing latency by 8.7% to 23.3%, and lowering data chunk growth significantly from 20.23% to 2.06%.

Conclusion: ComRAG demonstrates effectiveness and efficiency in industrial CQA tasks by optimizing knowledge use, reducing latency, and better managing memory.

Abstract: Community Question Answering (CQA) platforms can be deemed as important
knowledge bases in community, but effectively leveraging historical
interactions and domain knowledge in real-time remains a challenge. Existing
methods often underutilize external knowledge, fail to incorporate dynamic
historical QA context, or lack memory mechanisms suited for industrial
deployment. We propose ComRAG, a retrieval-augmented generation framework for
real-time industrial CQA that integrates static knowledge with dynamic
historical QA pairs via a centroid-based memory mechanism designed for
retrieval, generation, and efficient storage. Evaluated on three industrial CQA
datasets, ComRAG consistently outperforms all baselines--achieving up to 25.9%
improvement in vector similarity, reducing latency by 8.7% to 23.3%, and
lowering chunk growth from 20.23% to 2.06% over iterations.

*Xiaoshuang Ji,Zhendong Zhao,Xiaojun Chen,Xin Zhao,Zeyao Liu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Progtuning proposes a progressive fine-tuning approach for Transformer-based models, optimizing resource allocation by selectively reducing updated Transformer blocks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current fine-tuning and parameter-efficient methods often allocate computational resources inefficiently by uniformly updating Transformer blocks, regardless of their actual contribution.

Method: Introduce Progtuning, a fine-tuning framework that progressively reduces the number of updated Transformer blocks based on their contribution, optimizing resource use.

Result: Progtuning achieves a 25% reduction in updated parameters while maintaining competitive performance and proves adaptable across parameter-efficient methods.

Conclusion: Progtuning balances efficiency and effectiveness by optimizing the allocation of computing resources, offering significant improvements in fine-tuning Transformer-based models.

Abstract: Fine-tuning is a promising technique for leveraging Transformer-based
language models in downstream tasks. As model sizes continue to grow, updating
all model parameters becomes increasingly costly. Parameter-efficient
fine-tuning methods effectively address this issue by selectively updating a
small subset of parameters. However, fine-tuning and most existing
parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods require updating the same number of
parameters as the initial size, ignoring the unequal contribution across
Transformer blocks and leading to extremely inefficient allocation of computing
resources. In this paper, we propose Progtuning, the novel fine-tuning
framework combined with progressive learning for Transformer-based language
models. Specifically, Progtuning progressively reduces the number of updated
transformer blocks based on the contribution. Remarkably, Progtuning optimizes
resource allocation and reduces the number of updated parameters by
approximately 25\%, while still maintaining competitive performance. And it
also exhibits high adaptability with parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods,
demonstrating excellent performance across various adaptation scenarios.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces Cosmos, a novel text generation model that uses diffusion in a compressed latent space, achieving faster and high-quality generation compared to existing baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of autoregressive text generation models, such as slow decoding and global coherence issues, by leveraging diffusion-based methods.

Method: Cosmos utilizes a compressed, smooth latent space for diffusion, trained with an autoencoder aligned with a pretrained language encoder for semantic grounding and augmentations.

Result: The model demonstrates an 8x compression of text representations while maintaining generation quality, surpassing baselines in performance, and achieving over 2x faster inference.

Conclusion: Cosmos provides a promising paradigm for efficient and high-quality text generation, showcasing the potential of diffusion in latent spaces for various generative tasks.

Abstract: Autoregressive language models dominate modern text generation, yet their
sequential nature introduces fundamental limitations: decoding is slow, and
maintaining global coherence remains challenging. Diffusion models offer a
promising alternative by enabling parallel generation and flexible control;
however, their application to text generation is hindered by the high
dimensionality of token-level representations. We introduce Cosmos, a novel
approach to text generation that operates entirely in a compressed, smooth
latent space tailored specifically for diffusion. This space is learned using
an autoencoder trained simultaneously for token-level reconstruction and
alignment with frozen activations from a pretrained language encoder, providing
robust semantic grounding and enabling effective perturbation-based
augmentations. Empirically, we demonstrate that text representations can be
compressed by $8\times$ while maintaining generation quality comparable to
token-level diffusion models. Furthermore, increasing the latent sequence
length allows Cosmos to surpass both diffusion-based and autoregressive
baselines. We evaluate Cosmos on four diverse generative tasks including story
generation, question generation, summarization, and detoxification and compare
it with various generative paradigms. Cosmos achieves comparable or superior
generation quality while offering more than $2\times$ faster inference.

TL;DR: Integrating textual prompts with transformer models for turn-taking in dialogues enhances prediction accuracy and cycle variability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Develop real-time turn-taking prediction models that respond dynamically to text-based instructions for improved adaptability.

Method: Enhanced transformer-based Voice Activity Projection model with textual prompt embeddings; utilized synthetic prompts generated by a large language model.

Result: Improved predictive accuracy and successfully varied turn-taking behavior based on textual instructions.

Conclusion: Textual prompts enable adaptive and precise control in turn-taking systems, offering promising improvements for conversational AI.

Abstract: Turn-taking prediction models are essential components in spoken dialogue
systems and conversational robots. Recent approaches leverage transformer-based
architectures to predict speech activity continuously and in real-time. In this
study, we propose a novel model that enables turn-taking prediction to be
dynamically controlled via textual prompts. This approach allows intuitive and
explicit control through instructions such as "faster" or "calmer" adapting
dynamically to conversational partners and contexts. The proposed model builds
upon a transformer-based voice activity projection (VAP) model, incorporating
textual prompt embeddings into both channel-wise transformers and a
cross-channel transformer. We evaluated the feasibility of our approach using
over 950 hours of human-human spoken dialogue data. Since textual prompt data
for the proposed approach was not available in existing datasets, we utilized a
large language model (LLM) to generate synthetic prompt sentences. Experimental
results demonstrated that the proposed model improved prediction accuracy and
effectively varied turn-taking timing behaviors according to the textual
prompts.

*Yongchan Chun,Minhyuk Kim,Dongjun Kim,Chanjun Park,Heuiseok Lim*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces a retrieval-based prompting strategy for Automatic Term Extraction (ATE) using syntactic similarity in large language models (LLMs), achieving improved performance across benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to explore the largely untapped potential of large language models (LLMs) for Automatic Term Extraction (ATE), a task critical for applications like machine translation and information retrieval.

Method: The authors propose a retrieval-based prompting system where demonstrations are chosen based on syntactic similarity instead of semantic similarity, making it domain-agnostic. They analyze its effectiveness in both in-domain and cross-domain contexts.

Result: Experiments on three specialized ATE benchmarks demonstrate that the syntactic retrieval-based approach achieves higher F1-scores, validating the use of syntactic cues.

Conclusion: The study concludes that syntactic similarity can reliably guide LLMs for ATE, emphasizing its value over semantic retrieval in adapting models to terminology-extraction tasks.

Abstract: Automatic Term Extraction (ATE) identifies domain-specific expressions that
are crucial for downstream tasks such as machine translation and information
retrieval. Although large language models (LLMs) have significantly advanced
various NLP tasks, their potential for ATE has scarcely been examined. We
propose a retrieval-based prompting strategy that, in the few-shot setting,
selects demonstrations according to \emph{syntactic} rather than semantic
similarity. This syntactic retrieval method is domain-agnostic and provides
more reliable guidance for capturing term boundaries. We evaluate the approach
in both in-domain and cross-domain settings, analyzing how lexical overlap
between the query sentence and its retrieved examples affects performance.
Experiments on three specialized ATE benchmarks show that syntactic retrieval
improves F1-score. These findings highlight the importance of syntactic cues
when adapting LLMs to terminology-extraction tasks.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces Agent-RewardBench, a benchmark for evaluating reward modeling in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), focusing on real-world agent scenarios, step-level rewards, and maintaining high-quality difficulty. Current models show limitations, emphasizing the need for specialized training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges MLLM-based multimodal agents face in self-correction and generalization due to lack of external feedback, and the absence of structured benchmarks for reward models in real-world agent tasks.

Method: The authors propose Agent-RewardBench featuring three main contributions: (1) evaluation across multiple real-world agent scenarios including perception, planning, and safety; (2) step-level analysis to assess capabilities during task execution; (3) curation through diverse model sampling, difficulty control, and manual verification.

Result: Experimental evaluations reveal that even advanced multimodal models underperform on the benchmark, pointing to significant gaps in agent reward modeling.

Conclusion: Agent-RewardBench serves as an essential framework for advancing the reward modeling capabilities of MLLMs, indicating the necessity for focused development and training of such models.

Abstract: As Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) advance, multimodal agents show
promise in real-world tasks like web navigation and embodied intelligence.
However, due to limitations in a lack of external feedback, these agents
struggle with self-correction and generalization. A promising approach is to
use reward models as external feedback, but there is no clear on how to select
reward models for agents. Thus, there is an urgent need to build a reward bench
targeted at agents. To address these challenges, we propose Agent-RewardBench,
a benchmark designed to evaluate reward modeling ability in MLLMs. The
benchmark is characterized by three key features: (1) Multiple dimensions and
real-world agent scenarios evaluation. It covers perception, planning, and
safety with 7 scenarios; (2) Step-level reward evaluation. It allows for the
assessment of agent capabilities at the individual steps of a task, providing a
more granular view of performance during the planning process; and (3)
Appropriately difficulty and high-quality. We carefully sample from 10 diverse
models, difficulty control to maintain task challenges, and manual verification
to ensure the integrity of the data. Experiments demonstrate that even
state-of-the-art multimodal models show limited performance, highlighting the
need for specialized training in agent reward modeling. Code is available at

### [40] [Cat and Mouse -- Can Fake Text Generation Outpace Detector Systems?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21274)
*Andrea McGlinchey,Peter J Barclay*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study explores whether the detection of fake text generated by LLMs can remain reliable despite advancements in model sizes and architectures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: With the increasing prevalence of large language models (LLMs) in generating fake text in areas like academic writing and political news, the paper investigates the ongoing challenge of detecting such artificially generated content.

Method: The authors assess the ability of statistical classifiers to identify fake text, focusing on text styled as classical detective fiction and comparing the detection capabilities across different versions of LLMs, including Gemini and GPT.

Result: Their findings reveal that while Gemini demonstrated improved text generation deceptiveness over a version upgrade, GPT did not, suggesting varying capabilities among models in evading detection.

Conclusion: Detection of fake text may remain viable even as LLMs grow larger, although advancements in model architecture could improve their ability to generate deceptive outputs.

Abstract: Large language models can produce convincing "fake text" in domains such as
academic writing, product reviews, and political news. Many approaches have
been investigated for the detection of artificially generated text. While this
may seem to presage an endless "arms race", we note that newer LLMs use ever
more parameters, training data, and energy, while relatively simple classifiers
demonstrate a good level of detection accuracy with modest resources. To
approach the question of whether the models' ability to beat the detectors may
therefore reach a plateau, we examine the ability of statistical classifiers to
identify "fake text" in the style of classical detective fiction. Over a 0.5
version increase, we found that Gemini showed an increased ability to generate
deceptive text, while GPT did not. This suggests that reliable detection of
fake text may remain feasible even for ever-larger models, though new model
architectures may improve their deceptiveness

TL;DR: This paper introduces Double-Checker, a framework that enhances reasoning capabilities in large language models (LLMs) by enabling self-critique and iterative refinement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard LLMs often struggle to generate critiques and refine previous solutions effectively. The paper seeks to address these limitations, aiming to foster better reasoning and reliability in LLMs.

Method: The authors developed Double-Checker by fine-tuning LLMs on 1,730 instances of self-critique. This allows models to iteratively critique and refine outputs during inference until deemed correct under self-generated critiques.

Result: Double-Checker improved the pass@1 performance on challenging benchmarks like AIME from 4.4% to 18.2%, showcasing enhanced reasoning abilities.

Conclusion: Iterative self-critique significantly boosts LLM reasoning capabilities, pointing toward the development of more trustworthy and effective models.

Abstract: While slow-thinking large language models (LLMs) exhibit reflection-like
reasoning, commonly referred to as the "aha moment:, their ability to generate
informative critiques and refine prior solutions remains limited. In this
paper, we introduce Double-Checker, a principled framework designed to enhance
the reasoning capabilities of slow-thinking LLMs by fostering explicit
self-critique and iterative refinement of their previous solutions. By
fine-tuning on our curated 1,730 self-critical instances, Double-Checker
empowers long-CoT LLMs to iteratively critique and refine their outputs during
inference until they evaluate their solutions as correct under self-generated
critiques. We validate the efficacy of Double-Checker across a comprehensive
suite of reasoning benchmarks, demonstrating that iterative self-critique
significantly enhances the reasoning capabilities of long-CoT LLMs. Notably,
our Double-Checker increases the pass@1 performance on challenging AIME
benchmarks from 4.4% to 18.2% compared to the original long-CoT LLMs. These
results highlight a promising direction for developing more trustworthy and
effective LLMs capable of structured self-critique.

Method: The study uses fine-tuned lightweight encoder models like RoBERTa and NomicBERT to detect groundedness efficiently, comparing them to advanced LLMs.

Result: Lightweight models achieved comparable accuracy to leading LLMs while significantly decreasing inference latency.

Conclusion: Groundedness detection can be effectively and more efficiently achieved using lightweight models, enhancing trust and resource utilization.

Abstract: Augmenting large language models (LLMs) with external context significantly
improves their performance in natural language processing (NLP) tasks. However,
LLMs struggle to answer queries reliably when the provided context lacks
information, often resorting to ungrounded speculation or internal knowledge.
Groundedness - generating responses strictly supported by the context - is
essential for ensuring factual consistency and trustworthiness. This study
focuses on detecting whether a given query is grounded in a document provided
in context before the costly answer generation by LLMs. Such a detection
mechanism can significantly reduce both inference time and resource
consumption. We show that lightweight, task specific encoder models such as
RoBERTa and NomicBERT, fine-tuned on curated datasets, can achieve accuracy
comparable to state-of-the-art LLMs, such as Llama3 8B and GPT4o, in
groundedness detection while reducing inference latency by orders of magnitude.

### [43] [Detecting Referring Expressions in Visually Grounded Dialogue with Autoregressive Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21294)
*Bram Willemsen,Gabriel Skantze*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper explores using language models to detect referring expressions in dialogues without visual input.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether linguistic context alone can identify visually grounded references in conversations.

Method: The authors adapt a pretrained large language model to annotate mention spans via next-token prediction, using fine-tuning on small datasets.

Result: Moderately sized LLMs with parameter-efficient fine-tuning can effectively extract referring expressions from text-only input.

Conclusion: While effective, text-only approaches are fundamentally limited for multimodal tasks like visually grounded dialogue analysis.

Abstract: In this paper, we explore the use of a text-only, autoregressive language
modeling approach for the extraction of referring expressions from visually
grounded dialogue. More specifically, the aim is to investigate the extent to
which the linguistic context alone can inform the detection of mentions that
have a (visually perceivable) referent in the visual context of the
conversation. To this end, we adapt a pretrained large language model (LLM) to
perform a relatively course-grained annotation of mention spans in unfolding
conversations by demarcating mention span boundaries in text via next-token
prediction. Our findings indicate that even when using a moderately sized LLM,
relatively small datasets, and parameter-efficient fine-tuning, a text-only
approach can be effective, highlighting the relative importance of the
linguistic context for this task. Nevertheless, we argue that the task
represents an inherently multimodal problem and discuss limitations fundamental
to unimodal approaches.

*Fangzhou Dong,Yifan Zeng,Yingpeng Sang,Hong Shen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces GLASS, a framework enhancing LLMs' ability to perform profound literary analysis using the Greimas Semiotic Square (GSS).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs lack skills in offering deep literary criticism for complex narratives, creating a need for a framework to enhance their analytical abilities.

Method: The GLASS framework uses GSS for structured narrative analysis, includes a dataset with 48 works, defines quantitative metrics for evaluation, and employs LLM-as-a-judge to assess its performance.

Result: GLASS showcases high performance compared to expert criticism on various works and produces original, high-quality analyses of 39 classic works.

Conclusion: GLASS emerges as a useful AI-powered tool for literary research and education, revealing insights into how literature engages cognition.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel in understanding and generating text but
struggle with providing professional literary criticism for works with profound
thoughts and complex narratives. This paper proposes GLASS (Greimas Literary
Analysis via Semiotic Square), a structured analytical framework based on
Greimas Semiotic Square (GSS), to enhance LLMs' ability to conduct in-depth
literary analysis. GLASS facilitates the rapid dissection of narrative
structures and deep meanings in narrative works. We propose the first dataset
for GSS-based literary criticism, featuring detailed analyses of 48 works. Then
we propose quantitative metrics for GSS-based literary criticism using the
LLM-as-a-judge paradigm. Our framework's results, compared with expert
criticism across multiple works and LLMs, show high performance. Finally, we
applied GLASS to 39 classic works, producing original and high-quality analyses
that address existing research gaps. This research provides an AI-based tool
for literary research and education, offering insights into the cognitive
mechanisms underlying literary engagement.

*Guanting Dong,Xiaoxi Li,Yuyao Zhang,Mengjie Deng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Omni-RAG introduces a framework to enhance retrieval-augmented generation systems in dealing with noisy, complex user queries in live, real-world scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing systems struggle with processing queries that are noisy, ambiguous, or have multiple intents, limiting their real-world applicability.

Method: Omni-RAG uses three modules: Deep Query Understanding and Decomposition, Intent-Aware Knowledge Retrieval, and Reranking and Generation, leveraging LLMs with tailored prompts.

Result: Omni-RAG improves query preprocessing, retrieval, and generation, enabling robust handling of complex, real-world queries.

Conclusion: The framework bridges the gap between current RAG system capabilities and the needs of real-world, open-domain applications.

Abstract: Real-world live retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems face significant
challenges when processing user queries that are often noisy, ambiguous, and
contain multiple intents. While RAG enhances large language models (LLMs) with
external knowledge, current systems typically struggle with such complex
inputs, as they are often trained or evaluated on cleaner data. This paper
introduces Omni-RAG, a novel framework designed to improve the robustness and
effectiveness of RAG systems in live, open-domain settings. Omni-RAG employs
LLM-assisted query understanding to preprocess user inputs through three key
modules: (1) Deep Query Understanding and Decomposition, which utilizes LLMs
with tailored prompts to denoise queries (e.g., correcting spelling errors) and
decompose multi-intent queries into structured sub-queries; (2) Intent-Aware
Knowledge Retrieval, which performs retrieval for each sub-query from a corpus
(i.e., FineWeb using OpenSearch) and aggregates the results; and (3) Reranking
and Generation, where a reranker (i.e., BGE) refines document selection before
a final response is generated by an LLM (i.e., Falcon-10B) using a
chain-of-thought prompt. Omni-RAG aims to bridge the gap between current RAG
capabilities and the demands of real-world applications, such as those
highlighted by the SIGIR 2025 LiveRAG Challenge, by robustly handling complex
and noisy queries.

### [46] [Domain Knowledge-Enhanced LLMs for Fraud and Concept Drift Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21443)
*Ali Şenol,Garima Agrawal,Huan Liu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper proposes a Domain Knowledge (DK)-Enhanced LLM framework for detecting fake conversations and semantic shifts (Concept Drift) to improve NLP performance in fraud detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Detecting deceptive conversations is challenging because of evolving language patterns and semantic shifts that obscure malicious content or mimic normal behavior.

Method: The proposed framework integrates pretrained Large Language Models (LLMs) with structured domain knowledge to detect fake conversations, identify semantic shifts using a drift detection unit, and classify these shifts as benign or fraudulent.

Result: Testing on a fake review dataset and a multiturn dialogue dataset (SEConvo), the framework achieves high accuracy—98% in classification—while outperforming zero-shot LLM baselines by leveraging domain knowledge.

Conclusion: Incorporating domain knowledge and drift-awareness improves accuracy, interpretability, and robustness in NLP applications tackling fraud detection and concept drift.

Abstract: Detecting deceptive conversations on dynamic platforms is increasingly
difficult due to evolving language patterns and Concept Drift (CD)-i.e.,
semantic or topical shifts that alter the context or intent of interactions
over time. These shifts can obscure malicious intent or mimic normal dialogue,
making accurate classification challenging. While Large Language Models (LLMs)
show strong performance in natural language tasks, they often struggle with
contextual ambiguity and hallucinations in risk-sensitive scenarios. To address
these challenges, we present a Domain Knowledge (DK)-Enhanced LLM framework
that integrates pretrained LLMs with structured, task-specific insights to
perform fraud and concept drift detection. The proposed architecture consists
of three main components: (1) a DK-LLM module to detect fake or deceptive
conversations; (2) a drift detection unit (OCDD) to determine whether a
semantic shift has occurred; and (3) a second DK-LLM module to classify the
drift as either benign or fraudulent. We first validate the value of domain
knowledge using a fake review dataset and then apply our full framework to
SEConvo, a multiturn dialogue dataset that includes various types of fraud and
spam attacks. Results show that our system detects fake conversations with high
accuracy and effectively classifies the nature of drift. Guided by structured
prompts, the LLaMA-based implementation achieves 98% classification accuracy.
Comparative studies against zero-shot baselines demonstrate that incorporating
domain knowledge and drift awareness significantly improves performance,
interpretability, and robustness in high-stakes NLP applications.

### [47] [Text2Cypher Across Languages: Evaluating Foundational Models Beyond English](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21445)
*Makbule Gulcin Ozsoy,William Tai*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper examines the performance of large language models (LLMs) for generating Cypher queries from user questions in English, Spanish, and Turkish. It introduces a multilingual test set, evaluates models, and highlights performance differences across languages.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore and address gaps in the evaluation of LLM-based database query generation in non-English languages, expanding their accessibility and inclusiveness.

Method: Created a multilingual test set with translated Spanish and Turkish questions linked to original Cypher queries. Evaluated foundational LLMs using standardized metrics and studied the impact of translating task prompts.

Result: Performance was highest in English, followed by Spanish, and lowest for Turkish, attributed to varying training data availability and linguistic factors. Translating prompts showed minimal effect on results.

Conclusion: Multilingual testing shows disparities in LLM query generation, underscoring the need for inclusive model evaluation and development. Future work should focus on schema localization and fine-tuning for diverse languages.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models have enabled natural language
interfaces that translate user questions into database queries, such as
Text2SQL, Text2SPARQL, and Text2Cypher. While these interfaces enhance database
accessibility, most research today focuses solely on English, with limited
evaluation in other languages. This paper investigates the performance of
foundational LLMs on the Text2Cypher task across multiple languages. We create
and release a multilingual test set by translating English questions into
Spanish and Turkish while preserving the original Cypher queries, enabling fair
cross-lingual comparison. We evaluate multiple foundational models using
standardized prompts and metrics. Our results show a consistent performance
pattern: highest on English, then Spanish, and lowest on Turkish. We attribute
this to differences in training data availability and linguistic
characteristics. Additionally, we explore the impact of translating task
prompts into Spanish and Turkish. Results show little to no change in
evaluation metrics, suggesting prompt translation has minor impact. Our
findings highlight the need for more inclusive evaluation and development in
multilingual query generation. Future work includes schema localization and
fine-tuning across diverse languages.

*Anne Wu,Laurent Mazaré,Neil Zeghidour,Alexandre Défossez*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This research introduces a preference alignment framework for spoken dialogue models, improving their real-time conversational performance through a large dataset and fine-tuning methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of existing preference learning methods that focus on text-based models, which are unsuitable for the dynamic and unsegmented nature of real-time spoken dialogue.

Method: Developed a dataset of 150,000 preference pairs from multi-turn speech conversations with AI feedback, used these for offline alignment to fine-tune a duplex speech-to-speech model.

Result: The experiments showed that incorporating feedback improved the model's ability to produce factual, safer, and more contextually aware dialogues in real-time speech interactions.

Conclusion: Well-balanced preference alignment is essential for enhancing natural conversational dynamics in real-time speech dialogue systems.

Abstract: We propose a novel preference alignment framework for improving spoken
dialogue models on real-time conversations from user interactions. Current
preference learning methods primarily focus on text-based language models, and
are not directly suited to the complexities of real-time speech interactions,
with richer dynamics (e.g. interruption, interjection) and no explicit
segmentation between speaker turns.We create a large-scale dataset of more than
150,000 preference pairs from raw multi-turn speech conversations, annotated
with AI feedback, to cover preferences over both linguistic content and
temporal context variations. We leverage offline alignment methods to finetune
a full-duplex autoregressive speech-to-speech model. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that feedback on generic conversations can be consistently
effective in improving spoken dialogue models to produce more factual, safer
and more contextually aligned interactions. We deploy the finetuned model and
conduct holistic human evaluations to assess the impact beyond single-turn
conversations. Our findings shed light on the importance of a well-calibrated
balance among various dynamics, crucial for natural real-time speech dialogue
systems.

### [49] [TopK Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21468)
*Ryosuke Takahashi,Tatsuro Inaba,Kentaro Inui,Benjamin Heinzerling*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces TopK activation functions in transformers to address Sparse Autoencoder (SAE) limitations, improving interpretability without post-hoc training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods using Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) for analyzing transformer-based language models face issues like unclear interpretability, unstable feature tracing, and architectural influence over learned features.

Method: The study replaces post-hoc SAEs with a modified transformer architecture that uses a TopK activation function, directly integrating sparse representations into the model's hidden states.

Result: TopK LMs match the interpretability of SAEs without post-hoc training, maintain model capabilities, and allow targeted neuron interventions and analysis—offering stability across checkpoints and layers.

Conclusion: TopK LMs are a lightweight and stable alternative to SAEs, enabling better understanding of language models and advancing research on their interpretability and control.

Abstract: Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) have become an important tool for analyzing and
interpreting the activation space of transformer-based language models (LMs).
However, SAEs suffer several shortcomings that diminish their utility and
internal validity. Since SAEs are trained post-hoc, it is unclear if the
failure to discover a particular concept is a failure on the SAE's side or due
to the underlying LM not representing this concept. This problem is exacerbated
by training conditions and architecture choices affecting which features an SAE
learns. When tracing how LMs learn concepts during training, the lack of
feature stability also makes it difficult to compare SAEs features across
different checkpoints. To address these limitations, we introduce a
modification to the transformer architecture that incorporates a TopK
activation function at chosen layers, making the model's hidden states
equivalent to the latent features of a TopK SAE. This approach eliminates the
need for post-hoc training while providing interpretability comparable to SAEs.
The resulting TopK LMs offer a favorable trade-off between model size,
computational efficiency, and interpretability. Despite this simple
architectural change, TopK LMs maintain their original capabilities while
providing robust interpretability benefits. Our experiments demonstrate that
the sparse representations learned by TopK LMs enable successful steering
through targeted neuron interventions and facilitate detailed analysis of
neuron formation processes across checkpoints and layers. These features make
TopK LMs stable and reliable tools for understanding how language models learn
and represent concepts, which we believe will significantly advance future
research on model interpretability and controllability.

TL;DR: The paper analyzes reinforcement learning techniques for finetuning large language models across offline, semi-online, and online regimes, discovering comparable performance between different optimization methods and emphasizing benefits of multi-tasking.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate the performance of reinforcement learning methods in transitioning large language models across different training regimes and task types.

Method: Experiments on verifiable math and non-verifiable instruction tasks, comparing Direct Preference Optimization and Group Reward Policy Optimization across various settings. Analysis of hyperparameters and training dynamics.

Result: Finds similar convergence and performance between semi-online and online optimization methods, both outperforming offline techniques. Multi-tasking improves performance across diverse task types.

Conclusion: Reinforcement learning techniques are effective for finetuning large language models, with multi-tasking enhancing results across verifiable and non-verifiable tasks.

Abstract: We investigate the effectiveness of reinforcement learning methods for
finetuning large language models when transitioning from offline to semi-online
to fully online regimes for both verifiable and non-verifiable tasks. Our
experiments cover training on verifiable math as well as non-verifiable
instruction following with a set of benchmark evaluations for both. Across
these settings, we extensively compare online and semi-online Direct Preference
Optimization and Group Reward Policy Optimization objectives, and surprisingly
find similar performance and convergence between these variants, which all
strongly outperform offline methods. We provide a detailed analysis of the
training dynamics and hyperparameter selection strategies to achieve optimal
results. Finally, we show that multi-tasking with verifiable and non-verifiable
rewards jointly yields improved performance across both task types.

*Jiashuo Wang,Kaitao Song,Chunpu Xu,Changhe Song,Yang Xiao,Dongsheng Li,Lili Qiu,Wenjie Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes a method for enhancing user engagement in interactive language models by using future conversation signals. It introduces a user simulator and interacts via i×MCTS to optimize models for high user engagement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods inadequately address the subtle connection between user engagement and knowledge or dialogue acts in socially-driven dialogues.

Method: The researchers employed a user's reaction as a reward metric, used a user simulator with i×MCTS for interactions, and collected datasets for direct preference optimization (DPO).

Result: Experiments show that the approach significantly improves user engagement in emotional support and persuasive dialogue scenarios.

Conclusion: The proposed system can better align interactive LLMs for fostering meaningful and engaging dialogues compared to traditional methods.

Abstract: Enhancing user engagement through interactions plays an essential role in
socially-driven dialogues. While prior works have optimized models to reason
over relevant knowledge or plan a dialogue act flow, the relationship between
user engagement and knowledge or dialogue acts is subtle and does not guarantee
user engagement in socially-driven dialogues. To this end, we enable
interactive LLMs to learn user engagement by leveraging signals from the future
development of conversations. Specifically, we adopt a more direct and relevant
indicator of user engagement, i.e., the user's reaction related to dialogue
intention after the interaction, as a reward to align interactive LLMs. To
achieve this, we develop a user simulator to interact with target interactive
LLMs and explore interactions between the user and the interactive LLM system
via \textit{i$\times$MCTS} (\textit{M}onte \textit{C}arlo \textit{T}ree
\textit{S}earch for \textit{i}nteraction). In this way, we collect a dataset
containing pairs of higher and lower-quality experiences using
\textit{i$\times$MCTS}, and align interactive LLMs for high-level user
engagement by direct preference optimization (DPO) accordingly. Experiments
conducted on two socially-driven dialogue scenarios (emotional support
conversations and persuasion for good) demonstrate that our method effectively
enhances user engagement in interactive LLMs.

Finally, we also release the complete benchmark data, an open-source toolkit

*Marina Mancoridis,Bec Weeks,Keyon Vafa,Sendhil Mullainathan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper critiques the use of benchmark datasets for evaluating LLMs, showing they often reveal 'potemkin understanding,' or illusory comprehension, rather than true conceptual grasp.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess whether benchmarks for LLMs, commonly designed for human evaluation, truly measure linguistic and conceptual understanding in models.

Method: Introduced a formal framework and two procedures: (1) a specially-designed benchmark in three domains and (2) a general procedure estimating the prevalence of 'potemkin understanding.'

Result: The research observed widespread occurrences of 'potemkin understanding' across different models, tasks, and domains, highlighting internal incoherence in concept representations.

Conclusion: Current benchmarks may fail to evaluate true comprehension in LLMs and instead demonstrate superficially correct answers that lack human-like interpretation of concepts.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are regularly evaluated using benchmark
datasets. But what justifies making inferences about an LLM's capabilities
based on its answers to a curated set of questions? This paper first introduces
a formal framework to address this question. The key is to note that the
benchmarks used to test LLMs -- such as AP exams -- are also those used to test
people. However, this raises an implication: these benchmarks are only valid
tests if LLMs misunderstand concepts in ways that mirror human
misunderstandings. Otherwise, success on benchmarks only demonstrates potemkin
understanding: the illusion of understanding driven by answers irreconcilable
with how any human would interpret a concept. We present two procedures for
quantifying the existence of potemkins: one using a specially designed
benchmark in three domains, the other using a general procedure that provides a
lower-bound on their prevalence. We find that potemkins are ubiquitous across
models, tasks, and domains. We also find that these failures reflect not just
incorrect understanding, but deeper internal incoherence in concept
representations.

Motivation: With rising use of large language models for healthcare inquiries, the paper aims to understand the risks and interaction patterns in these conversations.

Method: The study filters large-scale AI conversational datasets into HealthChat-11K and employs a clinician-driven taxonomy for analyzing user interactions with LLMs.

Result: Insights were found into common user interactions, issues like incomplete context, affective behaviors, and leading questions potentially inducing biases such as sycophancy in LLM behavior.

Conclusion: The findings emphasize the need to improve healthcare-related capabilities in conversational AI to better support users and mitigate potential risks.

Abstract: People are increasingly seeking healthcare information from large language
models (LLMs) via interactive chatbots, yet the nature and inherent risks of
these conversations remain largely unexplored. In this paper, we filter
large-scale conversational AI datasets to achieve HealthChat-11K, a curated
dataset of 11K real-world conversations composed of 25K user messages. We use
HealthChat-11K and a clinician-driven taxonomy for how users interact with LLMs
when seeking healthcare information in order to systematically study user
interactions across 21 distinct health specialties. Our analysis reveals
insights into the nature of how and why users seek health information, such as
common interactions, instances of incomplete context, affective behaviors, and
interactions (e.g., leading questions) that can induce sycophancy, underscoring
the need for improvements in the healthcare support capabilities of LLMs
deployed as conversational AI. Code and artifacts to retrieve our analyses and

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces 'Data Efficacy,' a novel paradigm aimed at optimizing the organization of training data to maximize language model (LM) performance without increasing data or model size, through methods like Learnability-Quality Scoring (LQS) and Folding Ordering.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore how optimizing the organization of training data, rather than just reducing its size, can improve LM performance, as this area is currently underexplored compared to data efficiency techniques.

Method: The authors propose DELT, a general paradigm for data efficacy in LM training, which includes three components: Data Scoring, Data Selection, and Data Ordering. They design Learnability-Quality Scoring (LQS) to evaluate data learnability and quality and introduce Folding Ordering (FO) to address issues like model forgetting and data distribution bias.

Result: Comprehensive experiments show that DELT improves LM performance without increasing data scale or model size. LQS and FO, in particular, lead to the most significant gains among all methods tested. Additionally, data efficacy can complement data efficiency through data selection.

Conclusion: Data efficacy, focused on optimizing data organization, is a promising foundational area for enhancing LM training. Techniques like LQS and FO are effective in improving performance, and data efficacy can be achieved alongside data efficiency.

Abstract: Data is fundamental to the training of language models (LM). Recent research
has been dedicated to data efficiency, which aims to maximize performance by
selecting a minimal or optimal subset of training data. Techniques such as data
filtering, sampling, and selection play a crucial role in this area. To
complement it, we define Data Efficacy, which focuses on maximizing performance
by optimizing the organization of training data and remains relatively
underexplored. This work introduces a general paradigm, DELT, for considering
data efficacy in LM training, which highlights the significance of training
data organization. DELT comprises three components: Data Scoring, Data
Selection, and Data Ordering. Among these components, we design
Learnability-Quality Scoring (LQS), as a new instance of Data Scoring, which
considers both the learnability and quality of each data sample from the
gradient consistency perspective. We also devise Folding Ordering (FO), as a
novel instance of Data Ordering, which addresses issues such as model
forgetting and data distribution bias. Comprehensive experiments validate the
data efficacy in LM training, which demonstrates the following: Firstly,
various instances of the proposed DELT enhance LM performance to varying
degrees without increasing the data scale and model size. Secondly, among these
instances, the combination of our proposed LQS for data scoring and Folding for
data ordering achieves the most significant improvement. Lastly, data efficacy
can be achieved together with data efficiency by applying data selection.
Therefore, we believe that data efficacy is a promising foundational area in LM
training.

*Qin Ren,Yifan Wang,Ruogu Fang,Haibin Ling,Chenyu You*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes OTSurv, a novel MIL framework using optimal transport to enhance survival prediction accuracy in WSIs by explicitly addressing pathological heterogeneity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current multiple instance learning methods struggle to effectively capture heterogeneity in whole slide images, which affects survival prediction accuracy.

Method: The authors employ an optimal transport framework with two key constraints: global long-tail and local uncertainty-aware constraints, formulated into an unbalanced OT problem solved via an efficient matrix scaling algorithm.

Result: OTSurv outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving a 3.6% improvement in C-index across six benchmarks while demonstrating statistical significance in log-rank tests and robust interpretability.

Conclusion: The paper delivers OTSurv as a statistically significant and interpretable MIL solution for survival prediction in digital pathology, addressing pathological heterogeneity effectively.

Abstract: Survival prediction using whole slide images (WSIs) can be formulated as a
multiple instance learning (MIL) problem. However, existing MIL methods often
fail to explicitly capture pathological heterogeneity within WSIs, both
globally -- through long-tailed morphological distributions, and locally
through -- tile-level prediction uncertainty. Optimal transport (OT) provides a
principled way of modeling such heterogeneity by incorporating marginal
distribution constraints. Building on this insight, we propose OTSurv, a novel
MIL framework from an optimal transport perspective. Specifically, OTSurv
formulates survival predictions as a heterogeneity-aware OT problem with two
constraints: (1) global long-tail constraint that models prior morphological
distributions to avert both mode collapse and excessive uniformity by
regulating transport mass allocation, and (2) local uncertainty-aware
constraint that prioritizes high-confidence patches while suppressing noise by
progressively raising the total transport mass. We then recast the initial OT
problem, augmented by these constraints, into an unbalanced OT formulation that
can be solved with an efficient, hardware-friendly matrix scaling algorithm.
Empirically, OTSurv sets new state-of-the-art results across six popular
benchmarks, achieving an absolute 3.6% improvement in average C-index. In
addition, OTSurv achieves statistical significance in log-rank tests and offers
high interpretability, making it a powerful tool for survival prediction in
digital pathology. Our codes are available at

Motivation: Video depth estimation methods often follow the image depth estimation paradigm, but this approach fails to account for different temporal consistency needs in static and dynamic regions. Better solutions are needed to handle these specific challenges.

Method: StereoDiff is a two-stage video depth estimation model that uses stereo matching for static areas and video depth diffusion for dynamic areas. The complementary strengths of these methods are analyzed mathematically through frequency domain analysis.

Result: StereoDiff achieves superior performance on zero-shot, real-world dynamic video benchmarks, consistently delivering high accuracy and improved depth transitions for both indoor and outdoor environments.

Conclusion: By leveraging stereo matching and video depth diffusion, StereoDiff successfully addresses unique challenges in video depth estimation and enhances both global consistency and accuracy in dynamic videos.

Abstract: Recent video depth estimation methods achieve great performance by following
the paradigm of image depth estimation, i.e., typically fine-tuning pre-trained
video diffusion models with massive data. However, we argue that video depth
estimation is not a naive extension of image depth estimation. The temporal
consistency requirements for dynamic and static regions in videos are
fundamentally different. Consistent video depth in static regions, typically
backgrounds, can be more effectively achieved via stereo matching across all
frames, which provides much stronger global 3D cues. While the consistency for
dynamic regions still should be learned from large-scale video depth data to
ensure smooth transitions, due to the violation of triangulation constraints.
Based on these insights, we introduce StereoDiff, a two-stage video depth
estimator that synergizes stereo matching for mainly the static areas with
video depth diffusion for maintaining consistent depth transitions in dynamic
areas. We mathematically demonstrate how stereo matching and video depth
diffusion offer complementary strengths through frequency domain analysis,
highlighting the effectiveness of their synergy in capturing the advantages of
both. Experimental results on zero-shot, real-world, dynamic video depth
benchmarks, both indoor and outdoor, demonstrate StereoDiff's SoTA performance,
showcasing its superior consistency and accuracy in video depth estimation.

### [58] [ConViTac: Aligning Visual-Tactile Fusion with Contrastive Representations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20757)
*Zhiyuan Wu,Yongqiang Zhao,Shan Luo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces ConViTac, a network for better aligning visual-tactile features using a contrastive learning approach, achieving significant improvements in downstream tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the poor feature integration resulting from simple fusion methods in visual-tactile representation learning, which limits robot perception and manipulation tasks.

Method: The authors propose ConViTac with a novel Contrastive Embedding Conditioning (CEC) mechanism, leveraging a contrastive encoder for self-supervised learning to unify visual-tactile features using cross-modal attention.

Result: Extensive experiments show ConViTac improves performance significantly, achieving up to a 12% accuracy boost in material classification and grasping prediction tasks compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: ConViTac demonstrates the importance of aligning visual-tactile representations through contrastive embeddings for better task performance, establishing a new benchmark for multimodal robot perception.

Abstract: Vision and touch are two fundamental sensory modalities for robots, offering
complementary information that enhances perception and manipulation tasks.
Previous research has attempted to jointly learn visual-tactile representations
to extract more meaningful information. However, these approaches often rely on
direct combination, such as feature addition and concatenation, for modality
fusion, which tend to result in poor feature integration. In this paper, we
propose ConViTac, a visual-tactile representation learning network designed to
enhance the alignment of features during fusion using contrastive
representations. Our key contribution is a Contrastive Embedding Conditioning
(CEC) mechanism that leverages a contrastive encoder pretrained through
self-supervised contrastive learning to project visual and tactile inputs into
unified latent embeddings. These embeddings are used to couple visual-tactile
feature fusion through cross-modal attention, aiming at aligning the unified
representations and enhancing performance on downstream tasks. We conduct
extensive experiments to demonstrate the superiority of ConViTac in real world
over current state-of-the-art methods and the effectiveness of our proposed CEC
mechanism, which improves accuracy by up to 12.0% in material classification
and grasping prediction tasks.

*Connor Ludwig,Khashayar Namdar,Farzad Khalvati*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The study evaluates five models for medical image segmentation, finding that although some perform well with precise prompts, nnU-Net remains superior due to practical limitations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a lack of comparative evaluations of recent promptable and medical segmentation models on a standardized medical dataset.

Method: The paper assesses the zero-shot performance of five models using varied prompts, tests fine-tuning, and compares results on the BraTS 2023 dataset.

Result: SAM and SAM 2 achieve high Dice scores with precise prompts but nnU-Net outperforms overall due to real-world prompt difficulties.

Conclusion: While fine-tuning shows potential, nnU-Net remains the preferred choice for medical image segmentation in practical scenarios.

Abstract: Medical image segmentation has greatly aided medical diagnosis, with U-Net
based architectures and nnU-Net providing state-of-the-art performance. There
have been numerous general promptable models and medical variations introduced
in recent years, but there is currently a lack of evaluation and comparison of
these models across a variety of prompt qualities on a common medical dataset.
This research uses Segment Anything Model (SAM), Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM
2), MedSAM, SAM-Med-3D, and nnU-Net to obtain zero-shot inference on the BraTS
2023 adult glioma and pediatrics dataset across multiple prompt qualities for
both points and bounding boxes. Several of these models exhibit promising Dice
scores, particularly SAM and SAM 2 achieving scores of up to 0.894 and 0.893,
respectively when given extremely accurate bounding box prompts which exceeds
nnU-Net's segmentation performance. However, nnU-Net remains the dominant
medical image segmentation network due to the impracticality of providing
highly accurate prompts to the models. The model and prompt evaluation, as well
as the comparison, are extended through fine-tuning SAM, SAM 2, MedSAM, and
SAM-Med-3D on the pediatrics dataset. The improvements in point prompt
performance after fine-tuning are substantial and show promise for future
investigation, but are unable to achieve better segmentation than bounding
boxes or nnU-Net.

### [60] [How do Foundation Models Compare to Skeleton-Based Approaches for Gesture Recognition in Human-Robot Interaction?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20795)
*Stephanie Käs,Anton Burenko,Louis Markert,Onur Alp Culha,Dennis Mack,Timm Linder,Bastian Leibe*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper evaluates gesture recognition methods using Vision Foundation Models (VFMs), Vision Language Models (VLMs), and traditional skeleton-based approaches in human-robot communication scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to explore innovative ways to simplify gesture recognition systems in noisy environments by leveraging the generalized capabilities of VFMs and VLMs instead of task-specific architectures.

Method: The study compares V-JEPA (VFM), Gemini Flash 2.0 (VLM), and HD-GCN (skeleton-based) methods for gesture recognition using the NUGGET dataset tailored for intralogistics environments.

Result: HD-GCN outperformed other approaches, but V-JEPA showed near-competitive results with a simple classification head. Gemini struggled in zero-shot gesture differentiation, revealing challenges in textual gesture representation input.

Conclusion: VFMs show promise for reducing module-specific complexity in gesture recognition, although there are limitations with VLMs in processing dynamic gestures.

Abstract: Gestures enable non-verbal human-robot communication, especially in noisy
environments like agile production. Traditional deep learning-based gesture
recognition relies on task-specific architectures using images, videos, or
skeletal pose estimates as input. Meanwhile, Vision Foundation Models (VFMs)
and Vision Language Models (VLMs) with their strong generalization abilities
offer potential to reduce system complexity by replacing dedicated
task-specific modules. This study investigates adapting such models for
dynamic, full-body gesture recognition, comparing V-JEPA (a state-of-the-art
VFM), Gemini Flash 2.0 (a multimodal VLM), and HD-GCN (a top-performing
skeleton-based approach). We introduce NUGGET, a dataset tailored for
human-robot communication in intralogistics environments, to evaluate the
different gesture recognition approaches. In our experiments, HD-GCN achieves
best performance, but V-JEPA comes close with a simple, task-specific
classification head - thus paving a possible way towards reducing system
complexity, by using it as a shared multi-task model. In contrast, Gemini
struggles to differentiate gestures based solely on textual descriptions in the
zero-shot setting, highlighting the need of further research on suitable input
representations for gestures.

### [61] [Leveraging Vision-Language Models to Select Trustworthy Super-Resolution Samples Generated by Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20832)
*Cansu Korkmaz,Ahmet Murat Tekalp,Zafer Dogan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a method to select the most reliable super-resolution (SR) output from diffusion-based models, using vision-language models (VLMs) and a novel Trustworthiness Score (TWS).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Super-resolution (SR) is prone to artifacts and ambiguity, making it unreliable for information-critical tasks. While diffusion models can generate diverse SR outputs, selecting a trustworthy solution remains a challenge.

Method: The authors utilize VLMs (such as BLIP-2 and GPT-4) to evaluate and rank SR outputs based on semantic correctness, visual quality, and artifact presence. The top-ranked candidates are ensembled for a final output. Additionally, a hybrid Trustworthiness Score (TWS) is introduced, combining semantic similarity, structural integrity, and artifact sensitivity.

Result: The proposed method shows strong alignment with human judgments, as TWS correlates well with human preferences. VLM-guided selections also achieved consistently high TWS values.

Conclusion: This framework offers a scalable and accurate means of selecting trustworthy SR outputs, outperforming traditional metrics like PSNR and LPIPS. It sets a new benchmark for aligning SR results with human expectations and needs.

Abstract: Super-resolution (SR) is an ill-posed inverse problem with many feasible
solutions consistent with a given low-resolution image. On one hand, regressive
SR models aim to balance fidelity and perceptual quality to yield a single
solution, but this trade-off often introduces artifacts that create ambiguity
in information-critical applications such as recognizing digits or letters. On
the other hand, diffusion models generate a diverse set of SR images, but
selecting the most trustworthy solution from this set remains a challenge. This
paper introduces a robust, automated framework for identifying the most
trustworthy SR sample from a diffusion-generated set by leveraging the semantic
reasoning capabilities of vision-language models (VLMs). Specifically, VLMs
such as BLIP-2, GPT-4o, and their variants are prompted with structured queries
to assess semantic correctness, visual quality, and artifact presence. The
top-ranked SR candidates are then ensembled to yield a single trustworthy
output in a cost-effective manner. To rigorously assess the validity of
VLM-selected samples, we propose a novel Trustworthiness Score (TWS) a hybrid
metric that quantifies SR reliability based on three complementary components:
semantic similarity via CLIP embeddings, structural integrity using SSIM on
edge maps, and artifact sensitivity through multi-level wavelet decomposition.
We empirically show that TWS correlates strongly with human preference in both
ambiguous and natural images, and that VLM-guided selections consistently yield
high TWS values. Compared to conventional metrics like PSNR, LPIPS, which fail
to reflect information fidelity, our approach offers a principled, scalable,
and generalizable solution for navigating the uncertainty of the diffusion SR
space. By aligning outputs with human expectations and semantic correctness,
this work sets a new benchmark for trustworthiness in generative SR.

### [62] [FixCLR: Negative-Class Contrastive Learning for Semi-Supervised Domain Generalization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20841)
*Ha Min Son,Shahbaz Rezaei,Xin Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces FixCLR, a method to improve semi-supervised domain generalization (SSDG) by explicitly regularizing domain invariance using contrastive learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SSDG faces challenges due to label scarcity and the lack of explicit domain-invariant representation learning.

Method: FixCLR adapts contrastive learning with pseudo-label class information and a repelling term to strengthen domain invariance.

Result: FixCLR enhances SSDG performance and complements existing methods, demonstrated through extensive experiments.

Conclusion: FixCLR is a versatile and effective approach for SSDG, particularly when used alongside other semi-supervised methods.

Abstract: Semi-supervised domain generalization (SSDG) aims to solve the problem of
generalizing to out-of-distribution data when only a few labels are available.
Due to label scarcity, applying domain generalization methods often
underperform. Consequently, existing SSDG methods combine semi-supervised
learning methods with various regularization terms. However, these methods do
not explicitly regularize to learn domains invariant representations across all
domains, which is a key goal for domain generalization. To address this, we
introduce FixCLR. Inspired by success in self-supervised learning, we change
two crucial components to adapt contrastive learning for explicit domain
invariance regularization: utilization of class information from pseudo-labels
and using only a repelling term. FixCLR can also be added on top of most
existing SSDG and semi-supervised methods for complementary performance
improvements. Our research includes extensive experiments that have not been
previously explored in SSDG studies. These experiments include benchmarking
different improvements to semi-supervised methods, evaluating the performance
of pretrained versus non-pretrained models, and testing on datasets with many
domains. Overall, FixCLR proves to be an effective SSDG method, especially when
combined with other semi-supervised methods.

### [63] [Vector Contrastive Learning For Pixel-Wise Pretraining In Medical Vision](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20850)
*Yuting He,Shuo Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces a novel contrastive learning (CL) method called COVER to address the issue of over-dispersion in pixel-wise representation learning, crucial for medical vision, enabling better self-supervised pretraining (SSP) for foundation models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to overcome limitations in standard contrastive learning for pixel-wise representation, which suffers from over-dispersion problems that disrupt intra-class feature distributions, thus hindering its applications in medical visual tasks.

Method: The authors propose a new framework called COVER (Contrast in Vector Regression) that reformulates contrastive learning into a vector regression problem. COVER ensures better pixel-wise feature correlation by incorporating a consistent optimization flow that regresses displacement vectors and uses a vector pyramid architecture for granularity adaptation.

Result: Extensive experiments across 8 tasks in 2D and 4 medical imaging modalities showed that COVER significantly enhances pixel-wise self-supervised pretraining, improving the generalizability of medical visual foundation models.

Conclusion: COVER resolves the over-dispersion issue in pixel-wise CL and sets a new precedent in medical vision SSP by maintaining feature correlations and delivering robust, generalizable results.

Abstract: Contrastive learning (CL) has become a cornerstone of self-supervised
pretraining (SSP) in foundation models, however, extending CL to pixel-wise
representation, crucial for medical vision, remains an open problem. Standard
CL formulates SSP as a binary optimization problem (binary CL) where the
excessive pursuit of feature dispersion leads to an over-dispersion problem,
breaking pixel-wise feature correlation thus disrupting the intra-class
distribution. Our vector CL reformulates CL as a vector regression problem,
enabling dispersion quantification in pixel-wise pretraining via modeling
feature distances in regressing displacement vectors. To implement this novel
paradigm, we propose the COntrast in VEctor Regression (COVER) framework. COVER
establishes an extendable vector-based self-learning, enforces a consistent
optimization flow from vector regression to distance modeling, and leverages a
vector pyramid architecture for granularity adaptation, thus preserving
pixel-wise feature correlations in SSP. Extensive experiments across 8 tasks,
spanning 2 dimensions and 4 modalities, show that COVER significantly improves
pixel-wise SSP, advancing generalizable medical visual foundation models.

*Ryosuke Kawamura,Hideaki Hayashi,Shunsuke Otake,Noriko Takemura,Hajime Nagahara*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MIDAS is a data augmentation method for enhancing dynamic facial expression recognition (DFER) by using soft labels and extending mixup to video data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of recognizing ambiguous facial expressions in practical, in-the-wild scenarios, where current models show limitations.

Method: MIDAS combines pairs of video frames and their soft emotion labels using a convex mixup strategy to augment training data, specifically addressing the ambiguity in expressions.

Result: Experiments show MIDAS improves performance on the DFEW dataset and a new soft-labeled dataset (FERV39k-Plus), surpassing state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: MIDAS provides a simple yet effective strategy for improving DFER accuracy, particularly for ambiguous facial expression data.

Abstract: Dynamic facial expression recognition (DFER) is a task that estimates
emotions from facial expression video sequences. For practical applications,
accurately recognizing ambiguous facial expressions -- frequently encountered
in in-the-wild data -- is essential. In this study, we propose MIDAS, a data
augmentation method designed to enhance DFER performance for ambiguous facial
expression data using soft labels representing probabilities of multiple
emotion classes. MIDAS augments training data by convexly combining pairs of
video frames and their corresponding emotion class labels. This approach
extends mixup to soft-labeled video data, offering a simple yet highly
effective method for handling ambiguity in DFER. To evaluate MIDAS, we
conducted experiments on both the DFEW dataset and FERV39k-Plus, a newly
constructed dataset that assigns soft labels to an existing DFER dataset. The
results demonstrate that models trained with MIDAS-augmented data achieve
superior performance compared to the state-of-the-art method trained on the
original dataset.

### [65] [THIRDEYE: Cue-Aware Monocular Depth Estimation via Brain-Inspired Multi-Stage Fusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20877)
*Calin Teodor Ioan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes ThirdEye, a new framework for monocular depth estimation that explicitly incorporates human-like visual cues using pre-trained networks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Monocular depth estimation often lacks explicit inclusion of cues like occlusion, shading, and perspective, which humans use for depth perception.

Method: ThirdEye fuses depth cues from pre-trained networks in a three-stage hierarchical structure (V1->V2->V3) and uses a key-value working-memory module, followed by an adaptive-bins transformer head for disparity map generation.

Result: Quantitative results will be provided in a later revision, though the paper emphasizes the architectural and neuroscientific contributions of its approach.

Conclusion: Integrating hardcoded human-like visual cues into depth estimation models can improve performance and reduce the need for extensive fine-tuning.

Abstract: Monocular depth estimation methods traditionally train deep models to infer
depth directly from RGB pixels. This implicit learning often overlooks explicit
monocular cues that the human visual system relies on, such as occlusion
boundaries, shading, and perspective. Rather than expecting a network to
discover these cues unaided, we present ThirdEye, a cue-aware pipeline that
deliberately supplies each cue through specialised, pre-trained, and frozen
networks. These cues are fused in a three-stage cortical hierarchy (V1->V2->V3)
equipped with a key-value working-memory module that weights them by
reliability. An adaptive-bins transformer head then produces a high-resolution
disparity map. Because the cue experts are frozen, ThirdEye inherits large
amounts of external supervision while requiring only modest fine-tuning. This
extended version provides additional architectural detail, neuroscientific
motivation, and an expanded experimental protocol; quantitative results will
appear in a future revision.

TL;DR: The paper introduces MultiHuman-Testbench, a novel benchmark and evaluation suite for generating images with multiple humans performing complex actions, incorporating identity preservation and diverse demographics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The lack of a dedicated benchmark to evaluate models for generating images with multiple humans, retaining facial identities, and diverse human representations.

Method: Creation of MultiHuman-Testbench with 1,800 text prompts and 5,550 unique human face images, coupled with a multi-faceted evaluation suite measuring face count, identity similarity, alignment with prompts, and action detection.

Result: Comprehensive evaluation of generative models reveals insights into their performance. Novel techniques involving human segmentation and Hungarian matching show significant improvements in identity similarity.

Conclusion: MultiHuman-Testbench creates a standardized and insightful tool for research in multi-human image generation, advancing the field by providing a rigorous evaluation framework and key findings.

Abstract: Generation of images containing multiple humans, performing complex actions,
while preserving their facial identities, is a significant challenge. A major
factor contributing to this is the lack of a a dedicated benchmark. To address
this, we introduce MultiHuman-Testbench, a novel benchmark for rigorously
evaluating generative models for multi-human generation. The benchmark
comprises 1800 samples, including carefully curated text prompts, describing a
range of simple to complex human actions. These prompts are matched with a
total of 5,550 unique human face images, sampled uniformly to ensure diversity
across age, ethnic background, and gender. Alongside captions, we provide
human-selected pose conditioning images which accurately match the prompt. We
propose a multi-faceted evaluation suite employing four key metrics to quantify
face count, ID similarity, prompt alignment, and action detection. We conduct a
thorough evaluation of a diverse set of models, including zero-shot approaches
and training-based methods, with and without regional priors. We also propose
novel techniques to incorporate image and region isolation using human
segmentation and Hungarian matching, significantly improving ID similarity. Our
proposed benchmark and key findings provide valuable insights and a
standardized tool for advancing research in multi-human image generation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve the accuracy of 3D depth reconstruction by integrating foundational geometric principles with human-inspired perception mechanisms.

Method: Proposing novel geometric constraints, evaluating stereo feature matching with deep learning, and leveraging attention-based mechanisms.

Result: Empirical and theoretical studies show that combining geometric priors with learned features improves stereo vision system performance.

Conclusion: Geometric foundations integrated with learned features and attention mechanisms yield robust stereo vision systems for accurate depth reconstruction.

Abstract: This work investigates the geometric foundations of modern stereo vision
systems, with a focus on how 3D structure and human-inspired perception
contribute to accurate depth reconstruction. We revisit the Cyclopean Eye model
and propose novel geometric constraints that account for occlusions and depth
discontinuities. Our analysis includes the evaluation of stereo feature
matching quality derived from deep learning models, as well as the role of
attention mechanisms in recovering meaningful 3D surfaces. Through both
theoretical insights and empirical studies on real datasets, we demonstrate
that combining strong geometric priors with learned features provides internal
abstractions for understanding stereo vision systems.

*Advait Gupta,Rishie Raj,Dang Nguyen,Tianyi Zhou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces FaSTA$^*$, a computationally efficient neurosymbolic agent for multi-turn image editing tasks, leveraging large language models (LLMs) for high-level subtask planning and symbolic subroutine reuse.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Efficiently solve complex, multi-turn image editing tasks by combining fast LLMs and accurate but slower A$^*$ search to reduce computation cost while maintaining task success.

Method: The proposed methodology involves a hybrid approach of fast high-level LLM subtask planning complemented by slow and precise A$^*$ search. Inductive reasoning is used to extract and refine reusable subroutine tools for adaptive planning.

Result: FaSTA$^*$ achieves improved computational efficiency compared to traditional methods while maintaining a comparable success rate in complex image editing tasks.

Conclusion: FaSTA$^*$ demonstrates an effective balance of cost-saving and task success by intelligently combining neurosymbolic reasoning and adaptability, providing a human-like toolpath optimization strategy for image editing tasks.

Abstract: We develop a cost-efficient neurosymbolic agent to address challenging
multi-turn image editing tasks such as "Detect the bench in the image while
recoloring it to pink. Also, remove the cat for a clearer view and recolor the
wall to yellow.'' It combines the fast, high-level subtask planning by large
language models (LLMs) with the slow, accurate, tool-use, and local A$^*$
search per subtask to find a cost-efficient toolpath -- a sequence of calls to
AI tools. To save the cost of A$^*$ on similar subtasks, we perform inductive
reasoning on previously successful toolpaths via LLMs to continuously
extract/refine frequently used subroutines and reuse them as new tools for
future tasks in an adaptive fast-slow planning, where the higher-level
subroutines are explored first, and only when they fail, the low-level A$^*$
search is activated. The reusable symbolic subroutines considerably save
exploration cost on the same types of subtasks applied to similar images,
yielding a human-like fast-slow toolpath agent "FaSTA$^*$'': fast subtask
planning followed by rule-based subroutine selection per subtask is attempted
by LLMs at first, which is expected to cover most tasks, while slow A$^*$
search is only triggered for novel and challenging subtasks. By comparing with
recent image editing approaches, we demonstrate FaSTA$^*$ is significantly more
computationally efficient while remaining competitive with the state-of-the-art
baseline in terms of success rate.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: M2SFormer is a Transformer-based approach that improves subtle and complex image forgery detection, outperforming previous models on diverse datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Image editing progress has led to both creative uses and malicious manipulations, requiring better methods for detecting such forgeries.

Method: The authors propose M2SFormer, combining multi-frequency and multi-scale attentions with a difficulty-guided attention module for enhanced detail retention.

Result: M2SFormer achieves superior performance in detecting and localizing forgeries across multiple benchmark datasets compared to prior methods.

Conclusion: M2SFormer offers a robust solution for visual forgery detection, emphasizing generalization and precision in challenging scenarios.

Abstract: Image editing techniques have rapidly advanced, facilitating both innovative
use cases and malicious manipulation of digital images. Deep learning-based
methods have recently achieved high accuracy in pixel-level forgery
localization, yet they frequently struggle with computational overhead and
limited representation power, particularly for subtle or complex tampering. In
this paper, we propose M2SFormer, a novel Transformer encoder-based framework
designed to overcome these challenges. Unlike approaches that process spatial
and frequency cues separately, M2SFormer unifies multi-frequency and
multi-scale attentions in the skip connection, harnessing global context to
better capture diverse forgery artifacts. Additionally, our framework addresses
the loss of fine detail during upsampling by utilizing a global prior map, a
curvature metric indicating the difficulty of forgery localization, which then
guides a difficulty-guided attention module to preserve subtle manipulations
more effectively. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets
demonstrate that M2SFormer outperforms existing state-of-the-art models,
offering superior generalization in detecting and localizing forgeries across
unseen domains.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces PhysRig, a differentiable physics-based framework for skinning and rigging that overcomes limitations of Linear Blend Skinning (LBS) by embedding a skeleton into a volumetric soft-body structure.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Linear Blend Skinning (LBS) approaches struggle with artifacts like volume loss and cannot model elastic materials or flexible soft-body structures accurately.

Method: The proposed framework, PhysRig, leverages continuum mechanics, embedding the skeleton in a volumetric representation simulated as a deformable soft body, and employs material prototypes for reduced learning space and differentiability.

Result: PhysRig consistently outperforms traditional LBS-based methods in terms of realism and physical plausibility, demonstrated across a diverse synthetic dataset.

Conclusion: PhysRig effectively addresses the limitations of LBS, showcasing its flexibility and improved performance in tasks such as pose transfer and articulated object modeling.

Abstract: Skinning and rigging are fundamental components in animation, articulated
object reconstruction, motion transfer, and 4D generation. Existing approaches
predominantly rely on Linear Blend Skinning (LBS), due to its simplicity and
differentiability. However, LBS introduces artifacts such as volume loss and
unnatural deformations, and it fails to model elastic materials like soft
tissues, fur, and flexible appendages (e.g., elephant trunks, ears, and fatty
tissues). In this work, we propose PhysRig: a differentiable physics-based
skinning and rigging framework that overcomes these limitations by embedding
the rigid skeleton into a volumetric representation (e.g., a tetrahedral mesh),
which is simulated as a deformable soft-body structure driven by the animated
skeleton. Our method leverages continuum mechanics and discretizes the object
as particles embedded in an Eulerian background grid to ensure
differentiability with respect to both material properties and skeletal motion.
Additionally, we introduce material prototypes, significantly reducing the
learning space while maintaining high expressiveness. To evaluate our
framework, we construct a comprehensive synthetic dataset using meshes from
Objaverse, The Amazing Animals Zoo, and MixaMo, covering diverse object
categories and motion patterns. Our method consistently outperforms traditional
LBS-based approaches, generating more realistic and physically plausible
results. Furthermore, we demonstrate the applicability of our framework in the
pose transfer task highlighting its versatility for articulated object
modeling.

Motivation: To address the absence of publicly available, large, and diverse datasets tagged with relevant visibility estimates for aviation use.

Method: Collected images over a year using the FAA weather camera network to create a new dataset and applied multiple machine learning benchmarks on this and other public datasets.

Result: Provided a benchmark comparison using three common approaches and a baseline measured against an ASTM visibility standard.

Conclusion: The paper contributes a new aviation visibility dataset and evaluates machine learning methods, aiding the quest for cost-efficient weather solutions.

Abstract: Machine Learning for aviation weather is a growing area of research for
providing low-cost alternatives for traditional, expensive weather sensors;
however, in the area of atmospheric visibility estimation, publicly available

of diverse locations, of sufficient size for use in supervised learning, are

a year-long data collection campaign of images from the FAA weather camera

Motivation: The lack of large datasets and precise annotations has limited CSLR progress, necessitating better utilization of gloss knowledge and improved alignment of visual and textual modalities.

Method: The authors propose the Hierarchical Sub-action Tree (HST) powered by gloss knowledge from large language models. The technique uses tree structures to align visual and textual data step-by-step, enhancing modality connections with a contrastive alignment approach.

Result: Experiments on four datasets, including PHOENIX-2014 and CSL-Daily, confirm the effectiveness of HST-CSLR in improving recognition tasks.

Conclusion: HST-CSLR successfully integrates gloss-specific textual and visual data, achieving better CSLR performance and reducing computational complexity.

Abstract: Continuous sign language recognition (CSLR) aims to transcribe untrimmed
videos into glosses, which are typically textual words. Recent studies indicate
that the lack of large datasets and precise annotations has become a bottleneck
for CSLR due to insufficient training data. To address this, some works have
developed cross-modal solutions to align visual and textual modalities.
However, they typically extract textual features from glosses without fully
utilizing their knowledge. In this paper, we propose the Hierarchical
Sub-action Tree (HST), termed HST-CSLR, to efficiently combine gloss knowledge
with visual representation learning. By incorporating gloss-specific knowledge
from large language models, our approach leverages textual information more
effectively. Specifically, we construct an HST for textual information
representation, aligning visual and textual modalities step-by-step and
benefiting from the tree structure to reduce computational complexity.
Additionally, we impose a contrastive alignment enhancement to bridge the gap
between the two modalities. Experiments on four datasets (PHOENIX-2014,
PHOENIX-2014T, CSL-Daily, and Sign Language Gesture) demonstrate the
effectiveness of our HST-CSLR.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current computational pathology models inadequately integrate language and text-based context, and existing multimodal models lack sufficient data and diagnostic reasoning capabilities.

Method: The study introduces PathChat+, an MLLM trained on over 1 million pathology-specific instructions and 5.5 million question-answer pairs. Additionally, SlideSeek, a multi-agent AI system enabled by PathChat+, autonomously evaluates gigapixel images using iterative diagnostic reasoning.

Result: PathChat+ surpasses previous pathology-specific and general-purpose models in various benchmarks. SlideSeek achieves high diagnostic accuracy on DDxBench and generates interpretable visual reports.

Conclusion: PathChat+ and SlideSeek mark significant advancements in computational pathology by addressing multimodal integration, diagnostic reasoning, and performance limitations of previous models.

Abstract: Pathology is experiencing rapid digital transformation driven by whole-slide
imaging and artificial intelligence (AI). While deep learning-based
computational pathology has achieved notable success, traditional models
primarily focus on image analysis without integrating natural language
instruction or rich, text-based context. Current multimodal large language
models (MLLMs) in computational pathology face limitations, including
insufficient training data, inadequate support and evaluation for multi-image
understanding, and a lack of autonomous, diagnostic reasoning capabilities. To
address these limitations, we introduce PathChat+, a new MLLM specifically
designed for human pathology, trained on over 1 million diverse,
pathology-specific instruction samples and nearly 5.5 million question answer
turns. Extensive evaluations across diverse pathology benchmarks demonstrated
that PathChat+ substantially outperforms the prior PathChat copilot, as well as
both state-of-the-art (SOTA) general-purpose and other pathology-specific
models. Furthermore, we present SlideSeek, a reasoning-enabled multi-agent AI
system leveraging PathChat+ to autonomously evaluate gigapixel whole-slide

TL;DR: DFVEdit introduces an efficient zero-shot video editing approach for Video Diffusion Transformers (Video DiTs), significantly reducing computational requirements while maintaining high-quality editing results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing video editing methods for Video DiTs are computationally expensive, requiring heavy resources for attention modification or fine-tuning.

Method: DFVEdit employs flow transformation to directly operate on clean latents. It introduces Conditional Delta Flow Vector (CDFV), Implicit Cross Attention (ICA) guidance, and Embedding Reinforcement (ER) to ensure efficient and high-quality video editing.

Result: DFVEdit achieves at least 20x faster inference speed and 85% memory savings compared to attention-engineering-based methods, while maintaining state-of-the-art performance on structural fidelity, spatial-temporal consistency, and editing quality.

Conclusion: DFVEdit proves to be a practical and efficient solution for zero-shot video editing on Video DiTs, compatible with popular platforms and delivering superior video editing results without heavy computational overhead.

Abstract: The advent of Video Diffusion Transformers (Video DiTs) marks a milestone in
video generation. However, directly applying existing video editing methods to
Video DiTs often incurs substantial computational overhead, due to
resource-intensive attention modification or finetuning. To alleviate this
problem, we present DFVEdit, an efficient zero-shot video editing method
tailored for Video DiTs. DFVEdit eliminates the need for both attention
modification and fine-tuning by directly operating on clean latents via flow
transformation. To be more specific, we observe that editing and sampling can
be unified under the continuous flow perspective. Building upon this
foundation, we propose the Conditional Delta Flow Vector (CDFV) -- a
theoretically unbiased estimation of DFV -- and integrate Implicit Cross
Attention (ICA) guidance as well as Embedding Reinforcement (ER) to further
enhance editing quality. DFVEdit excels in practical efficiency, offering at
least 20x inference speed-up and 85\% memory reduction on Video DiTs compared
to attention-engineering-based editing methods. Extensive quantitative and
qualitative experiments demonstrate that DFVEdit can be seamlessly applied to
popular Video DiTs (e.g., CogVideoX and Wan2.1), attaining state-of-the-art
performance on structural fidelity, spatial-temporal consistency, and editing
quality.

*Tao Liu,Dafeng Zhang,Gengchen Li,Shizhuo Liu,Yongqi Song,Senmao Li,Shiqi Yang,Boqian Li,Kai Wang,Yaxing Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Cradle2Cane, a two-pass face aging framework based on text-to-image diffusion models, focusing on both age accuracy and identity preservation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current face aging techniques struggle with achieving realistic transformations across various ages while preserving identity, an Age-ID trade-off challenge.

Method: Cradle2Cane employs a two-step approach with adaptive noise injection for age adjustments and identity-aware embeddings for enhancing identity preservation, trained jointly.

Result: Experiments on CelebA-HQ dataset demonstrate superior performance in age accuracy and identity consistency compared to previous methods.

Conclusion: Cradle2Cane successfully balances age accuracy and identity preservation, addressing key challenges in face aging tasks.

Abstract: Face aging has become a crucial task in computer vision, with applications
ranging from entertainment to healthcare. However, existing methods struggle
with achieving a realistic and seamless transformation across the entire
lifespan, especially when handling large age gaps or extreme head poses. The
core challenge lies in balancing age accuracy and identity preservation--what
we refer to as the Age-ID trade-off. Most prior methods either prioritize age
transformation at the expense of identity consistency or vice versa. In this
work, we address this issue by proposing a two-pass face aging framework, named
Cradle2Cane, based on few-step text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models. The first
pass focuses on solving age accuracy by introducing an adaptive noise injection
(AdaNI) mechanism. This mechanism is guided by including prompt descriptions of
age and gender for the given person as the textual condition. Also, by
adjusting the noise level, we can control the strength of aging while allowing
more flexibility in transforming the face. However, identity preservation is
weakly ensured here to facilitate stronger age transformations. In the second
pass, we enhance identity preservation while maintaining age-specific features
by conditioning the model on two identity-aware embeddings (IDEmb): SVR-ArcFace
and Rotate-CLIP. This pass allows for denoising the transformed image from the
first pass, ensuring stronger identity preservation without compromising the
aging accuracy. Both passes are jointly trained in an end-to-end way. Extensive
experiments on the CelebA-HQ test dataset, evaluated through Face++ and Qwen-VL
protocols, show that our Cradle2Cane outperforms existing face aging methods in
age accuracy and identity consistency.

*Weichen Dai,Kangcheng Ma,Jiaxin Wang,Kecen Pan,Yuhang Ming,Hua Zhang,Wanzeng Kong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper presents a method for high-quality 3D scene representation from images by jointly optimizing camera photometric parameters and scene radiance fields.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address the issue of photometric distortions in camera imaging, which introduces inaccuracies in 3D scene representation.

Method: They propose a full photometric model combined with depth regularization to optimize camera imaging parameters and separate scene-unrelated information.

Result: Experimental evidence shows the proposed method successfully enhances 3D scene representations, particularly under distorted conditions like vignetting or dirt on camera lenses.

Conclusion: Jointly optimizing scene and camera parameters creates robust and accurate 3D scene representations, eliminating image distortions for improved mapping.

Abstract: Representing scenes from multi-view images is a crucial task in computer
vision with extensive applications. However, inherent photometric distortions
in the camera imaging can significantly degrade image quality. Without
accounting for these distortions, the 3D scene representation may inadvertently
incorporate erroneous information unrelated to the scene, diminishing the
quality of the representation. In this paper, we propose a novel 3D
scene-camera representation with joint camera photometric optimization. By
introducing internal and external photometric model, we propose a full
photometric model and corresponding camera representation. Based on
simultaneously optimizing the parameters of the camera representation, the
proposed method effectively separates scene-unrelated information from the 3D
scene representation. Additionally, during the optimization of the photometric
parameters, we introduce a depth regularization to prevent the 3D scene
representation from fitting scene-unrelated information. By incorporating the
camera model as part of the mapping process, the proposed method constructs a
complete map that includes both the scene radiance field and the camera
photometric model. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method
can achieve high-quality 3D scene representations, even under conditions of
imaging degradation, such as vignetting and dirt.

TL;DR: The paper presents a novel Graph-oriented Inverse Reinforcement Learning (GoIRL) framework for trajectory prediction in autonomous driving, achieving state-of-the-art performance on benchmarks and superior generalization compared to supervised models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Trajectory prediction in autonomous driving is challenging due to uncertainty and multimodality. Current data-driven methods are mainly supervised learning-based, necessitating a more robust approach.

Method: The authors propose a Graph-oriented IRL framework leveraging vectorized context representations, lane-graph feature aggregation, and maximum entropy IRL. They also introduce a hierarchical trajectory generator with refinement and probability fusion strategies.

Result: The GoIRL framework achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on Argoverse and nuScenes benchmarks and demonstrates better generalization compared to supervised-learning methods.

Conclusion: The proposed GoIRL framework effectively addresses challenges in trajectory prediction by integrating IRL and advanced representation strategies, setting a new benchmark in the field.

Abstract: Trajectory prediction for surrounding agents is a challenging task in
autonomous driving due to its inherent uncertainty and underlying
multimodality. Unlike prevailing data-driven methods that primarily rely on
supervised learning, in this paper, we introduce a novel Graph-oriented Inverse
Reinforcement Learning (GoIRL) framework, which is an IRL-based predictor
equipped with vectorized context representations. We develop a feature adaptor
to effectively aggregate lane-graph features into grid space, enabling seamless
integration with the maximum entropy IRL paradigm to infer the reward
distribution and obtain the policy that can be sampled to induce multiple
plausible plans. Furthermore, conditioned on the sampled plans, we implement a
hierarchical parameterized trajectory generator with a refinement module to
enhance prediction accuracy and a probability fusion strategy to boost
prediction confidence. Extensive experimental results showcase our approach not
only achieves state-of-the-art performance on the large-scale Argoverse &
nuScenes motion forecasting benchmarks but also exhibits superior
generalization abilities compared to existing supervised models.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper revisits sparse pose signals like OpenPose for text-to-image generation, introducing SP-Ctrl to enhance pose controllability and alignment, achieving comparable results to dense signal methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Dense signals for pose guidance face challenges such as editing difficulties and inconsistencies with text prompts. The paper explores sparse signals due to their simplicity and underutilized potential.

Method: The authors propose SP-Ctrl, which extends sparse OpenPose signals into learnable spatial representations with discriminative embeddings and keypoint concept learning to boost spatial alignment.

Result: Through experiments on human and animal image generation, SP-Ctrl surpasses recent spatial text-to-image generation methods using sparse-pose guidance, achieving similar outcomes to dense methods.

Conclusion: SP-Ctrl demonstrates robust control for pose-guided image generation using sparse signals, with applications across species and promises in diverse generation scenarios.

Abstract: Recent works favored dense signals (e.g., depth, DensePose), as an
alternative to sparse signals (e.g., OpenPose), to provide detailed spatial
guidance for pose-guided text-to-image generation. However, dense
representations raised new challenges, including editing difficulties and
potential inconsistencies with textual prompts. This fact motivates us to
revisit sparse signals for pose guidance, owing to their simplicity and
shape-agnostic nature, which remains underexplored. This paper proposes a novel
Spatial-Pose ControlNet(SP-Ctrl), equipping sparse signals with robust
controllability for pose-guided image generation. Specifically, we extend
OpenPose to a learnable spatial representation, making keypoint embeddings
discriminative and expressive. Additionally, we introduce keypoint concept
learning, which encourages keypoint tokens to attend to the spatial positions
of each keypoint, thus improving pose alignment. Experiments on animal- and
human-centric image generation tasks demonstrate that our method outperforms
recent spatially controllable T2I generation approaches under sparse-pose
guidance and even matches the performance of dense signal-based methods.
Moreover, SP-Ctrl shows promising capabilities in diverse and cross-species
generation through sparse signals. Codes will be available at

TL;DR: The paper presents a 3D semantic occupancy prediction framework integrated with out-of-distribution (OoD) detection, leveraging synthetic anomalies for training and introducing novel datasets and methodologies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for semantic occupancy prediction focus on in-distribution scenes, which leaves them vulnerable to undetected anomalies and misinterpretations due to OoD objects and long-tail distributions, posing safety risks.

Method: The authors developed a Synthetic Anomaly Integration Pipeline for generating datasets with realistic spatial and occlusion patterns and introduced a framework, OccOoD, with Voxel-BEV Progressive Fusion (VBPF). VBPF employs an RWKV-based branch for geometry-semantic fusion to enhance OoD detection.

Conclusion: The proposed methods provide advancements in detecting OoD anomalies in 3D voxel space, improving safety for autonomous driving, and offering publicly available datasets and code for future research.

Abstract: 3D Semantic Occupancy Prediction is crucial for autonomous driving, providing
a dense, semantically rich environmental representation. However, existing
methods focus on in-distribution scenes, making them susceptible to
Out-of-Distribution (OoD) objects and long-tail distributions, which increases
the risk of undetected anomalies and misinterpretations, posing safety hazards.
To address these challenges, we introduce Out-of-Distribution Semantic
Occupancy Prediction, targeting OoD detection in 3D voxel space. To fill the
gaps in the dataset, we propose a Synthetic Anomaly Integration Pipeline that
injects synthetic anomalies while preserving realistic spatial and occlusion
patterns, enabling the creation of two datasets: VAA-KITTI and VAA-KITTI-360.
We introduce OccOoD, a novel framework integrating OoD detection into 3D

*Xiao Zhang,Yongqiang Ma,Haodong Jing,Nanning Zheng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces EVA, a framework that improves recognition of unseen compositional object-state pairs using token-aware and semantic alignment techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing CZSL methods lack fine-grained alignment and suboptimal representation of primitive concepts, limiting generalization to unknown pairs.

Method: Developed EVA using Mixture-of-Experts for domain-specific token-aware learning and semantic variant alignment for accurate image-to-primitive mapping.

Result: EVA outperformed other state-of-the-art CZSL methods in benchmarks across both closed- and open-world settings.

Conclusion: The proposed EVA framework demonstrates significant improvement in compositional generalization for CZSL tasks.

Abstract: Compositional Zero-Shot Learning (CZSL) investigates compositional
generalization capacity to recognize unknown state-object pairs based on
learned primitive concepts. Existing CZSL methods typically derive primitives
features through a simple composition-prototype mapping, which is suboptimal
for a set of individuals that can be divided into distinct semantic subsets.
Moreover, the all-to-one cross-modal primitives matching neglects compositional
divergence within identical states or objects, limiting fine-grained
image-composition alignment. In this study, we propose EVA, a
Mixture-of-Experts Semantic Variant Alignment framework for CZSL. Specifically,
we introduce domain-expert adaption, leveraging multiple experts to achieve
token-aware learning and model high-quality primitive representations. To
enable accurate compositional generalization, we further present semantic
variant alignment to select semantically relevant representation for
image-primitives matching. Our method significantly outperforms other
state-of-the-art CZSL methods on three popular benchmarks in both closed- and
open-world settings, demonstrating the efficacy of the proposed insight.

TL;DR: This paper introduces Source-Free Occlusion-Aware Seamless Segmentation (SFOASS) and a novel approach called UNLOCK to process panoramic images without requiring labeled source data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Panoramic image processing is crucial for 360-degree perception but is challenged by distortions, perspective occlusions, and the lack of annotations. Additionally, current methods rely on labeled source data, which limits flexibility.

Method: The authors propose "UNLOCK," a framework that includes Omni Pseudo-Labeling Learning and Amodal-Driven Context Learning. UNLOCK allows segmentation in panoramic contexts without requiring source data or labeled target data.

Result: UNLOCK achieves performance comparable to source-dependent methods, with significant improvements in metrics like mAAP, mAP, and mAPQ, and sets new benchmarks for the SFOASS task in real-to-real and synthetic-to-real adaptation scenarios.

Conclusion: The proposed approach demonstrates the feasibility of source-free panoramic segmentation, offering a practical alternative to source-dependent methods. It establishes a new benchmark while advancing the field toward more autonomous and flexible applications.

Abstract: Panoramic image processing is essential for omni-context perception, yet
faces constraints like distortions, perspective occlusions, and limited
annotations. Previous unsupervised domain adaptation methods transfer knowledge
from labeled pinhole data to unlabeled panoramic images, but they require
access to source pinhole data. To address these, we introduce a more practical
task, i.e., Source-Free Occlusion-Aware Seamless Segmentation (SFOASS), and
propose its first solution, called UNconstrained Learning Omni-Context
Knowledge (UNLOCK). Specifically, UNLOCK includes two key modules: Omni
Pseudo-Labeling Learning and Amodal-Driven Context Learning. While adapting
without relying on source data or target labels, this framework enhances models
to achieve segmentation with 360{\deg} viewpoint coverage and occlusion-aware
reasoning. Furthermore, we benchmark the proposed SFOASS task through both
real-to-real and synthetic-to-real adaptation settings. Experimental results
show that our source-free method achieves performance comparable to
source-dependent methods, yielding state-of-the-art scores of 10.9 in mAAP and
11.6 in mAP, along with an absolute improvement of +4.3 in mAPQ over the
source-only method. All data and code will be made publicly available at

Abstract: Pathology image segmentation is crucial in computational pathology for
analyzing histological features relevant to cancer diagnosis and prognosis.
However, current methods face major challenges in clinical applications due to
limited annotated data and restricted category definitions. To address these
limitations, we propose PathSegmentor, the first text-prompted segmentation
foundation model designed specifically for pathology images. We also introduce
PathSeg , the largest and most comprehensive dataset for pathology
segmentation, built from 17 public sources and containing 275k image-mask-label
triples across 160 diverse categories. With PathSegmentor, users can perform
semantic segmentation using natural language prompts, eliminating the need for
laborious spatial inputs such as points or boxes. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that PathSegmentor outperforms specialized models with higher
accuracy and broader applicability, while maintaining a compact architecture.
It significantly surpasses existing spatial- and text-prompted models by 0.145

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods struggle with point-level segmentation tasks in 3D vision-language models due to the lack of direct 3D-text alignment, which is essential for linking local 3D features with textual context.

Method: The authors propose TSDASeg, a two-stage model featuring a direct cross-modal alignment module for explicit alignment among 3D, text, and 2D image data, and memory modules for storing and dynamically leveraging cross-modal features using self-attention and cross-attention mechanisms.

Result: TSDASeg achieves state-of-the-art performance on several 3D segmentation datasets, including tasks like instruction, reference, and semantic segmentation.

Conclusion: The proposed model effectively addresses limitations in current interactive point cloud segmentation by utilizing alignment and memory mechanisms, enhancing segmentation results across various scenarios.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of 3D vision-language models (VLMs) has spurred
significant interest in interactive point cloud processing tasks, particularly
for real-world applications. However, existing methods often underperform in
point-level tasks, such as segmentation, due to missing direct 3D-text
alignment, limiting their ability to link local 3D features with textual
context. To solve this problem, we propose TSDASeg, a Two-Stage model coupled
with a Direct cross-modal Alignment module and memory module for interactive
point cloud Segmentation. We introduce the direct cross-modal alignment module
to establish explicit alignment between 3D point clouds and textual/2D image
data. Within the memory module, we employ multiple dedicated memory banks to
separately store text features, visual features, and their cross-modal
correspondence mappings. These memory banks are dynamically leveraged through
self-attention and cross-attention mechanisms to update scene-specific features
based on prior stored data, effectively addressing inconsistencies in
interactive segmentation results across diverse scenarios. Experiments
conducted on multiple 3D instruction, reference, and semantic segmentation
datasets demonstrate that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art
performance.

Conclusion: The approach is effective in generating distinct, high-quality audio tracks from video, showcasing improvements over earlier methods.

Abstract: We propose a novel step-by-step video-to-audio generation method that
sequentially produces individual audio tracks, each corresponding to a specific
sound event in the video. Our approach mirrors traditional Foley workflows,
aiming to capture all sound events induced by a given video comprehensively.
Each generation step is formulated as a guided video-to-audio synthesis task,
conditioned on a target text prompt and previously generated audio tracks. This
design is inspired by the idea of concept negation from prior compositional
generation frameworks. To enable this guided generation, we introduce a
training framework that leverages pre-trained video-to-audio models and
eliminates the need for specialized paired datasets, allowing training on more
accessible data. Experimental results demonstrate that our method generates
multiple semantically distinct audio tracks for a single input video, leading
to higher-quality composite audio synthesis than existing baselines.

*Yeon-Ji Song,Jaein Kim,Byung-Ju Kim,Byoung-Tak Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a method called DBMovi-GS to synthesize novel views of dynamic scenes from blurry monocular videos effectively.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the limitations of existing methods that struggle with dynamic scenes and blurry videos, and lack robustness in complex real-world environments.

Method: They introduce DBMovi-GS, a method that uses sparse-controlled Gaussian splatting to generate dense 3D geometry and restore sharpness in dynamic, blurry conditions.

Result: DBMovi-GS demonstrates robust performance for novel view synthesis in dynamic blurry scenes and establishes a new benchmark for realistic scene generation.

Conclusion: The proposed approach successfully synthesizes stable and high-fidelity novel views, addressing previous challenges in dynamic and blurry environments.

Abstract: Novel view synthesis is a task of generating scenes from unseen perspectives;
however, synthesizing dynamic scenes from blurry monocular videos remains an
unresolved challenge that has yet to be effectively addressed. Existing novel
view synthesis methods are often constrained by their reliance on
high-resolution images or strong assumptions about static geometry and rigid
scene priors. Consequently, their approaches lack robustness in real-world
environments with dynamic object and camera motion, leading to instability and
degraded visual fidelity. To address this, we propose Motion-aware Dynamic View
Synthesis from Blurry Monocular Video via Sparse-Controlled Gaussian Splatting
(DBMovi-GS), a method designed for dynamic view synthesis from blurry monocular
videos. Our model generates dense 3D Gaussians, restoring sharpness from blurry
videos and reconstructing detailed 3D geometry of the scene affected by dynamic
motion variations. Our model achieves robust performance in novel view
synthesis under dynamic blurry scenes and sets a new benchmark in realistic
novel view synthesis for blurry monocular video inputs.

*Behrooz Nasihatkon,Hossein Resani,Amirreza Mehrzadian*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper presents ToosiCubix, a cost-effective method for annotating 3D vehicle cuboids using only monocular images and intrinsic camera parameters, eliminating the need for specialized equipment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitation of current 3D cuboid annotation methods that require expensive and complex setups, making large-scale data collection challenging and inaccessible.

Method: ToosiCubix employs approximately 10 user clicks per vehicle to label specific features, solving geometric constraints via an optimization problem using a coordinate descent strategy that alternates between Perspective-n-Points (PnP) and least-squares subproblems, while incorporating probabilistic size priors to handle ambiguities.

Result: The method accurately annotates vehicle pose, orientation, and dimensions with an 8/9 DoF framework, validated on the KITTI and Cityscapes3D datasets, showcasing scalability and cost-effectiveness.

Conclusion: ToosiCubix offers a practical and high-quality alternative to expensive setups for 3D cuboid annotation, enhancing accessibility for large-scale dataset annotations.

Abstract: Many existing methods for 3D cuboid annotation of vehicles rely on expensive
and carefully calibrated camera-LiDAR or stereo setups, limiting their
accessibility for large-scale data collection. We introduce ToosiCubix, a
simple yet powerful approach for annotating ground-truth cuboids using only
monocular images and intrinsic camera parameters. Our method requires only
about 10 user clicks per vehicle, making it highly practical for adding 3D
annotations to existing datasets originally collected without specialized
equipment. By annotating specific features (e.g., wheels, car badge,
symmetries) across different vehicle parts, we accurately estimate each
vehicle's position, orientation, and dimensions up to a scale ambiguity (8
DoF). The geometric constraints are formulated as an optimization problem,
which we solve using a coordinate descent strategy, alternating between
Perspective-n-Points (PnP) and least-squares subproblems. To handle common
ambiguities such as scale and unobserved dimensions, we incorporate
probabilistic size priors, enabling 9 DoF cuboid placements. We validate our
annotations against the KITTI and Cityscapes3D datasets, demonstrating that our
method offers a cost-effective and scalable solution for high-quality 3D cuboid
annotation.

*Qiuyi Qi,Xin Li,Ming Kong,Zikang Xu,Bingdi Chen,Qiang Zhu,S Kevin Zhou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces the SAIC method to generate high-quality, robust pathological images for better abnormal cell detection in cytopathology.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Training neural networks for abnormal cell detection faces challenges such as lack of annotations, long-tailed data, and varied staining styles.

Method: The SAIC method uses attribute-guided selection, high-frequency feature reconstruction, and large vision-language models to compose style-aligned pathological images.

Result: Experiments show SAIC-synthesized images enhance detection robustness, particularly for rare cell types and inconsistent styles.

Conclusion: SAIC improves abnormal cell detection and demonstrates generalizability for clinical applications. Code is publicly available.

Abstract: Challenges such as the lack of high-quality annotations, long-tailed data
distributions, and inconsistent staining styles pose significant obstacles to
training neural networks to detect abnormal cells in cytopathology robustly.
This paper proposes a style-aligned image composition (SAIC) method that
composes high-fidelity and style-preserved pathological images to enhance the
effectiveness and robustness of detection models. Without additional training,
SAIC first selects an appropriate candidate from the abnormal cell bank based
on attribute guidance. Then, it employs a high-frequency feature reconstruction
to achieve a style-aligned and high-fidelity composition of abnormal cells and
pathological backgrounds. Finally, it introduces a large vision-language model
to filter high-quality synthesis images. Experimental results demonstrate that
incorporating SAIC-synthesized images effectively enhances the performance and
robustness of abnormal cell detection for tail categories and styles, thereby
improving overall detection performance. The comprehensive quality evaluation
further confirms the generalizability and practicality of SAIC in clinical
application scenarios. Our code will be released at

*Taoyu Wu,Yiyi Miao,Zhuoxiao Li,Haocheng Zhao,Kang Dang,Jionglong Su,Limin Yu,Haoang Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper addresses challenges in surgical 3D reconstruction and visualization by enhancing Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) methods using optical flow loss, depth regularization, and improved 3D Gaussian Splatting refinement strategies, achieving superior performance in dynamic and static scenes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to tackle challenges in surgical environments for 3D reconstruction and visualization, such as photometric inconsistencies and dynamic motion, which affect SLAM systems' performance.

Method: The proposed method introduces optical flow loss as a geometric constraint, depth regularization to manage photometric inconsistencies, and refined 3D Gaussian Splatting approaches for better rendering quality, focusing on keyframes with suboptimal results.

Result: Experiments conducted on the C3VD static dataset and the StereoMIS dynamic dataset revealed that the proposed techniques outperform existing methods in view synthesis and pose estimation under surgical scenarios.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that the improved SLAM system delivers high-quality 3D reconstruction and visualization in both static and dynamic scenes, with source code set for public release upon paper acceptance.

Abstract: Efficient three-dimensional reconstruction and real-time visualization are
critical in surgical scenarios such as endoscopy. In recent years, 3D Gaussian
Splatting (3DGS) has demonstrated remarkable performance in efficient 3D
reconstruction and rendering. Most 3DGS-based Simultaneous Localization and
Mapping (SLAM) methods only rely on the appearance constraints for optimizing
both 3DGS and camera poses. However, in endoscopic scenarios, the challenges
include photometric inconsistencies caused by non-Lambertian surfaces and
dynamic motion from breathing affects the performance of SLAM systems. To
address these issues, we additionally introduce optical flow loss as a
geometric constraint, which effectively constrains both the 3D structure of the
scene and the camera motion. Furthermore, we propose a depth regularisation
strategy to mitigate the problem of photometric inconsistencies and ensure the
validity of 3DGS depth rendering in endoscopic scenes. In addition, to improve
scene representation in the SLAM system, we improve the 3DGS refinement
strategy by focusing on viewpoints corresponding to Keyframes with suboptimal
rendering quality frames, achieving better rendering results. Extensive
experiments on the C3VD static dataset and the StereoMIS dynamic dataset
demonstrate that our method outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in
novel view synthesis and pose estimation, exhibiting high performance in both
static and dynamic surgical scenes. The source code will be publicly available
upon paper acceptance.

TL;DR: The paper explores analyzing the effects of scene text removal (STR) processes, focusing on detecting and localizing removed text accurately, while also studying the possibility of recovering removed text content.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the growing risks of misuse associated with scene text removal (STR) processes by developing methods to identify and localize STR alterations in images.

Method: The study involves binary classification to detect STR-altered images, localization of removed text regions, and an attempt to recover removed text content using a trained text recognizer.

Result: The authors achieved high accuracy in detecting and localizing text alterations caused by STR processes; they also tested the limits of recovering textual content from STR-processed images.

Conclusion: The research provides effective techniques to detect and analyze STR misuse, supports ethical use, and suggests limitations and challenges in recovering removed text.

Abstract: Scene text removal (STR) aims to erase textual elements from images. It was
originally intended for removing privacy-sensitiveor undesired texts from
natural scene images, but is now also appliedto typographic images. STR
typically detects text regions and theninpaints them. Although STR has advanced
through neural networksand synthetic data, misuse risks have increased. This
paper investi-gates Inverse STR (ISTR), which analyzes STR-processed images
andfocuses on binary classification (detecting whether an image has un-dergone
STR) and localizing removed text regions. We demonstrate inexperiments that
these tasks are achievable with high accuracies, en-abling detection of
potential misuse and improving STR. We also at-tempt to recover the removed
text content by training a text recognizerto understand its difficulty.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VisionGuard improves road safety by detecting helmet violations among motorcyclists using a multi-stage framework, achieving a 3.1% mAP improvement over baseline detectors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Challenges like environmental variability and inconsistent data hinder reliable detection of helmet compliance and disrupt classification.

Method: VisionGuard introduces two modules: Adaptive Labeling for consistent tracking and classification refinement, and Contextual Expander for improving recall in underrepresented classes via virtual bounding boxes.

Result: Compared to baseline detectors, VisionGuard achieves a 3.1% improvement in mean Average Precision (mAP), showcasing enhanced detection capabilities.

Conclusion: VisionGuard demonstrates potential for real-world traffic surveillance systems, improving safety and ensuring helmet regulation adherence.

Abstract: Enforcing helmet regulations among motorcyclists is essential for enhancing
road safety and ensuring the effectiveness of traffic management systems.
However, automatic detection of helmet violations faces significant challenges
due to environmental variability, camera angles, and inconsistencies in the
data. These factors hinder reliable detection of motorcycles and riders and
disrupt consistent object classification. To address these challenges, we
propose VisionGuard, a synergistic multi-stage framework designed to overcome
the limitations of frame-wise detectors, especially in scenarios with class
imbalance and inconsistent annotations. VisionGuard integrates two key
components: Adaptive Labeling and Contextual Expander modules. The Adaptive
Labeling module is a tracking-based refinement technique that enhances
classification consistency by leveraging a tracking algorithm to assign
persistent labels across frames and correct misclassifications. The Contextual
Expander module improves recall for underrepresented classes by generating
virtual bounding boxes with appropriate confidence scores, effectively
addressing the impact of data imbalance. Experimental results show that
VisionGuard improves overall mAP by 3.1% compared to baseline detectors,
demonstrating its effectiveness and potential for real-world deployment in
traffic surveillance systems, ultimately promoting safety and regulatory
compliance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a foundation model that achieves robust segmentation across camera and LiDAR data streams in dynamically changing autonomous driving scenarios while addressing annotation bottlenecks.

Method: The model introduces Unified Multi-modal Positional Encoding (UMPE) to align features in a shared 3D space and Motion-aware Cross-modal Memory Attention (MCMA) for temporal consistency. Additionally, it uses an automated multi-modal data engine to generate aligned pseudo-labels faster than human annotation.

Result: Extensive experiments on the Waymo-4DSeg dataset validate the model’s strong cross-modal segmentation performance and its potential for efficient data annotation.

Conclusion: SAM4D demonstrates its capability for accurate segmentation across modalities and timeframes, aligning camera and LiDAR data, and efficiently addressing the challenges in data annotation for autonomous driving applications.

Abstract: We present SAM4D, a multi-modal and temporal foundation model designed for
promptable segmentation across camera and LiDAR streams. Unified Multi-modal
Positional Encoding (UMPE) is introduced to align camera and LiDAR features in
a shared 3D space, enabling seamless cross-modal prompting and interaction.
Additionally, we propose Motion-aware Cross-modal Memory Attention (MCMA),
which leverages ego-motion compensation to enhance temporal consistency and
long-horizon feature retrieval, ensuring robust segmentation across dynamically
changing autonomous driving scenes. To avoid annotation bottlenecks, we develop
a multi-modal automated data engine that synergizes VFM-driven video masklets,
spatiotemporal 4D reconstruction, and cross-modal masklet fusion. This
framework generates camera-LiDAR aligned pseudo-labels at a speed orders of
magnitude faster than human annotation while preserving VFM-derived semantic
fidelity in point cloud representations. We conduct extensive experiments on
the constructed Waymo-4DSeg, which demonstrate the powerful cross-modal
segmentation ability and great potential in data annotation of proposed SAM4D.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper presents a deep learning method using FFCL and SAM to improve the speed and accuracy of tumor margin assessment during lumpectomy, achieving high performance with reduced inference time.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve the accuracy of intraoperative specimen margin status assessment in lumpectomy surgeries, as the current method (2D specimen radiography) often necessitates additional surgeries due to its limited precision.

Method: The paper proposes a combined framework of the Segment Anything Model (SAM) and Forward-Forward Contrastive Learning (FFCL). FFCL is used for pre-training a ResNet-18 model for margin classification, followed by SAM for accurate tumor margin segmentation.

Result: The proposed model achieved an AUC of 0.8455 for margin classification, a 27.4% improvement in Dice similarity for segmentation, and reduced inference time to 47 milliseconds per image.

Conclusion: The FFCL-SAM framework significantly enhances intraoperative margin assessment in terms of both accuracy and speed, with the potential to lower re-excision rates and improve breast cancer treatment outcomes.

Abstract: Complete removal of cancer tumors with a negative specimen margin during
lumpectomy is essential in reducing breast cancer recurrence. However, 2D
specimen radiography (SR), the current method used to assess intraoperative
specimen margin status, has limited accuracy, resulting in nearly a quarter of
patients requiring additional surgery. To address this, we propose a novel deep
learning framework combining the Segment Anything Model (SAM) with
Forward-Forward Contrastive Learning (FFCL), a pre-training strategy leveraging
both local and global contrastive learning for patch-level classification of SR
images. After annotating SR images with regions of known maligancy,
non-malignant tissue, and pathology-confirmed margins, we pre-train a ResNet-18
backbone with FFCL to classify margin status, then reconstruct coarse binary
masks to prompt SAM for refined tumor margin segmentation. Our approach
achieved an AUC of 0.8455 for margin classification and segmented margins with
a 27.4% improvement in Dice similarity over baseline models, while reducing
inference time to 47 milliseconds per image. These results demonstrate that
FFCL-SAM significantly enhances both the speed and accuracy of intraoperative
margin assessment, with strong potential to reduce re-excision rates and
improve surgical outcomes in breast cancer treatment. Our code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To simulate how human physical actions shape the environment from a first-person perspective.

Method: Auto-regressive conditional diffusion transformer trained on Nymeria dataset.

Result: Model learns embodied prediction by conditioning on kinematic pose trajectories.

Conclusion: This work pioneers video prediction for modeling real-world environments and embodied behaviors from a human viewpoint.

Abstract: We train models to Predict Ego-centric Video from human Actions (PEVA), given
the past video and an action represented by the relative 3D body pose. By
conditioning on kinematic pose trajectories, structured by the joint hierarchy
of the body, our model learns to simulate how physical human actions shape the
environment from a first-person point of view. We train an auto-regressive
conditional diffusion transformer on Nymeria, a large-scale dataset of
real-world egocentric video and body pose capture. We further design a
hierarchical evaluation protocol with increasingly challenging tasks, enabling
a comprehensive analysis of the model's embodied prediction and control
abilities. Our work represents an initial attempt to tackle the challenges of
modeling complex real-world environments and embodied agent behaviors with
video prediction from the perspective of a human.

TL;DR: This paper proposes a novel framework, "Aging Multiverse," for generating diverse, condition-based facial aging trajectories from a single image, using a training-free diffusion-based method.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing aging models treat aging as a single deterministic path, lacking flexibility for different plausible futures influenced by external factors like health and environment.

Method: The authors introduce a training-free diffusion-based method utilizing attention mixing for editing strength and Simulated Aging Regularization to stabilize the transformations.

Result: Experiments and user studies demonstrated superior performance in identity preservation, aging realism, and alignment with conditions, surpassing existing editing and age-progression models.

Conclusion: This approach transforms the concept of aging into a controllable and interpretable process, offering applications in digital storytelling, health education, and personalized visualization.

Abstract: We introduce the Aging Multiverse, a framework for generating multiple
plausible facial aging trajectories from a single image, each conditioned on
external factors such as environment, health, and lifestyle. Unlike prior
methods that model aging as a single deterministic path, our approach creates
an aging tree that visualizes diverse futures. To enable this, we propose a
training-free diffusion-based method that balances identity preservation, age
accuracy, and condition control. Our key contributions include attention mixing
to modulate editing strength and a Simulated Aging Regularization strategy to
stabilize edits. Extensive experiments and user studies demonstrate
state-of-the-art performance across identity preservation, aging realism, and
conditional alignment, outperforming existing editing and age-progression
models, which often fail to account for one or more of the editing criteria. By
transforming aging into a multi-dimensional, controllable, and interpretable
process, our approach opens up new creative and practical avenues in digital
storytelling, health education, and personalized visualization.

TL;DR: This paper introduces a novel data collection method for augmented reality by visualizing errors to guide new view sampling, improving both user experience and final results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing augmented reality methods for novel view synthesis rely on 3D annotations, which are mentally demanding and limit scene exploration.

Method: The paper uses locally reconstructed light fields and error visualization to guide users in inserting new views, avoiding reliance on restrictive 3D annotations.

Result: The proposed approach reduces user effort, enhances satisfaction, requires fewer view samples, and aids radiance field reconstruction for larger scenes.

Conclusion: The approach improves data collection efficiency and expands applicability to larger scenes, marking progress in mobile view synthesis systems.

Abstract: Augmented reality (AR) provides ways to visualize missing view samples for
novel view synthesis. Existing approaches present 3D annotations for new view
samples and task users with taking images by aligning the AR display. This data
collection task is known to be mentally demanding and limits capture areas to
pre-defined small areas due to the ideal but restrictive underlying sampling
theory. To free users from 3D annotations and limited scene exploration, we
propose using locally reconstructed light fields and visualizing errors to be
removed by inserting new views. Our results show that the error-peaking
visualization is less invasive, reduces disappointment in final results, and is
satisfactory with fewer view samples in our mobile view synthesis system. We
also show that our approach can contribute to recent radiance field
reconstruction for larger scenes, such as 3D Gaussian splatting.

### [98] [Bridging Video Quality Scoring and Justification via Large Multimodal Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21011)
*Qizhi Xie,Kun Yuan,Yunpeng Qu,Jiachao Gong,Mingda Wu,Ming Sun,Chao Zhou,Jihong Zhu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes adapting video large multimodal models (LMMs) for video quality assessment (VQA) using a new instruction tuning pipeline called Score-based Instruction Generation (SIG), resulting in better scoring and explanation abilities for these models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Classical VQA methods provide single scores for assessing video quality, failing to capture complex quality dimensions. Leveraging linguistic outputs from LMMs can add depth to video quality assessment.

Method: The Score-based Instruction Generation (SIG) pipeline generates instruction-response pairs by scoring unlabeled videos on multiple quality dimensions, mapping scores to text-defined levels, and incorporating a hierarchical Chain-of-Thought reasoning process. This method creates scalable and effective data for video LMM training without relying on human annotations.

Result: The SIG pipeline produced the Score2Instruct (S2I) dataset with over 320K pairs for instruction tuning and the S2I-Bench benchmark with 400 questions. Experiments showed improved video quality scoring and justification across multiple video LMMs.

Conclusion: Using the SIG pipeline and the S2I dataset enables video LMMs to achieve better multi-dimensional quality assessment and reasoning capabilities, advancing the state-of-the-art in VQA.

Abstract: Classical video quality assessment (VQA) methods generate a numerical score
to judge a video's perceived visual fidelity and clarity. Yet, a score fails to
describe the video's complex quality dimensions, restricting its applicability.
Benefiting from the linguistic output, adapting video large multimodal models
(LMMs) to VQA via instruction tuning has the potential to address this issue.
The core of the approach lies in the video quality-centric instruction data.
Previous explorations mainly focus on the image domain, and their data
generation processes heavily rely on human quality annotations and proprietary
systems, limiting data scalability and effectiveness. To address these
challenges, we propose the Score-based Instruction Generation (SIG) pipeline.
Specifically, SIG first scores multiple quality dimensions of an unlabeled
video and maps scores to text-defined levels. It then explicitly incorporates a
hierarchical Chain-of-Thought (CoT) to model the correlation between specific
dimensions and overall quality, mimicking the human visual system's reasoning
process. The automated pipeline eliminates the reliance on expert-written
quality descriptions and proprietary systems, ensuring data scalability and
generation efficiency. To this end, the resulting Score2Instruct (S2I) dataset
contains over 320K diverse instruction-response pairs, laying the basis for
instruction tuning. Moreover, to advance video LMMs' quality scoring and
justification abilities simultaneously, we devise a progressive tuning strategy
to fully unleash the power of S2I. Built upon SIG, we further curate a
benchmark termed S2I-Bench with 400 open-ended questions to better evaluate the
quality justification capacity of video LMMs. Experimental results on the
S2I-Bench and existing benchmarks indicate that our method consistently
improves quality scoring and justification capabilities across multiple video
LMMs.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes FedSC, a federated learning framework that addresses data heterogeneity by leveraging client-specific and class-relevant semantic knowledge to improve collaborative model training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address data heterogeneity in federated learning, which arises from biased labeling across clients, by exploiting intra-client semantic information that existing methods often overlook.

Method: FedSC constructs relational and consistent prototypes to utilize semantic-level knowledge. It employs inter-contrastive learning to align instance embeddings with relational prototypes and uses a discrepancy aggregation strategy to create consistent prototypes as a regularization mechanism.

Result: FedSC demonstrated effectiveness in addressing data heterogeneity and delivered promising results across challenging federated learning settings. A theoretical convergence analysis further validated its robustness.

Conclusion: FedSC effectively incorporates semantic-aware collaboration to reduce data heterogeneity issues in federated learning, offering both stable convergence and improved performance at the client level.

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) aims to train models collaboratively across clients
without sharing data for privacy-preserving. However, one major challenge is
the data heterogeneity issue, which refers to the biased labeling preferences
at multiple clients. A number of existing FL methods attempt to tackle data
heterogeneity locally (e.g., regularizing local models) or globally (e.g.,
fine-tuning global model), often neglecting inherent semantic information
contained in each client. To explore the possibility of using intra-client
semantically meaningful knowledge in handling data heterogeneity, in this
paper, we propose Federated Learning with Semantic-Aware Collaboration (FedSC)
to capture client-specific and class-relevant knowledge across heterogeneous
clients. The core idea of FedSC is to construct relational prototypes and
consistent prototypes at semantic-level, aiming to provide fruitful class
underlying knowledge and stable convergence signals in a prototype-wise
collaborative way. On the one hand, FedSC introduces an inter-contrastive
learning strategy to bring instance-level embeddings closer to relational
prototypes with the same semantics and away from distinct classes. On the other
hand, FedSC devises consistent prototypes via a discrepancy aggregation manner,
as a regularization penalty to constrain the optimization region of the local
model. Moreover, a theoretical analysis for FedSC is provided to ensure a
convergence guarantee. Experimental results on various challenging scenarios
demonstrate the effectiveness of FedSC and the efficiency of crucial
components.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel classical-quantum generative adversarial network (GAN) for generating high-quality color medical images, outperforming classical and existing hybrid methods in terms of both image quality and utility for data augmentation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Skin disease detection using machine learning faces challenges such as class imbalance, privacy concerns, and inefficient data augmentation. Current generative models are computationally intensive, while quantum approaches are limited to low-quality grayscale images, necessitating advancement in image generation methods.

Method: The proposed model fuses classical and quantum latent spaces to create a novel classical-quantum GAN capable of generating high-quality color medical images. It incorporates a classical-quantum hybrid design and is validated on both simulations and real IBM quantum hardware.

Result: The model outperformed classical deep convolutional GANs and existing hybrid GANs in image quality and data augmentation utility. It also achieved comparable results to state-of-the-art classical models but required significantly fewer parameters (25x fewer) and training epochs (10x fewer).

Conclusion: The study demonstrates that quantum-assisted image generation is a viable and efficient alternative to classical methods, with promise for further advancements as quantum hardware continues to improve.

Abstract: Machine learning-assisted diagnosis is gaining traction in skin disease
detection, but training effective models requires large amounts of high-quality
data. Skin disease datasets often suffer from class imbalance, privacy
concerns, and object bias, making data augmentation essential. While classical
generative models are widely used, they demand extensive computational
resources and lengthy training time. Quantum computing offers a promising
alternative, but existing quantum-based image generation methods can only yield
grayscale low-quality images. Through a novel classical-quantum latent space
fusion technique, our work overcomes this limitation and introduces the first
classical-quantum generative adversarial network (GAN) capable of generating
color medical images. Our model outperforms classical deep convolutional GANs
and existing hybrid classical-quantum GANs in both image generation quality and
classification performance boost when used as data augmentation. Moreover, the
performance boost is comparable with that achieved using state-of-the-art
classical generative models, yet with over 25 times fewer parameters and 10
times fewer training epochs. Such results suggest a promising future for
quantum image generation as quantum hardware advances. Finally, we demonstrate
the robust performance of our model on real IBM quantum machine with hardware
noise.

Result: MPA-FER outperforms state-of-the-art models on benchmark datasets while ensuring computational efficiency.

Conclusion: The framework provides precise facial expression recognition by leveraging textual and visual feature alignment, improving interpretability and retaining the model's pretrained advantages.

Abstract: Prompt learning has been widely adopted to efficiently adapt vision-language
models (VLMs) like CLIP for various downstream tasks. Despite their success,
current VLM-based facial expression recognition (FER) methods struggle to
capture fine-grained textual-visual relationships, which are essential for
distinguishing subtle differences between facial expressions. To address this
challenge, we propose a multimodal prompt alignment framework for FER, called
MPA-FER, that provides fine-grained semantic guidance to the learning process
of prompted visual features, resulting in more precise and interpretable
representations. Specifically, we introduce a multi-granularity hard prompt
generation strategy that utilizes a large language model (LLM) like ChatGPT to
generate detailed descriptions for each facial expression. The LLM-based
external knowledge is injected into the soft prompts by minimizing the feature
discrepancy between the soft prompts and the hard prompts. To preserve the
generalization abilities of the pretrained CLIP model, our approach
incorporates prototype-guided visual feature alignment, ensuring that the
prompted visual features from the frozen image encoder align closely with
class-specific prototypes. Additionally, we propose a cross-modal global-local
alignment module that focuses on expression-relevant facial features, further
improving the alignment between textual and visual features. Extensive
experiments demonstrate our framework outperforms state-of-the-art methods on
three FER benchmark datasets, while retaining the benefits of the pretrained
model and minimizing computational costs.

*Lei Hao,Lina Xu,Chang Liu,Yanni Dong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes a lightweight, efficient multimodal object detection framework (LASFNet) that simplifies the training process by using a single feature-level fusion unit while achieving significant computational efficiency and improved accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous multimodal object detection methods suffer from complex training processes and high computational overhead due to the stacking of multiple feature-level fusion units. The need for a simpler, more efficient approach is evident.

Method: The authors introduced LASFNet, which employs an attention-guided self-modulation feature fusion (ASFF) module to adaptively adjust fusion features and a feature attention transformation module (FATM) at the neck for enhanced focus and reduced information loss.

Result: The proposed LASFNet significantly reduces parameters and computational costs by 90% and 85%, respectively, while increasing detection accuracy by 1%-3% mAP compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: The LASFNet framework offers a highly efficient and accurate alternative to existing multimodal object detection models, balancing computational efficiency with improved accuracy. This innovation addresses computational challenges and will be open-sourced.

Abstract: Effective deep feature extraction via feature-level fusion is crucial for
multimodal object detection. However, previous studies often involve complex
training processes that integrate modality-specific features by stacking
multiple feature-level fusion units, leading to significant computational
overhead. To address this issue, we propose a new fusion detection baseline
that uses a single feature-level fusion unit to enable high-performance
detection, thereby simplifying the training process. Based on this approach, we
propose a lightweight attention-guided self-modulation feature fusion network
(LASFNet), which introduces a novel attention-guided self-modulation feature
fusion (ASFF) module that adaptively adjusts the responses of fusion features
at both global and local levels based on attention information from different
modalities, thereby promoting comprehensive and enriched feature generation.
Additionally, a lightweight feature attention transformation module (FATM) is
designed at the neck of LASFNet to enhance the focus on fused features and
minimize information loss. Extensive experiments on three representative
datasets demonstrate that, compared to state-of-the-art methods, our approach
achieves a favorable efficiency-accuracy trade-off, reducing the number of
parameters and computational cost by as much as 90% and 85%, respectively,
while improving detection accuracy (mAP) by 1%-3%. The code will be
open-sourced at https://github.com/leileilei2000/LASFNet.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces a novel 1D binary latent representation for image tokenization, efficiently reducing computational demands while preserving high-resolution details.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need to improve the efficiency of image and multimodal understanding and generation by reducing the computational demands of high-resolution image modeling.

Method: The authors propose replacing traditional one-hot codebook tokens with binary vector representations in 1D latent spaces, reducing token count and maintaining detail.

Result: The method achieves competitive results in text-to-image generation using only 128 tokens for images up to 1024x1024, enabling efficient training with a global batch size of 4096 on a single GPU node.

Conclusion: The paper presents a scalable, efficient alternative to conventional tokenization methods, offering faster training and inference without requiring in-house data or post-training refinements.

Abstract: Image tokenization plays a critical role in reducing the computational
demands of modeling high-resolution images, significantly improving the
efficiency of image and multimodal understanding and generation. Recent
advances in 1D latent spaces have reduced the number of tokens required by
eliminating the need for a 2D grid structure. In this paper, we further advance
compact discrete image representation by introducing 1D binary image latents.
By representing each image as a sequence of binary vectors, rather than using
traditional one-hot codebook tokens, our approach preserves high-resolution
details while maintaining the compactness of 1D latents. To the best of our
knowledge, our text-to-image models are the first to achieve competitive
performance in both diffusion and auto-regressive generation using just 128
discrete tokens for images up to 1024x1024, demonstrating up to a 32-fold
reduction in token numbers compared to standard VQ-VAEs. The proposed 1D binary
latent space, coupled with simple model architectures, achieves marked
improvements in speed training and inference speed. Our text-to-image models
allow for a global batch size of 4096 on a single GPU node with 8 AMD MI300X
GPUs, and the training can be completed within 200 GPU days. Our models achieve
competitive performance compared to modern image generation models without any
in-house private training data or post-training refinements, offering a
scalable and efficient alternative to conventional tokenization methods.

TL;DR: This paper introduces DidSee, a novel framework designed to enhance depth completion for non-Lambertian objects by addressing biases and improving prediction accuracy using a diffusion-based approach.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The noisy and incomplete depth maps produced by RGB-D cameras for non-Lambertian objects and the generalization limitations of traditional depth completion methods.

Method: The framework introduces a rescaled noise scheduler, a noise-agnostic single-step training scheme, and a semantic enhancer for joint depth completion and segmentation.

Result: DidSee achieves state-of-the-art performance, robust real-world generalization, and improves performance in tasks like pose estimation and robotic grasping across multiple benchmarks.

Conclusion: DidSee effectively addresses depth completion challenges with innovative methods, combining improved model training and semantic enhancement for better accuracy and practical application.

Abstract: Commercial RGB-D cameras often produce noisy, incomplete depth maps for
non-Lambertian objects. Traditional depth completion methods struggle to
generalize due to the limited diversity and scale of training data. Recent
advances exploit visual priors from pre-trained text-to-image diffusion models
to enhance generalization in dense prediction tasks. However, we find that
biases arising from training-inference mismatches in the vanilla diffusion
framework significantly impair depth completion performance. Additionally, the
lack of distinct visual features in non-Lambertian regions further hinders
precise prediction. To address these issues, we propose \textbf{DidSee}, a
diffusion-based framework for depth completion on non-Lambertian objects.
First, we integrate a rescaled noise scheduler enforcing a zero terminal
signal-to-noise ratio to eliminate signal leakage bias. Second, we devise a
noise-agnostic single-step training formulation to alleviate error accumulation
caused by exposure bias and optimize the model with a task-specific loss.
Finally, we incorporate a semantic enhancer that enables joint depth completion
and semantic segmentation, distinguishing objects from backgrounds and yielding
precise, fine-grained depth maps. DidSee achieves state-of-the-art performance
on multiple benchmarks, demonstrates robust real-world generalization, and
effectively improves downstream tasks such as category-level pose estimation
and robotic grasping.Project page: https://wenzhoulyu.github.io/DidSee/

*Boyong He,Yuxiang Ji,Zhuoyue Tan,Liaoni Wu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper addresses the challenges of domain gaps in object detection by leveraging diffusion models and proposes enhancements to improve both efficiency and performance across domain generalization (DG) and adaptation (DA) tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Detectors commonly experience performance drops due to domain gaps between the training and testing datasets. Existing methods using diffusion models for DG and DA face issues of high inference costs and limited utilization of diffusion model capabilities.

Method: The authors propose a single-step diffusion process to optimize feature extraction and fusion, construct an auxiliary object-centered branch using box-masked images with class prompts, and employ consistency loss to balance fitness and generalization. They integrate these techniques into a unified framework that combines feature- and object-level alignment across domains.

Result: The proposed method reduces inference time by 75% while achieving competitive performance on 3 DA and 5 DG benchmarks. It maintains advantages in large domain shifts and low-data scenarios, particularly demonstrated through experiments on the COCO generalization benchmark.

Conclusion: This work highlights the benefits of applying diffusion models to domain generalization and adaptation tasks in object detection, offering valuable insights for robust performance across diverse domains while achieving high efficiency.

Abstract: Detectors often suffer from performance drop due to domain gap between
training and testing data. Recent methods explore diffusion models applied to
domain generalization (DG) and adaptation (DA) tasks, but still struggle with
large inference costs and have not yet fully leveraged the capabilities of
diffusion models. We propose to tackle these problems by extracting
intermediate features from a single-step diffusion process, improving feature
collection and fusion to reduce inference time by 75% while enhancing
performance on source domains (i.e., Fitness). Then, we construct an
object-centered auxiliary branch by applying box-masked images with class
prompts to extract robust and domain-invariant features that focus on object.
We also apply consistency loss to align the auxiliary and ordinary branch,
balancing fitness and generalization while preventing overfitting and improving
performance on target domains (i.e., Generalization). Furthermore, within a
unified framework, standard detectors are guided by diffusion detectors through
feature-level and object-level alignment on source domains (for DG) and
unlabeled target domains (for DA), thereby improving cross-domain detection
performance (i.e., Transferability). Our method achieves competitive results on
3 DA benchmarks and 5 DG benchmarks. Additionally, experiments on COCO
generalization benchmark demonstrate that our method maintains significant
advantages and show remarkable efficiency in large domain shifts and low-data
scenarios. Our work shows the superiority of applying diffusion models to
domain generalized and adaptive detection tasks and offers valuable insights
for visual perception tasks across diverse domains. The code is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Faithfulness Guidance and Scheduling (FGS) for improved image editing, balancing between modifying and preserving image elements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To resolve the trade-off between editability (modification extent) and faithfulness (preservation of unaltered parts) in text-guided diffusion models for image editing.

Method: FGS combines faithfulness guidance to preserve image information and a scheduling strategy to align editability and faithfulness.

Result: FGS demonstrates superior faithfulness and maintains editability, achieving high-quality, precise edits across various tasks.

Conclusion: FGS is effective and compatible with multiple methods, providing improved and versatile image editing solutions.

Abstract: Text-guided diffusion models have become essential for high-quality image
synthesis, enabling dynamic image editing. In image editing, two crucial
aspects are editability, which determines the extent of modification, and
faithfulness, which reflects how well unaltered elements are preserved.
However, achieving optimal results is challenging because of the inherent
trade-off between editability and faithfulness. To address this, we propose
Faithfulness Guidance and Scheduling (FGS), which enhances faithfulness with
minimal impact on editability. FGS incorporates faithfulness guidance to
strengthen the preservation of input image information and introduces a
scheduling strategy to resolve misalignment between editability and
faithfulness. Experimental results demonstrate that FGS achieves superior
faithfulness while maintaining editability. Moreover, its compatibility with
various editing methods enables precise, high-quality image edits across
diverse tasks.

*Shangbo Wu,Yu-an Tan,Ruinan Ma,Wencong Ma,Dehua Zhu,Yuanzhang Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel attack method leveraging self-supervised Vision Transformers (ViTs) for crafting black-box adversarial examples with improved transferability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance the generalizability of adversarial perturbations in black-box attacks by leveraging intermediate features beyond hard labels.

Method: The method, called dSVA, uses dual self-supervised ViT features (contrastive learning and masked image modeling) to train a generator for creating black-box adversarial examples.

Result: The approach demonstrates improved transferability of adversarial examples across various architectures, outperforming existing state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: Self-supervised ViT representations can synergistically boost adversarial example transferability, presenting a significant advancement in adversarial attack strategies.

Abstract: The ability of deep neural networks (DNNs) come from extracting and
interpreting features from the data provided. By exploiting intermediate
features in DNNs instead of relying on hard labels, we craft adversarial
perturbation that generalize more effectively, boosting black-box
transferability. These features ubiquitously come from supervised learning in
previous work. Inspired by the exceptional synergy between self-supervised
learning and the Transformer architecture, this paper explores whether
exploiting self-supervised Vision Transformer (ViT) representations can improve
adversarial transferability. We present dSVA -- a generative dual
self-supervised ViT features attack, that exploits both global structural
features from contrastive learning (CL) and local textural features from masked
image modeling (MIM), the self-supervised learning paradigm duo for ViTs. We
design a novel generative training framework that incorporates a generator to
create black-box adversarial examples, and strategies to train the generator by
exploiting joint features and the attention mechanism of self-supervised ViTs.
Our findings show that CL and MIM enable ViTs to attend to distinct feature
tendencies, which, when exploited in tandem, boast great adversarial
generalizability. By disrupting dual deep features distilled by self-supervised
ViTs, we are rewarded with remarkable black-box transferability to models of
various architectures that outperform state-of-the-arts. Code available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper seeks to overcome limitations in existing document analysis methods that are restricted to fixed categories and granularity, aiming to enable flexible, user-customized solutions.

Method: The proposed RoI-Matcher framework uses a siamese network for multi-level feature extraction and cross-attention layers for semantic alignment across reference and target domains. A benchmark (RoI-Matching-Bench) is introduced, with varying difficulty levels and new evaluation metrics.

Result: Experiments show the proposed RoI-Matcher performs effectively on the benchmark, establishing it as a baseline for future research.

Conclusion: The study successfully introduces RoI-Matching and the RoI-Matcher framework, contributing a flexible and efficient solution for document analysis and laying groundwork for future investigation.

Abstract: Document understanding and analysis have received a lot of attention due to
their widespread application. However, existing document analysis solutions,
such as document layout analysis and key information extraction, are only
suitable for fixed category definitions and granularities, and cannot achieve
flexible applications customized by users. Therefore, this paper defines a new
task named ``Class-Agnostic Region-of-Interest Matching'' (``RoI-Matching'' for
short), which aims to match the customized regions in a flexible, efficient,
multi-granularity, and open-set manner. The visual prompt of the reference
document and target document images are fed into our model, while the output is
the corresponding bounding boxes in the target document images. To meet the
above requirements, we construct a benchmark RoI-Matching-Bench, which sets
three levels of difficulties following real-world conditions, and propose the
macro and micro metrics to evaluate. Furthermore, we also propose a new
framework RoI-Matcher, which employs a siamese network to extract multi-level
features both in the reference and target domains, and cross-attention layers
to integrate and align similar semantics in different domains. Experiments show
that our method with a simple procedure is effective on RoI-Matching-Bench, and
serves as the baseline for further research. The code is available at

TL;DR: SAMURAI focuses on retrieving 3D objects in indoor environments using masked 2D images and language descriptions, addressing challenges like distorted viewpoints and noisy masks through a hybrid framework.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The research aims to tackle the complexities of retrieving 3D objects from limited 2D masked images and ambiguous natural language prompts, especially under ROOMELSA challenge constraints.

Method: SAMURAI utilizes shape-aware multimodal retrieval by integrating semantic matching and shape-guided re-ranking, supported by preprocessing for mask improvement and a voting strategy.

Result: The approach achieves competitive performance on the ROOMELSA test set by combining shape and language cues for more accurate object retrieval.

Conclusion: Combining shape priors with language understanding is key for improving open-world 3D object retrieval, as demonstrated by SAMURAI's competitive results.

Abstract: Retrieving 3D objects in complex indoor environments using only a masked 2D
image and a natural language description presents significant challenges. The
ROOMELSA challenge limits access to full 3D scene context, complicating
reasoning about object appearance, geometry, and semantics. These challenges
are intensified by distorted viewpoints, textureless masked regions, ambiguous
language prompts, and noisy segmentation masks. To address this, we propose
SAMURAI: Shape-Aware Multimodal Retrieval for 3D Object Identification. SAMURAI
integrates CLIP-based semantic matching with shape-guided re-ranking derived
from binary silhouettes of masked regions, alongside a robust majority voting
strategy. A dedicated preprocessing pipeline enhances mask quality by
extracting the largest connected component and removing background noise. Our
hybrid retrieval framework leverages both language and shape cues, achieving
competitive performance on the ROOMELSA private test set. These results
highlight the importance of combining shape priors with language understanding
for robust open-world 3D object retrieval.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PoseMaster introduces an end-to-end framework for 3D character modeling, addressing inefficiencies and distortions in current methods by combining pose transformation and 3D character generation using flow-based techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for 3D character modeling face challenges like image distortion during pose standardization due to self-occlusion, affecting geometric quality. A new approach is needed to improve efficiency and accuracy.

Method: PoseMaster unifies pose transformation and 3D character generation into a single flow-based framework, using 3D body bones as pose conditions and incorporating randomized condition emptying during training to enhance generalizability.

Result: PoseMaster demonstrates superior performance in both visual quality and control across arbitrary poses, outperforming state-of-the-art techniques in experiments.

Conclusion: PoseMaster is an effective solution for accurate and efficient 3D character modeling, showcasing robust pose control and quality enhancement over existing methods.

Abstract: 3D characters play a crucial role in our daily entertainment. To improve the
efficiency of 3D character modeling, recent image-based methods use two
separate models to achieve pose standardization and 3D reconstruction of the
A-pose character. However, these methods are prone to generating distorted and
degraded images in the pose standardization stage due to self-occlusion and
viewpoints, which further affects the geometric quality of the subsequent
reconstruction process. To tackle these problems, we propose PoseMaster, an
end-to-end controllable 3D character generation framework. Specifically, we
unify pose transformation and 3D character generation into a flow-based 3D
native generation framework. To achieve accurate arbitrary-pose control, we
propose to leverage the 3D body bones existing in the skeleton of an animatable
character as the pose condition. Furthermore, considering the specificity of
multi-condition control, we randomly empty the pose condition and the image
condition during training to improve the effectiveness and generalizability of
pose control. Finally, we create a high-quality pose-control dataset derived
from realistic character animation data to make the model learning the implicit
relationships between skeleton and skinning weights. Extensive experiments show
that PoseMaster outperforms current state-of-the-art techniques in both
qualitative and quantitative evaluations for A-pose character generation while
demonstrating its powerful ability to achieve precise control for arbitrary
poses.

TL;DR: The paper discusses improving multimodal large language models' reasoning by addressing global context understanding and shortcut problems through reinforcement learning and introducing a new benchmark, IntentBench.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance the reasoning capabilities of multimodal large language models that struggle with context misinterpretation and overlooking key multimodal cues.

Method: Using reinforcement learning with context, format, and logical rewards judged by a large language model, alongside a new evaluation benchmark, IntentBench, for reasoning in multimodal contexts.

Result: The proposed method outperforms other open-source multimodal models in understanding complex human intentions and emotions across multiple benchmarks.

Conclusion: The approach effectively addresses existing challenges in multimodal reasoning and demonstrates improved model performance in reasoning tasks through better global context understanding and evaluation mechanisms.

Abstract: With the rapid evolution of multimodal large language models, the capacity to
deeply understand and interpret human intentions has emerged as a critical
capability, which demands detailed and thoughtful reasoning. In recent studies,
Reinforcement Learning (RL) has demonstrated potential in enhancing the
reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). Nonetheless, the
challenges associated with adapting RL to multimodal data and formats remain
largely unaddressed. In this paper, we identify two issues in existing
multimodal reasoning models: insufficient global context understanding and
shortcut problems. Insufficient context understanding can happen when a model
misinterprets multimodal context, resulting in incorrect answers. The shortcut
problem occurs when the model overlooks crucial clues in multimodal inputs,
directly addressing the query without considering the multimodal information.
To tackle these issues, we emphasize the necessity for the model to reason with
a clear understanding of the global context within multimodal inputs. This
global context understanding can effectively prevent the model from overlooking
key multimodal cues and ensure a thorough reasoning process. To ensure the
accurate interpretation of multimodal context information, we implement a
context reward judged by a large language model, alongside format and accuracy
rewards. Additionally, to improve complex reasoning capability, we employ the
LLM to assess the logical reward, determining whether the reasoning process
successfully integrates multimodal information with logical methods. We also
introduce a reasoning omni-modal benchmark, IntentBench, aimed at evaluating
models in understanding complex human intentions and emotions. Our proposed
method demonstrates advanced performance across multiple omni-modal benchmarks
compared to other open-source omni-modal models.

Conclusion: EgoAdapt effectively balances efficiency and performance, making it suitable for deployment in resource-limited settings for various egocentric perception tasks.

Abstract: Modern perception models, particularly those designed for multisensory
egocentric tasks, have achieved remarkable performance but often come with
substantial computational costs. These high demands pose challenges for
real-world deployment, especially in resource-constrained environments. In this
paper, we introduce EgoAdapt, a framework that adaptively performs cross-modal
distillation and policy learning to enable efficient inference across different

adaptable to task-specific action spaces, making it broadly applicable.

TL;DR: The paper introduces Enhanced Shuffle Mixer (ESM) to improve stereo matching, achieving accurate disparity maps at real-time processing speeds.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improving stereo matching models to ensure both high accuracy and real-time performance for modern autonomous systems.

Method: The Enhanced Shuffle Mixer (ESM) integrates primary features into the disparity upsampling unit, mixes them using shuffling and layer splitting, and refines them with a compact hourglass network to restore critical scene details.

Result: ESMStereo achieves real-time disparity map reconstruction, with speeds of 116 FPS on high-end GPUs and 91 FPS on AGX Orin.

Conclusion: The proposed ESM minimizes information loss in small-scale cost volumes and balances high accuracy with real-time processing for stereo matching applications.

Abstract: Stereo matching has become an increasingly important component of modern
autonomous systems. Developing deep learning-based stereo matching models that
deliver high accuracy while operating in real-time continues to be a major
challenge in computer vision. In the domain of cost-volume-based stereo
matching, accurate disparity estimation depends heavily on large-scale cost
volumes. However, such large volumes store substantial redundant information
and also require computationally intensive aggregation units for processing and
regression, making real-time performance unattainable. Conversely, small-scale
cost volumes followed by lightweight aggregation units provide a promising
route for real-time performance, but lack sufficient information to ensure
highly accurate disparity estimation. To address this challenge, we propose the
Enhanced Shuffle Mixer (ESM) to mitigate information loss associated with
small-scale cost volumes. ESM restores critical details by integrating primary
features into the disparity upsampling unit. It quickly extracts features from
the initial disparity estimation and fuses them with image features. These
features are mixed by shuffling and layer splitting then refined through a
compact feature-guided hourglass network to recover more detailed scene
geometry. The ESM focuses on local contextual connectivity with a large
receptive field and low computational cost, leading to the reconstruction of a
highly accurate disparity map at real-time. The compact version of ESMStereo
achieves an inference speed of 116 FPS on high-end GPUs and 91 FPS on the AGX
Orin.

TL;DR: A novel framework, OracleFusion, is introduced to help decipher Oracle Bone Script (OBS) using advanced multimodal and vector graphic techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The majority of ancient Oracle Bone Script characters remain undeciphered due to their complex structures and abstract imagery.

Method: The OracleFusion framework uses a two-stage approach: (1) applying a Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) with spatial reasoning for OBS glyph analysis, and (2) introducing Oracle Structural Vector Fusion (OSVF) to create semantically consistent vector fonts while preserving glyph structure.

Result: OracleFusion surpasses current methods in terms of semantic accuracy, visual appeal, and structural integrity of the glyphs, improving readability and aesthetics.

Conclusion: OracleFusion aids in deciphering ancient Oracle Bone Script by offering expert-like insights and enhanced visual representations, serving as a valuable tool for researchers.

Abstract: As one of the earliest ancient languages, Oracle Bone Script (OBS)
encapsulates the cultural records and intellectual expressions of ancient
civilizations. Despite the discovery of approximately 4,500 OBS characters,
only about 1,600 have been deciphered. The remaining undeciphered ones, with
their complex structure and abstract imagery, pose significant challenges for
interpretation. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a novel
two-stage semantic typography framework, named OracleFusion. In the first
stage, this approach leverages the Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) with
enhanced Spatial Awareness Reasoning (SAR) to analyze the glyph structure of
the OBS character and perform visual localization of key components. In the
second stage, we introduce Oracle Structural Vector Fusion (OSVF),
incorporating glyph structure constraints and glyph maintenance constraints to
ensure the accurate generation of semantically enriched vector fonts. This
approach preserves the objective integrity of the glyph structure, offering
visually enhanced representations that assist experts in deciphering OBS.
Extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments demonstrate that
OracleFusion outperforms state-of-the-art baseline models in terms of
semantics, visual appeal, and glyph maintenance, significantly enhancing both
readability and aesthetic quality. Furthermore, OracleFusion provides
expert-like insights on unseen oracle characters, making it a valuable tool for

### [115] [Pushing Trade-Off Boundaries: Compact yet Effective Remote Sensing Change Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21109)
*Luosheng Xu,Dalin Zhang,Zhaohui Song*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This study introduces FlickCD, a lightweight and efficient model for remote sensing change detection, targeting high accuracy with minimal resource consumption for applications such as on-satellite processing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Monitoring dynamic landscape transformations requires efficient techniques to handle urban expansion, disasters, and resource management. Current deep learning models are resource-intensive without proportional accuracy gains, highlighting a need for better performance-cost solutions.

Method: FlickCD employs an Enhanced Difference Module (EDM) to stress critical temporal feature differences and a decoder with Local-Global Fusion Blocks using Shifted Window Self-Attention and Enhanced Global Self-Attention for multi-scale semantic information capture.

Result: Experiments on four benchmark datasets show that FlickCD reduces computational/storage needs by over 10x, achieving SOTA performance with minor (<1% F1 score) accuracy compromises.

Conclusion: FlickCD advances the efficiency of remote sensing change detection, balancing high accuracy and minimal resource consumption, with its code available for public use.

Abstract: Remote sensing change detection is essential for monitoring urban expansion,
disaster assessment, and resource management, offering timely, accurate, and
large-scale insights into dynamic landscape transformations. While deep
learning has revolutionized change detection, the increasing complexity and
computational demands of modern models have not necessarily translated into
significant accuracy gains. Instead of following this trend, this study
explores a more efficient approach, focusing on lightweight models that
maintain high accuracy while minimizing resource consumption, which is an
essential requirement for on-satellite processing. To this end, we propose
FlickCD, which means quick flick then get great results, pushing the boundaries
of the performance-resource trade-off. FlickCD introduces an Enhanced
Difference Module (EDM) to amplify critical feature differences between
temporal phases while suppressing irrelevant variations such as lighting and
weather changes, thereby reducing computational costs in the subsequent change
decoder. Additionally, the FlickCD decoder incorporates Local-Global Fusion
Blocks, leveraging Shifted Window Self-Attention (SWSA) and Enhanced Global
Self-Attention (EGSA) to efficiently capture semantic information at multiple
scales, preserving both coarse- and fine-grained changes. Extensive experiments
on four benchmark datasets demonstrate that FlickCD reduces computational and
storage overheads by more than an order of magnitude while achieving
state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance or incurring only a minor (<1\% F1)
accuracy trade-off. The implementation code is publicly available at

*Yujia Liang,Jile Jiao,Zhicheng Wang,Xuetao Feng,Zixuan Ye,Yuan Wang,Hao Lu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces a new dataset (MultiClip-Bench) and a model (IPFormer-VideoLLM) to improve VideoLLMs' performance on multi-shot video understanding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VideoLLMs struggle with multi-shot scenarios, such as varying camera angles or scene changes, due to lack of datasets designed for these challenges.

Method: The paper provides a new dataset, MultiClip-Bench, with dense descriptions and QA pairs for multi-shot scenarios, and proposes a model, IPFormer-VideoLLM, which uses instance-level features as prompts via an attention-based connector.

Result: Experiments show significant improvements in multi-shot video understanding and performance across various benchmarks.

Conclusion: The proposed dataset and model meaningfully address gaps in VideoLLM performance, particularly in handling multi-shot scenarios, enhancing both evaluation and understanding.

Abstract: Video Large Language Models (VideoLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable
understanding capabilities, but are found struggling to tackle multi-shot
scenarios,e.g., video clips with varying camera angles or scene changes. This
challenge can render failures such as instance identity forgetting and key
frame negligence. In this work, we first attribute the challenge to the lack of
multi-shot annotations among existing datasets and therefore we introduce a new
dataset termed MultiClip-Bench, featuring dense descriptions and
instruction-based question-answering pairs tailored for multi-shot scenarios.
We empirically find that the training set significantly boosts the multi-shot
performance, while the testing benchmark provides a reliable measure of the
model capability in multi-shot scenarios. By further analyzing and discovering
that current models only encode instance features in a discrete or lossy
manner, at the risk of missing identity information, we then contribute a new
model IPFormer-VideoLLM. Its key idea is the injection of instance-level
features as instance prompts through an efficient attention-based connector.
This allows for the aggregation of instance-specific information across scenes.
Experiments demonstrate that our proposed dataset and model not only enhance
the multi-scene video understanding significantly, but also offer distinct
advantages across various video benchmarks.

*Jan Ackermann,Jonas Kulhanek,Shengqu Cai,Haofei Xu,Marc Pollefeys,Gordon Wetzstein,Leonidas Guibas,Songyou Peng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper presents CL-Splats, a method for efficiently updating 3D scene representations in dynamic environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Efficiently adapting 3D reconstructions in dynamic environments is critical to avoid computationally expensive re-optimization while maintaining quality.

Method: The proposed approach, CL-Splats, uses Gaussian splatting and a change-detection module to identify updated and static parts of the scene, focusing on local optimizations rather than reprocessing the entire scene.

Result: Extensive experiments show that CL-Splats enhances reconstruction quality and update efficiency compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: CL-Splats offers a robust framework for real-time 3D scene reconstruction and opens new possibilities for scene analysis and temporal segmentation.

Abstract: In dynamic 3D environments, accurately updating scene representations over
time is crucial for applications in robotics, mixed reality, and embodied AI.
As scenes evolve, efficient methods to incorporate changes are needed to
maintain up-to-date, high-quality reconstructions without the computational
overhead of re-optimizing the entire scene. This paper introduces CL-Splats,
which incrementally updates Gaussian splatting-based 3D representations from
sparse scene captures. CL-Splats integrates a robust change-detection module
that segments updated and static components within the scene, enabling focused,
local optimization that avoids unnecessary re-computation. Moreover, CL-Splats
supports storing and recovering previous scene states, facilitating temporal
segmentation and new scene-analysis applications. Our extensive experiments
demonstrate that CL-Splats achieves efficient updates with improved
reconstruction quality over the state-of-the-art. This establishes a robust
foundation for future real-time adaptation in 3D scene reconstruction tasks.

aims to overcome the limitations of traditional OCR methods, offering
significant improvements in accuracy and efficiency. We release the underlying
model as an open-source library and make our OCR platform available for

*Hai Jiang,Binhao Guan,Zhen Liu,Xiaohong Liu,Jian Yu,Zheng Liu,Songchen Han,Shuaicheng Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper focuses on enhancing RAW image quality in extremely low-light conditions using a new dataset and a diffusion-based framework.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current learning-based methods for low-light RAW image enhancement struggle in extremely dark scenarios due to the lack of appropriate datasets.

Method: The authors introduce the SIED dataset with paired data in ranges from 0.0001 to 0.1 lux and propose a diffusion-based framework incorporating adaptive illumination correction and color consistency techniques.

Result: Experiments validated the effectiveness of the proposed framework on the SIED dataset and other benchmarks, achieving high-quality enhancement under extremely low-light conditions.

Conclusion: The study addresses limitations in low-light RAW image enhancement and offers a robust solution combining synthetic datasets and advanced restoration methods.

Abstract: Learning-based methods have made promising advances in low-light RAW image
enhancement, while their capability to extremely dark scenes where the
environmental illuminance drops as low as 0.0001 lux remains to be explored due
to the lack of corresponding datasets. To this end, we propose a
paired-to-paired data synthesis pipeline capable of generating well-calibrated
extremely low-light RAW images at three precise illuminance ranges of 0.01-0.1
lux, 0.001-0.01 lux, and 0.0001-0.001 lux, together with high-quality sRGB
references to comprise a large-scale paired dataset named
See-in-the-Extremely-Dark (SIED) to benchmark low-light RAW image enhancement
approaches. Furthermore, we propose a diffusion-based framework that leverages
the generative ability and intrinsic denoising property of diffusion models to
restore visually pleasing results from extremely low-SNR RAW inputs, in which
an Adaptive Illumination Correction Module (AICM) and a color consistency loss
are introduced to ensure accurate exposure correction and color restoration.
Extensive experiments on the proposed SIED and publicly available benchmarks
demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. The code and dataset are available

### [120] [HalluSegBench: Counterfactual Visual Reasoning for Segmentation Hallucination Evaluation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21546)
*Xinzhuo Li,Adheesh Juvekar,Xingyou Liu,Muntasir Wahed,Kiet A. Nguyen,Ismini Lourentzou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces HalluSegBench, a new benchmark and dataset to evaluate hallucinations in vision-language segmentation models using counterfactual visual reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The research addresses the issue of hallucinations in vision-language segmentation models, where models inaccurately generate segmentation masks or assign incorrect labels, and existing evaluation methods fail to properly diagnose these issues.

Method: The authors propose HalluSegBench, which includes a dataset of 1340 counterfactual image pairs and metrics for assessing hallucinations under visually coherent scene edits.

Result: Their experiments demonstrated that hallucinations driven by visual contexts are more prominent than label-driven errors, implying a significant issue with grounding fidelity in current models.

Conclusion: Counterfactual reasoning is essential for effectively diagnosing hallucination issues in vision-language segmentation systems, as highlighted by the developed benchmark and findings.

Abstract: Recent progress in vision-language segmentation has significantly advanced
grounded visual understanding. However, these models often exhibit
hallucinations by producing segmentation masks for objects not grounded in the
image content or by incorrectly labeling irrelevant regions. Existing
evaluation protocols for segmentation hallucination primarily focus on label or
textual hallucinations without manipulating the visual context, limiting their
capacity to diagnose critical failures. In response, we introduce
HalluSegBench, the first benchmark specifically designed to evaluate
hallucinations in visual grounding through the lens of counterfactual visual
reasoning. Our benchmark consists of a novel dataset of 1340 counterfactual
instance pairs spanning 281 unique object classes, and a set of newly
introduced metrics that quantify hallucination sensitivity under visually
coherent scene edits. Experiments on HalluSegBench with state-of-the-art
vision-language segmentation models reveal that vision-driven hallucinations
are significantly more prevalent than label-driven ones, with models often
persisting in false segmentation, highlighting the need for counterfactual
reasoning to diagnose grounding fidelity.

*Jiawei Hu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces YOLO-FDA, a detection framework addressing challenges in industrial surface defect identification by enhancing details and fusing features using attention mechanisms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Industrial surface defect detection is challenging due to the variability in defects, fine-grained requirements, and complex material textures.

Method: YOLO-FDA strengthens feature aggregation through BiFPN architecture, introduces a DDFM module for detail enhancement, and employs novel attention-based fusion strategies (AC and CAF) for improved contextual representation.

Result: Experiments show YOLO-FDA achieves superior accuracy and robustness in defect detection compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: YOLO-FDA effectively addresses multiscale defect detection challenges and enhances detection accuracy and robustness through refined feature enhancements and attention-guided strategies.

Abstract: Surface defect detection in industrial scenarios is both crucial and
technically demanding due to the wide variability in defect types, irregular
shapes and sizes, fine-grained requirements, and complex material textures.
Although recent advances in AI-based detectors have improved performance,
existing methods often suffer from redundant features, limited detail
sensitivity, and weak robustness under multiscale conditions. To address these
challenges, we propose YOLO-FDA, a novel YOLO-based detection framework that
integrates fine-grained detail enhancement and attention-guided feature fusion.
Specifically, we adopt a BiFPN-style architecture to strengthen bidirectional
multilevel feature aggregation within the YOLOv5 backbone. To better capture
fine structural changes, we introduce a Detail-directional Fusion Module (DDFM)
that introduces a directional asymmetric convolution in the second-lowest layer
to enrich spatial details and fuses the second-lowest layer with low-level
features to enhance semantic consistency. Furthermore, we propose two novel
attention-based fusion strategies, Attention-weighted Concatenation (AC) and
Cross-layer Attention Fusion (CAF) to improve contextual representation and
reduce feature noise. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate
that YOLO-FDA consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in
terms of both accuracy and robustness across diverse types of defects and
scales.

*Junwen Wang,Oscar Maccormac,William Rochford,Aaron Kujawa,Jonathan Shapey,Tom Vercauteren*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes semantic loss functions using hierarchical label organization for enhancing hyperspectral imaging-based surgical vision systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to overcome limitations of common learning methods that treat all segmentation errors equally, failing to exploit inter-class label semantics in hyperspectral imaging.

Method: The authors introduce two tree-based semantic loss functions, incorporating them into a framework for sparse, background-free annotations, and conduct experiments using a clinically organized label structure.

Result: The method achieves state-of-the-art performance on a dataset with 107 classes, creates effective out-of-distribution pixel detection, and maintains segmentation accuracy.

Conclusion: Incorporating hierarchical label semantics enables better segmentation and reliable OOD pixel detection in hyperspectral imaging for surgery.

Abstract: Hyperspectral imaging (HSI) shows great promise for surgical applications,
offering detailed insights into biological tissue differences beyond what the
naked eye can perceive. Refined labelling efforts are underway to train vision
systems to distinguish large numbers of subtly varying classes. However,
commonly used learning methods for biomedical segmentation tasks penalise all
errors equivalently and thus fail to exploit any inter-class semantics in the
label space. In this work, we introduce two tree-based semantic loss functions
which take advantage of a hierarchical organisation of the labels. We further
incorporate our losses in a recently proposed approach for training with
sparse, background-free annotations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our
proposed method reaches state-of-the-art performance on a sparsely annotated
HSI dataset comprising $107$ classes organised in a clinically-defined semantic
tree structure. Furthermore, our method enables effective detection of
out-of-distribution (OOD) pixels without compromising segmentation performance
on in-distribution (ID) pixels.

TL;DR: The study develops a deep-learning pipeline for automatic myocardial scar segmentation from cardiac MRI, overcoming label noise and data variability challenges to achieve superior accuracy and generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address challenges in myocardial scar segmentation from cardiac MRI, such as label noise, data heterogeneity, and class imbalance, which are crucial for accurate clinical assessment and treatment planning.

Method: This study uses a fine-tuned state-of-the-art deep-learning pipeline with Kullback-Leibler loss and extensive data augmentation to handle label noise and data variability. The method evaluates performance on acute and chronic cases.

Result: The proposed method outperforms models like nnU-Net, achieving accurate and smooth myocardial scar segmentations, and exhibits strong generalization across out-of-distribution test sets.

Conclusion: The deep-learning pipeline establishes a reliable foundation for automated myocardial scar quantification and supports the clinical adoption of deep learning in cardiac imaging.

Abstract: The accurate segmentation of myocardial scars from cardiac MRI is essential
for clinical assessment and treatment planning. In this study, we propose a
robust deep-learning pipeline for fully automated myocardial scar detection and
segmentation by fine-tuning state-of-the-art models. The method explicitly
addresses challenges of label noise from semi-automatic annotations, data
heterogeneity, and class imbalance through the use of Kullback-Leibler loss and
extensive data augmentation. We evaluate the model's performance on both acute
and chronic cases and demonstrate its ability to produce accurate and smooth
segmentations despite noisy labels. In particular, our approach outperforms
state-of-the-art models like nnU-Net and shows strong generalizability in an
out-of-distribution test set, highlighting its robustness across various
imaging conditions and clinical tasks. These results establish a reliable
foundation for automated myocardial scar quantification and support the broader
clinical adoption of deep learning in cardiac imaging.

*Pufan Li,Bi'an Du,Wei Hu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces a method for generating realistic 3D objects from single-view images by leveraging geometry and perception priors without requiring extra model training. It achieves superior multiview consistency and geometric detail.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing approaches for 3D object generation from single images suffer from poor multiview consistency and lack geometric detail.

Method: The method integrates geometry and perception priors by training Gaussian branches initialized from geometry prior, perception prior, and Gaussian noise. Refinements include interactions between priors and a reprojection-based strategy enforcing depth consistency.

Result: Experiments show that the proposed method achieves higher fidelity in 3D reconstruction and novel view synthesis, outperforming prior approaches.

Conclusion: The presented approach successfully generates detailed and consistent 3D objects from single-view images, addressing multiview consistency and geometric detail issues in existing methods.

Abstract: Generating realistic 3D objects from single-view images requires natural
appearance, 3D consistency, and the ability to capture multiple plausible
interpretations of unseen regions. Existing approaches often rely on
fine-tuning pretrained 2D diffusion models or directly generating 3D
information through fast network inference or 3D Gaussian Splatting, but their
results generally suffer from poor multiview consistency and lack geometric
detail. To takle these issues, we present a novel method that seamlessly
integrates geometry and perception priors without requiring additional model
training to reconstruct detailed 3D objects from a single image. Specifically,
we train three different Gaussian branches initialized from the geometry prior,
perception prior and Gaussian noise, respectively. The geometry prior captures
the rough 3D shapes, while the perception prior utilizes the 2D pretrained
diffusion model to enhance multiview information. Subsequently, we refine 3D
Gaussian branches through mutual interaction between geometry and perception
priors, further enhanced by a reprojection-based strategy that enforces depth
consistency. Experiments demonstrate the higher-fidelity reconstruction results
of our method, outperforming existing methods on novel view synthesis and 3D
reconstruction, demonstrating robust and consistent 3D object generation.

*Longkun Zou,Kangjun Liu,Ke Chen,Kailing Guo,Kui Jia,Yaowei Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes the Topology-Aware Modeling (TAM) framework to address the Sim2Real domain adaptation gap in 3D point cloud object classification by leveraging global spatial topology and an advanced self-training strategy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation arises from the challenges posed by significant geometric variations and the Sim2Real domain gap in 3D object shape classification, as current UDA methods fail to generalize due to overfitting to source domain patterns.

Method: The proposed TAM framework incorporates topology awareness to model global spatial topology and uses a novel self-supervised learning task. It also includes a robust self-training strategy combining cross-domain contrastive learning and pseudo-label noise reduction.

Result: Tested on three public Sim2Real benchmarks, TAM demonstrated consistent improvements in accuracy and generalization over existing state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: The TAM framework effectively mitigates the Sim2Real domain gap in 3D object point cloud classification, offering a significant advancement in UDA performance, with open-source code enabling further developments.

Abstract: Learning semantic representations from point sets of 3D object shapes is
often challenged by significant geometric variations, primarily due to
differences in data acquisition methods. Typically, training data is generated
using point simulators, while testing data is collected with distinct 3D
sensors, leading to a simulation-to-reality (Sim2Real) domain gap that limits
the generalization ability of point classifiers. Current unsupervised domain
adaptation (UDA) techniques struggle with this gap, as they often lack robust,
domain-insensitive descriptors capable of capturing global topological
information, resulting in overfitting to the limited semantic patterns of the
source domain. To address this issue, we introduce a novel Topology-Aware
Modeling (TAM) framework for Sim2Real UDA on object point clouds. Our approach
mitigates the domain gap by leveraging global spatial topology, characterized
by low-level, high-frequency 3D structures, and by modeling the topological
relations of local geometric features through a novel self-supervised learning
task. Additionally, we propose an advanced self-training strategy that combines
cross-domain contrastive learning with self-training, effectively reducing the
impact of noisy pseudo-labels and enhancing the robustness of the adaptation
process. Experimental results on three public Sim2Real benchmarks validate the
effectiveness of our TAM framework, showing consistent improvements over
state-of-the-art methods across all evaluated tasks. The source code of this
work will be available at https://github.com/zou-longkun/TAG.git.

*Minghao Qin,Yan Shu,Peitian Zhang,Kun Lun,Huaying Yuan,Juenjie Zhou,Shitao Xiao,Bo Zhao,Zheng Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Video-X^2L introduces a novel method for efficient long-video understanding by using bi-level key-value compression and selective re-loading, significantly reducing computational cost without sacrificing key information.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of prohibitive computational costs in long-video understanding tasks faced by multimodal large language models (MLLMs).

Method: Video-X^2L employs two main techniques: (1) bi-level key-value (KV) compression, creating both low-compression and high-compression KVs, and (2) selective KV re-loading, which dynamically switches between the two types during decoding depending on the task's needs.

Result: Video-X^2L outperforms existing KV-compression techniques by a significant margin across various long-video understanding benchmarks while also reducing computational overhead.

Conclusion: Video-X^2L provides an effective and efficient solution for long-video understanding tasks, fully compatible with existing KV-compressible MLLMs and requiring no additional training.

Abstract: Long-video understanding (LVU) remains a severe challenge for existing
multimodal large language models (MLLMs), primarily due to the prohibitive
computational cost. Recent approaches have explored KV compression to mitigate
this issue, but they often suffer from significant information loss at high
compression ratios. In this paper, we introduce Video-X^2L, which flexibly
preserves critical video information for each LVU task. Video-X^2L involves two
key operations. The first one is called bi-level KV compression. During the
MLLM's pre-filling stage, Video-X^2L generates two types of compressed KVs:
low-compression KVs (L-KVs) to capture fine-grained video details and
high-compression KVs (H-KVs) to offer compact video representations. The second
one is called selective KV re-loading. During the MLLM's decoding stage,
Video-X^2L selectively re-loads L-KVs for the most critical video chunks while
using H-KVs for other less important ones. This allows the MLLM to fully
utilize task-specific information while maintaining the overall compactness.
Video-X^2L is simple yet effective: it is free from additional training and
directly compatible with existing KV-compressible MLLMs. We evaluate Video-X^2L
with a variety of popular LVU benchmarks, including VideoMME, MLVU,
LongVideoBench, and VNBench. Our experiment result shows that Video-X^2L
outperforms existing KV-compression methods by a huge advantage while
substantially saving the computation cost.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces "GroundFlow," a module that significantly enhances temporal reasoning for sequential grounding in 3D point clouds (SG3D), outperforming existing models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the inability of existing 3D visual grounding (3DVG) methods to handle temporal and contextual information present in text instructions, especially pronouns like "it" and "the same," in sequential 3D object grounding tasks.

Method: The proposed method, GroundFlow, is a plug-in module that incorporates both short-term and long-term temporal reasoning into 3DVG methods, selectively extracting relevant historical information to enhance grounding accuracy.

Result: GroundFlow improves task accuracy by 7.5% and 10.2% in the SG3D benchmark and surpasses a 3D large language model pre-trained on diverse datasets.

Conclusion: GroundFlow effectively integrates temporal reasoning into 3DVG models, achieving state-of-the-art performance in SG3D benchmarks across five datasets.

Abstract: Sequential grounding in 3D point clouds (SG3D) refers to locating sequences
of objects by following text instructions for a daily activity with detailed
steps. Current 3D visual grounding (3DVG) methods treat text instructions with
multiple steps as a whole, without extracting useful temporal information from
each step. However, the instructions in SG3D often contain pronouns such as
"it", "here" and "the same" to make language expressions concise. This requires
grounding methods to understand the context and retrieve relevant information
from previous steps to correctly locate object sequences. Due to the lack of an
effective module for collecting related historical information,
state-of-the-art 3DVG methods face significant challenges in adapting to the
SG3D task. To fill this gap, we propose GroundFlow -- a plug-in module for
temporal reasoning on 3D point cloud sequential grounding. Firstly, we
demonstrate that integrating GroundFlow improves the task accuracy of 3DVG
baseline methods by a large margin (+7.5\% and +10.2\%) in the SG3D benchmark,
even outperforming a 3D large language model pre-trained on various datasets.
Furthermore, we selectively extract both short-term and long-term step
information based on its relevance to the current instruction, enabling
GroundFlow to take a comprehensive view of historical information and maintain
its temporal understanding advantage as step counts increase. Overall, our work
introduces temporal reasoning capabilities to existing 3DVG models and achieves
state-of-the-art performance in the SG3D benchmark across five datasets.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MedPrompt combines a few-shot prompted LLM and modular CNN for flexible and scalable medical imaging analysis, evaluated across multiple tasks and modalities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the limitations of existing medical image systems that lack flexibility and require separate models for classification and segmentation.

Method: The framework uses a few-shot prompted Large Language Model (LLM) for generating task-specific instructions and a modular Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for image processing. A weight routing mechanism is employed for scalability.

Result: MedPrompt achieves 97% task correctness, 2.5-second inference latency, competitive segmentation (Dice 0.9856) and classification (F1 0.9744) performance.

Conclusion: MedPrompt offers a scalable, efficient solution for medical imaging tasks by combining LLM interpretability with modular CNN efficiency.

Abstract: Current medical image analysis systems are typically task-specific, requiring
separate models for classification and segmentation, and lack the flexibility
to support user-defined workflows. To address these challenges, we introduce
MedPrompt, a unified framework that combines a few-shot prompted Large Language
Model (Llama-4-17B) for high-level task planning with a modular Convolutional
Neural Network (DeepFusionLab) for low-level image processing. The LLM
interprets user instructions and generates structured output to dynamically
route task-specific pretrained weights. This weight routing approach avoids
retraining the entire framework when adding new tasks-only task-specific
weights are required, enhancing scalability and deployment. We evaluated
MedPrompt across 19 public datasets, covering 12 tasks spanning 5 imaging
modalities. The system achieves a 97% end-to-end correctness in interpreting
and executing prompt-driven instructions, with an average inference latency of
2.5 seconds, making it suitable for near real-time applications. DeepFusionLab
achieves competitive segmentation accuracy (e.g., Dice 0.9856 on lungs) and
strong classification performance (F1 0.9744 on tuberculosis). Overall,
MedPrompt enables scalable, prompt-driven medical imaging by combining the
interpretability of LLMs with the efficiency of modular CNNs.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: BitMark introduces a robust watermarking method for Infinity, a state-of-the-art text-to-image model, addressing concerns about model collapse from training on generated content.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Preventing model collapse caused by repeated training on generated images, particularly as models increasingly reuse their own previous outputs.

Method: The paper proposes BitMark, embedding human-imperceptible watermarks at the bit level of token streams during image generation. It ensures robustness against removal methods and high traceability across model generations.

Result: BitMark successfully maintains visual fidelity and speed while embedding robust watermarks detectable even after fine-tuning on watermarked images.

Conclusion: The framework provides a reliable approach toward detecting generated content and mitigating risks associated with model collapse in generative image models.

Abstract: State-of-the-art text-to-image models like Infinity generate photorealistic
images at an unprecedented speed. These models operate in a bitwise
autoregressive manner over a discrete set of tokens that is practically
infinite in size. However, their impressive generative power comes with a
growing risk: as their outputs increasingly populate the Internet, they are
likely to be scraped and reused as training data-potentially by the very same
models. This phenomenon has been shown to lead to model collapse, where
repeated training on generated content, especially from the models' own
previous versions, causes a gradual degradation in performance. A promising
mitigation strategy is watermarking, which embeds human-imperceptible yet
detectable signals into generated images-enabling the identification of
generated content. In this work, we introduce BitMark, a robust bitwise
watermarking framework for Infinity. Our method embeds a watermark directly at
the bit level of the token stream across multiple scales (also referred to as
resolutions) during Infinity's image generation process. Our bitwise watermark
subtly influences the bits to preserve visual fidelity and generation speed
while remaining robust against a spectrum of removal techniques. Furthermore,
it exhibits high radioactivity, i.e., when watermarked generated images are
used to train another image generative model, this second model's outputs will
also carry the watermark. The radioactive traces remain detectable even when
only fine-tuning diffusion or image autoregressive models on images watermarked
with our BitMark. Overall, our approach provides a principled step toward
preventing model collapse in image generative models by enabling reliable
detection of generated outputs.

*Xiwei Xuan,Ziquan Deng,Kwan-Liu Ma*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes a new approach for training-free open-vocabulary semantic segmentation (OVS) focusing on data quality, outperforming existing methods using a data-quality-oriented framework.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the performance limitations in OVS caused by poor model reliance and suboptimal reference datasets, and to emphasize the significance of data quality in achieving better results in training-free tasks.

Method: The method introduces a framework centered around data quality and includes a specialized data pipeline for constructing a high-quality reference set with paired segment-text embeddings. A similarity-based retrieval process is then used to improve segmentation performance.

Result: Extensive tests show that the proposed method achieves superior results across ten benchmark datasets, surpassing current training-free OVS approaches.

Conclusion: The research highlights the critical role of data-quality in training-free OVS and demonstrates that a data-centric design can significantly enhance segmentation performance.

Abstract: Training-free open-vocabulary semantic segmentation (OVS) aims to segment
images given a set of arbitrary textual categories without costly model
fine-tuning. Existing solutions often explore attention mechanisms of
pre-trained models, such as CLIP, or generate synthetic data and design complex
retrieval processes to perform OVS. However, their performance is limited by
the capability of reliant models or the suboptimal quality of reference sets.
In this work, we investigate the largely overlooked data quality problem for
this challenging dense scene understanding task, and identify that a
high-quality reference set can significantly benefit training-free OVS. With
this observation, we introduce a data-quality-oriented framework, comprising a
data pipeline to construct a reference set with well-paired segment-text
embeddings and a simple similarity-based retrieval to unveil the essential
effect of data. Remarkably, extensive evaluations on ten benchmark datasets
demonstrate that our method outperforms all existing training-free OVS
approaches, highlighting the importance of data-centric design for advancing
OVS without training. Our code is available at https://github.com/xiweix/ReME .

*Umaima Rahman,Mohammad Yaqub,Dwarikanath Mahapatra*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces DiMPLe, a method for disentangling invariant and spurious features in multi-modal learning to improve generalization and robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the issue of spurious correlations in visual data which degrade out-of-distribution (OOD) performance.

Method: DiMPLe introduces multi-modal disentanglement by minimizing mutual information, regularizing spurious features, and using contrastive learning on invariant features.

Result: DiMPLe outperforms CoOp-OOD across 11 datasets, achieving significant improvements of 15.27 in base class accuracy and 44.31 in novel class accuracy.

Conclusion: DiMPLe effectively disentangles features across vision and language modalities, improving OOD performance and robustness to distribution shifts.

Abstract: We introduce DiMPLe (Disentangled Multi-Modal Prompt Learning), a novel
approach to disentangle invariant and spurious features across vision and
language modalities in multi-modal learning. Spurious correlations in visual
data often hinder out-of-distribution (OOD) performance. Unlike prior methods
focusing solely on image features, DiMPLe disentangles features within and
across modalities while maintaining consistent alignment, enabling better
generalization to novel classes and robustness to distribution shifts. Our
method combines three key objectives: (1) mutual information minimization
between invariant and spurious features, (2) spurious feature regularization,
and (3) contrastive learning on invariant features. Extensive experiments
demonstrate DiMPLe demonstrates superior performance compared to CoOp-OOD, when
averaged across 11 diverse datasets, and achieves absolute gains of 15.27 in
base class accuracy and 44.31 in novel class accuracy.

### [132] [Temporal Rate Reduction Clustering for Human Motion Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21249)
*Xianghan Meng,Zhengyu Tong,Zhiyuan Huang,Chun-Guang Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel method, Temporal Rate Reduction Clustering (TR^2C), for segmenting human motion in videos, outperforming existing techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current Human Motion Segmentation (HMS) methods struggle with complex motions and cluttered backgrounds, as they rely on the assumption that temporal data aligns with a Union-of-Subspaces (UoS) distribution.

Method: The proposed TR^2C method learns structured representations that are both temporally consistent and aligned with UoS to enhance the segmentation process.

Result: Experiments on five benchmark HMS datasets demonstrate that TR^2C achieves state-of-the-art performance, regardless of the feature extractor used.

Conclusion: TR^2C is an effective and robust method for HMS, overcoming limitations of existing approaches and excelling in various scenarios.

Abstract: Human Motion Segmentation (HMS), which aims to partition videos into
non-overlapping human motions, has attracted increasing research attention
recently. Existing approaches for HMS are mainly dominated by subspace
clustering methods, which are grounded on the assumption that high-dimensional
temporal data align with a Union-of-Subspaces (UoS) distribution. However, the
frames in video capturing complex human motions with cluttered backgrounds may
not align well with the UoS distribution. In this paper, we propose a novel
approach for HMS, named Temporal Rate Reduction Clustering
($\text{TR}^2\text{C}$), which jointly learns structured representations and
affinity to segment the frame sequences in video. Specifically, the structured
representations learned by $\text{TR}^2\text{C}$ maintain temporally consistent
and align well with a UoS structure, which is favorable for the HMS task. We
conduct extensive experiments on five benchmark HMS datasets and achieve
state-of-the-art performances with different feature extractors.

### [133] [DuET: Dual Incremental Object Detection via Exemplar-Free Task Arithmetic](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21260)
*Munish Monga,Vishal Chudasama,Pankaj Wasnik,Biplab Banerjee*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The study introduces DuET, a novel framework for Dual Incremental Object Detection (DuIOD), addressing the simultaneous challenges of class and domain shifts in object detection without using exemplars. It outperforms prior methods in both retaining learning and adapting to new tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current object detection methods deal with either learning new classes (CIOD) or adapting to new domains (DIOD) but struggle when both challenges arise simultaneously in practical settings.

Method: The authors propose DuET, a detector-agnostic framework featuring Task Arithmetic-based model merging and a Directional Consistency Loss to stabilize incremental learning and mitigate sign conflicts.

Result: DuET demonstrated a significant improvement in real-world scenarios, achieving over 13% RAI improvement on the Pascal Series and 11% on the Diverse Weather Series, surpassing existing methods in adaptability and retention.

Conclusion: DuET provides a viable solution for simultaneous class and domain incremental advancements in object detection while exhibiting strong reliability and adaptability, paving the way for practical applications in real-time detection systems.

Abstract: Real-world object detection systems, such as those in autonomous driving and
surveillance, must continuously learn new object categories and simultaneously
adapt to changing environmental conditions. Existing approaches, Class
Incremental Object Detection (CIOD) and Domain Incremental Object Detection
(DIOD) only address one aspect of this challenge. CIOD struggles in unseen
domains, while DIOD suffers from catastrophic forgetting when learning new
classes, limiting their real-world applicability. To overcome these
limitations, we introduce Dual Incremental Object Detection (DuIOD), a more
practical setting that simultaneously handles class and domain shifts in an
exemplar-free manner. We propose DuET, a Task Arithmetic-based model merging
framework that enables stable incremental learning while mitigating sign
conflicts through a novel Directional Consistency Loss. Unlike prior methods,
DuET is detector-agnostic, allowing models like YOLO11 and RT-DETR to function
as real-time incremental object detectors. To comprehensively evaluate both
retention and adaptation, we introduce the Retention-Adaptability Index (RAI),
which combines the Average Retention Index (Avg RI) for catastrophic forgetting
and the Average Generalization Index for domain adaptability into a common
ground. Extensive experiments on the Pascal Series and Diverse Weather Series
demonstrate DuET's effectiveness, achieving a +13.12% RAI improvement while
preserving 89.3% Avg RI on the Pascal Series (4 tasks), as well as a +11.39%
RAI improvement with 88.57% Avg RI on the Diverse Weather Series (3 tasks),
outperforming existing methods.

*Cheng Zou,Senlin Cheng,Bolei Xu,Dandan Zheng,Xiaobo Li,Jingdong Chen,Ming Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ViTI (Video Try-on Inpainter) proposes an approach to video virtual try-on by treating it as a video inpainting task, ensuring enhanced spatial-temporal consistency and garment detail preservation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing video virtual try-on methods suffer from spatial-temporal inconsistency and poor garment detail preservation when processing videos frame-by-frame.

Method: The authors formulate video try-on as a conditional video inpainting task using Diffusion Transformer with 3D spatial-temporal attention, incorporating masking strategies and multi-stage training.

Result: ViTI achieves significant improvements in spatial-temporal consistency and garment detail stability, outperforming previous methods quantitatively and qualitatively.

Conclusion: ViTI effectively integrates garment details and video generation principles, providing a more consistent and realistic video try-on experience compared to prior approaches.

Abstract: Video virtual try-on aims to naturally fit a garment to a target person in
consecutive video frames. It is a challenging task, on the one hand, the output
video should be in good spatial-temporal consistency, on the other hand, the
details of the given garment need to be preserved well in all the frames.
Naively using image-based try-on methods frame by frame can get poor results
due to severe inconsistency. Recent diffusion-based video try-on methods,
though very few, happen to coincide with a similar solution: inserting temporal
attention into image-based try-on model to adapt it for video try-on task,
which have shown improvements but there still exist inconsistency problems. In
this paper, we propose ViTI (Video Try-on Inpainter), formulate and implement
video virtual try-on as a conditional video inpainting task, which is different
from previous methods. In this way, we start with a video generation problem
instead of an image-based try-on problem, which from the beginning has a better
spatial-temporal consistency. Specifically, at first we build a video
inpainting framework based on Diffusion Transformer with full 3D
spatial-temporal attention, and then we progressively adapt it for video
garment inpainting, with a collection of masking strategies and multi-stage
training. After these steps, the model can inpaint the masked garment area with
appropriate garment pixels according to the prompt with good spatial-temporal
consistency. Finally, as other try-on methods, garment condition is added to
the model to make sure the inpainted garment appearance and details are as
expected. Both quantitative and qualitative experimental results show that ViTI
is superior to previous works.

*Wenda Shi,Yiren Song,Zihan Rao,Dengming Zhang,Jiaming Liu,Xingxing Zou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper addresses the challenge of precise word-level typography control in generated images by proposing the Text-Image Alignment (TIA) framework and WordCon, a parameter-efficient fine-tuning approach.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to improve control over word-level typography in image generation, a persistent problem in text-to-image synthesis.

Method: They construct a word-level controlled dataset, introduce the TIA framework leveraging cross-modal correspondence, propose WordCon for fine-tuning, and implement masked and joint-attention losses for better controllability.

Result: The proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art techniques in both qualitative and quantitative evaluations.

Conclusion: The new techniques enhance typography control and flexibility in multiple applications, with datasets and code available for academic use.

Abstract: Achieving precise word-level typography control within generated images
remains a persistent challenge. To address it, we newly construct a word-level
controlled scene text dataset and introduce the Text-Image Alignment (TIA)
framework. This framework leverages cross-modal correspondence between text and
local image regions provided by grounding models to enhance the Text-to-Image
(T2I) model training. Furthermore, we propose WordCon, a hybrid
parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) method. WordCon reparameterizes
selective key parameters, improving both efficiency and portability. This
allows seamless integration into diverse pipelines, including artistic text
rendering, text editing, and image-conditioned text rendering. To further
enhance controllability, the masked loss at the latent level is applied to
guide the model to concentrate on learning the text region in the image, and
the joint-attention loss provides feature-level supervision to promote
disentanglement between different words. Both qualitative and quantitative
results demonstrate the superiority of our method to the state of the art. The
datasets and source code will be available for academic use.

*Diego Biagini,Nassir Navab,Azade Farshad*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces HieraSurg, a surgical video generation framework leveraging a two-stage diffusion model to ensure factual and fine-grained video synthesis, outperforming existing methods qualitatively and quantitatively.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing surgical video synthesis approaches lack consistency with surgical actions and phases due to limited understanding and fine-grained guidance, necessitating a more structured generation framework.

Method: The proposed framework uses two diffusion models: the first predicts coarse semantic changes via segmentation, while the second enriches these maps with fine visual textures to ensure detailed and phase-consistent video generation.

Result: Experimental results on Cholecystectomy videos confirm that HieraSurg performs better in terms of quality, consistency, and generalization while achieving higher frame-rate output compared to prior approaches.

Conclusion: HieraSurg demonstrates strong potential for factual and practical surgical simulations, showing fine-grained adherence and improved video generation capabilities, especially with pre-existing segmentation inputs.

Abstract: Surgical Video Synthesis has emerged as a promising research direction
following the success of diffusion models in general-domain video generation.
Although existing approaches achieve high-quality video generation, most are
unconditional and fail to maintain consistency with surgical actions and
phases, lacking the surgical understanding and fine-grained guidance necessary
for factual simulation. We address these challenges by proposing HieraSurg, a
hierarchy-aware surgical video generation framework consisting of two
specialized diffusion models. Given a surgical phase and an initial frame,
HieraSurg first predicts future coarse-grained semantic changes through a
segmentation prediction model. The final video is then generated by a
second-stage model that augments these temporal segmentation maps with
fine-grained visual features, leading to effective texture rendering and
integration of semantic information in the video space. Our approach leverages
surgical information at multiple levels of abstraction, including surgical
phase, action triplets, and panoptic segmentation maps. The experimental
results on Cholecystectomy Surgical Video Generation demonstrate that the model
significantly outperforms prior work both quantitatively and qualitatively,
showing strong generalization capabilities and the ability to generate higher
frame-rate videos. The model exhibits particularly fine-grained adherence when
provided with existing segmentation maps, suggesting its potential for
practical surgical applications.

*Lars Möllenbrok,Behnood Rasti,Begüm Demir*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces CoSMAE, a continual self-supervised learning method using masked autoencoders to tackle catastrophic forgetting in remote sensing tasks. CoSMAE leverages data and model mixup strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing continual learning methods in remote sensing rely on abundant labeled data, which is costly and often unrealistic. There's a need for self-supervised approaches to address catastrophic forgetting in scenarios with limited labeled data.

Method: The CoSMAE framework integrates two novel components: (i) data mixup to combine new and old task data distributions, and (ii) model mixup knowledge distillation to interpolate past and present model weights for better knowledge transfer.

Result: Experimental evaluations indicate CoSMAE significantly outperforms state-of-the-art continual learning methods applied to masked autoencoders, with performance gains of up to 4.94%.

Conclusion: CoSMAE effectively mitigates catastrophic forgetting while enhancing generalization across tasks, making it a promising approach for continual learning in remote sensing. Its publicly available code ensures further research and reproducibility.

Abstract: The development of continual learning (CL) methods, which aim to learn new
tasks in a sequential manner from the training data acquired continuously, has
gained great attention in remote sensing (RS). The existing CL methods in RS,
while learning new tasks, enhance robustness towards catastrophic forgetting.
This is achieved by using a large number of labeled training samples, which is
costly and not always feasible to gather in RS. To address this problem, we
propose a novel continual self-supervised learning method in the context of
masked autoencoders (denoted as CoSMAE). The proposed CoSMAE consists of two
components: i) data mixup; and ii) model mixup knowledge distillation. Data
mixup is associated with retaining information on previous data distributions
by interpolating images from the current task with those from the previous
tasks. Model mixup knowledge distillation is associated with distilling
knowledge from past models and the current model simultaneously by
interpolating their model weights to form a teacher for the knowledge
distillation. The two components complement each other to regularize the MAE at
the data and model levels to facilitate better generalization across tasks and
reduce the risk of catastrophic forgetting. Experimental results show that
CoSMAE achieves significant improvements of up to 4.94% over state-of-the-art
CL methods applied to MAE. Our code is publicly available at:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the challenge of visual grounding in complex, multilingual document images, emphasizing interpretability and precision in VQA systems.

Method: The authors propose a multi-granular approach integrating multilingual OCR, large language models, and a new region matching algorithm. They also created a benchmark dataset for fine-grained grounding across various granularities.

Result: Drishtikon achieves state-of-the-art grounding accuracy, with the best balance between precision and recall at the line-level granularity. It also demonstrates superior performance compared to existing vision-language models.

Conclusion: The proposed structured, alignment-based approach provides more accurate and interpretable grounding for document understanding, setting a foundation for improved real-world applications.

Abstract: Visual grounding in text-rich document images is a critical yet underexplored
challenge for document intelligence and visual question answering (VQA)
systems. We present \drishtikon, a multi-granular visual grounding framework
designed to enhance interpretability and trust in VQA for complex, multilingual
documents. Our approach integrates robust multi-lingual OCR, large language
models, and a novel region matching algorithm to accurately localize answer
spans at block, line, word, and point levels. We curate a new benchmark from
the CircularsVQA test set, providing fine-grained, human-verified annotations
across multiple granularities. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our
method achieves state-of-the-art grounding accuracy, with line-level
granularity offering the best trade-off between precision and recall. Ablation
studies further highlight the benefits of multi-block and multi-line reasoning.
Comparative evaluations with leading vision-language models reveal the
limitations of current VLMs in precise localization, underscoring the
effectiveness of our structured, alignment-based approach. Our findings pave
the way for more robust and interpretable document understanding systems in
real-world, text-centric scenarios. Code and dataset has been made available at

*Jacopo Dapueto,Nicoletta Noceti,Francesca Odone*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper explores the transfer of disentangled representations learned from synthetic to real data and introduces a new metric for evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome limitations in disentangled representation learning on real images due to correlated generative factors, resolution issues, and limited ground truth labels.

Method: Leveraging synthetic data for disentangled representation learning, fine-tuning for transfer to real data, and evaluating outcomes using a novel intervention-based metric.

Result: The study finds that disentangled representations learned from synthetic data can be transferred to real data and shows the effectiveness of this transfer under certain conditions.

Conclusion: Disentanglement from synthetic to real data is achievable to some extent, aided by a new metric for quality evaluation.

Abstract: Developing meaningful and efficient representations that separate the
fundamental structure of the data generation mechanism is crucial in
representation learning. However, Disentangled Representation Learning has not
fully shown its potential on real images, because of correlated generative
factors, their resolution and limited access to ground truth labels.
Specifically on the latter, we investigate the possibility of leveraging
synthetic data to learn general-purpose disentangled representations applicable
to real data, discussing the effect of fine-tuning and what properties of
disentanglement are preserved after the transfer. We provide an extensive
empirical study to address these issues. In addition, we propose a new
interpretable intervention-based metric, to measure the quality of factors
encoding in the representation. Our results indicate that some level of
disentanglement, transferring a representation from synthetic to real data, is
possible and effective.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a method to integrate human keypoints with other visual features to improve vision-language models on human-centric tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current vision-language models lack specialized data for complex human pose and action tasks, leading to inadequate performance.

Method: The authors created a dataset of 200,328 samples integrating human keypoints, captions, and bounding boxes, and fine-tuned the LLaVA-1.5-7B model using this data.

Result: The proposed LLaVA-Pose model showed significant improvements, with a 33.2% performance boost over the original model in the E-HPAUB benchmark.

Conclusion: Incorporating human keypoint data can substantially enhance the capabilities of vision-language models for human-centric visual tasks.

Abstract: Current vision-language models (VLMs) are well-adapted for general visual
understanding tasks. However, they perform inadequately when handling complex
visual tasks related to human poses and actions due to the lack of specialized
vision-language instruction-following data. We introduce a method for
generating such data by integrating human keypoints with traditional visual
features such as captions and bounding boxes, enabling more precise
understanding of human-centric scenes. Our approach constructs a dataset
comprising 200,328 samples tailored to fine-tune models for human-centric
tasks, focusing on three areas: conversation, detailed description, and complex
reasoning. We establish an Extended Human Pose and Action Understanding
Benchmark (E-HPAUB) to assess model performance on human pose and action
understanding. We fine-tune the LLaVA-1.5-7B model using this dataset and
evaluate our resulting LLaVA-Pose model on the benchmark, achieving significant
improvements. Experimental results show an overall improvement of 33.2%
compared to the original LLaVA-1.5-7B model. These findings highlight the
effectiveness of keypoint-integrated data in enhancing multimodal models for
human-centric visual understanding. Code is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel hierarchical state space model to analyze robot-assisted surgical workflows for full-length videos efficiently, overcoming challenges of quadratic attention in transformer models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Robot-assisted surgeries generate prolonged video data, but existing models struggle with analyzing such data due to computational inefficiencies and limitations in capturing both local and global video dynamics.

Method: The authors develop a hierarchical input-dependent state space model with two modules: local-aggregation for fine-grained dynamics and global-relation for overarching temporal dependencies. A hybrid discrete-continuous supervision strategy is used for training.

Result: The proposed method achieves significant performance improvements over state-of-the-art methods, boasting a +2.8% improvement on the Cholec80 dataset, +4.3% on MICCAI2016, and +12.9% on Heichole datasets.

Conclusion: This framework demonstrates superior performance in extensive video analysis of surgical workflows, providing a resource-efficient and accurate method for capturing temporal dynamics for such applications.

Abstract: Surgical workflow analysis is essential in robot-assisted surgeries, yet the
long duration of such procedures poses significant challenges for comprehensive
video analysis. Recent approaches have predominantly relied on transformer
models; however, their quadratic attention mechanism restricts efficient
processing of lengthy surgical videos. In this paper, we propose a novel
hierarchical input-dependent state space model that leverages the linear
scaling property of state space models to enable decision making on full-length
videos while capturing both local and global dynamics. Our framework
incorporates a temporally consistent visual feature extractor, which appends a
state space model head to a visual feature extractor to propagate temporal
information. The proposed model consists of two key modules: a
local-aggregation state space model block that effectively captures intricate
local dynamics, and a global-relation state space model block that models
temporal dependencies across the entire video. The model is trained using a
hybrid discrete-continuous supervision strategy, where both signals of discrete
phase labels and continuous phase progresses are propagated through the
network. Experiments have shown that our method outperforms the current
state-of-the-art methods by a large margin (+2.8% on Cholec80, +4.3% on
MICCAI2016, and +12.9% on Heichole datasets). Code will be publicly available
after paper acceptance.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper presents PanSt3R, a novel approach for panoptic segmentation of 3D scenes using unposed 2D images, achieving state-of-the-art performance without needing computationally expensive test-time optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing techniques for panoptic segmentation of 3D scenes rely on 2D panoptic segmentation from per-frame images, which doesn't fully utilize 3D spatial relationships and requires extensive computation during test-time.

Method: PanSt3R proposes an integrated approach that simultaneously predicts 3D geometry and multi-view panoptic segmentation in a single pass. Built on MUSt3R, it incorporates semantic awareness, improved post-processing for mask merging, and a novel-view generation method.

Result: PanSt3R significantly improves performance benchmarks for 3D panoptic segmentation while being much faster compared to current methods.

Conclusion: PanSt3R is a fast, scalable, and conceptually straightforward solution that advances the field of 3D panoptic segmentation by overcoming limitations of prior approaches.

Abstract: Panoptic segmentation of 3D scenes, involving the segmentation and
classification of object instances in a dense 3D reconstruction of a scene, is
a challenging problem, especially when relying solely on unposed 2D images.
Existing approaches typically leverage off-the-shelf models to extract
per-frame 2D panoptic segmentations, before optimizing an implicit geometric
representation (often based on NeRF) to integrate and fuse the 2D predictions.
We argue that relying on 2D panoptic segmentation for a problem inherently 3D
and multi-view is likely suboptimal as it fails to leverage the full potential
of spatial relationships across views. In addition to requiring camera
parameters, these approaches also necessitate computationally expensive
test-time optimization for each scene. Instead, in this work, we propose a
unified and integrated approach PanSt3R, which eliminates the need for
test-time optimization by jointly predicting 3D geometry and multi-view
panoptic segmentation in a single forward pass. Our approach builds upon recent
advances in 3D reconstruction, specifically upon MUSt3R, a scalable multi-view
version of DUSt3R, and enhances it with semantic awareness and multi-view
panoptic segmentation capabilities. We additionally revisit the standard
post-processing mask merging procedure and introduce a more principled approach
for multi-view segmentation. We also introduce a simple method for generating
novel-view predictions based on the predictions of PanSt3R and vanilla 3DGS.
Overall, the proposed PanSt3R is conceptually simple, yet fast and scalable,
and achieves state-of-the-art performance on several benchmarks, while being
orders of magnitude faster than existing methods.

*Yizhe Cheng,Chunxun Tian,Haoru Wang,Wentao Zhu,Xiaoxuan Ma,Yizhou Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a novel physics-informed framework for solving Electromagnetic Inverse Scattering Problems (EISP), addressing major limitations of previous methods with improved generalization, accuracy, and robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for solving electromagnetic inverse scattering problems fail to generalize to unseen data, often require case-specific optimization, and struggle under sparse transmitter configurations, which limits their practical applicability.

Method: The authors reformulate EISP as a two-stage process involving a current estimator and a permittivity solver. This decouples the nonlinear scattering process from the ill-posed inverse problem, enabling data-driven training and feed-forward predictions.

Result: The proposed framework consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of reconstruction accuracy, generalization to new data, and robustness under sparse transmitter setups.

Conclusion: This work provides a physics-driven solution for EISP that not only enhances accuracy and generalization but also represents a transformative step towards practical, cost-effective solutions for electromagnetic imaging.

Abstract: Solving Electromagnetic Inverse Scattering Problems (EISP) is fundamental in
applications such as medical imaging, where the goal is to reconstruct the
relative permittivity from scattered electromagnetic field. This inverse
process is inherently ill-posed and highly nonlinear, making it particularly
challenging. A recent machine learning-based approach, Img-Interiors, shows
promising results by leveraging continuous implicit functions. However, it
requires case-specific optimization, lacks generalization to unseen data, and
fails under sparse transmitter setups (e.g., with only one transmitter). To
address these limitations, we revisit EISP from a physics-informed perspective,
reformulating it as a two stage inverse transmission-scattering process. This
formulation reveals the induced current as a generalizable intermediate
representation, effectively decoupling the nonlinear scattering process from
the ill-posed inverse problem. Built on this insight, we propose the first
generalizable physics-driven framework for EISP, comprising a current estimator
and a permittivity solver, working in an end-to-end manner. The current
estimator explicitly learns the induced current as a physical bridge between
the incident and scattered field, while the permittivity solver computes the
relative permittivity directly from the estimated induced current. This design
enables data-driven training and generalizable feed-forward prediction of
relative permittivity on unseen data while maintaining strong robustness to
transmitter sparsity. Extensive experiments show that our method outperforms
state-of-the-art approaches in reconstruction accuracy, generalization, and
robustness. This work offers a fundamentally new perspective on electromagnetic
inverse scattering and represents a major step toward cost-effective practical
solutions for electromagnetic imaging.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces ShotBench and ShotQA, benchmarks and datasets for evaluating vision-language models on cinematic grammar understanding, revealing limitations in current models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the lack of robust evaluation and understanding of cinematic grammar in Vision-Language Models, which limits precision in AI-assisted video generation.

Method: The authors developed ShotBench with expert-annotated QA pairs, evaluated 24 leading VLMs, created ShotQA with 70k QA pairs, and introduced ShotVL using fine-tuning and optimization methods.

Result: ShotVL achieves state-of-the-art performance on ShotBench, outperforming existing models in cinematic grammar comprehension.

Conclusion: The study highlights significant VLM limitations and proposes benchmarks, datasets, and models to advance AI-driven cinematic understanding, openly providing their resources for further development.

Abstract: Cinematography, the fundamental visual language of film, is essential for
conveying narrative, emotion, and aesthetic quality. While recent
Vision-Language Models (VLMs) demonstrate strong general visual understanding,
their proficiency in comprehending the nuanced cinematic grammar embedded
within individual shots remains largely unexplored and lacks robust evaluation.
This critical gap limits both fine-grained visual comprehension and the
precision of AI-assisted video generation. To address this, we introduce
\textbf{ShotBench}, a comprehensive benchmark specifically designed for
cinematic language understanding. It features over 3.5k expert-annotated QA
pairs from images and video clips, meticulously curated from over 200 acclaimed
(predominantly Oscar-nominated) films and spanning eight key cinematography
dimensions. Our evaluation of 24 leading VLMs on ShotBench reveals their
substantial limitations: even the top-performing model achieves less than 60\%
average accuracy, particularly struggling with fine-grained visual cues and
complex spatial reasoning. To catalyze advancement in this domain, we construct
\textbf{ShotQA}, a large-scale multimodal dataset comprising approximately 70k
cinematic QA pairs. Leveraging ShotQA, we develop \textbf{ShotVL} through
supervised fine-tuning and Group Relative Policy Optimization. ShotVL
significantly outperforms all existing open-source and proprietary models on
ShotBench, establishing new \textbf{state-of-the-art} performance. We
open-source our models, data, and code to foster rapid progress in this crucial
area of AI-driven cinematic understanding and generation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of accurate scene graph data and improve scene understanding through detailed and hypothetical relational annotations.

Method: The authors create CoPa-SG, a synthetic dataset with exhaustive annotations, and propose parametric relations (fine-grained details like angles) and proto-relations (hypothetical relations).

Result: Using CoPa-SG, the authors assessed various scene graph generation models and demonstrated improvements in downstream applications through the new relation types.

Conclusion: CoPa-SG provides a robust framework for enhancing scene graph generation and applications by introducing precise data and innovative relation concepts.

Abstract: 2D scene graphs provide a structural and explainable framework for scene
understanding. However, current work still struggles with the lack of accurate
scene graph data. To overcome this data bottleneck, we present CoPa-SG, a
synthetic scene graph dataset with highly precise ground truth and exhaustive
relation annotations between all objects. Moreover, we introduce parametric and
proto-relations, two new fundamental concepts for scene graphs. The former
provides a much more fine-grained representation than its traditional
counterpart by enriching relations with additional parameters such as angles or
distances. The latter encodes hypothetical relations in a scene graph and
describes how relations would form if new objects are placed in the scene.
Using CoPa-SG, we compare the performance of various scene graph generation
models. We demonstrate how our new relation types can be integrated in
downstream applications to enhance planning and reasoning capabilities.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces novel methods to improve image-to-point cloud registration accuracy by addressing feature channel attention differences and redundant correspondences.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the issues of degraded matching due to feature channel attention differences and redundant correspondences that impair image-to-point cloud registration.

Method: They propose two modules: Channel Adaptive Adjustment (CAA) for enhancing intra-modal features and suppressing cross-modal sensitivity, and Global Optimal Selection (GOS) to replace local selection with global optimization.

Result: Experiments on RGB-D Scenes V2 and 7-Scenes datasets show the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance in image-to-point cloud registration.

Conclusion: Channel Adaptive Adjustment and Global Optimal Selection modules effectively enhance cross-modal matching and improve registration accuracy, providing a significant step forward in the field.

Abstract: Detection-free methods typically follow a coarse-to-fine pipeline, extracting
image and point cloud features for patch-level matching and refining dense
pixel-to-point correspondences. However, differences in feature channel
attention between images and point clouds may lead to degraded matching
results, ultimately impairing registration accuracy. Furthermore, similar
structures in the scene could lead to redundant correspondences in cross-modal
matching. To address these issues, we propose Channel Adaptive Adjustment
Module (CAA) and Global Optimal Selection Module (GOS). CAA enhances
intra-modal features and suppresses cross-modal sensitivity, while GOS replaces
local selection with global optimization. Experiments on RGB-D Scenes V2 and
7-Scenes demonstrate the superiority of our method, achieving state-of-the-art
performance in image-to-point cloud registration.

### [148] [FastRef:Fast Prototype Refinement for Few-Shot Industrial Anomaly Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21398)
*Long Tian,Yufei Li,Yuyang Dai,Wenchao Chen,Xiyang Liu,Bo Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces FastRef, a novel and efficient framework to enhance prototype representativeness in few-shot industrial anomaly detection (FS-IAD), particularly under limited-data conditions. The method refines prototypes through characteristic transfer and anomaly suppression.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: FS-IAD poses challenges in automated inspection systems operating with scarce data. Current methods fail to systematically incorporate query image statistics, limiting the effectiveness of prototype representativeness. This gap necessitated the development of a solution to improve detection capabilities.

Method: The authors propose FastRef, which iteratively refines prototypes in two stages: (1) characteristic transfer from query features to prototypes using an optimizable transformation matrix through linear reconstruction, and (2) anomaly suppression via prototype alignment using optimal transport.

Result: FastRef is integrated with leading FS-IAD approaches (PatchCore, FastRecon, WinCLIP, and AnomalyDINO) and tested on a range of benchmarks (MVTec, ViSA, MPDD, RealIAD). The experiments demonstrate its superior effectiveness and computational efficiency under diverse few-shot scenarios.

Conclusion: FastRef successfully addresses limitations in FS-IAD by refining prototypes, leveraging query image statistics, and enhancing anomaly detection capabilities in data-scarce environments while maintaining computational efficiency.

Abstract: Few-shot industrial anomaly detection (FS-IAD) presents a critical challenge
for practical automated inspection systems operating in data-scarce
environments. While existing approaches predominantly focus on deriving
prototypes from limited normal samples, they typically neglect to
systematically incorporate query image statistics to enhance prototype
representativeness. To address this issue, we propose FastRef, a novel and
efficient prototype refinement framework for FS-IAD. Our method operates
through an iterative two-stage process: (1) characteristic transfer from query
features to prototypes via an optimizable transformation matrix, and (2)
anomaly suppression through prototype alignment. The characteristic transfer is
achieved through linear reconstruction of query features from prototypes, while
the anomaly suppression addresses a key observation in FS-IAD that unlike
conventional IAD with abundant normal prototypes, the limited-sample setting
makes anomaly reconstruction more probable. Therefore, we employ optimal
transport (OT) for non-Gaussian sampled features to measure and minimize the
gap between prototypes and their refined counterparts for anomaly suppression.
For comprehensive evaluation, we integrate FastRef with three competitive
prototype-based FS-IAD methods: PatchCore, FastRecon, WinCLIP, and AnomalyDINO.
Extensive experiments across four benchmark datasets of MVTec, ViSA, MPDD and
RealIAD demonstrate both the effectiveness and computational efficiency of our
approach under 1/2/4-shots.

### [149] [Curve-Aware Gaussian Splatting for 3D Parametric Curve Reconstruction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21401)
*Zhirui Gao. Renjiao Yi,Yaqiao Dai,Xuening Zhu,Wei Chen,Chenyang Zhu,Kai Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel one-stage framework for directly reconstructing 3D parametric curves from 2D multi-view edge maps, which improves efficiency and accuracy compared to traditional two-stage methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To eliminate errors caused by the optimization gap in two-stage methods for 3D curve reconstruction and improve accuracy and efficiency in producing robust reconstructions.

Method: The approach uses a bi-directional coupling mechanism linking parametric curves with edge-oriented Gaussian components, forming a CurveGaussian representation for differentiable rendering. It also employs dynamic topology optimization for refining curve structures during training.

Result: Evaluations on the ABC dataset and real-world benchmarks show the method delivers cleaner, more robust reconstructions and reduces parameter counts, achieving higher efficiency and superior performance compared to alternatives.

Conclusion: Direct optimization of parametric curves offers a significant improvement in reconstruction quality, efficiency, and robustness, demonstrating the viability of the proposed one-stage framework.

Abstract: This paper presents an end-to-end framework for reconstructing 3D parametric
curves directly from multi-view edge maps. Contrasting with existing two-stage
methods that follow a sequential ``edge point cloud reconstruction and
parametric curve fitting'' pipeline, our one-stage approach optimizes 3D
parametric curves directly from 2D edge maps, eliminating error accumulation
caused by the inherent optimization gap between disconnected stages. However,
parametric curves inherently lack suitability for rendering-based multi-view
optimization, necessitating a complementary representation that preserves their
geometric properties while enabling differentiable rendering. We propose a
novel bi-directional coupling mechanism between parametric curves and
edge-oriented Gaussian components. This tight correspondence formulates a
curve-aware Gaussian representation, \textbf{CurveGaussian}, that enables
differentiable rendering of 3D curves, allowing direct optimization guided by
multi-view evidence. Furthermore, we introduce a dynamically adaptive topology
optimization framework during training to refine curve structures through
linearization, merging, splitting, and pruning operations. Comprehensive
evaluations on the ABC dataset and real-world benchmarks demonstrate our
one-stage method's superiority over two-stage alternatives, particularly in
producing cleaner and more robust reconstructions. Additionally, by directly
optimizing parametric curves, our method significantly reduces the parameter
count during training, achieving both higher efficiency and superior
performance compared to existing approaches.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: XVerse is a new model addressing challenges in text-to-image generation, enabling fine control over multiple subjects with high fidelity and editability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To tackle issues like artifacts and attribute entanglement in multi-subject text-to-image generation while ensuring editability and coherence.

Method: Transforms reference images into token-specific offsets for text-stream modulation to allow precise and separate control over individual subjects.

Result: Achieves high-fidelity, editable multi-subject image synthesis with robust control over subject characteristics and semantic attributes.

Conclusion: XVerse substantially advances the field of personalized and complex scene image generation with improved control and quality.

Abstract: Achieving fine-grained control over subject identity and semantic attributes
(pose, style, lighting) in text-to-image generation, particularly for multiple
subjects, often undermines the editability and coherence of Diffusion
Transformers (DiTs). Many approaches introduce artifacts or suffer from
attribute entanglement. To overcome these challenges, we propose a novel
multi-subject controlled generation model XVerse. By transforming reference
images into offsets for token-specific text-stream modulation, XVerse allows
for precise and independent control for specific subject without disrupting
image latents or features. Consequently, XVerse offers high-fidelity, editable
multi-subject image synthesis with robust control over individual subject
characteristics and semantic attributes. This advancement significantly
improves personalized and complex scene generation capabilities.

*Samuel Joutard,Marijn Stollenga,Marc Balle Sanchez,Mohammad Farid Azampour,Raphael Prevost*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HyperSORT introduces a hyper-network approach to address heterogeneous biases in medical imaging datasets, enabling robust segmentation through latent space organization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Medical imaging datasets are often plagued by biases and labeling inconsistencies, which challenge the performance of deep segmentation networks.

Method: HyperSORT employs a hyper-network that predicts UNet parameters from latent vectors representing image and annotation variability, jointly learning network parameters and dataset-specific latent vectors.

Result: The method demonstrated its ability to identify systematic biases and erroneous samples, validated on the AMOS and TotalSegmentator datasets. Latent space clusters supported relevant bias analysis.

Conclusion: HyperSORT provides a framework to map biases in complex datasets, improving segmentation performance and dataset understanding, with code and analyses publicly available.

Abstract: Medical imaging datasets often contain heterogeneous biases ranging from
erroneous labels to inconsistent labeling styles. Such biases can negatively
impact deep segmentation networks performance. Yet, the identification and
characterization of such biases is a particularly tedious and challenging task.
In this paper, we introduce HyperSORT, a framework using a hyper-network
predicting UNets' parameters from latent vectors representing both the image
and annotation variability. The hyper-network parameters and the latent vector
collection corresponding to each data sample from the training set are jointly
learned. Hence, instead of optimizing a single neural network to fit a dataset,
HyperSORT learns a complex distribution of UNet parameters where low density
areas can capture noise-specific patterns while larger modes robustly segment
organs in differentiated but meaningful manners. We validate our method on two
3D abdominal CT public datasets: first a synthetically perturbed version of the
AMOS dataset, and TotalSegmentator, a large scale dataset containing real
unknown biases and errors. Our experiments show that HyperSORT creates a
structured mapping of the dataset allowing the identification of relevant
systematic biases and erroneous samples. Latent space clusters yield UNet
parameters performing the segmentation task in accordance with the underlying
learned systematic bias. The code and our analysis of the TotalSegmentator
dataset are made available: https://github.com/ImFusionGmbH/HyperSORT

TL;DR: This paper investigates deep learning methods to automate the classification of atypical mitotic figures (AMF) in breast cancer, achieving promising accuracy using advanced model fine-tuning techniques like LoRA.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Atypical mitoses can indicate tumor malignancy and serve as a prognostic marker, yet they are difficult to identify due to their rarity, subtle differences from normal mitoses, and challenges such as class imbalance and inter-rater disagreement.

Method: The study develops a benchmark for AMF classification, comparing baseline deep learning models, foundation models with linear probing, and foundation models fine-tuned with Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA). It also introduces two new datasets for rigorous evaluation: AtNorM-Br and AtNorM-MD.

Result: The LoRA-based adaptation of foundation models performed well, achieving up to 0.8135, 0.7696, and 0.7705 balanced accuracy on the AMi-Br, AtNorM-Br, and AtNorM-MD datasets respectively.

Conclusion: This study demonstrates that recent transfer learning advancements like LoRA can successfully tackle the challenging problem of atypical mitosis classification, providing significant improvements in accuracy.

Abstract: Atypical mitoses mark a deviation in the cell division process that can be an
independent prognostically relevant marker for tumor malignancy. However, their
identification remains challenging due to low prevalence, at times subtle
morphological differences from normal mitoses, low inter-rater agreement among
pathologists, and class imbalance in datasets. Building on the Atypical Mitosis
dataset for Breast Cancer (AMi-Br), this study presents a comprehensive
benchmark comparing deep learning approaches for automated atypical mitotic
figure (AMF) classification, including baseline models, foundation models with
linear probing, and foundation models fine-tuned with low-rank adaptation
(LoRA). For rigorous evaluation, we further introduce two new hold-out AMF
datasets - AtNorM-Br, a dataset of mitoses from the The TCGA breast cancer
cohort, and AtNorM-MD, a multi-domain dataset of mitoses from the MIDOG++
training set. We found average balanced accuracy values of up to 0.8135,
0.7696, and 0.7705 on the in-domain AMi-Br and the out-of-domain AtNorm-Br and
AtNorM-MD datasets, respectively, with the results being particularly good for
LoRA-based adaptation of the Virchow-line of foundation models. Our work shows
that atypical mitosis classification, while being a challenging problem, can be
effectively addressed through the use of recent advances in transfer learning
and model fine-tuning techniques. We make available all code and data used in
this paper in this github repository:

*Mohamed Omran,Dimitris Kalatzis,Jens Petersen,Amirhossein Habibian,Auke Wiggers*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper presents a method for precise object placement in images by using a visual map and coarse object masks, resolving ambiguities while preserving background details.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of accurately placing objects in images with precise location and orientation without requiring intricate inpainting masks or prompts.

Method: A visual map is combined with coarse object masks to create a conditioning signal for a text-conditioned generative inpainting model, enabling controlled object placement while leaving the background untouched.

Result: The method effectively places objects in novel locations and poses in the automotive context, achieving high-quality edits in terms of appearance and spatial accuracy, including scenarios with complex shape variations.

Conclusion: The proposed approach enables precise object placement and orientation in images, proving effective for fine-grained control while maintaining the integrity of the image background.

Abstract: Image editing approaches have become more powerful and flexible with the
advent of powerful text-conditioned generative models. However, placing objects
in an environment with a precise location and orientation still remains a
challenge, as this typically requires carefully crafted inpainting masks or
prompts. In this work, we show that a carefully designed visual map, combined
with coarse object masks, is sufficient for high quality object placement. We
design a conditioning signal that resolves ambiguities, while being flexible
enough to allow for changing of shapes or object orientations. By building on
an inpainting model, we leave the background intact by design, in contrast to
methods that model objects and background jointly. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of our method in the automotive setting, where we compare
different conditioning signals in novel object placement tasks. These tasks are
designed to measure edit quality not only in terms of appearance, but also in
terms of pose and location accuracy, including cases that require non-trivial
shape changes. Lastly, we show that fine location control can be combined with
appearance control to place existing objects in precise locations in a scene.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of datasets suitable for developing deep learning-based miner detection systems in underground mining environments, ensuring better safety and emergency response.

Method: Thermal imagery of mining activities and scenarios was systematically collected to create a dataset. Several object detection algorithms were evaluated for baseline metrics using this dataset.

Result: Baseline performance metrics were generated from state-of-the-art algorithms like YOLOv8, YOLOv10, YOLO11, and RT-DETR, demonstrating the potential for this dataset in miner detection.

Conclusion: The dataset lays a foundation for future research and highlights the feasibility of thermal imaging for miner detection, aiming to enhance emergency response effectiveness.

Abstract: Underground mining operations face significant safety challenges that make
emergency response capabilities crucial. While robots have shown promise in
assisting with search and rescue operations, their effectiveness depends on
reliable miner detection capabilities. Deep learning algorithms offer potential
solutions for automated miner detection, but require comprehensive training
datasets, which are currently lacking for underground mining environments. This
paper presents a novel thermal imaging dataset specifically designed to enable
the development and validation of miner detection systems for potential
emergency applications. We systematically captured thermal imagery of various
mining activities and scenarios to create a robust foundation for detection
algorithms. To establish baseline performance metrics, we evaluated several
state-of-the-art object detection algorithms including YOLOv8, YOLOv10, YOLO11,
and RT-DETR on our dataset. While not exhaustive of all possible emergency
situations, this dataset serves as a crucial first step toward developing
reliable thermal-based miner detection systems that could eventually be
deployed in real emergency scenarios. This work demonstrates the feasibility of
using thermal imaging for miner detection and establishes a foundation for
future research in this critical safety application.

*Kaiyu Song,Hanjiang Lai*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LF-CFG enhances classifier-free guidance in diffusion models by addressing oversaturation and unrealistic artifacts through adaptive handling of low-frequency signals.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the oversaturation and unrealistic artifacts caused by high guidance scales in classifier-free guidance for diffusion models.

Method: Propose LF-CFG, which uses adaptive threshold-based measurement and a down-weight strategy to reduce redundant low-frequency signal information.

Result: Experimental results show LF-CFG alleviates oversaturation and artifacts across various diffusion models, including Stable Diffusion versions and SiT-XL.

Conclusion: LF-CFG is effective in improving diffusion model outputs by mitigating oversaturation and unrealistic artifacts through low-frequency signal adjustment.

Abstract: Classifier-free guidance (CFG) succeeds in condition diffusion models that
use a guidance scale to balance the influence of conditional and unconditional
terms. A high guidance scale is used to enhance the performance of the
conditional term. However, the high guidance scale often results in
oversaturation and unrealistic artifacts. In this paper, we introduce a new
perspective based on low-frequency signals, identifying the accumulation of
redundant information in these signals as the key factor behind oversaturation
and unrealistic artifacts. Building on this insight, we propose low-frequency
improved classifier-free guidance (LF-CFG) to mitigate these issues.
Specifically, we introduce an adaptive threshold-based measurement to pinpoint
the locations of redundant information. We determine a reasonable threshold by
analyzing the change rate of low-frequency information between prior and
current steps. We then apply a down-weight strategy to reduce the impact of
redundant information in the low-frequency signals. Experimental results
demonstrate that LF-CFG effectively alleviates oversaturation and unrealistic
artifacts across various diffusion models, including Stable Diffusion-XL,
Stable Diffusion 2.1, 3.0, 3.5, and SiT-XL.

*Mohammad Shokrolah Shirazi,Hung-Fu Chang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper develops dynamic, static, and hybrid traffic signal configuration methods using vision-based TMC data to optimize traffic flow at six intersections in Las Vegas, with hybrid methods excelling in peak-hour scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve traffic signal designs and traffic flow management by accurately utilizing turning movement count (TMC) data, which is crucial for urban transportation planning.

Method: A vision-based tracking system was used to estimate TMC at six intersections in Las Vegas, integrating the data into the Simulation of Urban MObility framework. Static, dynamic, and hybrid configurations were simulated under realistic traffic conditions to evaluate performance.

Result: Experimental results indicate that dynamic signals perform better for most intersections, static signals work best with evenly distributed traffic, and the hybrid method adapts effectively to bimodal traffic patterns, improving performance during peak and off-peak hours.

Conclusion: The hybrid signal configuration offers superior adaptability for intersections with uneven or bimodal traffic patterns, enhancing overall traffic management efficiency.

Abstract: The turning movement count data is crucial for traffic signal design,
intersection geometry planning, traffic flow, and congestion analysis. This
work proposes three methods called dynamic, static, and hybrid configuration
for TMC-based traffic signals. A vision-based tracking system is developed to
estimate the TMC of six intersections in Las Vegas using traffic cameras. The
intersection design, route (e.g. vehicle movement directions), and signal
configuration files with compatible formats are synthesized and imported into
Simulation of Urban MObility for signal evaluation with realistic data. The
initial experimental results based on estimated waiting times indicate that the
cycle time of 90 and 120 seconds works best for all intersections. In addition,
four intersections show better performance for dynamic signal timing
configuration, and the other two with lower performance have a lower ratio of
total vehicle count to total lanes of the intersection leg. Since daily traffic
flow often exhibits a bimodal pattern, we propose a hybrid signal method that
switches between dynamic and static methods, adapting to peak and off-peak
traffic conditions for improved flow management. So, a built-in traffic
generator module creates vehicle routes for 4 hours, including peak hours, and
a signal design module produces signal schedule cycles according to static,
dynamic, and hybrid methods. Vehicle count distributions are weighted
differently for each zone (i.e., West, North, East, South) to generate diverse
traffic patterns. The extended experimental results for 6 intersections with 4
hours of simulation time imply that zone-based traffic pattern distributions
affect signal design selection. Although the static method works great for
evenly zone-based traffic distribution, the hybrid method works well for highly
weighted traffic at intersection pairs of the West-East and North-South zones.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper presents the Radial Cross-Modal Embeddings (RCME) framework to enhance hierarchical modeling in vision-language models by explicitly enforcing transitivity in entailment, achieving state-of-the-art performance in tasks like species classification and retrieval.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of learning hierarchical structures in vision-language models, which previous work failed to accomplish by omitting explicit transitivity modeling for entailment.

Method: The authors proposed the RCME framework, optimizing the partial order of concepts within vision-language models to model transitivity-enforced entailment explicitly.

Result: The RCME framework demonstrated superior performance on hierarchical species classification and retrieval tasks compared to existing state-of-the-art models.

Conclusion: By incorporating transitivity-enforced entailment, the RCME framework provides a robust approach for hierarchical vision-language modeling, with open-sourced resources available for broader usage.

Abstract: Learning the hierarchical structure of data in vision-language models is a
significant challenge. Previous works have attempted to address this challenge
by employing entailment learning. However, these approaches fail to model the
transitive nature of entailment explicitly, which establishes the relationship
between order and semantics within a representation space. In this work, we
introduce Radial Cross-Modal Embeddings (RCME), a framework that enables the
explicit modeling of transitivity-enforced entailment. Our proposed framework
optimizes for the partial order of concepts within vision-language models. By
leveraging our framework, we develop a hierarchical vision-language foundation

### [158] [TITAN: Query-Token based Domain Adaptive Adversarial Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21484)
*Tajamul Ashraf,Janibul Bashir*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This study addresses SF-DAOD by minimizing noise in pseudo-labels using a proposed TITAN framework, demonstrating significant performance improvements across benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation stems from the challenges in SF-DAOD, where the absence of source data and domain shifts lead to unreliable pseudo-labels and performance degradation in self-supervised frameworks.

Method: The proposed TITAN framework segments the target domain into easier and harder subsets based on detection variance and incorporates query-token-based adversarial modules within a student-teacher framework to reduce domain gaps.

Result: TITAN outperforms existing methods with mAP improvements of +22.7, +22.2, +21.1, and +3.7 percent across several natural and medical imaging benchmarks.

Conclusion: By effectively mitigating domain gaps and producing reliable pseudo-labels, TITAN showcases superior performance, offering a viable solution to SF-DAOD challenges.

Abstract: We focus on the source-free domain adaptive object detection (SF-DAOD)
problem when source data is unavailable during adaptation and the model must
adapt to an unlabeled target domain. The majority of approaches for the problem
employ a self-supervised approach using a student-teacher (ST) framework where
pseudo-labels are generated via a source-pretrained model for further
fine-tuning. We observe that the performance of a student model often degrades
drastically, due to the collapse of the teacher model, primarily caused by high
noise in pseudo-labels, resulting from domain bias, discrepancies, and a
significant domain shift across domains. To obtain reliable pseudo-labels, we
propose a Target-based Iterative Query-Token Adversarial Network (TITAN), which
separates the target images into two subsets: those similar to the source
(easy) and those dissimilar (hard). We propose a strategy to estimate variance
to partition the target domain. This approach leverages the insight that higher
detection variances correspond to higher recall and greater similarity to the
source domain. Also, we incorporate query-token-based adversarial modules into
a student-teacher baseline framework to reduce the domain gaps between two
feature representations. Experiments conducted on four natural imaging datasets
and two challenging medical datasets have substantiated the superior
performance of TITAN compared to existing state-of-the-art (SOTA)
methodologies. We report an mAP improvement of +22.7, +22.2, +21.1, and +3.7
percent over the current SOTA on C2F, C2B, S2C, and K2C benchmarks,
respectively.

### [159] [Towards Reliable Detection of Empty Space: Conditional Marked Point Processes for Object Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21486)
*Tobias J. Riedlinger,Kira Maag,Hanno Gottschalk*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes a novel object detection model grounded in spatial statistics to provide better-calibrated confidence estimates, ensuring safe drivable region assessments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing object detection models prioritize task performance over probabilistic accuracy and fail to address uncertainty in regions outside detected bounding boxes, posing safety risks in applications like automated driving.

Method: The authors employ a statistical framework based on marked point processes for bounding box data. This allows for likelihood-based training and more reliable confidence estimates regarding drivable areas.

Result: The proposed method demonstrates improved confidence calibration and performance in object detection tasks, specifically in ensuring the safety of drivable regions.

Conclusion: Integrating spatial statistics into object detection enhances safety-critical applications by providing better-calibrated predictions and addressing uncertainties in regions without detected objects.

Abstract: Deep neural networks have set the state-of-the-art in computer vision tasks
such as bounding box detection and semantic segmentation. Object detectors and
segmentation models assign confidence scores to predictions, reflecting the
model's uncertainty in object detection or pixel-wise classification. However,
these confidence estimates are often miscalibrated, as their architectures and
loss functions are tailored to task performance rather than probabilistic
foundation. Even with well calibrated predictions, object detectors fail to
quantify uncertainty outside detected bounding boxes, i.e., the model does not
make a probability assessment of whether an area without detected objects is
truly free of obstacles. This poses a safety risk in applications such as
automated driving, where uncertainty in empty areas remains unexplored. In this
work, we propose an object detection model grounded in spatial statistics.
Bounding box data matches realizations of a marked point process, commonly used
to describe the probabilistic occurrence of spatial point events identified as
bounding box centers, where marks are used to describe the spatial extension of
bounding boxes and classes. Our statistical framework enables a
likelihood-based training and provides well-defined confidence estimates for
whether a region is drivable, i.e., free of objects. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of our method through calibration assessments and evaluation of
performance.

### [160] [Mitigating Hallucination of Large Vision-Language Models via Dynamic Logits Calibration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21509)
*Jiahe Chen,Jiaying He,Qian Shao,Qiyuan Chen,Jiahe Ying,Hongxia Xu,Jintai Chen,Jianwei Zheng,Jian Wu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel method called Dynamic Logits Calibration (DLC) to reduce hallucinations in Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) during text generation by dynamically aligning it with visual input.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large Vision-Language Models often struggle with text generation that contradicts the visual input, known as hallucination, due to inefficient and rigid decoding strategies.

Method: Dynamic Logits Calibration (DLC) uses CLIP as a semantic alignment assessor for input images and text during decoding, evaluates candidate tokens' relevance, adjusts logits based on relative visual advantage, and balances visual guidance with text quality using adaptive weighting.

Result: Experiments show that DLC significantly reduces hallucinations across diverse benchmarks and LVLM architectures, outperforming existing methods while maintaining efficient inference.

Conclusion: DLC provides an effective and efficient solution to mitigate hallucinations in LVLMs, thereby improving their reliability and practical usability.

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have demonstrated significant
advancements in multimodal understanding, yet they are frequently hampered by
hallucination-the generation of text that contradicts visual input. Existing
training-free decoding strategies exhibit critical limitations, including the
use of static constraints that do not adapt to semantic drift during
generation, inefficiency stemming from the need for multiple forward passes,
and degradation of detail due to overly rigid intervention rules. To overcome
these challenges, this paper introduces Dynamic Logits Calibration (DLC), a
novel training-free decoding framework designed to dynamically align text
generation with visual evidence at inference time. At the decoding phase, DLC
step-wise employs CLIP to assess the semantic alignment between the input image
and the generated text sequence. Then, the Relative Visual Advantage (RVA) of
candidate tokens is evaluated against a dynamically updated contextual
baseline, adaptively adjusting output logits to favor tokens that are visually
grounded. Furthermore, an adaptive weighting mechanism, informed by a real-time
context alignment score, carefully balances the visual guidance while ensuring
the overall quality of the textual output. Extensive experiments conducted
across diverse benchmarks and various LVLM architectures (such as LLaVA,
InstructBLIP, and MiniGPT-4) demonstrate that DLC significantly reduces
hallucinations, outperforming current methods while maintaining high inference
efficiency by avoiding multiple forward passes. Overall, we present an
effective and efficient decoding-time solution to mitigate hallucinations,
thereby enhancing the reliability of LVLMs for more practices. Code will be
released on Github.

### [161] [GGTalker: Talking Head Systhesis with Generalizable Gaussian Priors and Identity-Specific Adaptation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21513)
*Wentao Hu,Shunkai Li,Ziqiao Peng,Haoxian Zhang,Fan Shi,Xiaoqiang Liu,Pengfei Wan,Di Zhang,Hui Tian*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GGTalker is a new method to create realistic 3D talking heads using generalizable priors and identity-specific adaptations, addressing challenges in handling large head rotations and diverse audio inputs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to overcome limitations in previous methods for creating 3D talking heads, such as struggles with OOD audio, large head rotations, and inefficient identity-specific training.

Method: GGTalker employs a two-stage Prior-Adaptation training strategy. It first trains general Audio-Expression and Expression-Visual priors, followed by customizable adaptations for individual textures and speaking styles.

Result: Experiments show that GGTalker achieves state-of-the-art performance in various aspects such as rendering quality, lip-sync accuracy, 3D consistency, and training efficiency.

Conclusion: GGTalker effectively addresses previous challenges in synthesizing high-quality talking heads, proving to be both practical and efficient.

Abstract: Creating high-quality, generalizable speech-driven 3D talking heads remains a
persistent challenge. Previous methods achieve satisfactory results for fixed
viewpoints and small-scale audio variations, but they struggle with large head
rotations and out-of-distribution (OOD) audio. Moreover, they are constrained
by the need for time-consuming, identity-specific training. We believe the core
issue lies in the lack of sufficient 3D priors, which limits the extrapolation
capabilities of synthesized talking heads. To address this, we propose
GGTalker, which synthesizes talking heads through a combination of
generalizable priors and identity-specific adaptation. We introduce a two-stage
Prior-Adaptation training strategy to learn Gaussian head priors and adapt to
individual characteristics. We train Audio-Expression and Expression-Visual
priors to capture the universal patterns of lip movements and the general
distribution of head textures. During the Customized Adaptation, individual
speaking styles and texture details are precisely modeled. Additionally, we
introduce a color MLP to generate fine-grained, motion-aligned textures and a
Body Inpainter to blend rendered results with the background, producing
indistinguishable, photorealistic video frames. Comprehensive experiments show
that GGTalker achieves state-of-the-art performance in rendering quality, 3D
consistency, lip-sync accuracy, and training efficiency.

*Mohammed Rakib,Arunkumar Bagavathi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Gradient-Guided Distillation (G$^{2}$D), a framework addressing modality imbalance in multimodal learning by optimizing with balanced objectives and prioritizing each modality during training, resulting in improved performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To tackle the issue of modality imbalance in multimodal models, where dominant modalities hinder the representation and contribution of weaker ones.

Method: A novel framework, G$^{2}$D, combining a custom loss function for unified learning objectives and Sequential Modality Prioritization (SMP) for ensuring each modality leads the learning process.

Result: Experiments on multiple real-world datasets demonstrate that G$^{2}$D enhances the contribution of weaker modalities during training and surpasses state-of-the-art methods in classification and regression tasks.

Conclusion: Gradient-Guided Distillation (G$^{2}$D) is an effective solution for addressing modality imbalance in multimodal models, ensuring comprehensive utilization of all modalities and achieving superior performance.

Abstract: Multimodal learning aims to leverage information from diverse data modalities
to achieve more comprehensive performance. However, conventional multimodal
models often suffer from modality imbalance, where one or a few modalities
dominate model optimization, leading to suboptimal feature representation and
underutilization of weak modalities. To address this challenge, we introduce
Gradient-Guided Distillation (G$^{2}$D), a knowledge distillation framework
that optimizes the multimodal model with a custom-built loss function that
fuses both unimodal and multimodal objectives. G$^{2}$D further incorporates a
dynamic sequential modality prioritization (SMP) technique in the learning
process to ensure each modality leads the learning process, avoiding the
pitfall of stronger modalities overshadowing weaker ones. We validate G$^{2}$D
on multiple real-world datasets and show that G$^{2}$D amplifies the
significance of weak modalities while training and outperforms state-of-the-art
methods in classification and regression tasks. Our code is available at

*Polina Karpikova,Daniil Selikhanovych,Kirill Struminsky,Ruslan Musaev,Maria Golitsyna,Dmitry Baranchuk*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces MADrive, a framework for memory-augmented scene reconstruction in autonomous driving setups, replacing observed vehicles with similar 3D assets for photorealistic synthesis of altered scenes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current 3D Gaussian splatting methods for scene reconstruction in autonomous driving environments struggle to support significant alterations or novel scene syntheses while maintaining photorealism.

Method: MADrive incorporates a memory-augmented framework and uses a retrieval module to replace observed vehicles in reconstructed AD scenes with visually similar pre-modeled 3D vehicle assets from a large-scale external dataset (MAD-Cars) of car videos.

Result: The approach enables realistic multi-view scene representations with altered driving scenarios through successful vehicle replacement based on orientation alignment, relighting, and asset integration.

Conclusion: MADrive showcases the ability to enhance scene reconstruction capabilities by enabling photorealistic synthesis and modification of autonomous driving environments, demonstrated through its performance on altered scenarios.

Abstract: Recent advances in scene reconstruction have pushed toward highly realistic
modeling of autonomous driving (AD) environments using 3D Gaussian splatting.
However, the resulting reconstructions remain closely tied to the original
observations and struggle to support photorealistic synthesis of significantly
altered or novel driving scenarios. This work introduces MADrive, a
memory-augmented reconstruction framework designed to extend the capabilities
of existing scene reconstruction methods by replacing observed vehicles with
visually similar 3D assets retrieved from a large-scale external memory bank.
Specifically, we release MAD-Cars, a curated dataset of ${\sim}70$K 360{\deg}
car videos captured in the wild and present a retrieval module that finds the
most similar car instances in the memory bank, reconstructs the corresponding
3D assets from video, and integrates them into the target scene through
orientation alignment and relighting. The resulting replacements provide
complete multi-view representations of vehicles in the scene, enabling
photorealistic synthesis of substantially altered configurations, as
demonstrated in our experiments. Project page:

TL;DR: WAFT is a novel optical flow method prioritizing high-resolution warping instead of cost volumes, offering better accuracy and lower memory usage.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to challenge the reliance on cost volumes in optical flow methods by proposing a design that achieves strong performance without high memory costs.

Method: The authors introduce WAFT, which leverages high-resolution warping as an alternative to cost volume construction, offering a simpler, more flexible approach.

Result: WAFT achieves state-of-the-art performance, ranking 1st on Spring and KITTI benchmarks, with the best zero-shot generalization on KITTI, and is up to 4.1x faster than comparable methods.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that cost volumes are not necessary for strong optical flow performance, as WAFT provides a simpler, highly efficient, and effective alternative with broad applicability.

Abstract: We introduce Warping-Alone Field Transforms (WAFT), a simple and effective
method for optical flow. WAFT is similar to RAFT but replaces cost volume with
high-resolution warping, achieving better accuracy with lower memory cost. This
design challenges the conventional wisdom that constructing cost volumes is
necessary for strong performance. WAFT is a simple and flexible
meta-architecture with minimal inductive biases and reliance on custom designs.
Compared with existing methods, WAFT ranks 1st on Spring and KITTI benchmarks,
achieves the best zero-shot generalization on KITTI, while being up to 4.1x
faster than methods with similar performance. Code and model weights are

*Hani Alomari,Anushka Sivakumar,Andrew Zhang,Chris Thomas*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes enhancing cross-modal image-text retrieval by addressing issues in set-based representations, introducing new optimization techniques and losses to improve semantic diversity and performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current cross-modal retrieval methods struggle to capture diverse relationships across image and text modalities, especially with single-vector embeddings. Set-based representations promise richer semantics but face challenges like sparse supervision and set collapse.

Method: The authors propose "Maximal Pair Assignment Similarity" for better one-to-one matching within embedding sets, alongside two loss functions: Global Discriminative Loss for enhancing embedding distinction and Intra-Set Divergence Loss to prevent set collapse.

Result: The proposed approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on popular datasets MS-COCO and Flickr30k without relying on external data.

Conclusion: Addressing key challenges in set-based cross-modal retrieval, the method effectively improves semantic diversity and retrieval accuracy, setting a new benchmark in this field.

Abstract: Cross-modal image-text retrieval is challenging because of the diverse
possible associations between content from different modalities. Traditional
methods learn a single-vector embedding to represent semantics of each sample,
but struggle to capture nuanced and diverse relationships that can exist across
modalities. Set-based approaches, which represent each sample with multiple
embeddings, offer a promising alternative, as they can capture richer and more
diverse relationships. In this paper, we show that, despite their promise,
these set-based representations continue to face issues including sparse
supervision and set collapse, which limits their effectiveness. To address
these challenges, we propose Maximal Pair Assignment Similarity to optimize
one-to-one matching between embedding sets which preserve semantic diversity
within the set. We also introduce two loss functions to further enhance the
representations: Global Discriminative Loss to enhance distinction among
embeddings, and Intra-Set Divergence Loss to prevent collapse within each set.
Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on MS-COCO and Flickr30k
without relying on external data.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces StruMamba3D for point cloud representation learning, improving upon Mamba-based methods by addressing adjacency and long-sequence memory issues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Mamba-based methods struggle with maintaining adjacency of 3D points in SSM processing and lose long-sequence memory as input length increases, limiting downstream task performance.

Method: Introduces spatial states to preserve spatial dependencies, enhances SSM with state-wise updates and lightweight convolution, and incorporates a sequence length-adaptive strategy to handle input variations.

Result: Achieved SOTA 95.1% accuracy on ModelNet40 and 92.75% on ScanObjectNN's toughest split without voting; validated effectiveness across four downstream tasks.

Conclusion: StruMamba3D is highly effective and efficient for point cloud representation learning by overcoming limitations in Mamba-based methods and setting new SOTA benchmarks.

Abstract: Recently, Mamba-based methods have demonstrated impressive performance in
point cloud representation learning by leveraging State Space Model (SSM) with
the efficient context modeling ability and linear complexity. However, these
methods still face two key issues that limit the potential of SSM: Destroying
the adjacency of 3D points during SSM processing and failing to retain
long-sequence memory as the input length increases in downstream tasks. To
address these issues, we propose StruMamba3D, a novel paradigm for
self-supervised point cloud representation learning. It enjoys several merits.
First, we design spatial states and use them as proxies to preserve spatial
dependencies among points. Second, we enhance the SSM with a state-wise update
strategy and incorporate a lightweight convolution to facilitate interactions
between spatial states for efficient structure modeling. Third, our method
reduces the sensitivity of pre-trained Mamba-based models to varying input
lengths by introducing a sequence length-adaptive strategy. Experimental
results across four downstream tasks showcase the superior performance of our
method. In addition, our method attains the SOTA 95.1% accuracy on ModelNet40
and 92.75% accuracy on the most challenging split of ScanObjectNN without
voting strategy.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper presents a system that reconstructs 3D objects from partially occluded single images by synthesizing structurally consistent novel views.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of accurately reconstructing 3D objects from single images under real-world occlusions.

Method: The approach synthesizes six consistent novel views directly from a partially occluded image using a self-supervised training pipeline on the Pix2Gestalt dataset, without requiring prior inpainting or user annotations.

Result: The proposed framework generates structurally consistent views and enables downstream 3D reconstruction under occlusions. A novel benchmark for occlusion-aware reconstruction is also introduced.

Conclusion: By fine-tuning view synthesis models and introducing an occlusion-aware reconstruction benchmark, the work advances 3D object reconstruction under challenging occlusions and provides tools for future evaluation.

Abstract: Reconstructing 3D objects from a single image is a long-standing challenge,
especially under real-world occlusions. While recent diffusion-based view
synthesis models can generate consistent novel views from a single RGB image,
they generally assume fully visible inputs and fail when parts of the object
are occluded. This leads to inconsistent views and degraded 3D reconstruction
quality. To overcome this limitation, we propose an end-to-end framework for
occlusion-aware multi-view generation. Our method directly synthesizes six
structurally consistent novel views from a single partially occluded image,
enabling downstream 3D reconstruction without requiring prior inpainting or
manual annotations. We construct a self-supervised training pipeline using the
Pix2Gestalt dataset, leveraging occluded-unoccluded image pairs and
pseudo-ground-truth views to teach the model structure-aware completion and
view consistency. Without modifying the original architecture, we fully
fine-tune the view synthesis model to jointly learn completion and multi-view
generation. Additionally, we introduce the first benchmark for occlusion-aware
reconstruction, encompassing diverse occlusion levels, object categories, and
mask patterns. This benchmark provides a standardized protocol for evaluating
future methods under partial occlusions. Our code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current benchmarks fail to address single-instance anomaly detection and the challenge of generalizing from synthetic to real-world data using multiview and multimodal information.

Method: SiM3D provides a multimodal multiview dataset with high-resolution images, point clouds, and CAD models. It offers new metrics for evaluating anomaly volumes and adapts single-view methods for 3D anomaly detection.

Result: SiM3D delivers manually annotated 3D segmentation ground truths, effective datasets, and metrics for assessing the performance of adapted algorithms on 3D anomaly tasks.

Conclusion: SiM3D advances the field of 3D anomaly detection by addressing generalization issues, producing robust benchmarks, and enabling better integration of multimodal data in training and evaluation.

Abstract: We propose SiM3D, the first benchmark considering the integration of
multiview and multimodal information for comprehensive 3D anomaly detection and
segmentation (ADS), where the task is to produce a voxel-based Anomaly Volume.
Moreover, SiM3D focuses on a scenario of high interest in manufacturing:
single-instance anomaly detection, where only one object, either real or
synthetic, is available for training. In this respect, SiM3D stands out as the
first ADS benchmark that addresses the challenge of generalising from synthetic
training data to real test data. SiM3D includes a novel multimodal multiview
dataset acquired using top-tier industrial sensors and robots. The dataset
features multiview high-resolution images (12 Mpx) and point clouds (7M points)
for 333 instances of eight types of objects, alongside a CAD model for each
type. We also provide manually annotated 3D segmentation GTs for anomalous test
samples. To establish reference baselines for the proposed multiview 3D ADS
task, we adapt prominent singleview methods and assess their performance using
novel metrics that operate on Anomaly Volumes.

TL;DR: The paper presents a framework for distributed analysis of large GPU profiler data, enabling faster and more scalable insights for HPC and AI workflows.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current tools for GPU performance log analysis suffer from memory and runtime constraints, hindering timely insights and workflow integration in HPC environments.

Method: The framework partitions datasets into shards analyzed concurrently across MPI ranks, reducing memory pressure and bottlenecks, and facilitating efficient exploration of high-dimensional traces.

Result: The framework was applied to HPC and AI workloads, successfully diagnosing performance variability and identifying memory transfer latency effects on GPU kernel behavior.

Conclusion: This approach enables scalable and timely performance log analysis, making it suitable for complex and large-scale HPC workflows.

Abstract: Analyzing large-scale performance logs from GPU profilers often requires
terabytes of memory and hours of runtime, even for basic summaries. These
constraints prevent timely insight and hinder the integration of performance
analytics into automated workflows. Existing analysis tools typically process
data sequentially, making them ill-suited for HPC workflows with growing trace
complexity and volume. We introduce a distributed data analysis framework that
scales with dataset size and compute availability. Rather than treating the
dataset as a single entity, our system partitions it into independently
analyzable shards and processes them concurrently across MPI ranks. This design
reduces per-node memory pressure, avoids central bottlenecks, and enables
low-latency exploration of high-dimensional trace data. We apply the framework
to end-to-end Nsight Compute traces from real HPC and AI workloads, demonstrate
its ability to diagnose performance variability, and uncover the impact of
memory transfer latency on GPU kernel behavior.

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: The paper introduces ClusterRCA, a framework for diagnosing network failures in HPC systems using multimodal data and novel graph- and classifier-based techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges of diagnosing network failures in HPC systems due to data heterogeneity and low accuracy of existing methods.

Method: ClusterRCA combines classifier- and graph-based approaches, including feature extraction from connected NIC pairs, failure graph construction, and customized random walks to localize root causes.

Result: ClusterRCA achieves high accuracy in network failure diagnosis and demonstrates robustness across diverse application scenarios, validated using real-world datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed ClusterRCA framework effectively overcomes limitations of existing methods, offering a precise and robust solution for HPC network failure diagnosis.

Abstract: Network failure diagnosis is challenging yet critical for high-performance
computing (HPC) systems. Existing methods cannot be directly applied to HPC
scenarios due to data heterogeneity and lack of accuracy. This paper proposes a
novel framework, called ClusterRCA, to localize culprit nodes and determine
failure types by leveraging multimodal data. ClusterRCA extracts features from
topologically connected network interface controller (NIC) pairs to analyze the
diverse, multimodal data in HPC systems. To accurately localize culprit nodes
and determine failure types, ClusterRCA combines classifier-based and
graph-based approaches. A failure graph is constructed based on the output of
the state classifier, and then it performs a customized random walk on the
graph to localize the root cause. Experiments on datasets collected by a
top-tier global HPC device vendor show ClusterRCA achieves high accuracy in
diagnosing network failure for HPC systems. ClusterRCA also maintains robust
performance across different application scenarios.

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: This paper identifies the inefficiency of speculative decoding for emerging Mixture of Experts (MoE) models due to increased data movement and overhead, then proposes Cascade, a utility-driven framework for optimizing speculation in MoE serving.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address the challenges of speculative decoding in emerging Mixture of Experts (MoE) models, where the technique performs inefficiently due to increased data movement and verification time, despite its success in dense LLMs.

Method: The authors introduce Cascade, which calculates speculation utility (ratio of token gains to verification cost) to dynamically enable speculation and tune the number of speculative tokens (K) per request and iteration, maximizing performance.

Result: The proposed Cascade framework limits speculation-induced slowdowns to 5% (from up to 1.5x) and improves throughput by 7-14% compared to static K in evaluations across five popular MoE models with diverse tasks.

Conclusion: Cascade makes speculative decoding practical and efficient for MoE models, overcoming the overhead issues observed in conventional approaches, enabling improved performance and adaptability across tasks.

Abstract: GPU memory bandwidth is the main bottleneck for low-latency Large Language
Model (LLM) inference. Speculative decoding leverages idle GPU compute by using
a lightweight drafter to propose K tokens, which the LLM verifies in parallel,
boosting token throughput. In conventional dense LLMs, all model weights are
fetched each iteration, so speculation adds no latency overhead. Emerging
Mixture of Experts (MoE) models activate only a subset of weights per token,
greatly reducing data movement. However, we show that speculation is
ineffective for MoEs: draft tokens collectively activate more weights,
increasing data movement and verification time by 2-3x. When token throughput
gains fail to offset this overhead, speculation causes slowdowns up to 1.5x,
making it infeasible. Even when useful, the optimal K varies by task, model,
and even between requests and iterations. Thus, despite widespread use in dense
LLMs, speculation remains impractical in leading MoEs.
  We present Cascade, a utility-driven framework that selectively enables
speculation to avoid slowdowns and dynamically tunes K to accelerate MoE
serving. Cascade uses a lightweight metric, speculation utility, the ratio of
token gains to verification cost, which shows iteration-level locality,
enabling periodic decisions via short test and longer set phases. For each
request, Cascade disables speculation if utility drops below one during
testing, and when utility exceeds one, tests multiple K-values to choose the
utility-maximizing K for the set phase. We implement Cascade in vLLM and
evaluate it on five popular MoEs with workloads spanning code, math,
extraction, and mixed tasks. Cascade limits slowdown to 5% (vs. 1.5x) and
improves throughput by 7-14% over static K, making speculative decoding
practical for MoEs.

Method: The study introduces ParEval-Repo, a benchmarking framework containing diverse applications to evaluate LLMs' ability to translate codebases, assessing factors like accuracy, errors, and token consumption.

Result: The findings reveal LLMs are capable of translating small programs effectively, but struggle with larger repositories due to issues like cross-file dependencies and build system challenges.

Conclusion: LLMs show promise in aiding codebase translation but face scalability obstacles, highlighting areas for improvement in handling complex programming environments.

Abstract: GPGPU architectures have become significantly diverse in recent years, which
has led to an emergence of a variety of specialized programming models and
software stacks to support them. While portable execution models exist, they
still require significant developer effort to port to and optimize for
different hardware architectures. Recent advances in large language models
(LLMs) can help us reduce some of this programmer burden. In this paper, we
present a novel benchmark and testing framework, ParEval-Repo, which can be
used to evaluate the efficacy of LLM-based approaches in automatically
translating entire codebases across GPGPU execution models. ParEval-Repo
includes several scientific computing and AI mini-applications in a range of
programming models, and levels of repository complexity. We use ParEval-Repo to
evaluate a range of state-of-the-art open-source and commercial LLMs, with both
a non-agentic and a top-down agentic approach. We assess code generated by the
LLMs and approaches in terms of compilability, functional correctness,
categories of build errors, and the cost of translation in terms of the number
of inference tokens. Our results demonstrate that LLM translation of scientific
applications is feasible for small programs but difficulty with generating
functional build systems and cross-file dependencies pose challenges in scaling
to larger codebases.

Result: The generated code delivered portability and competitive performance across Nvidia GH200, Nvidia A100, and AMD MI250X GPUs.

Conclusion: DaCe demonstrates the feasibility of using portable, automated solutions to ensure the sustainability and performance of large-scale scientific applications in diverse HPC environments.

Abstract: With the emergence of new high-performance computing (HPC) accelerators, such
as Nvidia and AMD GPUs, efficiently targeting diverse hardware architectures
has become a major challenge for HPC application developers. The increasing
hardware diversity in HPC systems often necessitates the development of
architecture-specific code, hindering the sustainability of large-scale
scientific applications. In this work, we leverage DaCe, a data-centric
parallel programming framework, to automate the generation of high-performance
kernels. DaCe enables automatic code generation for multicore processors and
various accelerators, reducing the burden on developers who would otherwise
need to rewrite code for each new architecture. Our study demonstrates DaCe's
capabilities by applying its automatic code generation to a critical
computational kernel used in Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD). Specifically,
we focus on Neko, a Fortran-based solver that employs the spectral-element
method, which relies on small tensor operations. We detail the formulation of
this computational kernel using DaCe's Stateful Dataflow Multigraph (SDFG)
representation and discuss how this approach facilitates high-performance code
generation. Additionally, we outline the workflow for seamlessly integrating
DaCe's generated code into the Neko solver. Our results highlight the
portability and performance of the generated code across multiple platforms,
including Nvidia GH200, Nvidia A100, and AMD MI250X GPUs, with competitive
performance results. By demonstrating the potential of automatic code
generation, we emphasise the feasibility of using portable solutions to ensure
the long-term sustainability of large-scale scientific applications.

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: This paper proposes using blockchain-based systems to manage external knowledge for Large Language Models (LLMs) to address their hallucination problem, ensuring secure and reliable knowledge sharing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to solve the hallucination problem in LLMs by providing secure, decentralized access to external knowledge that is often isolated in various 'knowledge silos.'

Method: A blockchain-based external knowledge framework is developed. The method includes knowledge distillation, blockchain transactions, reputation mechanisms, cross-validation, and a query generation framework that integrates with LLM retrieval APIs.

Result: Experiments demonstrated that the framework enables efficient knowledge sharing and retrieval in blockchain environments, addressing the challenge of working with dispersed and isolated knowledge sources.

Conclusion: The proposed blockchain-based framework effectively improves LLM knowledge retrieval while maintaining data security, ensuring high-quality knowledge sharing through reputation systems and cross-validation.

Abstract: The hallucination problem of Large Language Models (LLMs) has increasingly
drawn attention. Augmenting LLMs with external knowledge is a promising
solution to address this issue. However, due to privacy and security concerns,
a vast amount of downstream task-related knowledge remains dispersed and
isolated across various "silos," making it difficult to access. To bridge this
knowledge gap, we propose a blockchain-based external knowledge framework that
coordinates multiple knowledge silos to provide reliable foundational knowledge
for large model retrieval while ensuring data security. Technically, we distill
knowledge from local data into prompts and execute transactions and records on
the blockchain. Additionally, we introduce a reputation mechanism and
cross-validation to ensure knowledge quality and provide incentives for
participation. Furthermore, we design a query generation framework that
provides a direct API interface for large model retrieval. To evaluate the
performance of our proposed framework, we conducted extensive experiments on
various knowledge sources. The results demonstrate that the proposed framework
achieves efficient LLM service knowledge sharing in blockchain environments.

*Ryan Croote,Islam El-Ashi,Thomas Locher,Yvonne-Anne Pignolet*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: This paper introduces an architecture enabling Turing-complete Bitcoin smart contracts on the Internet Computer (IC) without requiring a bridge, addressing security and performance limitations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current approaches for Bitcoin programmability either modify Bitcoin or rely on bridging mechanisms to enable smart contracts, both of which have inherent security and practical limitations.

Method: The proposed architecture leverages direct interaction between IC and Bitcoin nodes, ensuring secure integration and handling Bitcoin's probabilistic nature alongside IC's finalized state changes. Evaluation is conducted via mainnet implementation.

Result: The findings show that the architecture enables Bitcoin-based decentralized applications with improved finalization times (few seconds) and low execution costs, making them practically and economically viable.

Conclusion: This work demonstrates a secure, efficient, and novel mechanism for integrating Bitcoin with Turing-complete smart contracts on IC, paving the way for new decentralized application possibilities.

Abstract: There is growing interest in providing programmatic access to the value
locked in Bitcoin, which famously offers limited programmability itself.
Various approaches have been put forth in recent years, with the vast majority
of proposed mechanisms either building new functionality on top of Bitcoin or
leveraging a bridging mechanism to enable smart contracts that make use of
``wrapped'' bitcoins on entirely different platforms.
  In this work, an architecture is presented that follows a different approach.
The architecture enables the execution of Turing-complete Bitcoin smart
contracts on the Internet Computer (IC), a blockchain platform for hosting and
executing decentralized applications. Instead of using a bridge, IC and Bitcoin
nodes interact directly, eliminating potential security risks that the use of a
bridge entails. This integration requires novel concepts, in particular to
reconcile the probabilistic nature of Bitcoin with the irreversibility of
finalized state changes on the IC, which may be of independent interest.
  In addition to the presentation of the architecture, we provide evaluation
results based on measurements of the Bitcoin integration running on mainnet.
The evaluation results demonstrate that, with finalization in a few seconds and
low execution costs, this integration enables complex Bitcoin-based
decentralized applications that were not practically feasible or economically
viable before.

TL;DR: This paper addresses the carbon footprint issue of data centers by proposing a strategy for operating microservices within hourly carbon budgets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the critical concern of the carbon footprint attributed to data centers.

Method: Developing a carbon-aware operational approach for microservices by selecting suitable versions and scaleouts to maximize experience and revenue within carbon constraints.

Result: The proposed strategy adapts effectively to varying workloads and carbon intensities across diverse configurations.

Conclusion: Microservices can be optimized sustainably while ensuring low latency and accessibility under carbon budget constraints.

Abstract: The carbon footprint of data centers has recently become a critical concern.
So far, most carbon-aware strategies have focused on leveraging the flexibility
of scheduling decisions for batch processing by shifting the time and location
of workload executions. However, such approaches cannot be applied to
service-oriented cloud applications, since they have to be reachable at every
point in time and often at low latencies. We propose a carbon-aware approach
for operating microservices under hourly carbon budgets. By choosing the most
appropriate version and horizontal scaleout for each microservice, our strategy
maximizes user experience and revenue while staying within budget constraints.
Experiments across various application configurations and carbon budgets
demonstrate that the approach adapts properly to changing workloads and carbon
intensities.

Conclusion: Discovery Spaces significantly enhance workload configuration searches, proving generalizable across diverse tasks like Large Language Model inference and Big Data Analytics.

Abstract: Finding the optimal set of cloud resources to deploy a given workload at

millions of deployment options.
  In this paper, we propose Discovery Space, an abstraction that formalizes the
description of workload configuration problems, and exhibits a set of
characteristics required for structured, robust and distributed investigations
of large search spaces. We describe a concrete implementation of the Discovery
Space abstraction and show that it is generalizable across a diverse set of
workloads such as Large Language Model inference and Big Data Analytics.
  We demonstrate that our approach enables safe, transparent sharing of data
between executions of best-of-breed optimizers increasing the efficiency of
optimal configuration detection in large search spaces. We also demonstrate how
Discovery Spaces enable transfer and reuse of knowledge across similar search
spaces, enabling configuration search speed-ups of over 90%.

*Sajid Hussain,Muhammad Sohail,Nauman Ali Khan,Naima Iltaf,Ihtesham ul Islam*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Size-Based Adaptive Federated Learning (SAFL), focusing on dataset size characteristics in FL and showing improved accuracy and efficiency in heterogeneous datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of focus on dataset size characteristics in federated learning, despite its growing importance for preserving data privacy in distributed learning.

Method: A novel progressive FL framework called SAFL, organizing training based on dataset size characteristics, tested on 13 datasets across diverse modalities.

Result: SAFL identified an optimal dataset size range (1000-1500 samples), ranked modality performance (structured data outperforming unstructured), and observed performance drops for datasets over 2000 samples, achieving high accuracy (87.68% average).

Conclusion: SAFL offers significant advancements in FL by optimizing communication efficiency, accuracy, and resource monitoring, making it practical for real-world deployments.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) has emerged as a transformative paradigm for
distributed machine learning while preserving data privacy. However, existing
approaches predominantly focus on model heterogeneity and aggregation
techniques, largely overlooking the fundamental impact of dataset size
characteristics on federated training dynamics. This paper introduces
Size-Based Adaptive Federated Learning (SAFL), a novel progressive training
framework that systematically organizes federated learning based on dataset
size characteristics across heterogeneous multi-modal data. Our comprehensive
experimental evaluation across 13 diverse datasets spanning 7 modalities
(vision, text, time series, audio, sensor, medical vision, and multimodal)
reveals critical insights: 1) an optimal dataset size range of 1000-1500
samples for federated learning effectiveness; 2) a clear modality performance
hierarchy with structured data (time series, sensor) significantly
outperforming unstructured data (text, multimodal); and 3) systematic
performance degradation for large datasets exceeding 2000 samples. SAFL
achieves an average accuracy of 87.68% across all datasets, with structured
data modalities reaching 99%+ accuracy. The framework demonstrates superior
communication efficiency, reducing total data transfer to 7.38 GB across 558
communications while maintaining high performance. Our real-time monitoring
framework provides unprecedented insights into system resource utilization,
network efficiency, and training dynamics. This work fills critical gaps in
understanding how data characteristics should drive federated learning
strategies, providing both theoretical insights and practical guidance for
real-world FL deployments in neural network and learning systems.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces E-ABIN, a framework for detecting and interpreting gene anomalies using machine learning and graph-based methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Growing availability of omics data necessitates robust and interpretable tools for analyzing gene expression and identifying disease-related molecular anomalies.

Method: E-ABIN integrates classical machine learning (SVM, RF) and graph-based deep learning methods (GAE, GAAN) in a user-friendly platform.

Result: E-ABIN demonstrated effectiveness in detecting gene anomalies and provided insights into disease mechanisms in cases like bladder cancer and coeliac disease.

Conclusion: E-ABIN serves as a versatile tool to analyze biological networks, bringing together interpretability and high predictive accuracy for actionable insights.

Abstract: The increasing availability of large-scale omics data calls for robust
analytical frameworks capable of handling complex gene expression datasets
while offering interpretable results. Recent advances in artificial
intelligence have enabled the identification of aberrant molecular patterns
distinguishing disease states from healthy controls. Coupled with improvements
in model interpretability, these tools now support the identification of genes
potentially driving disease phenotypes. However, current approaches to gene
anomaly detection often remain limited to single datasets and lack accessible
graphical interfaces. Here, we introduce E-ABIN, a general-purpose, explainable
framework for Anomaly detection in Biological Networks. E-ABIN combines
classical machine learning and graph-based deep learning techniques within a
unified, user-friendly platform, enabling the detection and interpretation of
anomalies from gene expression or methylation-derived networks. By integrating
algorithms such as Support Vector Machines, Random Forests, Graph Autoencoders
(GAEs), and Graph Adversarial Attributed Networks (GAANs), E-ABIN ensures a
high predictive accuracy while maintaining interpretability. We demonstrate the
utility of E-ABIN through case studies of bladder cancer and coeliac disease,
where it effectively uncovers biologically relevant anomalies and offers
insights into disease mechanisms.

### [182] [On Context-Content Uncertainty Principle](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20699)
*Xin Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The Context-Content Uncertainty Principle (CCUP) outlines how inference operates under uncertainty by aligning high-entropy contexts with low-entropy content within a layered computational framework.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide a theoretical foundation for understanding how both biological brains and machines handle uncertainty by leveraging structured, content-driven inference.

Method: A computational framework based on directional entropy minimization is developed, with four operational layers: Core Inference Constraints, Resource Allocation Principles, Temporal Bootstrapping Dynamics, and Spatial Hierarchical Composition. Formal theorems and computational simulations are used to illustrate these principles.

Result: The developed CCUP framework demonstrates efficiency in handling inference under uncertainty and offers a unifying explanation for recursive alignment of structure and specificity in both brains and machines.

Conclusion: Brains and machines minimize uncertainty not just through inference but by resolving entropy gradients in a cycle-consistent manner that aligns context with structured content through recursive processes.

Abstract: The Context-Content Uncertainty Principle (CCUP) proposes that inference
under uncertainty is governed by an entropy asymmetry between context and
content: high-entropy contexts must be interpreted through alignment with
low-entropy, structured content. In this paper, we develop a layered
computational framework that derives operational principles from this
foundational asymmetry. At the base level, CCUP formalizes inference as
directional entropy minimization, establishing a variational gradient that
favors content-first structuring. Building upon this, we identify four
hierarchical layers of operational principles: (\textbf{L1}) \emph{Core
Inference Constraints}, including structure-before-specificity, asymmetric
inference flow, cycle-consistent bootstrapping, and conditional compression,
all shown to be mutually reducible; (\textbf{L2}) \emph{Resource Allocation
Principles}, such as precision-weighted attention, asymmetric learning rates,
and attractor-based memory encoding; (\textbf{L3}) \emph{Temporal Bootstrapping
Dynamics}, which organize learning over time via structure-guided curricula;
and (\textbf{L4}) \emph{Spatial Hierarchical Composition}, which integrates
these mechanisms into self-organizing cycles of memory, inference, and
planning. We present formal equivalence theorems, a dependency lattice among
principles, and computational simulations demonstrating the efficiency gains of
CCUP-aligned inference. This work provides a unified theoretical foundation for
understanding how brains and machines minimize uncertainty through recursive
structure-specificity alignment. The brain is not just an inference machine. It
is a cycle-consistent entropy gradient resolver, aligning structure and
specificity via path-dependent, content-seeded simulation.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces an automated GPU kernel optimization methodology using Large Language Models (LLMs), particularly for emerging hardware with limited traditional support.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Optimizing GPU kernels is highly complex, especially on newer architectures with limited documentation or tools. The paper seeks to simplify this process using LLMs to assist with code iteration and optimization.

Method: The authors developed a multi-stage evolutionary process with LLMs: (a) selecting prior code versions, (b) hypothesizing optimization steps based on GPU literature, and (c) autonomously implementing and evaluating modifications using timing data.

Result: Performance data remains embargoed, but the paper shares qualitative insights into the design and workflow, demonstrating the potential of LLM agents for GPU optimization.

Conclusion: LLM-driven processes could democratize GPU kernel optimization by lowering the need for deep expertise, particularly benefiting resource-constrained or rapidly changing hardware environments.

Abstract: Optimizing GPU kernels for high performance is a complex task, often
demanding deep architectural knowledge, extensive profiling, and iterative
experimentation. This challenge is amplified when targeting newer or
less-documented GPU architectures where traditional development aids are
scarce. This paper introduces an LLM-powered "GPU Kernel Scientist," an
automated methodology for iteratively refining accelerator kernels.
  Our methodology employs LLMs in a multi-stage, evolutionary process: (a)
strategically selecting promising prior code versions as a basis for new
iterations; (b) generating hypotheses for optimization experiments, based on
existing code and assimilated knowledge from general GPU literature; and (c)
autonomously implementing these experiments through code modification and
subsequent submission to an external evaluation system, using only observed
timing data as performance feedback. We detail how this approach navigates the
challenges of the AMD MI300 target architecture and leverages LLMs to
compensate for limited domain-specific human expertise.
  Since quantitative results from an ongoing performance competition were
embargoed on paper submission date, we present the architectural design,
operational workflow, and qualitative insights, highlighting the potential of
LLM-driven agents to democratise and accelerate GPU kernel optimization,
especially in resource-constrained or rapidly evolving hardware environments.

*Vineet Jain,Kusha Sareen,Mohammad Pedramfar,Siamak Ravanbakhsh*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Diffusion Tree Sampling (DTS) and its greedy variant DTS★, methods for improving pretrained diffusion model adaptation via inference-time alignment as a search problem, improving efficiency and sample quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address inefficiencies and inaccuracies in existing steering methods for pretrained diffusion models, specifically inaccurate value estimation at high noise levels and the lack of reuse of past runs' computations.

Method: The authors propose adapting the diffusion process to include a Monte Carlo Tree Search-inspired method called Diffusion Tree Sampling (DTS). They sample target distributions by propagating rewards through the diffusion chain, refining estimates, and applying global search strategies like their greedy variant, DTS★.

Result: In experiments, DTS achieved comparable sample quality (FID on MNIST and CIFAR-10) with up to 10× less computation than existing baselines. DTS★ performed similarly well in text-to-image and language completion tasks with up to 5× less computation and scaled well for higher compute budgets.

Conclusion: DTS and DTS★ enable computationally efficient and progressively better sampling through past computation reuse, making them scalable and effective for inference-time alignment in generative modeling tasks.

Abstract: Adapting a pretrained diffusion model to new objectives at inference time
remains an open problem in generative modeling. Existing steering methods
suffer from inaccurate value estimation, especially at high noise levels, which
biases guidance. Moreover, information from past runs is not reused to improve
sample quality, resulting in inefficient use of compute. Inspired by the
success of Monte Carlo Tree Search, we address these limitations by casting
inference-time alignment as a search problem that reuses past computations. We
introduce a tree-based approach that samples from the reward-aligned target
density by propagating terminal rewards back through the diffusion chain and
iteratively refining value estimates with each additional generation. Our
proposed method, Diffusion Tree Sampling (DTS), produces asymptotically exact
samples from the target distribution in the limit of infinite rollouts, and its
greedy variant, Diffusion Tree Search (DTS$^\star$), performs a global search
for high reward samples. On MNIST and CIFAR-10 class-conditional generation,
DTS matches the FID of the best-performing baseline with up to $10\times$ less
compute. In text-to-image generation and language completion tasks, DTS$^\star$
effectively searches for high reward samples that match best-of-N with up to
$5\times$ less compute. By reusing information from previous generations, we
get an anytime algorithm that turns additional compute into steadily better
samples, providing a scalable approach for inference-time alignment of
diffusion models.

*Kin Kwan Leung,Rasa Hosseinzadeh,Gabriel Loaiza-Ganem*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper formalizes the theoretical basis for the FLIPD LID estimator in diffusion models, extending its validity to more realistic data scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To establish a robust theoretical foundation for the FLIPD local intrinsic dimension (LID) estimator, which quantifies data complexity and has applications in outlier detection and adversarial analysis.

Method: The authors analyze the FLIPD estimator, extending its proof of correctness from affine submanifolds to realistic data manifolds, and explore its behavior under Gaussian and uniform noise convolutions.

Result: FLIPD's correctness is formally proven under realistic assumptions, alongside demonstrations for cases involving uniform noise convolutions.

Conclusion: The expanded theoretical foundation of FLIPD enhances its credibility and applicability, making it a more practical tool for real-world applications in data analysis and generative modeling.

Abstract: The manifold hypothesis asserts that data of interest in high-dimensional
ambient spaces, such as image data, lies on unknown low-dimensional
submanifolds. Diffusion models (DMs) -- which operate by convolving data with
progressively larger amounts of Gaussian noise and then learning to revert this
process -- have risen to prominence as the most performant generative models,
and are known to be able to learn distributions with low-dimensional support.
For a given datum in one of these submanifolds, we should thus intuitively
expect DMs to have implicitly learned its corresponding local intrinsic
dimension (LID), i.e. the dimension of the submanifold it belongs to. Kamkari
et al. (2024b) recently showed that this is indeed the case by linking this LID
to the rate of change of the log marginal densities of the DM with respect to
the amount of added noise, resulting in an LID estimator known as FLIPD. LID
estimators such as FLIPD have a plethora of uses, among others they quantify
the complexity of a given datum, and can be used to detect outliers,
adversarial examples and AI-generated text. FLIPD achieves state-of-the-art
performance at LID estimation, yet its theoretical underpinnings are incomplete
since Kamkari et al. (2024b) only proved its correctness under the highly
unrealistic assumption of affine submanifolds. In this work we bridge this gap
by formally proving the correctness of FLIPD under realistic assumptions.
Additionally, we show that an analogous result holds when Gaussian convolutions
are replaced with uniform ones, and discuss the relevance of this result.

Conclusion: Step-wise symbolic verification is demonstrated as a powerful method for enhancing LLM performance in solving complex scientific problems, with strong generalizability between mathematical and physics domains.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown strong capabilities in complex
reasoning, and test-time scaling techniques can enhance their performance with
comparably low cost. Many of these methods have been developed and evaluated on
mathematical reasoning benchmarks such as AIME. This paper investigates whether
the lessons learned from these benchmarks generalize to the domain of advanced
theoretical physics. We evaluate a range of common test-time scaling methods on
the TPBench physics dataset and compare their effectiveness with results on
AIME. To better leverage the structure of physics problems, we develop a novel,
symbolic weak-verifier framework to improve parallel scaling results. Our
empirical results demonstrate that this method significantly outperforms
existing test-time scaling approaches on TPBench. We also evaluate our method
on AIME, confirming its effectiveness in solving advanced mathematical
problems. Our findings highlight the power of step-wise symbolic verification
for tackling complex scientific problems.

Conclusion: Foundation models show promise for transformative progress in materials science, but addressing their limitations through areas like scalable pretraining and governance is essential for achieving their full potential.

Abstract: Foundation models (FMs) are catalyzing a transformative shift in materials
science (MatSci) by enabling scalable, general-purpose, and multimodal AI
systems for scientific discovery. Unlike traditional machine learning models,
which are typically narrow in scope and require task-specific engineering, FMs
offer cross-domain generalization and exhibit emergent capabilities. Their
versatility is especially well-suited to materials science, where research
challenges span diverse data types and scales. This survey provides a
comprehensive overview of foundation models, agentic systems, datasets, and
computational tools supporting this growing field. We introduce a task-driven
taxonomy encompassing six broad application areas: data extraction,
interpretation and Q\&A; atomistic simulation; property prediction; materials
structure, design and discovery; process planning, discovery, and optimization;
and multiscale modeling. We discuss recent advances in both unimodal and
multimodal FMs, as well as emerging large language model (LLM) agents.
Furthermore, we review standardized datasets, open-source tools, and autonomous
experimental platforms that collectively fuel the development and integration
of FMs into research workflows. We assess the early successes of foundation
models and identify persistent limitations, including challenges in
generalizability, interpretability, data imbalance, safety concerns, and
limited multimodal fusion. Finally, we articulate future research directions
centered on scalable pretraining, continual learning, data governance, and
trustworthiness.

### [188] [Multiple Streams of Relation Extraction: Enriching and Recalling in Transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20746)
*Todd Nief,David Reber,Sean Richardson,Ari Holtzman*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper investigates how fine-tuned language models integrate and utilize information about specific relations, introducing dynamic weight-grafting to explore how finetuned knowledge affects predictions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding where and how relations learned during finetuning of LLMs are stored and recalled when predictions are made.

Method: Proposes dynamic weight-grafting between fine-tuned and pre-trained language models to study mechanisms such as entity processing and information recall.

Result: Fine-tuned LLMs combine entity processing and information recall pathways in varied ways. "Recall" utilizes task-specific attention and final-layer mechanisms.

Conclusion: Both "enrichment" and "recall" pathways are pivotal for encoding and recalling relational knowledge in LLMs, with redundancy and distinct layer roles in this process detailed.

Abstract: When an LLM learns a relation during finetuning (e.g., new movie releases,
corporate mergers, etc.), where does this information go? Is it extracted when
the model processes an entity, recalled just-in-time before a prediction, or
are there multiple separate heuristics? Existing localization approaches (e.g.
activation patching) are ill-suited for this analysis because they tend to
replace parts of the residual stream, potentially deleting information. To fill
this gap, we propose dynamic weight-grafting between fine-tuned and pre-trained
language models to show that fine-tuned language models both (1) extract
relation information learned during finetuning while processing entities and
(2) ``recall" this information in later layers while generating predictions. In
some cases, models need both of these pathways to correctly generate finetuned
information while, in other cases, a single ``enrichment" or ``recall" pathway
alone is sufficient. We examine the necessity and sufficiency of these
information pathways, examining what layers they occur at, how much redundancy
they exhibit, and which model components are involved -- finding that the
``recall" pathway occurs via both task-specific attention mechanisms and a
relation extraction step in the output of the attention and the feedforward
networks at the final layers before next token prediction.

### [189] [Characterization and Mitigation of Training Instabilities in Microscaling Formats](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20752)
*Huangyuan Su,Mujin Kwun,Stephanie Gil,Sham Kakade,Nikhil Anand*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper examines the stability challenges and strategies when using low-precision formats like Microscaling (MX) in training large language models, finding significant instabilities that can be mitigated with adaptive changes mid-training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Training large-scale language models is resource-intensive, driving interest in low-precision formats to reduce computational costs.

Method: Analyzing nearly 1000 language models across varying compute scales and conducting controlled experiments to investigate instabilities in low-precision training formats.

Result: Identifies sharp instabilities caused by multiplicative gradient bias in low-precision formats and demonstrates that adaptive precision schemes can stabilize training.

Conclusion: Stabilization strategies, including hybrid precision configurations, make low-precision formats viable for competitive performance in language model training.

Abstract: Training large language models is an expensive, compute-bound process that
must be repeated as models scale, algorithms improve, and new data is
collected. To address this, next-generation hardware accelerators increasingly
support lower-precision arithmetic formats, such as the Microscaling (MX)
formats introduced in NVIDIA's Blackwell architecture. These formats use a
shared scale within blocks of parameters to extend representable range and
perform forward/backward GEMM operations in reduced precision for efficiency
gains. In this work, we investigate the challenges and viability of
block-scaled precision formats during model training. Across nearly one
thousand language models trained from scratch -- spanning compute budgets from
$2 \times 10^{17}$ to $4.8 \times 10^{19}$ FLOPs and sweeping over a broad
range of weight-activation precision combinations -- we consistently observe
that training in MX formats exhibits sharp, stochastic instabilities in the
loss, particularly at larger compute scales. To explain this phenomenon, we
conduct controlled experiments and ablations on a smaller proxy model that
exhibits similar behavior as the language model, sweeping across architectural
settings, hyperparameters, and precision formats. These experiments motivate a
simple model in which multiplicative gradient bias introduced by the
quantization of layer-norm affine parameters and a small fraction of
activations can trigger runaway divergence. Through \emph{in situ} intervention
experiments on our proxy model, we demonstrate that instabilities can be
averted or delayed by modifying precision schemes mid-training. Guided by these
findings, we evaluate stabilization strategies in the LLM setting and show that
certain hybrid configurations recover performance competitive with
full-precision training. We release our code at
https://github.com/Hither1/systems-scaling.

### [190] [Stochastic and Non-local Closure Modeling for Nonlinear Dynamical Systems via Latent Score-based Generative Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20771)
*Xinghao Dong,Huchen Yang,Jin-Long Wu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a latent score-based generative AI framework for efficiently modeling complex, nonlinear dynamical systems by utilizing stochastic closure models in latent spaces, achieving computational acceleration and accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Modeling multiscale dynamical systems lacking clear scale separation (e.g., turbulent flows) is computationally expensive, and current deterministic methods are restrictive and impractical for such regimes.

Method: The authors combine convolutional autoencoders with conditional diffusion models to create a reduced-dimensional latent space for sampling, achieving efficient and physically consistent stochastic modeling.

Result: The framework discovers appropriate latent spaces with minimal reconstruction errors and enables accurate diffusion modeling while reducing the computational cost associated with inference.

Conclusion: The proposed method accelerates stochastic modeling in non-linear systems while maintaining predictive accuracy, making it practical for real-world applications.

Abstract: We propose a latent score-based generative AI framework for learning
stochastic, non-local closure models and constitutive laws in nonlinear
dynamical systems of computational mechanics. This work addresses a key
challenge of modeling complex multiscale dynamical systems without a clear
scale separation, for which numerically resolving all scales is prohibitively
expensive, e.g., for engineering turbulent flows. While classical closure
modeling methods leverage domain knowledge to approximate subgrid-scale
phenomena, their deterministic and local assumptions can be too restrictive in
regimes lacking a clear scale separation. Recent developments of
diffusion-based stochastic models have shown promise in the context of closure
modeling, but their prohibitive computational inference cost limits practical
applications for many real-world applications. This work addresses this
limitation by jointly training convolutional autoencoders with conditional
diffusion models in the latent spaces, significantly reducing the
dimensionality of the sampling process while preserving essential physical
characteristics. Numerical results demonstrate that the joint training approach
helps discover a proper latent space that not only guarantees small
reconstruction errors but also ensures good performance of the diffusion model
in the latent space. When integrated into numerical simulations, the proposed
stochastic modeling framework via latent conditional diffusion models achieves
significant computational acceleration while maintaining comparable predictive
accuracy to standard diffusion models in physical spaces.

### [191] [Stochastic Parameter Decomposition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20790)
*Lucius Bushnaq,Dan Braun,Lee Sharkey*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Stochastic Parameter Decomposition (SPD), a method for decomposing neural networks that is more scalable and robust than current methods like Attribution-based Parameter Decomposition (APD).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the limitations of Attribution-based Parameter Decomposition (APD), which is computationally expensive, sensitive to hyperparameters, and has limited applicability to larger or more complex models.

Method: The authors propose Stochastic Parameter Decomposition (SPD), which decomposes neural network parameters into a sum of sparsely used vectors, making it computationally efficient and robust to hyperparameter variations.

Result: SPD demonstrates scalability by decomposing slightly larger and more complex models than APD, avoids shrinkage issues, and identifies ground truth mechanisms effectively in toy models.

Conclusion: SPD bridges causal mediation analysis and network decomposition methods, enabling advancements in mechanistic interpretability by making linear parameter decomposition methods scalable to larger models.

Abstract: A key step in reverse engineering neural networks is to decompose them into
simpler parts that can be studied in relative isolation. Linear parameter
decomposition -- a framework that has been proposed to resolve several issues
with current decomposition methods -- decomposes neural network parameters into
a sum of sparsely used vectors in parameter space. However, the current main
method in this framework, Attribution-based Parameter Decomposition (APD), is
impractical on account of its computational cost and sensitivity to
hyperparameters. In this work, we introduce \textit{Stochastic Parameter
Decomposition} (SPD), a method that is more scalable and robust to
hyperparameters than APD, which we demonstrate by decomposing models that are
slightly larger and more complex than was possible to decompose with APD. We
also show that SPD avoids other issues, such as shrinkage of the learned
parameters, and better identifies ground truth mechanisms in toy models. By
bridging causal mediation analysis and network decomposition methods, this
demonstration opens up new research possibilities in mechanistic
interpretability by removing barriers to scaling linear parameter decomposition
methods to larger models. We release a library for running SPD and reproducing
our experiments at https://github.com/goodfire-ai/spd.

### [192] [Optimal Single-Policy Sample Complexity and Transient Coverage for Average-Reward Offline RL](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20904)
*Matthew Zurek,Guy Zamir,Yudong Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The study focuses on offline reinforcement learning in average-reward MDPs, introducing a novel algorithm and achieving single-policy sample complexity guarantees.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in offline RL for average-reward MDPs related to distribution shift, non-uniform coverage, and limited theoretical understanding.

Method: The authors develop an algorithm using pessimistic discounted value iteration with a novel quantile clipping technique and sharper penalty functions, aimed at targeting single-policy guarantees without requiring prior parameter knowledge.

Result: Achieved sharp single-policy guarantees depending on the bias span and policy hitting radius, and introduced lower bounds for the problem.

Conclusion: The study provides theoretical advancements and practical algorithms for average-reward offline RL, setting the groundwork for more precise single-policy analysis and mitigating restrictive assumptions of prior work.

Abstract: We study offline reinforcement learning in average-reward MDPs, which
presents increased challenges from the perspectives of distribution shift and
non-uniform coverage, and has been relatively underexamined from a theoretical
perspective. While previous work obtains performance guarantees under
single-policy data coverage assumptions, such guarantees utilize additional
complexity measures which are uniform over all policies, such as the uniform
mixing time. We develop sharp guarantees depending only on the target policy,
specifically the bias span and a novel policy hitting radius, yielding the
first fully single-policy sample complexity bound for average-reward offline
RL. We are also the first to handle general weakly communicating MDPs,
contrasting restrictive structural assumptions made in prior work. To achieve
this, we introduce an algorithm based on pessimistic discounted value iteration
enhanced by a novel quantile clipping technique, which enables the use of a
sharper empirical-span-based penalty function. Our algorithm also does not
require any prior parameter knowledge for its implementation. Remarkably, we
show via hard examples that learning under our conditions requires coverage
assumptions beyond the stationary distribution of the target policy,
distinguishing single-policy complexity measures from previously examined
cases. We also develop lower bounds nearly matching our main result.

### [193] [FINN-GL: Generalized Mixed-Precision Extensions for FPGA-Accelerated LSTMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20810)
*Shashwat Khandelwal,Jakoba Petri-Koenig,Thomas B. Preußer,Michaela Blott,Shreejith Shanker*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper presents an approach to deploy quantized LSTMs efficiently on FPGAs using the FINN framework, addressing resource constraints while maintaining accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing tools for FPGA-based AI acceleration largely target feed-forward networks and often neglect recurrent neural networks like LSTMs due to their computational complexity.

Method: The authors use the FINN framework and ONNX's Scan operator to model LSTM computations, introduce mixed quantization support, and perform hardware mapping using HLS kernel libraries for FPGA deployment.

Result: The method was validated by deploying a ConvLSTM model for stock prediction, achieving competitive accuracy, balanced performance, and efficient resource usage on a XCZU7EV FPGA device.

Conclusion: The proposed flow demonstrates a viable, generalizable approach to enable resource-efficient and accurate RNN accelerator designs on FPGAs.

Abstract: Recurrent neural networks (RNNs), particularly LSTMs, are effective for
time-series tasks like sentiment analysis and short-term stock prediction.
However, their computational complexity poses challenges for real-time
deployment in resource constrained environments. While FPGAs offer a promising
platform for energy-efficient AI acceleration, existing tools mainly target
feed-forward networks, and LSTM acceleration typically requires full custom
implementation. In this paper, we address this gap by leveraging the
open-source and extensible FINN framework to enable the generalized deployment
of LSTMs on FPGAs. Specifically, we leverage the Scan operator from the Open
Neural Network Exchange (ONNX) specification to model the recurrent nature of
LSTM computations, enabling support for mixed quantisation within them and
functional verification of LSTM-based models. Furthermore, we introduce custom
transformations within the FINN compiler to map the quantised ONNX computation
graph to hardware blocks from the HLS kernel library of the FINN compiler and
Vitis HLS. We validate the proposed tool-flow by training a quantised ConvLSTM
model for a mid-price stock prediction task using the widely used dataset and
generating a corresponding hardware IP of the model using our flow, targeting
the XCZU7EV device. We show that the generated quantised ConvLSTM accelerator
through our flow achieves a balance between performance (latency) and resource
consumption, while matching (or bettering) inference accuracy of
state-of-the-art models with reduced precision. We believe that the
generalisable nature of the proposed flow will pave the way for
resource-efficient RNN accelerator designs on FPGAs.

### [194] [An Information-Theoretic Analysis for Federated Learning under Concept Drift](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21036)
*Fu Peng,Meng Zhang,Ming Tang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper addresses the challenge of concept drift in federated learning (FL) by modeling it as a Markov chain, studying drift patterns, and proposing a new algorithm leveraging KL divergence and mutual information.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to tackle the issue of concept drift in federated learning, which occurs when data distributions change over time, leading to degraded model performance.

Method: The authors analyze concept drift using information theory, introduce the Stationary Generalization Error metric, and propose an algorithm that incorporates KL divergence and mutual information into the empirical risk minimization approach. They also investigate the performance-cost tradeoff using a Pareto front.

Result: The proposed method outperforms existing techniques across three types of concept drift (periodic, gradual, random), as validated theoretically and experimentally via an FL testbed using Raspberry Pi4 devices.

Conclusion: The study confirms that concept drift significantly impacts FL performance and that their algorithm effectively mitigates this issue, enhancing long-term performance in FL systems.

Abstract: Recent studies in federated learning (FL) commonly train models on static
datasets. However, real-world data often arrives as streams with shifting
distributions, causing performance degradation known as concept drift. This
paper analyzes FL performance under concept drift using information theory and
proposes an algorithm to mitigate the performance degradation. We model concept
drift as a Markov chain and introduce the \emph{Stationary Generalization
Error} to assess a model's capability to capture characteristics of future
unseen data. Its upper bound is derived using KL divergence and mutual
information. We study three drift patterns (periodic, gradual, and random) and
their impact on FL performance. Inspired by this, we propose an algorithm that
regularizes the empirical risk minimization approach with KL divergence and
mutual information, thereby enhancing long-term performance. We also explore
the performance-cost tradeoff by identifying a Pareto front. To validate our
approach, we build an FL testbed using Raspberry Pi4 devices. Experimental
results corroborate with theoretical findings, confirming that drift patterns
significantly affect performance. Our method consistently outperforms existing
approaches for these three patterns, demonstrating its effectiveness in
adapting concept drift in FL.

*Jakub Piwko,Jędrzej Ruciński,Dawid Płudowski,Antoni Zajko,Patryzja Żak,Mateusz Zacharecki,Anna Kozak,Katarzyna Woźnica*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces Hellsemble, an efficient and interpretable ensemble learning framework that enhances binary classification by leveraging dataset complexity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to overcome the high computational costs and limited adaptability to heterogeneous data distributions observed in traditional ensemble methods.

Method: Hellsemble uses an iterative partitioning strategy, training models on increasingly challenging subsets and employing a router model that assigns instances to the most suitable base model based on their difficulty.

Result: Hellsemble demonstrates strong results on OpenML-CC18 and Tabzilla benchmarks, outperforming classical ensemble methods in many cases.

Conclusion: Embracing instance-level difficulty can enable more efficient and robust ensemble learning designs, as shown by Hellsemble's accuracy and interpretability.

Abstract: Ensemble learning has proven effective in boosting predictive performance,
but traditional methods such as bagging, boosting, and dynamic ensemble
selection (DES) suffer from high computational cost and limited adaptability to
heterogeneous data distributions. To address these limitations, we propose
Hellsemble, a novel and interpretable ensemble framework for binary
classification that leverages dataset complexity during both training and
inference. Hellsemble incrementally partitions the dataset into circles of
difficulty by iteratively passing misclassified instances from simpler models
to subsequent ones, forming a committee of specialised base learners. Each
model is trained on increasingly challenging subsets, while a separate router
model learns to assign new instances to the most suitable base model based on
inferred difficulty. Hellsemble achieves strong classification accuracy while
maintaining computational efficiency and interpretability. Experimental results
on OpenML-CC18 and Tabzilla benchmarks demonstrate that Hellsemble often
outperforms classical ensemble methods. Our findings suggest that embracing
instance-level difficulty offers a promising direction for constructing
efficient and robust ensemble systems.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes CHOOSE, a shallow Transformer framework using chain-of-thought reasoning for efficient wireless symbol detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Wireless communication problems demand efficient and adaptable solutions, particularly for resource-constrained mobile devices.

Method: CHOOSE introduces autoregressive latent reasoning to enhance the performance of shallow Transformer models without increasing depth.

Result: CHOOSE outperforms shallow Transformers and achieves detection performance comparable to deep Transformers with reduced computational requirements.

Conclusion: The approach demonstrates the feasibility of efficient Transformer algorithms for wireless receivers, paving the way for resource-constrained deployments.

Abstract: Transformers have shown potential in solving wireless communication problems,
particularly via in-context learning (ICL), where models adapt to new tasks
through prompts without requiring model updates. However, prior ICL-based
Transformer models rely on deep architectures with many layers to achieve
satisfactory performance, resulting in substantial storage and computational
costs. In this work, we propose CHain Of thOught Symbol dEtection (CHOOSE), a
CoT-enhanced shallow Transformer framework for wireless symbol detection. By
introducing autoregressive latent reasoning steps within the hidden space,
CHOOSE significantly improves the reasoning capacity of shallow models (1-2
layers) without increasing model depth. This design enables lightweight
Transformers to achieve detection performance comparable to much deeper models,
making them well-suited for deployment on resource-constrained mobile devices.
Experimental results demonstrate that our approach outperforms conventional
shallow Transformers and achieves performance comparable to that of deep
Transformers, while maintaining storage and computational efficiency. This
represents a promising direction for implementing Transformer-based algorithms
in wireless receivers with limited computational resources.

*Furkan Mumcu,Yasin Yilmaz*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel regression-based method to detect adversarial examples by analyzing the varying impacts on DNN layers, showcasing its universal applicability, computational efficiency, and compatibility across domains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep Neural Networks are susceptible to adversarial attacks, and detecting these attacks is essential for practical defense beyond improving robustness.

Method: The authors train a lightweight regression model to predict deeper-layer features from early-layer features, using prediction error as a measure to identify adversarial examples.

Result: The proposed method achieves high detection accuracy, efficiency suitable for real-time processing, and compatibility across different DNN architectures and domains.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that their detection method is practical, robust, and versatile for securing DNNs across various applications like image, video, and audio processing.

Abstract: Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are notoriously vulnerable to adversarial input
designs with limited noise budgets. While numerous successful attacks with
subtle modifications to original input have been proposed, defense techniques
against these attacks are relatively understudied. Existing defense approaches
either focus on improving DNN robustness by negating the effects of
perturbations or use a secondary model to detect adversarial data. Although
equally important, the attack detection approach, which is studied in this
work, provides a more practical defense compared to the robustness approach. We
show that the existing detection methods are either ineffective against the
state-of-the-art attack techniques or computationally inefficient for real-time
processing. We propose a novel universal and efficient method to detect
adversarial examples by analyzing the varying degrees of impact of attacks on
different DNN layers. {Our method trains a lightweight regression model that
predicts deeper-layer features from early-layer features, and uses the
prediction error to detect adversarial samples.} Through theoretical arguments
and extensive experiments, we demonstrate that our detection method is highly
effective, computationally efficient for real-time processing, compatible with
any DNN architecture, and applicable across different domains, such as image,
video, and audio.

*Silas Dobler,Florian Lemmerich*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel neural network compression technique based on linearity properties enabled by ReLU-like activations, achieving up to 75% reduction in model size without loss of accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current neural network compression techniques focus on removing unnecessary parameters through importance and redundancy measures, but there is a need for alternative methods to further augment these optimized solutions.

Method: The proposed method identifies neurons that exhibit linear behavior due to frequent activation by ReLU-like functions, enabling merging of subsequent layers. The approach integrates theoretical insights and experimental validation.

Result: The method achieves lossless compression to 25% of the original model size across most tested models and exhibits compatibility with existing compression methods by not interfering with their performance.

Conclusion: This theory-backed technique offers a foundation for a new class of compression approaches that lead to smaller, more efficient neural networks, with potential for combination with other methods.

Abstract: In neural network compression, most current methods reduce unnecessary
parameters by measuring importance and redundancy. To augment already highly
optimized existing solutions, we propose linearity-based compression as a novel
way to reduce weights in a neural network. It is based on the intuition that
with ReLU-like activation functions, neurons that are almost always activated
behave linearly, allowing for merging of subsequent layers. We introduce the
theory underlying this compression and evaluate our approach experimentally.
Our novel method achieves a lossless compression down to 1/4 of the original
model size in over the majority of tested models. Applying our method on
already importance-based pruned models shows very little interference between
different types of compression, demonstrating the option of successful
combination of techniques. Overall, our work lays the foundation for a new type
of compression method that enables smaller and ultimately more efficient neural
network models.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper investigates performance issues in distributed GNN frameworks for link prediction and proposes SpLPG, which reduces communication costs while preserving accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Distributed GNN systems are often optimized for node classification, but their performance on link prediction suffers due to graph partitioning and negative sampling challenges.

Method: The authors analyze performance degradation caused by partitioning and sampling, and introduce SpLPG, a graph sparsification technique that minimizes communication costs while maintaining accuracy.

Result: SpLPG reduces communication costs by up to 80%, with minimal impact on link prediction accuracy, as demonstrated in experiments on real-world datasets.

Conclusion: SpLPG is an effective solution for distributed GNN training for link prediction, addressing scalability and accuracy challenges.

Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) are powerful tools for solving graph-related
problems. Distributed GNN frameworks and systems enhance the scalability of
GNNs and accelerate model training, yet most are optimized for node
classification. Their performance on link prediction remains underexplored.
This paper demystifies distributed training of GNNs for link prediction by
investigating the issue of performance degradation when each worker trains a
GNN on its assigned partitioned subgraph without having access to the entire
graph. We discover that the main sources of the issue come from not only the
information loss caused by graph partitioning but also the ways of drawing
negative samples during model training. While sharing the complete graph
information with each worker resolves the issue and preserves link prediction
accuracy, it incurs a high communication cost. We propose SpLPG, which
effectively leverages graph sparsification to mitigate the issue of performance
degradation at a reduced communication cost. Experiment results on several
public real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of SpLPG, which
reduces the communication overhead by up to about 80% while mostly preserving
link prediction accuracy.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve cognitive radar systems' capability to balance scanning and tracking by optimizing time allocation.

Method: Formulates the problem as a multi-objective optimization problem and applies DDPG and SAC algorithms for Pareto-optimal solutions; NSGA-II is also used for upper bound estimation.

Result: SAC outperforms DDPG in terms of stability and sample efficiency; both adapt well to scenarios.

Conclusion: The study enhances cognitive radar systems by achieving efficient trade-offs in dynamic settings using advanced algorithms.

Abstract: The time allocation problem in multi-function cognitive radar systems focuses
on the trade-off between scanning for newly emerging targets and tracking the
previously detected targets. We formulate this as a multi-objective
optimization problem and employ deep reinforcement learning to find
Pareto-optimal solutions and compare deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG)
and soft actor-critic (SAC) algorithms. Our results demonstrate the
effectiveness of both algorithms in adapting to various scenarios, with SAC
showing improved stability and sample efficiency compared to DDPG. We further
employ the NSGA-II algorithm to estimate an upper bound on the Pareto front of
the considered problem. This work contributes to the development of more
efficient and adaptive cognitive radar systems capable of balancing multiple
competing objectives in dynamic environments.

TL;DR: The study examines memorization risks associated with LoRA fine-tuning in large language models, finding it significantly safer compared to full fine-tuning while ensuring robust task performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses vulnerabilities of large language models to data extraction attacks and examines the memorization risks inherent in the fine-tuning process, particularly focusing on LoRA fine-tuning.

Method: The researchers utilize a relaxed similarity-based memorization metric to analyze how factors like model scale and data duplication influence memorization across different fine-tuning methods.

Result: LoRA fine-tuning is found to substantially reduce memorization risks when compared to full fine-tuning, while achieving strong task performance.

Conclusion: LoRA fine-tuning serves as a safer and efficient method to mitigate memorization risks, making it a desirable approach for parameter-efficient fine-tuning in large language models.

Abstract: Memorization in large language models (LLMs) makes them vulnerable to data
extraction attacks. While pre-training memorization has been extensively
studied, fewer works have explored its impact in fine-tuning, particularly for
LoRA fine-tuning, a widely adopted parameter-efficient method.
  In this work, we re-examine memorization in fine-tuning and uncover a
surprising divergence from prior findings across different fine-tuning
strategies. Factors such as model scale and data duplication, which strongly
influence memorization in pre-training and full fine-tuning, do not follow the
same trend in LoRA fine-tuning. Using a more relaxed similarity-based
memorization metric, we demonstrate that LoRA significantly reduces
memorization risks compared to full fine-tuning, while still maintaining strong

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Omniwise is an LLM-based self-supervised pipeline for GPU kernel performance prediction, achieving high accuracy without execution or profiling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To leverage large language models for a novel application: GPU kernel performance prediction, improving performance profiling processes.

Method: Introduced Omniwise, a self-supervised pipeline applying model-agnostic LLMs to analyze kernel code and predict performance metrics without execution.

Result: Achieved over 90% predictions within 10% relative error on AMD MI250 and MI300X, plus integration into workflows via tools like Visual Studio Code plugin.

Conclusion: Omniwise demonstrates the effectiveness of LLMs in performance prediction, paving the way for innovative applications in GPU profiling and developer tools.

Abstract: In recent years, the rapid advancement of deep neural networks (DNNs) has
revolutionized artificial intelligence, enabling models with unprecedented
capabilities in understanding, generating, and processing complex data. These
powerful architectures have transformed a wide range of downstream
applications, tackling tasks beyond human reach. In this paper, we introduce
Omniwise, the first end-to-end, self-supervised fine-tuning pipeline that
applies large language models (LLMs) to GPU kernel performance prediction--a
novel use case in performance profiling. Omniwise is model-agnostic and
lightweight, achieving strong results even with a small 3B-parameter model. It
can predict key performance metrics, including memory bandwidth, cache hit
rates, GFLOPs, and arithmetic intensity, directly from kernel code without the
need for code execution or profiling tools. Our approach achieves over 90% of
predictions within 10% relative error on GPU kernels executed on AMD MI250 and
MI300X architectures. In addition to the pipeline, we develop an online
inference server and a Visual Studio Code plugin that seamlessly integrate
LLM-based performance prediction into developers' workflows.

*Yian Wang,Ali Ebrahimpour-Boroojeny,Hari Sundaram*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes RWFT, a lightweight technique to erase a specific class from trained classifiers without retraining, addressing issues with user deletion rights and biased predictions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need to enforce user deletion rights and mitigate harmful or biased predictions drives the study of forgetting specific classes from already trained models.

Method: RWFT redistributes probability mass predictions for samples in the forgotten class and introduces a TV-based metric to prevent residual leakage.

Result: RWFT achieves superior performance compared to existing methods, showing a 2.79% improvement in established metrics and a 111.45% improvement in the TV-based metric.

Conclusion: RWFT addresses key challenges in model unlearning by robustly erasing classes, significantly outmatching state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: In this work, we introduce an output-reweighting unlearning method, RWFT, a
lightweight technique that erases an entire class from a trained classifier
without full retraining. Forgetting specific classes from trained models is
essential for enforcing user deletion rights and mitigating harmful or biased
predictions. The full retraining is costly and existing unlearning methods fail
to replicate the behavior of the retrained models when predicting samples from
the unlearned class. We prove this failure by designing a variant of membership
inference attacks, MIA-NN that successfully reveals the unlearned class for any
of these methods. We propose a simple redistribution of the probability mass
for the prediction on the samples in the forgotten class which is robust to
MIA-NN. We also introduce a new metric based on the total variation (TV)
distance of the prediction probabilities to quantify residual leakage to
prevent future methods from susceptibility to the new attack. Through extensive
experiments with state of the art baselines in machine unlearning, we show that
our approach matches the results of full retraining in both metrics used for
evaluation by prior work and the new metric we propose in this work. Compare to
state-of-the-art methods, we gain 2.79% in previously used metrics and 111.45%
in our new TV-based metric over the best existing method.

*Erfan Hajihashemi,Yanning Shen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This work presents a new multi-model conformal prediction algorithm that refines model selection through feedback from a bipartite graph to reduce prediction set size and computational cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation arises from challenges in multi-model online conformal prediction, such as increased computational complexity from large candidate model sets and poor performance when irrelevant models are included.

Method: The method involves a bipartite graph-based approach to dynamically refine a subset of effective models using feedback, enabling an efficient model selection process for prediction set construction.

Result: The proposed method achieves valid coverage, sublinear regret, and constructs smaller prediction sets. Experiments show performance superiority over existing approaches.

Conclusion: By leveraging feedback-driven methods, the study ensures robust coverage, enhanced computational efficiency, and better prediction set performance in dynamic environments.

Abstract: Online conformal prediction has demonstrated its capability to construct a
prediction set for each incoming data point that covers the true label with a
predetermined probability. To cope with potential distribution shift,
multi-model online conformal prediction has been introduced to select and
leverage different models from a preselected candidate set. Along with the
improved flexibility, the choice of the preselected set also brings challenges.
A candidate set that includes a large number of models may increase the
computational complexity. In addition, the inclusion of irrelevant models with
poor performance may negatively impact the performance and lead to
unnecessarily large prediction sets. To address these challenges, we propose a
novel multi-model online conformal prediction algorithm that identifies a
subset of effective models at each time step by collecting feedback from a
bipartite graph, which is refined upon receiving new data. A model is then
selected from this subset to construct the prediction set, resulting in reduced
computational complexity and smaller prediction sets. Additionally, we
demonstrate that using prediction set size as feedback, alongside model loss,
can significantly improve efficiency by constructing smaller prediction sets
while still satisfying the required coverage guarantee. The proposed algorithms
are proven to ensure valid coverage and achieve sublinear regret. Experiments
on real and synthetic datasets validate that the proposed methods construct
smaller prediction sets and outperform existing multi-model online conformal
prediction approaches.

TL;DR: The paper introduces DL-LIME, a novel explainable AI (XAI) technique, which integrates deep learning into LIME's sampling process for better insights and performance in radar resource management.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the "black box" nature of neural networks in decision-making tasks like radar resource management and to improve explainable AI (XAI) techniques, specifically the limitations of LIME.

Method: Proposing and implementing DL-LIME, a modified version of LIME that incorporates deep learning into its sampling process, and applying it within deep reinforcement learning for radar resource management.

Result: Numerical results show that DL-LIME achieves superior fidelity and task performance compared to conventional LIME. It also provides better insights into the important factors influencing radar resource management decisions.

Conclusion: DL-LIME enhances LIME's capabilities by integrating deep learning, improving explainability and performance in decision-making processes like radar resource management.

Abstract: Deep reinforcement learning has been extensively studied in decision-making
processes and has demonstrated superior performance over conventional
approaches in various fields, including radar resource management (RRM).
However, a notable limitation of neural networks is their ``black box" nature
and recent research work has increasingly focused on explainable AI (XAI)
techniques to describe the rationale behind neural network decisions. One
promising XAI method is local interpretable model-agnostic explanations (LIME).
However, the sampling process in LIME ignores the correlations between
features. In this paper, we propose a modified LIME approach that integrates
deep learning (DL) into the sampling process, which we refer to as DL-LIME. We
employ DL-LIME within deep reinforcement learning for radar resource
management. Numerical results show that DL-LIME outperforms conventional LIME
in terms of both fidelity and task performance, demonstrating superior
performance with both metrics. DL-LIME also provides insights on which factors
are more important in decision making for radar resource management.

### [207] [LLM-guided Chemical Process Optimization with a Multi-Agent Approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20921)
*Tong Zeng,Srivathsan Badrinarayanan,Janghoon Ock,Cheng-Kai Lai,Amir Barati Farimani*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a multi-agent LLM framework that infers chemical process constraints and optimizes operations efficiently, outperforming traditional methods in speed and computational effort.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Optimization in chemical processes is often hindered by poorly defined operating constraints, necessitating novel methods to autonomously estimate and apply these constraints for improved efficiency.

Method: A multi-agent framework using OpenAI's o3 model is designed. It includes agents for constraint generation, validation, simulation, and optimization, relying on embedded domain knowledge to autonomously define constraints and iteratively optimize the process.

Result: The framework validated on a hydrodealkylation process outperformed conventional methods by converging 31 times faster than grid search, achieving results within 20 minutes and showcasing domain-informed heuristics in optimization.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively addresses constraint-definition challenges in chemical optimization, offering significant efficiency improvements and broad applicability to emerging processes and retrofits where constraints are ill-defined.

Abstract: Chemical process optimization is crucial to maximize production efficiency
and economic performance. Traditional methods, including gradient-based
solvers, evolutionary algorithms, and parameter grid searches, become
impractical when operating constraints are ill-defined or unavailable,
requiring engineers to rely on subjective heuristics to estimate feasible
parameter ranges. To address this constraint definition bottleneck, we present
a multi-agent framework of large language model (LLM) agents that autonomously
infer operating constraints from minimal process descriptions, then
collaboratively guide optimization using the inferred constraints. Our
AutoGen-based agentic framework employs OpenAI's o3 model, with specialized
agents for constraint generation, parameter validation, simulation execution,
and optimization guidance. Through two phases - autonomous constraint
generation using embedded domain knowledge, followed by iterative multi-agent
optimization - the framework eliminates the need for predefined operational
bounds. Validated on the hydrodealkylation process across cost, yield, and
yield-to-cost ratio metrics, the framework demonstrated competitive performance
with conventional optimization methods while achieving better computational
efficiency, requiring fewer iterations to converge. Our approach converged in
under 20 minutes, achieving a 31-fold speedup over grid search. Beyond
computational efficiency, the framework's reasoning-guided search demonstrates
sophisticated process understanding, correctly identifying utility trade-offs,
and applying domain-informed heuristics. This approach shows significant
potential for optimization scenarios where operational constraints are poorly
characterized or unavailable, particularly for emerging processes and retrofit
applications.

### [208] [Interpretable Representation Learning for Additive Rule Ensembles](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20927)
*Shahrzad Behzadimanesh,Pierre Le Bodic,Geoffrey I. Webb,Mario Boley*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces symbolic rule ensembles with sparse linear transformations, achieving simpler models while maintaining accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study addresses limitations of traditional rule ensembles that require curated input features for effective modeling and interpretable predictions.

Method: A sequential greedy optimization approach is proposed to learn sparse rule ensembles using an iteratively reweighted logistic regression framework.

Result: The introduced method matches state-of-the-art performance in test risk while achieving significantly reduced model complexity, demonstrated on ten benchmark datasets.

Conclusion: The approach successfully extends the interpretability and applicability of rule ensembles by enabling general polytope decision regions with sparsity constraints.

Abstract: Small additive ensembles of symbolic rules offer interpretable prediction
models. Traditionally, these ensembles use rule conditions based on
conjunctions of simple threshold propositions $x \geq t$ on a single input
variable $x$ and threshold $t$, resulting geometrically in axis-parallel
polytopes as decision regions. While this form ensures a high degree of
interpretability for individual rules and can be learned efficiently using the
gradient boosting approach, it relies on having access to a curated set of
expressive and ideally independent input features so that a small ensemble of
axis-parallel regions can describe the target variable well. Absent such
features, reaching sufficient accuracy requires increasing the number and
complexity of individual rules, which diminishes the interpretability of the
model. Here, we extend classical rule ensembles by introducing logical
propositions with learnable sparse linear transformations of input variables,
i.e., propositions of the form $\mathbf{x}^\mathrm{T}\mathbf{w} \geq t$, where
$\mathbf{w}$ is a learnable sparse weight vector, enabling decision regions as
general polytopes with oblique faces. We propose a learning method using
sequential greedy optimization based on an iteratively reweighted formulation
of logistic regression. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed
method efficiently constructs rule ensembles with the same test risk as
state-of-the-art methods while significantly reducing model complexity across
ten benchmark datasets.

*Keivan Rezaei,Mehrdad Saberi,Abhilasha Ravichander,Soheil Feizi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces MSA, an algorithm to efficiently unlearn specific datapoints from large language models using model checkpoints, outperforming existing algorithms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large language models are often trained on datasets containing sensitive, copyrighted, or low-quality data. Since full retraining to remove such data is computationally expensive, an efficient unlearning solution is needed.

Method: The authors developed MSA, an algorithm that leverages model checkpoints to estimate and undo the influence of specific datapoints efficiently.

Result: Experimental results indicate that MSA surpasses existing machine unlearning algorithms in various benchmarks, improving the ability of models to erase data effectively.

Conclusion: MSA offers a promising, computationally efficient approach for machine unlearning, enhancing the flexibility and ethical compliance of large language models.

Abstract: Large language models are trained on massive corpora of web data, which may
include private data, copyrighted material, factually inaccurate data, or data
that degrades model performance. Eliminating the influence of such problematic
datapoints through complete retraining -- by repeatedly pretraining the model
on datasets that exclude these specific instances -- is computationally
prohibitive. For this reason, unlearning algorithms have emerged that aim to
eliminate the influence of particular datapoints, while otherwise preserving
the model -- at a low computational cost. However, precisely estimating and
undoing the influence of individual datapoints has proved to be challenging. In
this work, we propose a new algorithm, MSA, for estimating and undoing the
influence of datapoints -- by leveraging model checkpoints i.e. artifacts
capturing model states at different stages of pretraining. Our experimental
results demonstrate that MSA consistently outperforms existing machine
unlearning algorithms across multiple benchmarks, models, and evaluation
metrics, suggesting that MSA could be an effective approach towards more
flexible large language models that are capable of data erasure.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Antibody design for complex antigens remains a challenge, especially in handling geometric features, symmetry, and generalization of novel antigen interfaces.

Method: AbMEGD integrates multi-scale equivariant graph diffusion utilizing geometric deep learning. It combines atomic details with global interactions and employs E(3)-equivariant methods for precision and efficiency.

Result: AbMEGD achieved a 10.13% increase in amino acid recovery, a 3.32% improvement percentage, and a 0.062 Å reduction in CDR-H3 deviation compared to DiffAb.

Conclusion: AbMEGD sets a new standard for antibody sequence-structure co-design by balancing structural integrity with enhanced functionality, demonstrating superior performance.

Abstract: Antibody design remains a critical challenge in therapeutic and diagnostic
development, particularly for complex antigens with diverse binding interfaces.
Current computational methods face two main limitations: (1) capturing
geometric features while preserving symmetries, and (2) generalizing novel
antigen interfaces. Despite recent advancements, these methods often fail to
accurately capture molecular interactions and maintain structural integrity. To
address these challenges, we propose \textbf{AbMEGD}, an end-to-end framework
integrating \textbf{M}ulti-scale \textbf{E}quivariant \textbf{G}raph
\textbf{D}iffusion for antibody sequence and structure co-design. Leveraging
advanced geometric deep learning, AbMEGD combines atomic-level geometric
features with residue-level embeddings, capturing local atomic details and
global sequence-structure interactions. Its E(3)-equivariant diffusion method
ensures geometric precision, computational efficiency, and robust
generalizability for complex antigens. Furthermore, experiments using the
SAbDab database demonstrate a 10.13\% increase in amino acid recovery, 3.32\%
rise in improvement percentage, and a 0.062~\AA\ reduction in root mean square
deviation within the critical CDR-H3 region compared to DiffAb, a leading
antibody design model. These results highlight AbMEGD's ability to balance
structural integrity with improved functionality, establishing a new benchmark
for sequence-structure co-design and affinity optimization. The code is

*Yifan Yang,Zhen Zhang,Rupak Vignesh Swaminathan,Jing Liu,Nathan Susanj,Zheng Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces SharpZO, a new optimization approach to fine-tune vision-language models (VLMs) without backpropagation, achieving better performance and convergence than prior methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fine-tuning VLMs is memory-intensive and unsuitable for edge devices. Existing BP-free methods struggle with efficiency and performance, creating a need for a better optimization approach.

Method: SharpZO fine-tunes VLMs using a two-stage BP-free optimization: (1) a sharpness-aware evolutionary strategy (ES) phase for a strong initialization, and (2) sparse zeroth-order optimization for fine-tuning, relying only on forward passes.

Result: SharpZO shows significant improvement, with up to 7% average accuracy gain and faster convergence compared to state-of-the-art forward-only methods, as demonstrated through experiments on CLIP models.

Conclusion: SharpZO effectively enhances BP-free fine-tuning of VLMs, making it advantageous for memory-constrained and inference-only environments.

Abstract: Fine-tuning vision language models (VLMs) has achieved remarkable performance
across various downstream tasks; yet, it requires access to model gradients
through backpropagation (BP), making them unsuitable for memory-constrained,
inference-only edge devices. To address this limitation, previous work has
explored various BP-free fine-tuning methods. However, these approaches often
rely on high-variance evolutionary strategies (ES) or zeroth-order (ZO)
optimization, and often fail to achieve satisfactory performance. In this
paper, we propose a hybrid Sharpness-aware Zeroth-order optimization (SharpZO)
approach, specifically designed to enhance the performance of ZO VLM
fine-tuning via a sharpness-aware warm-up training. SharpZO features a
two-stage optimization process: a sharpness-aware ES stage that globally
explores and smooths the loss landscape to construct a strong initialization,
followed by a fine-grained local search via sparse ZO optimization. The entire
optimization relies solely on forward passes. Detailed theoretical analysis and
extensive experiments on CLIP models demonstrate that SharpZO significantly
improves accuracy and convergence speed, achieving up to 7% average gain over
state-of-the-art forward-only methods.

*Steven Walton,Valeriy Klyukin,Maksim Artemev,Denis Derkach,Nikita Orlov,Humphrey Shi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces knowledge distillation methods to improve the performance of smaller normalizing flows, a type of explicit density model used in generative modeling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address the inherent challenges of training explicit density models like normalizing flows, which often suffer from low sampling quality despite their advantages in density estimation and latent-variable inference.

Method: The paper proposes novel knowledge distillation techniques that leverage the unique properties of normalizing flows, including transferring knowledge within intermediate layers, to improve sampling quality and efficiency in smaller models.

Result: Through these distillation techniques, smaller models achieve significant performance improvements in density estimation and sampling quality while maintaining efficiency.

Conclusion: The proposed methods enhance the tradeoff between model size and performance in normalizing flows, making them more practical and efficient for real-world applications.

Abstract: Explicit density learners are becoming an increasingly popular technique for
generative models because of their ability to better model probability
distributions. They have advantages over Generative Adversarial Networks due to
their ability to perform density estimation and having exact latent-variable
inference. This has many advantages, including: being able to simply
interpolate, calculate sample likelihood, and analyze the probability
distribution. The downside of these models is that they are often more
difficult to train and have lower sampling quality.
  Normalizing flows are explicit density models, that use composable bijective
functions to turn an intractable probability function into a tractable one. In
this work, we present novel knowledge distillation techniques to increase
sampling quality and density estimation of smaller student normalizing flows.
We seek to study the capacity of knowledge distillation in Compositional
Normalizing Flows to understand the benefits and weaknesses provided by these
architectures. Normalizing flows have unique properties that allow for a
non-traditional forms of knowledge transfer, where we can transfer that
knowledge within intermediate layers. We find that through this distillation,
we can make students significantly smaller while making substantial performance
gains over a non-distilled student. With smaller models there is a
proportionally increased throughput as this is dependent upon the number of
bijectors, and thus parameters, in the network.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel generative policy (SSCP) for reinforcement learning that avoids high sampling costs and training instability, while achieving state-of-the-art performance across various RL settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Generative RL models like diffusion and flow-matching suffer from high computational costs and instability due to their iterative nature. The authors aim to address these inefficiencies while maintaining expressiveness.

Method: They propose the Single-Step Completion Policy (SSCP), a generative model trained with an augmented flow-matching objective to predict single-step actions directly, eliminating the need for iterative sampling.

Result: SSCP demonstrates substantial improvements in speed, adaptability, and performance compared to diffusion-based models, and achieves strong results in offline, offline-to-online, online, and goal-conditioned RL benchmarks.

Conclusion: SSCP offers a balance between expressiveness and efficiency for generative policies in reinforcement learning, making it adaptable and scalable across various RL settings.

Abstract: Generative models such as diffusion and flow-matching offer expressive
policies for offline reinforcement learning (RL) by capturing rich, multimodal
action distributions, but their iterative sampling introduces high inference
costs and training instability due to gradient propagation across sampling
steps. We propose the \textit{Single-Step Completion Policy} (SSCP), a
generative policy trained with an augmented flow-matching objective to predict
direct completion vectors from intermediate flow samples, enabling accurate,
one-shot action generation. In an off-policy actor-critic framework, SSCP
combines the expressiveness of generative models with the training and
inference efficiency of unimodal policies, without requiring long
backpropagation chains. Our method scales effectively to offline,
offline-to-online, and online RL settings, offering substantial gains in speed
and adaptability over diffusion-based baselines. We further extend SSCP to
goal-conditioned RL, enabling flat policies to exploit subgoal structures
without explicit hierarchical inference. SSCP achieves strong results across
standard offline RL and behavior cloning benchmarks, positioning it as a
versatile, expressive, and efficient framework for deep RL and sequential
decision-making.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: TRIDENT is a framework that enhances molecular property predictions by integrating multiple data modalities: SMILES, textual descriptions, and taxonomic annotations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multimodal learning for molecular representation has overlooked important textual and taxonomic information, limiting predictive performance.

Method: TRIDENT uses a newly curated dataset and employs a volume-based alignment mechanism for global tri-modal feature integration, alongside a novel local alignment objective that links molecular substructures with sub-textual descriptions.

Result: TRIDENT achieves state-of-the-art results in molecular property prediction across 11 downstream tasks.

Conclusion: Incorporating textual and taxonomic information using advanced alignment strategies can significantly improve molecular representation learning and prediction performance.

Abstract: Molecular property prediction aims to learn representations that map chemical
structures to functional properties. While multimodal learning has emerged as a
powerful paradigm to learn molecular representations, prior works have largely
overlooked textual and taxonomic information of molecules for representation
learning. We introduce TRIDENT, a novel framework that integrates molecular
SMILES, textual descriptions, and taxonomic functional annotations to learn
rich molecular representations. To achieve this, we curate a comprehensive
dataset of molecule-text pairs with structured, multi-level functional
annotations. Instead of relying on conventional contrastive loss, TRIDENT
employs a volume-based alignment objective to jointly align tri-modal features
at the global level, enabling soft, geometry-aware alignment across modalities.
Additionally, TRIDENT introduces a novel local alignment objective that
captures detailed relationships between molecular substructures and their
corresponding sub-textual descriptions. A momentum-based mechanism dynamically
balances global and local alignment, enabling the model to learn both broad
functional semantics and fine-grained structure-function mappings. TRIDENT
achieves state-of-the-art performance on 11 downstream tasks, demonstrating the
value of combining SMILES, textual, and taxonomic functional annotations for
molecular property prediction.

*Haodong Lu,Chongyang Zhao,Jason Xue,Lina Yao,Kristen Moore,Dong Gong*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces MoRA, a novel adaptive learning method to address challenges like interference, redundancy, and ambiguous routing in continual learning with pre-trained models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to tackle catastrophic forgetting and task interference in continual learning using pre-trained models, which current MoE approaches struggle to effectively address.

Method: The paper proposes MoRA, which decomposes rank-r updates into rank-1 components and uses sparse, self-activated ranks. A routing mechanism determines relevance, and rank pruning/activation budgets optimize expert selection.

Result: MoRA demonstrates significant performance improvements in continual learning tasks using CLIP and large language models, reducing forgetting and enhancing generalization.

Conclusion: MoRA effectively enhances continual learning with large pre-trained models by addressing forgetting, interference, and redundancy, thus advancing task performance and generalization.

Abstract: Continual learning (CL) with large pre-trained models is challenged by
catastrophic forgetting and task interference. Existing LoRA-based
Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) approaches mitigate forgetting by assigning and
freezing task-specific adapters, but suffer from interference, redundancy, and
ambiguous routing due to coarse adapter-level selection. However, this design
introduces three key challenges: 1) Interference: Activating full LoRA experts
per input leads to subspace interference and prevents selective reuse of useful
components across tasks. 2) Redundancy: Newly added experts often duplicate or
contradict existing knowledge due to unnecessary activation of unrelated ranks
and insufficient reuse of relevant ones. 3) Ambiguity: Overlapping features
across tasks confuse the router, resulting in unstable expert assignments. As
more experts accumulate, earlier task routing degrades, accelerating
forgetting. We propose MoRA, a Mixture-of-Rank Adaptive learning approach with
self-activated and sparse rank activation for CL. Unlike mixing multiple
low-rank matrices, MoRA decomposes each rank-r update into r rank-1 components,
each treated as an independent expert, enabling fine-grained mixture of rank-1
expert utilization while mitigating interference and redundancy. To avoid
ambiguous routing, we propose that each rank-1 expert can infer its own
relevance via intermediate activations. Coupled with our proposed rank pruning
and activation budgets, MoRA adaptively selects a sparse mixture of ranks per
input. We validate MoRA on continual learning tasks with CLIP and large
language models (LLMs), analyzing both in-domain learning and out-of-domain
forgetting/generalization during fine-tuning. MoRA shows significant
effectiveness on enhancing CL with PTMs, and improving generalization while
mitigating forgetting.

*Suorong Yang,Peijia Li,Furao Shen,Jian Zhao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes an RL-based method to improve training efficiency by reducing dataset redundancies without performance compromise.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large datasets come with high computational and storage costs, and real-world datasets often have redundancies. There is a need for data-efficient training approaches.

Method: A new concept, epsilon-sample cover, captures dataset redundancy. The method uses a lightweight RL agent (RL-Selector) to optimize data selection during training with epsilon-sample cover as a reward.

Result: Experiments show the method outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, enhancing generalization and training efficiency.

Conclusion: RL-Selector enables effective data selection, reducing redundancy and improving model performance while cutting costs and enhancing efficiency.

Abstract: Modern deep architectures often rely on large-scale datasets, but training on
these datasets incurs high computational and storage overhead. Real-world
datasets often contain substantial redundancies, prompting the need for more
data-efficient training paradigms. Data selection has shown promise to mitigate
redundancy by identifying the most representative samples, thereby reducing
training costs without compromising performance. Existing methods typically
rely on static scoring metrics or pretrained models, overlooking the combined
effect of selected samples and their evolving dynamics during training. We
introduce the concept of epsilon-sample cover, which quantifies sample
redundancy based on inter-sample relationships, capturing the intrinsic
structure of the dataset. Based on this, we reformulate data selection as a
reinforcement learning (RL) process and propose RL-Selector, where a
lightweight RL agent optimizes the selection policy by leveraging
epsilon-sample cover derived from evolving dataset distribution as a reward
signal. Extensive experiments across benchmark datasets and diverse
architectures demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms existing
state-of-the-art baselines. Models trained with our selected datasets show
enhanced generalization performance with improved training efficiency.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Strict Subgoal Execution (SSE), an enhanced graph-based hierarchical RL framework, addressing challenges in long-horizon, goal-conditioned tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Solve fundamental RL challenges with sparse rewards and distant goals in long-horizon tasks.

Method: SSE framework combines single-step subgoal reachability, a decoupled exploration policy, and failure-aware path refinement.

Result: Experiments show SSE achieves higher success rates and efficiency compared to existing RL methods across diverse benchmarks.

Conclusion: SSE improves planning reliability and exploration, offering a superior approach to long-horizon goal-conditioned tasks.

Abstract: Long-horizon goal-conditioned tasks pose fundamental challenges for
reinforcement learning (RL), particularly when goals are distant and rewards
are sparse. While hierarchical and graph-based methods offer partial solutions,
they often suffer from subgoal infeasibility and inefficient planning. We
introduce Strict Subgoal Execution (SSE), a graph-based hierarchical RL
framework that enforces single-step subgoal reachability by structurally
constraining high-level decision-making. To enhance exploration, SSE employs a
decoupled exploration policy that systematically traverses underexplored
regions of the goal space. Furthermore, a failure-aware path refinement, which
refines graph-based planning by dynamically adjusting edge costs according to
observed low-level success rates, thereby improving subgoal reliability.
Experimental results across diverse long-horizon benchmarks demonstrate that
SSE consistently outperforms existing goal-conditioned RL and hierarchical RL
approaches in both efficiency and success rate.

### [218] [Efficient Skill Discovery via Regret-Aware Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21044)
*He Zhang,Ming Zhou,Shaopeng Zhai,Ying Sun,Hui Xiong*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes a new method for unsupervised skill discovery in reinforcement learning, emphasizing efficiency and diversity improvements, particularly in high-dimensional environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing unsupervised skill discovery methods perform well in fostering diversity but are inefficient, especially in high-dimensional scenarios. A more efficient framework is needed.

Method: The authors frame skill discovery as a min-max game between skill generation and policy learning. They introduce a regret-aware approach that uses temporal representation learning and measures policy convergence to guide skill exploration.

Result: The proposed method outperforms baseline approaches in both skill diversity and efficiency, achieving a 15% zero-shot improvement in high-dimensional environments.

Conclusion: Skill discovery can be improved by designing it adversarially to policy learning. Leveraging a regret-aware mechanism enhances both skill diversity and efficiency.

Abstract: Unsupervised skill discovery aims to learn diverse and distinguishable
behaviors in open-ended reinforcement learning. For existing methods, they
focus on improving diversity through pure exploration, mutual information
optimization, and learning temporal representation. Despite that they perform
well on exploration, they remain limited in terms of efficiency, especially for
the high-dimensional situations. In this work, we frame skill discovery as a
min-max game of skill generation and policy learning, proposing a regret-aware
method on top of temporal representation learning that expands the discovered
skill space along the direction of upgradable policy strength. The key insight
behind the proposed method is that the skill discovery is adversarial to the
policy learning, i.e., skills with weak strength should be further explored
while less exploration for the skills with converged strength. As an
implementation, we score the degree of strength convergence with regret, and
guide the skill discovery with a learnable skill generator. To avoid
degeneration, skill generation comes from an up-gradable population of skill
generators. We conduct experiments on environments with varying complexities
and dimension sizes. Empirical results show that our method outperforms
baselines in both efficiency and diversity. Moreover, our method achieves a 15%
zero shot improvement in high-dimensional environments, compared to existing
methods.

### [219] [FedDAA: Dynamic Client Clustering for Concept Drift Adaptation in Federated Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21054)
*Fu Peng,Ming Tang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces FedDAA, a federated learning framework tackling multi-source concept drift by dynamically clustering and adapting data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current FL methods fail to handle multiple data drift types (real, virtual, and label drift) effectively, leading to poor generalization and catastrophic forgetting.

Method: The proposed framework, FedDAA, incorporates modules for determining optimal cluster numbers, detecting real drift, and adapting to new data while preserving historical knowledge.

Result: FedDAA improves accuracy by 7.84% to 8.52% compared to state-of-the-art FL methods on benchmarks like Fashion-MNIST, CIFAR-10, and CIFAR-100.

Conclusion: FedDAA offers a significant advancement by distinguishing and adapting to various concept drift sources, ensuring effective learning and retention in federated systems.

Abstract: In federated learning (FL), the data distribution of each client may change
over time, introducing both temporal and spatial data heterogeneity, known as
concept drift. Data heterogeneity arises from three drift sources: real drift
(a shift in the conditional distribution P(y|x)), virtual drift (a shift in the
input distribution P(x)), and label drift (a shift in the label distribution
P(y)). However, most existing FL methods addressing concept drift primarily
focus on real drift. When clients experience virtual or label drift, these
methods often fail to selectively retain useful historical knowledge, leading
to catastrophic forgetting. A key challenge lies in distinguishing different
sources of drift, as they require distinct adaptation strategies: real drift
calls for discarding outdated data, while virtual or label drift benefits from
retaining historical data. Without explicitly identifying the drift sources, a
general adaptation strategy is suboptimal and may harm generalization. To
address this challenge, we propose FedDAA, a dynamic clustered FL framework
designed to adapt to multi-source concept drift while preserving valuable
historical knowledge. Specifically, FedDAA integrates three modules: a cluster
number determination module to find the optimal number of clusters; a real
drift detection module to distinguish real drift from virtual/label drift; and
a concept drift adaptation module to adapt to new data while retaining useful
historical information. We provide theoretical convergence guarantees, and
experiments show that FedDAA achieves 7.84% to 8.52% accuracy improvements over
state-of-the-art methods on Fashion-MNIST, CIFAR-10, and CIFAR-100.

*Jingwei Wang,Zai Zhang,Hao Qian,Chunjing Gan,Binbin Hu,Ziqi Liu,Zhiqiang Zhang,Jun Zhou,Bin Shi,Bo Dong*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes using knowledge graphs to improve Large Language Models' (LLMs) tool utilization by generating high-quality instruction data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enhancing LLMs' problem-solving and tool usage abilities, given the existing challenge of inadequate data quality generated by previous methods.

Method: Utilizing knowledge graphs to extract query pathways, translating relationships into actionable tools, and generating high-quality instructional data through detailed solution step parsing.

Result: Experiments demonstrated that fine-tuning LLMs on a small sample of synthetic data significantly enhanced their tool-use capabilities.

Conclusion: Knowledge graphs provide an effective way to generate superior instruction data, leading to improved tool utilization and overall LLM functionality.

Abstract: Teaching large language models (LLMs) to use tools is crucial for improving
their problem-solving abilities and expanding their applications. However,
effectively using tools is challenging because it requires a deep understanding
of tool functionalities and user intentions. Previous methods relied mainly on
LLMs to generate instruction data, but the quality of these data was often
insufficient. In this paper, we propose a new method that uses knowledge graphs
to generate high-quality instruction data for LLMs. Knowledge graphs are
manually curated datasets rich in semantic information. We begin by extracting
various query pathways from a given knowledge graph, which are transformed into
a broad spectrum of user queries. We then translate the relationships between
entities into actionable tools and parse the pathways of each query into
detailed solution steps, thereby creating high-quality instruction data. Our
experiments show that fine-tuning on just a small sample of this synthetic data
can significantly improve the tool utilization and overall capabilities of
LLMs.

*Xenia Heilmann,Luca Corbucci,Mattia Cerrato,Anna Monreale*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces tools and datasets for fair federated learning (FL) aimed at addressing fairness challenges stemming from heterogeneous client biases.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fairness in federated learning is compromised when local client datasets introduce biases, particularly due to varied data distributions.

Method: The authors developed a library (FeDa4Fair), curated datasets with diverse biases, and provided evaluation metrics tailored to assess fairness outcomes in FL.

Result: Four bias-heterogeneous datasets and benchmarks were created to systematically evaluate and compare fairness-aware FL methods.

Conclusion: The paper provides essential tools and datasets to advance fairness research in FL, addressing both global and client-level fairness challenges.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables collaborative model training across multiple
clients without sharing clients' private data. However, fairness remains a key
concern, as biases in local clients' datasets can impact the entire federated
system. Heterogeneous data distributions across clients may lead to models that
are fairer for some clients than others. Although several fairness-enhancing
solutions are present in the literature, most focus on mitigating bias for a
single sensitive attribute, typically binary, overlooking the diverse and
sometimes conflicting fairness needs of different clients. This limited
perspective can limit the effectiveness of fairness interventions for the
different clients. To support more robust and reproducible fairness research in
FL, we aim to enable a consistent benchmarking of fairness-aware FL methods at
both the global and client levels. In this paper, we contribute in three ways:
(1) We introduce FeDa4Fair, a library to generate tabular datasets tailored to
evaluating fair FL methods under heterogeneous client bias; (2) we release four
bias-heterogeneous datasets and corresponding benchmarks to compare fairness
mitigation methods in a controlled environment; (3) we provide ready-to-use
functions for evaluating fairness outcomes for these datasets.

*David Debot,Pietro Barbiero,Gabriele Dominici,Giuseppe Marra*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: H-CMR addresses the limitations of Concept-Based Models by offering interpretability for both concepts and tasks through hierarchical reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current Concept-Based Models lack interpretability in concept predictions, restricting their usefulness in providing human-understandable insights.

Method: H-CMR employs a directed acyclic graph to model concept relationships and uses neural attention mechanisms to hierarchically apply logic rules for predictions.

Result: Experimental results show H-CMR achieves state-of-the-art performance and allows human interventions to improve accuracy and data efficiency.

Conclusion: H-CMR enhances CBMs by offering dual interpretability, enabling better human-machine collaboration and advancing training efficiency through background knowledge.

Abstract: Concept-Based Models (CBMs) are a class of deep learning models that provide
interpretability by explaining predictions through high-level concepts. These
models first predict concepts and then use them to perform a downstream task.
However, current CBMs offer interpretability only for the final task
prediction, while the concept predictions themselves are typically made via
black-box neural networks. To address this limitation, we propose Hierarchical
Concept Memory Reasoner (H-CMR), a new CBM that provides interpretability for
both concept and task predictions. H-CMR models relationships between concepts
using a learned directed acyclic graph, where edges represent logic rules that
define concepts in terms of other concepts. During inference, H-CMR employs a
neural attention mechanism to select a subset of these rules, which are then
applied hierarchically to predict all concepts and the final task. Experimental
results demonstrate that H-CMR matches state-of-the-art performance while
enabling strong human interaction through concept and model interventions. The
former can significantly improve accuracy at inference time, while the latter
can enhance data efficiency during training when background knowledge is
available.

### [223] [Learning to Skip the Middle Layers of Transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21103)
*Tim Lawson,Laurence Aitchison*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces a new Transformer architecture with dynamic layer skipping in middle layers, but does not improve the trade-off between performance and computational efficiency at tested scales.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current Transformer models are computationally heavy, and existing conditional computation methods lack global coordination when skipping redundant layers.

Method: The proposed architecture uses a learned gating mechanism to skip symmetric middle blocks dynamically and implements gated attention to manage token interactions. Regularization methods control residual norms and gate sparsity.

Result: The method did not surpass dense Transformer baselines in improving validation cross-entropy versus computational cost (FLOPs) trade-offs at the evaluated scales.

Conclusion: While theoretically sound, the approach did not yield measurable efficiency gains compared to simpler dense baselines. Code is made publicly available.

Abstract: Conditional computation is a popular strategy to make Transformers more
efficient. Existing methods often target individual modules (e.g.,
mixture-of-experts layers) or skip layers independently of one another.
However, interpretability research has demonstrated that the middle layers of
Transformers exhibit greater redundancy, and that early layers aggregate
information into token positions. Guided by these insights, we propose a novel
architecture that dynamically skips a variable number of layers from the middle
outward. In particular, a learned gating mechanism determines whether to bypass
a symmetric span of central blocks based on the input, and a gated attention
mechanism prevents subsequent tokens from attending to skipped token positions.
Residual norms are controlled with a 'sandwich' or 'perilayernorm' scheme and
gate sparsity with an adaptive regularization loss. We had aimed to reduce
compute requirements for 'simpler' tokens and potentially foster an emergent
multi-level representational hierarchy but, at the scales investigated, our
approach does not achieve improvements in the trade-off between validation
cross-entropy and estimated FLOPs compared to dense baselines with fewer
layers. We release our code at https://github.com/tim-lawson/skip-middle.

### [224] [Unlasting: Unpaired Single-Cell Multi-Perturbation Estimation by Dual Conditional Diffusion Implicit Bridges](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21107)
*Changxi Chi,Jun Xia,Yufei Huang,Jingbo Zhou,Siyuan Li,Yunfan Liu,Chang Yu,Stan Z. Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces a new methodology utilizing Dual Diffusion Implicit Bridges (DDIB) to model unpaired single-cell perturbation data while integrating biological information to better predict responses under perturbations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods struggle to analyze single-cell responses to perturbations due to unpaired data challenges, as existing approaches either pair data forcefully or ignore inter-cell relationships.

Method: The proposed framework leverages DDIB for distribution mapping, integrates gene regulatory network information to propagate perturbation signals, utilizes a masking mechanism for silent gene prediction, and introduces a new evaluation metric for modeling biological heterogeneity.

Result: The model effectively captures single-cell responses under perturbation and generates high-quality profiles, addressing bimodal distribution patterns and improving prediction accuracy.

Conclusion: The paper demonstrates the advantages of combining GRN-guided approaches with diffusion models, offering a biologically informed tool for evaluating unpaired single-cell data and enhancing drug screening workflows.

Abstract: Estimating single-cell responses across various perturbations facilitates the
identification of key genes and enhances drug screening, significantly boosting
experimental efficiency. However, single-cell sequencing is a destructive
process, making it impossible to capture the same cell's phenotype before and
after perturbation. Consequently, data collected under perturbed and
unperturbed conditions are inherently unpaired. Existing methods either attempt
to forcibly pair unpaired data using random sampling, or neglect the inherent
relationship between unperturbed and perturbed cells during the modeling. In
this work, we propose a framework based on Dual Diffusion Implicit Bridges
(DDIB) to learn the mapping between different data distributions, effectively
addressing the challenge of unpaired data. We further interpret this framework
as a form of data augmentation. We integrate gene regulatory network (GRN)
information to propagate perturbation signals in a biologically meaningful way,
and further incorporate a masking mechanism to predict silent genes, improving
the quality of generated profiles. Moreover, gene expression under the same
perturbation often varies significantly across cells, frequently exhibiting a
bimodal distribution that reflects intrinsic heterogeneity. To capture this, we
introduce a more suitable evaluation metric. We propose Unlasting, dual
conditional diffusion models that overcome the problem of unpaired single-cell
perturbation data and strengthen the model's insight into perturbations under
the guidance of the GRN, with a dedicated mask model designed to improve
generation quality by predicting silent genes. In addition, we introduce a
biologically grounded evaluation metric that better reflects the inherent
heterogeneity in single-cell responses.

*Deepak Kumar Panda,Weisi Guo*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper presents an antifragile reinforcement learning (RL) framework leveraging a switching mechanism with Discounted Thompson Sampling to counteract adversarial attacks on UAV navigation systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the limitations of existing robust RL methods in adapting to out-of-distribution shifts caused by adversarial attacks, given their focus on fixed perturbation handling.

Method: The method involves developing an ensemble of robust RL policies adapted to varying perturbations. These policies are framed as a multiarmed bandit problem using Discounted Thompson Sampling to switch dynamically among them in response to adversarial state-action-value shifts.

Result: The proposed antifragile RL framework outperformed existing robust RL methods in simulated UAV navigation tasks, demonstrating shorter paths and fewer conflicts under stronger attacks.

Conclusion: Antifragile RL, through its adaptability to broader distributional shifts and unseen adversarial strategies, achieves superior navigation performance compared to conventional robust RL systems.

Abstract: The increasing automation of navigation for unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs)
has exposed them to adversarial attacks that exploit vulnerabilities in
reinforcement learning (RL) through sensor manipulation. Although existing
robust RL methods aim to mitigate such threats, their effectiveness has limited
generalization to out-of-distribution shifts from the optimal value
distribution, as they are primarily designed to handle fixed perturbation. To
address this limitation, this paper introduces an antifragile RL framework that
enhances adaptability to broader distributional shifts by incorporating a
switching mechanism based on discounted Thompson sampling (DTS). This mechanism
dynamically selects among multiple robust policies to minimize adversarially
induced state-action-value distribution shifts. The proposed approach first
derives a diverse ensemble of action robust policies by accounting for a range
of perturbations in the policy space. These policies are then modeled as a
multiarmed bandit (MAB) problem, where DTS optimally selects policies in
response to nonstationary Bernoulli rewards, effectively adapting to evolving
adversarial strategies. Theoretical framework has also been provided where by
optimizing the DTS to minimize the overall regrets due to distributional shift,
results in effective adaptation against unseen adversarial attacks thus
inducing antifragility. Extensive numerical simulations validate the
effectiveness of the proposed framework in complex navigation environments with
multiple dynamic three-dimensional obstacles and with stronger projected
gradient descent (PGD) and spoofing attacks. Compared to conventional robust,
non-adaptive RL methods, the antifragile approach achieves superior
performance, demonstrating shorter navigation path lengths and a higher rate of
conflict-free navigation trajectories compared to existing robust RL techniques

*Deepak Kumar Panda,Adolfo Perrusquia,Weisi Guo*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper addresses the vulnerability of reinforcement learning (RL) policies to out-of-distribution (OOD) adversarial attacks by proposing an antifragile RL framework that adapts to incremental adversarial perturbations, significantly improving resilience in decision-making for safety-critical tasks like UAV navigation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing RL policies are fragile to OOD adversarial attacks in safety-critical settings, which induce distributional shifts, degrade value estimation, and lead to unsafe or suboptimal decisions.

Method: An antifragile RL framework is proposed that adapts to adversarial perturbations via a simulated attacker, gradually increasing perturbation strength. The approach uses Wasserstein distance minimization and iterative expert-guided critic alignment to stabilize catastrophic forgetting and enforce bounded value shifts.

Result: The proposed antifragile RL method outperforms standard RL baselines, achieving up to 15% higher cumulative rewards and over 30% fewer conflict events during UAV navigation under adversarial attacks.

Conclusion: Antifragile reinforcement learning is both practical and theoretically sound for resilient decision-making in environments with evolving adversarial threats.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) policies deployed in safety-critical systems,
such as unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) navigation in dynamic airspace, are
vulnerable to out-ofdistribution (OOD) adversarial attacks in the observation
space. These attacks induce distributional shifts that significantly degrade
value estimation, leading to unsafe or suboptimal decision making rendering the
existing policy fragile. To address this vulnerability, we propose an
antifragile RL framework designed to adapt against curriculum of incremental
adversarial perturbations. The framework introduces a simulated attacker which
incrementally increases the strength of observation-space perturbations which
enables the RL agent to adapt and generalize across a wider range of OOD
observations and anticipate previously unseen attacks. We begin with a
theoretical characterization of fragility, formally defining catastrophic
forgetting as a monotonic divergence in value function distributions with
increasing perturbation strength. Building on this, we define antifragility as
the boundedness of such value shifts and derive adaptation conditions under
which forgetting is stabilized. Our method enforces these bounds through
iterative expert-guided critic alignment using Wasserstein distance
minimization across incrementally perturbed observations. We empirically
evaluate the approach in a UAV deconfliction scenario involving dynamic 3D
obstacles. Results show that the antifragile policy consistently outperforms
standard and robust RL baselines when subjected to both projected gradient
descent (PGD) and GPS spoofing attacks, achieving up to 15% higher cumulative
reward and over 30% fewer conflict events. These findings demonstrate the
practical and theoretical viability of antifragile reinforcement learning for
secure and resilient decision-making in environments with evolving threat
scenarios.

*Andrey Goncharov,Daniil Vyazhev,Petr Sychev,Edvard Khalafyan,Alexey Zaytsev*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces an efficient fine-tuning method for large language models, categorizing data by complexity and avoiding unnecessary distillation for simpler data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The aim is to enhance the fine-tuning process of LLMs by reducing the cost of model calls and large data requirements associated with existing methods.

Method: The approach identifies complex data using entropy and integrates supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and targeted distillation only for high-complexity cases.

Result: The proposed method outperformed standard SFT in accuracy (0.55 vs 0.43) and matched distillation performance while requiring 62% less data.

Conclusion: This novel approach achieves an efficient balance between performance improvement and resource conservation, offering a practical solution for fine-tuning LLMs.

Abstract: General-purpose Large Language Models (LLMs) are frequently fine-tuned
through supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to enhance performance in specific
domains. Better results can be achieved by distilling the chain-of-thought of a
larger model at the cost of numerous expensive calls and a much greater amount
of data. We propose a novel blueprint for efficient fine-tuning that uses
reasoning only for complex data identified by entropy. Specifically, across two
small open models ($\approx 3B$) we split the training data into complexity
categories by a single token answer entropy (ROC AUC $0.73$), fine-tune large
language models (LLMs) via SFT and distillation, and show that our pipeline
significantly outperforms the standard SFT approach ($0.55$ vs $0.43$ average
accuracy) and provides comparable with distillation performance while using
$62\%$ less data ($0.55$ average accuracy for both). We publish our code and
data to facilitate further research in this direction.

*Weikang Meng,Yadan Luo,Liangyu Huo,Yaowei Wang,Xin Li,Zheng Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Linear attention techniques aim to reduce sequence length complexity while preserving key properties of softmax attention. Existing methods overlook query norms and suppress interactions impacted by negative values, leading to performance gaps.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current linear attention implementations struggle to handle query norms and suppress critical interactions due to negative values, causing inefficiencies in entropy reduction and kernel mapping.

Method: The paper introduces the Norm-Aware Linear Attention mechanism, which separates query and key matrices into norm and angular components to address entropy dynamics and preserves norm distributions. Additionally, it maps angular matrices for non-negative consistency using cosine similarity.

Result: Experiments demonstrate the proposed NaLaFormer achieves up to a 4.2% improvement in performance on vision and language-related tasks, showcasing improved expressiveness and computational efficiency.

Conclusion: Norm-Aware Linear Attention effectively tackles critical issues in current linear attentions, preserving entropy dynamics and kernel distributions, thereby enhancing overall model performance in diverse tasks.

Abstract: Linear attention has emerged as a viable alternative to softmax attention by
reducing complexity from quadratic to linear in sequence length. To preserve
two fundamental properties of softmax, non-negativity and entropy reduction,
current works employ various linearly separatable kernel functions with $L1$
normalization instead of softmax operator. However, query norms are neglected
by the normalization operation in linear attention, such degradation heavily
leads to an entropy gap. Meanwhile, existing works inhibit negative values of
query and key vectors resulting in a missing inner-product interactions after
being mapped. To address these dual challenges, we propose a novel Norm-Aware
Linear Attention mechanism serving to restore norm-guided dynamic spikiness and
recover kernel-perturbed norm distributions. Specifically, we first decouple
query and key matrices into two components: norm and direction, to achieve
norm-aware spikiness control and norm consistency, respectively. We
mathematically reveal that the extent of entropy reduction varies with the
query norm in softmax normalization, motivating a query-norm aware kernel
function for dynamic control over entropy reduction. Furthermore, to ensure
norm consistency and enforce non-negativity constraints, we employ a
norm-preserving mapping to project all elements of the angular matrix into
positive values, leveraging cosine similarity to inhibit dimensions with
opposite directions. We conduct extensive experiments demonstrating that the
NaLaFormer improves performance on vision and language tasks, enhancing both
expressiveness and efficiency by up to 4.2\%.

TL;DR: The paper introduces DiLoCoX, a framework for training massive models (over 100 billion parameters) on slower decentralized networks, achieving 357x speedup with minimal convergence loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of training large language models exceeding 100 billion parameters on slow, decentralized network clusters rather than relying on centralized infrastructure with fast interconnects.

Method: The framework integrates Pipeline Parallelism, Dual Optimizer Policy, One-Step-Delay Overlap of Communication and Local Training, and Adaptive Gradient Compression Scheme. It includes theoretical convergence analyses and an implementation to demonstrate its effectiveness.

Result: DiLoCoX successfully trains a 107B parameter model over a 1Gbps network, achieving a 357x speedup compared to AllReduce, with negligible degradation in convergence.

Conclusion: The proposed decentralized framework, DiLoCoX, demonstrates viability for training extremely large models on slower networks, opening opportunities for decentralized cluster utilization in large-scale machine learning.

Abstract: The distributed training of foundation models, particularly large language
models (LLMs), demands a high level of communication. Consequently, it is
highly dependent on a centralized cluster with fast and reliable interconnects.
Can we conduct training on slow networks and thereby unleash the power of
decentralized clusters when dealing with models exceeding 100 billion
parameters? In this paper, we propose DiLoCoX, a low-communication large-scale
decentralized cluster training framework. It combines Pipeline Parallelism with
Dual Optimizer Policy, One-Step-Delay Overlap of Communication and Local
Training, and an Adaptive Gradient Compression Scheme. This combination
significantly improves the scale of parameters and the speed of model
pre-training. We justify the benefits of one-step-delay overlap of
communication and local training, as well as the adaptive gradient compression
scheme, through a theoretical analysis of convergence. Empirically, we
demonstrate that DiLoCoX is capable of pre-training a 107B foundation model
over a 1Gbps network. Compared to vanilla AllReduce, DiLoCoX can achieve a 357x
speedup in distributed training while maintaining negligible degradation in
model convergence. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first
decentralized training framework successfully applied to models with over 100
billion parameters.

*Ziwei Wang,Hongbin Wang,Tianwang Jia,Xingyi He,Siyang Li,Dongrui Wu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces DBConformer, a novel dual-branch convolutional Transformer network for EEG decoding, which outperforms existing models with fewer parameters and superior interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the limitations of CNNs and CNN-Transformer hybrids in EEG decoding, specifically their inability to effectively capture long-range temporal dependencies and inter-channel relationships.

Method: The authors propose DBConformer, which features a dual-branch architecture with a temporal Conformer for long-range temporal dependencies and a spatial Conformer for inter-channel interactions. It also includes a channel attention module to enhance spatial representations.

Result: Extensive experiments conducted on seven datasets demonstrate that DBConformer surpasses 10 competitive baselines in EEG decoding performance while using far fewer parameters. Visualization results reveal physiologically interpretable features.

Conclusion: DBConformer offers a robust, efficient, and interpretable solution for EEG decoding, addressing key limitations in existing models and aligning with sensorimotor priors in motor imagery tasks. It holds significant promise for reliable and explainable BCI applications.

Abstract: Electroencephalography (EEG)-based brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) transform
spontaneous/evoked neural activity into control commands for external
communication. While convolutional neural networks (CNNs) remain the mainstream
backbone for EEG decoding, their inherently short receptive field makes it
difficult to capture long-range temporal dependencies and global inter-channel
relationships. Recent CNN-Transformer (Conformers) hybrids partially address
this issue, but most adopt a serial design, resulting in suboptimal integration
of local and global features, and often overlook explicit channel-wise
modeling. To address these limitations, we propose DBConformer, a dual-branch
convolutional Transformer network tailored for EEG decoding. It integrates a
temporal Conformer to model long-range temporal dependencies and a spatial
Conformer to extract inter-channel interactions, capturing both temporal
dynamics and spatial patterns in EEG signals. A lightweight channel attention
module further refines spatial representations by assigning data-driven
importance to EEG channels. Extensive experiments on five motor imagery (MI)
datasets and two seizure detection datasets under three evaluation settings
demonstrate that DBConformer consistently outperforms 10 competitive baseline
models, with over eight times fewer parameters than the high-capacity EEG
Conformer baseline. Further, the visualization results confirm that the
features extracted by DBConformer are physiologically interpretable and aligned
with sensorimotor priors in MI. The superior performance and interpretability
of DBConformer make it reliable for robust and explainable EEG decoding. Code

### [231] [Generative Adversarial Evasion and Out-of-Distribution Detection for UAV Cyber-Attacks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21142)
*Deepak Kumar Panda,Weisi Guo*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a framework using conditional generative adversarial networks (cGANs) to craft and detect stealthy adversarial attacks in UAV intrusion detection systems (IDS), achieving better threat detection through advanced probabilistic modeling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional intrusion detection systems for UAVs struggle with detecting novel or adversarial threats. Conventional out-of-distribution (OOD) approaches fail to adequately distinguish stealthy adversarial attacks from legitimate OOD events, leaving gaps in resilience against cyber intrusions.

Method: The study develops a cGAN-based framework to generate stealthy adversarial samples that bypass IDS detection. A conditional variational autoencoder (CVAE) is then used to detect such samples by employing negative log-likelihood scores to distinguish adversarial inputs from authentic OOD samples.

Result: The CVAE-based detection method showed significant improvements in identifying stealthy adversarial threats compared to traditional Mahalanobis distance-based approaches.

Conclusion: The paper underscores the importance of advanced probabilistic modeling, such as CVAE, in enhancing the resilience of UAV IDS systems to adaptive and generative adversarial threats.

Abstract: The growing integration of UAVs into civilian airspace underscores the need
for resilient and intelligent intrusion detection systems (IDS), as traditional
anomaly detection methods often fail to identify novel threats. A common
approach treats unfamiliar attacks as out-of-distribution (OOD) samples;
however, this leaves systems vulnerable when mitigation is inadequate.
Moreover, conventional OOD detectors struggle to distinguish stealthy
adversarial attacks from genuine OOD events. This paper introduces a
conditional generative adversarial network (cGAN)-based framework for crafting
stealthy adversarial attacks that evade IDS mechanisms. We first design a
robust multi-class IDS classifier trained on benign UAV telemetry and known
cyber-attacks, including Denial of Service (DoS), false data injection (FDI),
man-in-the-middle (MiTM), and replay attacks. Using this classifier, our cGAN
perturbs known attacks to generate adversarial samples that misclassify as
benign while retaining statistical resemblance to OOD distributions. These
adversarial samples are iteratively refined to achieve high stealth and success
rates. To detect such perturbations, we implement a conditional variational
autoencoder (CVAE), leveraging negative log-likelihood to separate adversarial
inputs from authentic OOD samples. Comparative evaluation shows that CVAE-based
regret scores significantly outperform traditional Mahalanobis distance-based
detectors in identifying stealthy adversarial threats. Our findings emphasize
the importance of advanced probabilistic modeling to strengthen IDS
capabilities against adaptive, generative-model-based cyber intrusions.

### [232] [Personalized Federated Learning via Dual-Prompt Optimization and Cross Fusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21144)
*Yuguang Zhang,Kuangpu Guo,Zhihe Lu,Yunbo Wang,Jian Liang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces pFedDC, a federated learning framework using dual-prompt learning and cross fusion to personalize model training across clients.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges of heterogeneity in federated learning settings and leverage pretrained vision-language models for personalized learning.

Method: The framework employs global and local prompts for vision-language modalities and uses a cross-fusion module to adaptively integrate client-specific data distributions.

Result: Experiments across nine heterogeneous datasets demonstrate pFedDC's superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: pFedDC effectively personalizes federated learning through its innovative dual-prompt learning and cross-fusion techniques, adapting to diverse client-specific data needs.

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) enables collaborative model training across
decentralized clients without sharing local data, but is challenged by
heterogeneity in data, computation, and communication. Pretrained
vision-language models (VLMs), with their strong generalization and lightweight
tuning via prompts, offer a promising solution. However, existing federated
prompt-learning methods rely only on text prompts and overlook joint
label-domain distribution shifts. In this paper, we propose a personalized FL
framework based on dual-prompt learning and cross fusion, termed pFedDC.
Specifically, each client maintains both global and local prompts across vision
and language modalities: global prompts capture common knowledge shared across
the federation, while local prompts encode client-specific semantics and domain
characteristics. Meanwhile, a cross-fusion module is designed to adaptively
integrate prompts from different levels, enabling the model to generate
personalized representations aligned with each client's unique data
distribution. Extensive experiments across nine datasets with various types of
heterogeneity show that pFedDC consistently outperforms state-of-the-art
methods.

*Jiajie Yang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces Latent Prototype Routing (LPR), a novel routing framework for Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures, aiming to address load imbalance issues and improve resource utilization without performance compromise.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Mixture-of-Experts architectures face significant load imbalance issues, where only a small subset of experts are consistently activated, leading to inefficient use of computational resources and model capacity.

Method: The study approaches expert routing from a clustering perspective and introduces Latent Prototype Routing (LPR), which generalizes existing methods while optimizing expert utilization.

Result: LPR demonstrates substantial improvements in load balancing across various MoE models, reducing the Gini coefficient of expert load from 0.70 to 0.035 on average and improving the min-max expert load ratio from 1e-6 to 0.70.

Conclusion: Latent Prototype Routing achieves near-perfect load balancing in MoE architectures, enhancing computational efficiency without affecting downstream performance.

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures have emerged as a key strategy for
scaling large language models (LLMs) efficiently. However, current MoE systems
suffer from severe load imbalance, where only a small subset of experts is
consistently activated during training and inference, leading to significant
underutilization of model capacity and computational resources. In this work,
we revisit expert routing through a clustering perspective and propose Latent
Prototype Routing (LPR), a novel routing framework that generalizes existing
approaches while promoting balanced expert utilization without compromising
downstream performance. Extensive experiments across multiple open-source MoE
models -- including DeepSeek-V3, Qwen3-MoE, and Mixtral -- demonstrate that LPR
reduces the Gini coefficient of expert load from 0.70 to 0.035 on average,
improves the min-max expert load ratio from 1e-6 to 0.70, achieving
near-perfect load balancing.

*Hampus Gummesson Svensson,Ola Engkvist,Jon Paul Janet,Christian Tyrchan,Morteza Haghir Chehreghani*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces diverse mini-batch selection using determinantal point processes for reinforcement learning, applied to drug discovery, showing improved solution diversity and quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Evaluating instances is costly and time-consuming, particularly in reinforcement learning where environment interactions provide reward signals. Sufficient exploration is crucial to mitigate mode collapse and improve learning outcomes.

Method: The paper employs determinantal point processes to select diverse mini-batches during reinforcement learning to enhance exploratory effectiveness.

Result: Experimental evaluations on molecular generation oracles reveal that the framework significantly enhances diversity without compromising the quality of solutions.

Conclusion: The approach has the potential to accelerate drug discovery by fostering diverse and high-quality solutions, addressing unmet needs in medication.

Abstract: In many real-world applications, evaluating the goodness of instances is
often costly and time-consuming, e.g., human feedback and physics simulations,
in contrast to proposing new instances. In particular, this is even more
critical in reinforcement learning, as new interactions with the environment
(i.e., new instances) need to be evaluated to provide a reward signal to learn
from. As sufficient exploration is crucial, learning from a diverse mini-batch
can have a large impact and help mitigate mode collapse. In this paper, we
introduce diverse mini-batch selection for reinforcement learning and propose
to use determinantal point processes for this task. We study this framework in
the context of a real-world problem, namely drug discovery. We experimentally
study how our proposed framework can improve the effectiveness of chemical
exploration in de novo drug design, where finding diverse and high-quality
solutions is essential. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation with three
well-established molecular generation oracles over numerous generative steps.
Our experiments conclude that our diverse mini-batch selection framework can
substantially improve the diversity of the solutions, while still obtaining
solutions of high quality. In drug discovery, such outcome can potentially lead
to fulfilling unmet medication needs faster.

*Colin Samplawski,Adam D. Cobb,Manoj Acharya,Ramneet Kaur,Susmit Jha*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces ScalaBL, a scalable Bayesian low-rank adaptation method for large language models (LLMs), achieving competitive performance with minimal additional parameters and enabling scalability to significantly larger models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs often produce hallucinated and poorly calibrated outputs, making uncertainty quantification crucial, especially in sensitive areas like healthcare and autonomy.

Method: The method, ScalaBL, uses stochastic variational subspace inference for Bayesian learning in a low-dimensional subspace, leveraging LoRA parameters as projection matrices to map samples into the full weight space of LLMs.

Result: ScalaBL achieves competitive performance with state-of-the-art methods, requires only about 1000 additional parameters, and scales to the largest Bayesian LLM to date, quadrupling the parameter count compared to prior work.

Conclusion: ScalaBL provides a computationally efficient and scalable way to perform Bayesian inference in LLMs, demonstrating its suitability for enhancing model reliability in high-stakes applications.

Abstract: Despite their widespread use, large language models (LLMs) are known to
hallucinate incorrect information and be poorly calibrated. This makes the
uncertainty quantification of these models of critical importance, especially
in high-stakes domains, such as autonomy and healthcare. Prior work has made
Bayesian deep learning-based approaches to this problem more tractable by
performing inference over the low-rank adaptation (LoRA) parameters of a
fine-tuned model. While effective, these approaches struggle to scale to larger
LLMs due to requiring further additional parameters compared to LoRA. In this
work we present $\textbf{Scala}$ble $\textbf{B}$ayesian $\textbf{L}$ow-Rank
Adaptation via Stochastic Variational Subspace Inference (ScalaBL). We perform
Bayesian inference in an $r$-dimensional subspace, for LoRA rank $r$. By
repurposing the LoRA parameters as projection matrices, we are able to map
samples from this subspace into the full weight space of the LLM. This allows
us to learn all the parameters of our approach using stochastic variational
inference. Despite the low dimensionality of our subspace, we are able to
achieve competitive performance with state-of-the-art approaches while only
requiring ${\sim}1000$ additional parameters. Furthermore, it allows us to
scale up to the largest Bayesian LLM to date, with four times as a many base
parameters as prior work.

TL;DR: The paper explores the use of Artificial Delegates to mitigate absenteeism's impact on fairness in perpetual voting systems, showing their effectiveness in enhancing representational equity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address fairness in perpetual voting systems where absenteeism and incomplete approval data are common challenges, requiring innovative solutions to maintain representational equity.

Method: The authors incorporate Artificial Delegates—preference-learning agents trained to represent absent voters—into perpetual voting systems and study their effects on fairness and representativeness using various voting methods.

Result: Absenteeism negatively impacts fairness in perpetual voting, but Artificial Delegates successfully mitigate these effects and improve robustness in different scenarios.

Conclusion: Artificial Delegates show promising results in maintaining fairness and representativeness in perpetual voting systems under conditions of partial voter turnout.

Abstract: Perpetual voting addresses fairness in sequential collective decision-making
by evaluating representational equity over time. However, existing perpetual
voting rules rely on full participation and complete approval information,
assumptions that rarely hold in practice, where partial turnout is the norm. In
this work, we study the integration of Artificial Delegates,
preference-learning agents trained to represent absent voters, into perpetual
voting systems. We examine how absenteeism affects fairness and
representativeness under various voting methods and evaluate the extent to
which Artificial Delegates can compensate for missing participation. Our
findings indicate that while absenteeism significantly affects fairness,
Artificial Delegates reliably mitigate these effects and enhance robustness
across diverse scenarios.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the challenges imposed by component obsolescence, which disrupts industries dependent on electronic components due to increased cost and reduced security and availability.

Method: The method integrates zero-shot learning and large language models to utilize domain-specific knowledge from tabular datasets for obsolescence risk prediction.

Result: The approach was applied to two real-world datasets and proved effective in predicting obsolescence risk. Comparative analysis of four LLMs highlighted the need to choose appropriate models for specific forecasting tasks.

Conclusion: By leveraging zero-shot learning with LLMs on tabular data, the study provides a promising solution for tackling data scarcity in risk prediction, though model selection is crucial for task-specific accuracy.

Abstract: Component obsolescence poses significant challenges in industries reliant on
electronic components, causing increased costs and disruptions in the security
and availability of systems. Accurate obsolescence risk prediction is essential
but hindered by a lack of reliable data. This paper proposes a novel approach
to forecasting obsolescence risk using zero-shot learning (ZSL) with large

*Guillaume Carrière,Frédéric Cazals*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper presents a novel analysis and improvement of randomized seeding methods for k-means clustering and Gaussian Mixture Models (k-GMM), introducing lookahead and multi-pass strategies to improve initialization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to improve the initialization techniques in k-means and k-GMM algorithms, which are critical for their performance but often rely on heuristics with room for optimization.

Method: The authors formalize randomized seeding techniques based on three key components (sampling metric, candidate seeds, seed selection metric) and introduce enhanced methods focused on lookahead principles and multi-pass strategies.

Result: Experiments demonstrate that the proposed methods achieve consistent improvements in evaluation metrics (SSE for k-means and log-likelihood for k-GMM) over classical techniques and recent methods like the multi-swap strategy.

Conclusion: The proposed seeding methods are practical and could become standard in clustering tasks, and the formalized framework enables new analytical approaches for further studies.

Abstract: We revisit the randomized seeding techniques for k-means clustering and k-GMM
(Gaussian Mixture model fitting with Expectation-Maximization), formalizing
their three key ingredients: the metric used for seed sampling, the number of
candidate seeds, and the metric used for seed selection. This analysis yields
novel families of initialization methods exploiting a lookahead
principle--conditioning the seed selection to an enhanced coherence with the
final metric used to assess the algorithm, and a multipass strategy to tame
down the effect of randomization.
  Experiments show a consistent constant factor improvement over classical
contenders in terms of the final metric (SSE for k-means, log-likelihood for
k-GMM), at a modest overhead. In particular, for k-means, our methods improve
on the recently designed multi-swap strategy, which was the first one to
outperform the greedy k-means++ seeding.
  Our experimental analysis also shed light on subtle properties of k-means
often overlooked, including the (lack of) correlations between the SSE upon
seeding and the final SSE, the variance reduction phenomena observed in
iterative seeding methods, and the sensitivity of the final SSE to the pool
size for greedy methods.
  Practically, our most effective seeding methods are strong candidates to
become one of the--if not the--standard techniques. From a theoretical
perspective, our formalization of seeding opens the door to a new line of
analytical approaches.

*Galvin Brice S. Lim,Brian Godwin S. Lim,Argel A. Bandala,John Anthony C. Jose,Timothy Scott C. Chu,Edwin Sybingco*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces AGTCNet, a graph-temporal model that significantly advances EEG-based motor imagery classification by outperforming existing classifiers and offering compact architecture with faster inference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the challenge in developing subject-invariant and session-invariant BCI systems due to variability in neural activity and hardware limitations while improving the robustness of MI-EEG classification.

Method: The AGTCNet model utilizes the topographic configuration of EEG electrodes and incorporates a graph convolutional attention network (GCAT) to learn spatiotemporal EEG representations. This approach enhances both subject-independent and subject-specific MI-EEG classification.

Result: AGTCNet outperformed state-of-the-art MI-EEG classifiers with a notable reduction in model size (49.87%), faster inference (64.65%), and improvements in classification accuracy across datasets, demonstrating scalability and effectiveness.

Conclusion: AGTCNet is a compact and efficient model suitable for BCI systems, offering promising advancements in EEG-based motor imagery classification for both subject-independent and subject-specific applications.

Abstract: Brain-computer interface (BCI) technology utilizing electroencephalography
(EEG) marks a transformative innovation, empowering motor-impaired individuals
to engage with their environment on equal footing. Despite its promising
potential, developing subject-invariant and session-invariant BCI systems
remains a significant challenge due to the inherent complexity and variability
of neural activity across individuals and over time, compounded by EEG hardware
constraints. While prior studies have sought to develop robust BCI systems,
existing approaches remain ineffective in capturing the intricate
spatiotemporal dependencies within multichannel EEG signals. This study
addresses this gap by introducing the attentive graph-temporal convolutional
network (AGTCNet), a novel graph-temporal model for motor imagery EEG (MI-EEG)
classification. Specifically, AGTCNet leverages the topographic configuration
of EEG electrodes as an inductive bias and integrates graph convolutional
attention network (GCAT) to jointly learn expressive spatiotemporal EEG
representations. The proposed model significantly outperformed existing MI-EEG
classifiers, achieving state-of-the-art performance while utilizing a compact
architecture, underscoring its effectiveness and practicality for BCI
deployment. With a 49.87% reduction in model size, 64.65% faster inference
time, and shorter input EEG signal, AGTCNet achieved a moving average accuracy
of 66.82% for subject-independent classification on the BCI Competition IV
Dataset 2a, which further improved to 82.88% when fine-tuned for
subject-specific classification. On the EEG Motor Movement/Imagery Dataset,
AGTCNet achieved moving average accuracies of 64.14% and 85.22% for 4-class and
2-class subject-independent classifications, respectively, with further
improvements to 72.13% and 90.54% for subject-specific classifications.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DynamicBench is a novel benchmark to test large language models' ability to process real-time and domain-specific data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Benchmarks for LLMs often rely on static evaluations, making it hard to assess their capability in handling real-time or dynamic information.

Method: DynamicBench uses a dual-path retrieval pipeline that combines web searches and local databases, emphasizing domain-specific knowledge generation.

Result: DynamicBench proves effective, outperforming GPT4o in scenarios without external documents by 7.0% and with them by 5.8%.

Conclusion: The proposed evaluation method is an improvement over traditional benchmarks, showing promise for real-time and domain-specific applications of large language models.

Abstract: Traditional benchmarks for large language models (LLMs) typically rely on
static evaluations through storytelling or opinion expression, which fail to
capture the dynamic requirements of real-time information processing in
contemporary applications. To address this limitation, we present DynamicBench,
a benchmark designed to evaluate the proficiency of LLMs in storing and
processing up-to-the-minute data. DynamicBench utilizes a dual-path retrieval
pipeline, integrating web searches with local report databases. It necessitates
domain-specific knowledge, ensuring accurate responses report generation within
specialized fields. By evaluating models in scenarios that either provide or
withhold external documents, DynamicBench effectively measures their capability
to independently process recent information or leverage contextual
enhancements. Additionally, we introduce an advanced report generation system
adept at managing dynamic information synthesis. Our experimental results
confirm the efficacy of our approach, with our method achieving
state-of-the-art performance, surpassing GPT4o in document-free and
document-assisted scenarios by 7.0% and 5.8%, respectively. The code and data
will be made publicly available.

### [241] [Lipschitz Bounds for Persistent Laplacian Eigenvalues under One-Simplex Insertions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21352)
*Le Vu Anh,Mehmet Dik,Nguyen Viet Anh*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper analyzes the behavior of eigenvalues in persistent Laplacians when a simplex is added to a filtration, proving a Lipschitz bound for such changes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide a precise understanding of how persistent Laplacian eigenvalues change under local updates, as these eigenvalues are crucial for downstream applications like heat-kernel signatures and spectral neural networks.

Method: The authors derive a uniform Lipschitz bound to quantify how each eigenvalue of up-persistent Laplacians changes when one simplex is added, analyzing its Euclidean boundary norm.

Result: They establish that every up-persistent Laplacian eigenvalue can change by at most twice the Euclidean norm of the simplex’s boundary, regardless of filtration scale or complex size.

Conclusion: This work offers the first eigenvalue-level robustness guarantee for spectral topological data analysis, ensuring stability of spectral features under local data updates and enabling better error control in dynamic settings.

Abstract: Persistent Laplacians are matrix operators that track how the shape and
structure of data transform across scales and are popularly adopted in biology,
physics, and machine learning. Their eigenvalues are concise descriptors of
geometric and topological features in a filtration. Although earlier work
established global algebraic stability for these operators, the precise change
in a single eigenvalue when one simplex, such as a vertex, edge, or triangle,
is added has remained unknown. This is important because downstream tools,
including heat-kernel signatures and spectral neural networks, depend directly
on these eigenvalues. We close this gap by proving a uniform Lipschitz bound:
after inserting one simplex, every up-persistent Laplacian eigenvalue can vary
by at most twice the Euclidean norm of that simplex's boundary, independent of
filtration scale and complex size. This result delivers the first
eigenvalue-level robustness guarantee for spectral topological data analysis.
It guarantees that spectral features remain stable under local updates and
enables reliable error control in dynamic data settings.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces SMMILE, a benchmark for evaluating the multimodal in-context learning (ICL) capabilities of large language models (MLLMs) in medical tasks. Results show limitations and biases, including susceptibility to irrelevant examples and ordering effects.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Clinicians frequently need to perform specialized tasks clinically important but based on limited examples. This paper aims to assess the underexplored area of MLLM ability to adapt to multimodal medical tasks.

Method: The authors created SMMILE, an expert-curated benchmark with 111 problems using multimodal queries and examples, alongside an augmented version, SMMILE++, with 1038 tasks. They evaluated 15 MLLMs across these benchmarks.

Result: The study showed MLLMs perform poorly in multimodal ICL tasks, achieving less than 10% improvement over zero-shot methods. Performance was negatively impacted by noisy examples and ordering biases.

Conclusion: The findings demonstrate significant limitations of MLLMs in medical multimodal ICL. Addressing performance degradation due to irrelevant inputs and example order biases is essential for medical AI development.

Abstract: Multimodal in-context learning (ICL) remains underexplored despite
significant potential for domains such as medicine. Clinicians routinely
encounter diverse, specialized tasks requiring adaptation from limited
examples, such as drawing insights from a few relevant prior cases or
considering a constrained set of differential diagnoses. While multimodal large
language models (MLLMs) have shown advances in medical visual question
answering (VQA), their ability to learn multimodal tasks from context is
largely unknown. We introduce SMMILE, the first expert-driven multimodal ICL
benchmark for medical tasks. Eleven medical experts curated problems, each
including a multimodal query and multimodal in-context examples as task
demonstrations. SMMILE encompasses 111 problems (517 question-image-answer
triplets) covering 6 medical specialties and 13 imaging modalities. We further
introduce SMMILE++, an augmented variant with 1038 permuted problems. A
comprehensive evaluation of 15 MLLMs demonstrates that most models exhibit
moderate to poor multimodal ICL ability in medical tasks. In open-ended
evaluations, ICL contributes only 8% average improvement over zero-shot on
SMMILE and 9.4% on SMMILE++. We observe a susceptibility for irrelevant
in-context examples: even a single noisy or irrelevant example can degrade
performance by up to 9.5%. Moreover, example ordering exhibits a recency bias,
i.e., placing the most relevant example last can lead to substantial
performance improvements by up to 71%. Our findings highlight critical
limitations and biases in current MLLMs when learning multimodal medical tasks
from context.

respectively in the MuJoCo Continuous Control Suite from pixels, and

in both sample efficiency and longer-term training. Moreover, the addition of
rQdia finally propels model-free continuous control from pixels over the state

TL;DR: This paper explores how fine-grained error resilience of DNNs and hardware approximation techniques can improve energy efficiency, achieving notable energy gains with minimal accuracy loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: With the growth of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) in Machine Learning, there is a need to reduce the high computational energy costs while maintaining accuracy. This paper aims to explore methods for achieving energy efficiency in DNNs.

Method: The authors utilize ROUP approximate multipliers and examine their distribution at layer, filter, and kernel levels in the ResNet-8 model on the CIFAR-10 dataset. They analyze the trade-off between energy efficiency and accuracy.

Result: The proposed method achieves up to 54% energy savings with a 4% accuracy loss compared to a quantized baseline and delivers 2x energy efficiency with better accuracy over previous state-of-the-art DNN approximations.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates that combining fine-grained error resilience and hardware approximation techniques offers a balance between energy efficiency and model accuracy, outperforming current approximations.

Abstract: Nowadays, the rapid growth of Deep Neural Network (DNN) architectures has
established them as the defacto approach for providing advanced Machine
Learning tasks with excellent accuracy. Targeting low-power DNN computing, this
paper examines the interplay of fine-grained error resilience of DNN workloads
in collaboration with hardware approximation techniques, to achieve higher
levels of energy efficiency. Utilizing the state-of-the-art ROUP approximate
multipliers, we systematically explore their fine-grained distribution across
the network according to our layer-, filter-, and kernel-level approaches, and
examine their impact on accuracy and energy. We use the ResNet-8 model on the
CIFAR-10 dataset to evaluate our approximations. The proposed solution delivers
up to 54% energy gains in exchange for up to 4% accuracy loss, compared to the
baseline quantized model, while it provides 2x energy gains with better
accuracy versus the state-of-the-art DNN approximations.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces NANOADAM, a method that updates only small-magnitude weights during finetuning to improve efficiency and effectiveness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Finetuning large pretrained models requires significant memory and computational resources, creating a need for efficient alternatives.

Method: NANOADAM dynamically updates only small-magnitude weights during finetuning. It avoids gradient computation, preserves large-magnitude weights, and allows larger learning rates.

Result: Experiments on NLP and vision tasks show that NANOADAM provides better generalization performance.

Conclusion: Focusing on small-magnitude weights during finetuning is an effective and resource-efficient strategy that reduces catastrophic forgetting and enhances performance.

Abstract: Finetuning large pretrained neural networks is known to be
resource-intensive, both in terms of memory and computational cost. To mitigate
this, a common approach is to restrict training to a subset of the model
parameters. By analyzing the relationship between gradients and weights during
finetuning, we observe a notable pattern: large gradients are often associated
with small-magnitude weights. This correlation is more pronounced in finetuning
settings than in training from scratch. Motivated by this observation, we
propose NANOADAM, which dynamically updates only the small-magnitude weights
during finetuning and offers several practical advantages: first, this
criterion is gradient-free -- the parameter subset can be determined without
gradient computation; second, it preserves large-magnitude weights, which are
likely to encode critical features learned during pretraining, thereby reducing
the risk of catastrophic forgetting; thirdly, it permits the use of larger
learning rates and consistently leads to better generalization performance in
experiments. We demonstrate this for both NLP and vision tasks.

*Zhi Zheng,Bochuan Zhou,Yuping Song*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces a novel Augmented Temporal-aware Graph Attention Network (ATGAT) for detecting cryptocurrency transaction fraud, addressing challenges like complex transaction patterns and class imbalance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enhanced detection of cryptocurrency fraud is critical due to increasingly intricate transaction behaviors and the difficulty of identifying minority fraudulent cases amid class imbalance.

Method: The paper outlines three modules in ATGAT: (1) a multi-scale temporal embedding module; (2) a triple attention mechanism optimizing structural, temporal, and global contexts; (3) weighted BCE loss for imbalance handling.

Result: Experiments on the Elliptic++ dataset show ATGAT achieving an AUC of 0.9130, outperforming traditional methods (e.g., XGBoost and GCN) by 9-12%.

Conclusion: ATGAT validates its efficiency in enhancing graph neural networks with temporal and triple attention mechanisms, providing scalable applications in financial fraud detection and broader temporal graph anomaly detection tasks.

Abstract: Cryptocurrency transaction fraud detection faces the dual challenges of
increasingly complex transaction patterns and severe class imbalance.
Traditional methods rely on manual feature engineering and struggle to capture
temporal and structural dependencies in transaction networks. This paper
proposes an Augmented Temporal-aware Graph Attention Network (ATGAT) that
enhances detection performance through three modules: (1) designing an advanced
temporal embedding module that fuses multi-scale time difference features with
periodic position encoding; (2) constructing a temporal-aware triple attention
mechanism that jointly optimizes structural, temporal, and global context
attention; (3) employing weighted BCE loss to address class imbalance.
Experiments on the Elliptic++ cryptocurrency dataset demonstrate that ATGAT
achieves an AUC of 0.9130, representing a 9.2% improvement over the best
traditional method XGBoost, 12.0% over GCN, and 10.0% over standard GAT. This
method not only validates the enhancement effect of temporal awareness and

*Jaris Küken,Lennart Purucker,Frank Hutter*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The study introduces an early-stopping strategy for in-context learning in tabular foundation models, achieving significantly faster inference without losing predictive performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current tabular foundation models provide robust in-context learning but face high inference-time costs for large datasets.

Method: A dynamic early-stopping mechanism is used during in-context learning, paired with layer-wise embedding decoding using a pre-trained decoder.

Result: The approach accelerates inference speeds up to x1.3 for small tasks and x2.2 for larger tasks while maintaining performance.

Conclusion: Early-exiting proves to be a practical and efficient solution for tabular in-context learning, enhancing computational efficiency without compromising accuracy.

Abstract: Tabular foundation models have shown strong performance across various
tabular learning tasks via in-context learning, offering robust generalization
without any downstream finetuning. However, their inference-time costs remain
high, particularly for larger datasets. To address this, we propose
early-stopping the in-context learning process. We achieve this by dynamically
evaluating whether to stop in-context learning after each Transformer encoder
layer. Once stopped, we decode the embedding using a pre-trained layer-wise
decoder. Experiments across 34 small classification tasks size show that early
stopping in-context learning accelerates inference by up to x1.3 with
negligible degradation in predictive performance. To assess scalability, we
further evaluate our method on five larger classification tasks, achieving
speedups of up to x2.2. Our results demonstrate the potential of early exiting
as an effective and practical strategy for improving the efficiency of tabular
in-context learning.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the computational challenges in tokenizing and aggregating images from diverse scientific sources, which are compute-intensive and not fully resolved by existing distributed methods.

Method: The authors present the D-CHAG approach, compatible with any model-parallel strategy and vision transformer architecture, to handle large datasets with multiple image channels efficiently.

Result: D-CHAG demonstrated a 75% reduction in memory usage and over a twofold increase in sustained throughput during hyperspectral imaging and weather forecasting tasks, leveraging 1,024 GPUs on the Frontier Supercomputer.

Conclusion: The proposed D-CHAG method significantly boosts computational efficiency in handling large-scale vision-based scientific datasets, making it a valuable solution for advancing scientific models.

Abstract: Vision-based scientific foundation models hold significant promise for
advancing scientific discovery and innovation. This potential stems from their
ability to aggregate images from diverse sources such as varying physical
groundings or data acquisition systems and to learn spatio-temporal
correlations using transformer architectures. However, tokenizing and
aggregating images can be compute-intensive, a challenge not fully addressed by
current distributed methods. In this work, we introduce the Distributed
Cross-Channel Hierarchical Aggregation (D-CHAG) approach designed for datasets
with a large number of channels across image modalities. Our method is
compatible with any model-parallel strategy and any type of vision transformer
architecture, significantly improving computational efficiency. We evaluated
D-CHAG on hyperspectral imaging and weather forecasting tasks. When integrated
with tensor parallelism and model sharding, our approach achieved up to a 75%
reduction in memory usage and more than doubled sustained throughput on up to
1,024 AMD GPUs on the Frontier Supercomputer.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This study examines how multimodal machine learning methods, with fused data from deceivers and deceived individuals, help detect deception in conversations, showing a 71% success rate using late fusion techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore how combining multimodal data (audio and facial cues) from both participants in a conversation could improve deception detection, motivated by psychological insights on expressions during human interactions.

Method: The study used a Scandinavian dataset of dyadic truth/lie scenarios, analyzing speech, facial Action Units, and gaze data through early and late data fusion techniques.

Result: Achieved a 71% accuracy in deception detection by combining audio and video data from both participants using the late fusion strategy.

Conclusion: Integrating multimodal data from both individuals in a dyadic interaction significantly enhances deception detection, providing foundational insights for related future research in fields like psychotherapy.

Abstract: This study investigates the efficacy of using multimodal machine learning
techniques to detect deception in dyadic interactions, focusing on the
integration of data from both the deceiver and the deceived. We compare early
and late fusion approaches, utilizing audio and video data - specifically,
Action Units and gaze information - across all possible combinations of
modalities and participants. Our dataset, newly collected from Swedish native
speakers engaged in truth or lie scenarios on emotionally relevant topics,
serves as the basis for our analysis. The results demonstrate that
incorporating both speech and facial information yields superior performance
compared to single-modality approaches. Moreover, including data from both
participants significantly enhances deception detection accuracy, with the best
performance (71%) achieved using a late fusion strategy applied to both
modalities and participants. These findings align with psychological theories
suggesting differential control of facial and vocal expressions during initial
interactions. As the first study of its kind on a Scandinavian cohort, this
research lays the groundwork for future investigations into dyadic
interactions, particularly within psychotherapy settings.

*Jens Püttschneider,Simon Heilig,Asja Fischer,Timm Faulwasser*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a training approach for ResNets inspired by optimal control theory, penalizing intermediate outputs to potentially simplify networks and prune layers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a theory-based approach for simplifying ResNet architectures by using insights from optimal control, potentially enhancing the efficiency of deep networks.

Method: A training framework that penalizes intermediate outputs of ResNets, effectively linking the training process to stage costs in optimal control, and biases unnecessary layer weights to vanish.

Result: The approach biases deeper, less necessary layers’ weights toward zero, suggesting it as a foundation for layer pruning.

Conclusion: The method provides a theory-informed basis for layer pruning in ResNets, potentially simplifying architectures while maintaining performance.

Abstract: We propose a training formulation for ResNets reflecting an optimal control
problem that is applicable for standard architectures and general loss
functions. We suggest bridging both worlds via penalizing intermediate outputs
of hidden states corresponding to stage cost terms in optimal control. For
standard ResNets, we obtain intermediate outputs by propagating the state
through the subsequent skip connections and the output layer. We demonstrate
that our training dynamic biases the weights of the unnecessary deeper residual
layers to vanish. This indicates the potential for a theory-grounded layer
pruning strategy.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in balancing accuracy, stability, and computational efficiency for high-order, low-storage Extended Stability Runge-Kutta methods, especially in large-scale computational science and engineering applications.

Method: A hybrid approach combining Genetic Algorithms (for search-space exploration) and Reinforcement Learning (for dynamic state transition and heuristic refinement) to automate ESRK heuristic optimisation.

Result: The proposed approach achieves a 25% reduction in IPOPT runtime, maintains fourth-order accuracy, and ensures numerical stability when tested on standard problems such as the Brusselator systems and Navier-Stokes equations.

Conclusion: The hybrid GA-RL framework improves resource efficiency for ESRK methods, expanding their usability in computational fluid dynamics and other fields. It also sets the stage for future development using advanced methods like Deep RL and AutoML.

Abstract: Extended Stability Runge-Kutta (ESRK) methods are crucial for solving
large-scale computational problems in science and engineering, including
weather forecasting, aerodynamic analysis, and complex biological modelling.
However, balancing accuracy, stability, and computational efficiency remains
challenging, particularly for high-order, low-storage schemes. This study
introduces a hybrid Genetic Algorithm (GA) and Reinforcement Learning (RL)
approach for automated heuristic discovery, optimising low-storage ESRK
methods. Unlike traditional approaches that rely on manually designed
heuristics or exhaustive numerical searches, our method leverages GA-driven
mutations for search-space exploration and an RL-inspired state transition
mechanism to refine heuristic selection dynamically. This enables systematic
parameter reduction, preserving fourth-order accuracy while significantly
improving computational efficiency.The proposed GA-RL heuristic optimisation
framework is validated through rigorous testing on benchmark problems,
including the 1D and 2D Brusselator systems and the steady-state Navier-Stokes
equations. The best-performing heuristic achieves a 25\% reduction in IPOPT
runtime compared to traditional ESRK optimisation processes while maintaining
numerical stability and accuracy. These findings demonstrate the potential of
adaptive heuristic discovery to improve resource efficiency in high-fidelity
simulations and broaden the applicability of low-storage Runge-Kutta methods in
real-world computational fluid dynamics, physics simulations, and other
demanding fields. This work establishes a new paradigm in heuristic
optimisation for numerical methods, opening pathways for further exploration

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper develops ML models to predict cancer susceptibility and proposes a system to increase cancer awareness and accessibility to healthcare in Telangana.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the low awareness and participation in cancer screening, leading to high morbidity and mortality rates despite early detection being crucial.

Method: Utilized ML classification models: Decision Tree for cervical cancer susceptibility and Support Vector Classification for breast cancer susceptibility. Also proposed a hospital recommendation system and integrated health card for medical records.

Result: ML models successfully predict cancer susceptibility. System promotes cancer awareness and facilitates healthcare access by providing hospital recommendations and maintaining health records.

Conclusion: The solution enhances cancer literacy, awareness, and healthcare access, aiming to reduce mortality and morbidity rates in Telangana.

Abstract: According to the data, the percent of women who underwent screening for
cervical cancer, breast and oral cancer in Telangana in the year 2020 was 3.3
percent, 0.3 percent and 2.3 percent respectively. Although early detection is
the only way to reduce morbidity and mortality, people have very low awareness
about cervical and breast cancer signs and symptoms and screening practices. We
developed an ML classification model to predict if a person is susceptible to
breast or cervical cancer based on demographic factors. We devised a system to
provide suggestions for the nearest hospital or Cancer treatment centres based
on the users location or address. In addition to this, we can integrate the
health card to maintain medical records of all individuals and conduct
awareness drives and campaigns. For ML classification models, we used decision
tree classification and support vector classification algorithms for cervical
cancer susceptibility and breast cancer susceptibility respectively. Thus, by
devising this solution we come one step closer to our goal which is spreading
cancer awareness, thereby, decreasing the cancer mortality and increasing
cancer literacy among the people of Telangana.

*Francesco Vitale,Nicola Dall'Ora,Sebastiano Gaiardelli,Enrico Fraccaroli,Nicola Mazzocca,Franco Fummi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes an unsupervised fault diagnosis approach for Cyber-Physical Systems (CPSs) that combines anomaly detection, process mining, and stochastic simulation to improve fault detection and root cause analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The manual modeling of faulty behaviors in CPSs is challenging due to the need for domain expertise and the complexity, errors, and unintelligibility associated with traditional models.

Method: The method integrates collective anomaly detection using multivariate time-series analysis, process mining to create interpretable models, and stochastic simulation of faulty behaviors via timing enhancements in Petri nets.

Result: Validation on the Robotic Arm Dataset (RoAD) demonstrates the method's effectiveness in fault detection, simulation, and classification, enabling the generation of fault dictionaries.

Conclusion: This methodology supports predictive maintenance and digital twin development by providing interpretable models and tools for analyzing faulty behaviors in industrial CPSs.

Abstract: Fault diagnosis in Cyber-Physical Systems (CPSs) is essential for ensuring
system dependability and operational efficiency by accurately detecting
anomalies and identifying their root causes. However, the manual modeling of
faulty behaviors often demands extensive domain expertise and produces models
that are complex, error-prone, and difficult to interpret. To address this
challenge, we present a novel unsupervised fault diagnosis methodology that
integrates collective anomaly detection in multivariate time series, process
mining, and stochastic simulation. Initially, collective anomalies are detected
from low-level sensor data using multivariate time-series analysis. These
anomalies are then transformed into structured event logs, enabling the
discovery of interpretable process models through process mining. By
incorporating timing distributions into the extracted Petri nets, the approach
supports stochastic simulation of faulty behaviors, thereby enhancing root
cause analysis and behavioral understanding. The methodology is validated using
the Robotic Arm Dataset (RoAD), a widely recognized benchmark in smart
manufacturing. Experimental results demonstrate its effectiveness in modeling,
simulating, and classifying faulty behaviors in CPSs. This enables the creation
of comprehensive fault dictionaries that support predictive maintenance and the
development of digital twins for industrial environments.

Motivation: To address the challenges of complex inter-variable dependencies, temporal dynamics, and sparse anomaly labels in MTS anomaly detection.

Method: Developing mTSBench to evaluate 24 anomaly detection methods systematically and standardizing unsupervised model selection techniques.

Result: mTSBench validates that no single detector excels across all datasets and exposes gaps in current selection methods.

Conclusion: mTSBench serves as a unified evaluation suite to advance the fields of adaptive anomaly detection and robust model selection.

Abstract: Multivariate time series anomaly detection (MTS-AD) is critical in domains

challenging due to complex inter-variable dependencies, temporal dynamics, and
sparse anomaly labels. We introduce mTSBench, the largest benchmark to date for
MTS-AD and unsupervised model selection, spanning 344 labeled time series
across 19 datasets and 12 diverse application domains. mTSBench evaluates 24
anomaly detection methods, including large language model (LLM)-based detectors
for multivariate time series, and systematically benchmarks unsupervised model
selection techniques under standardized conditions. Consistent with prior
findings, our results confirm that no single detector excels across datasets,
underscoring the importance of model selection. However, even state-of-the-art
selection methods remain far from optimal, revealing critical gaps. mTSBench
provides a unified evaluation suite to enable rigorous, reproducible

### [256] [Where to find Grokking in LLM Pretraining? Monitor Memorization-to-Generalization without Test](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21551)
*Ziyue Li,Chenrui Fan,Tianyi Zhou*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This study observes the phenomenon of 'grokking' in large language models (LLMs), where generalization improves even after training loss stagnates. It focuses on internal dynamics by introducing metrics for pathway evolution and complexity to explain delayed generalization effects.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Grokking, where test performance improves post-training loss convergence, has been witnessed in neural networks, leading to an unclear understanding of generalization mechanisms. This paper aims to investigate its occurrence in large-scale foundation models and explain the mechanisms behind it.

Method: The study evaluates grokking in the one-pass pretraining of a 7B parameter large language model (OLMoE). It analyzes training samples' pathways and their evolution, introducing metrics to study pathway distance and complexity and linking these metrics to generalization.

Result: Grokking was observed during pretraining of large models, with training samples transitioning from random pathways to structured ones, reducing pathway complexity. Two metrics—pathway distance and complexity—successfully predicted generalization improvement and were efficient and practical.

Conclusion: Structured pathways emerging during grokking reduce model complexity and elevate generalization, offering a mechanistic explanation for delayed generalization. The developed metrics can improve training supervision by monitoring generalization potential even without task-specific finetuning.

Abstract: Grokking, i.e., test performance keeps improving long after training loss
converged, has been recently witnessed in neural network training, making the
mechanism of generalization and other emerging capabilities such as reasoning
mysterious. While prior studies usually train small models on a few toy or
highly-specific tasks for thousands of epochs, we conduct the first study of
grokking on checkpoints during one-pass pretraining of a 7B large language
model (LLM), i.e., OLMoE. We compute the training loss and evaluate
generalization on diverse benchmark tasks, including math reasoning, code
generation, and commonsense/domain-specific knowledge retrieval tasks.
  Our study, for the first time, verifies that grokking still happens in the
pretraining of large-scale foundation models, though different data may enter
grokking stages asynchronously. We further demystify grokking's "emergence of
generalization" by investigating LLM internal dynamics. Specifically, we find
that training samples' pathways (i.e., expert choices across layers) evolve
from random, instance-specific to more structured and shareable between samples
during grokking. Also, the complexity of a sample's pathway reduces despite the
converged loss. These indicate a memorization-to-generalization conversion,
providing a mechanistic explanation of delayed generalization. In the study, we
develop two novel metrics to quantify pathway distance and the complexity of a
single pathway. We show their ability to predict the generalization improvement
on diverse downstream tasks. They are efficient, simple to compute and solely
dependent on training data. Hence, they have practical value for pretraining,
enabling us to monitor the generalization performance without finetuning and
test. Theoretically, we show that more structured pathways reduce model
complexity and improve the generalization bound.

TL;DR: This paper introduces the first theoretical framework for using spiking neural networks (SNNs) to improve energy-efficient synthetic aperture radar (SAR) interferometric phase unwrapping.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large-scale earth observation missions, such as NISAR, generate massive data volumes. Energy-efficient processing, such as through computationally efficient methodologies like SNNs, is increasingly vital for sustainability in data processing.

Method: The authors develop spike encoding schemes tailored for wrapped phase data, propose specialized SNN architectures leveraging phase unwrapping properties, and theoretically analyze the computational complexity and convergence characteristics of their framework.

Result: The proposed framework shows that SNNs' temporal dynamics effectively model spatial continuity constraints, demonstrating their potential to complement existing phase unwrapping approaches while being far more energy efficient.

Conclusion: This work pioneers the intersection of neuromorphic computing and SAR interferometry, paving the way for more sustainable and scalable processing of interferometric data with significant energy savings.

Abstract: We present the first theoretical framework for applying spiking neural
networks (SNNs) to synthetic aperture radar (SAR) interferometric phase
unwrapping. Despite extensive research in both domains, our comprehensive
literature review confirms that SNNs have never been applied to phase
unwrapping, representing a significant gap in current methodologies. As Earth
observation data volumes continue to grow exponentially (with missions like
NISAR expected to generate 100PB in two years) energy-efficient processing
becomes critical for sustainable data center operations. SNNs, with their
event-driven computation model, offer potential energy savings of 30-100x
compared to conventional approaches while maintaining comparable accuracy. We
develop spike encoding schemes specifically designed for wrapped phase data,
propose SNN architectures that leverage the spatial propagation nature of phase
unwrapping, and provide theoretical analysis of computational complexity and
convergence properties. Our framework demonstrates how the temporal dynamics
inherent in SNNs can naturally model the spatial continuity constraints
fundamental to phase unwrapping. This work opens a new research direction at
the intersection of neuromorphic computing and SAR interferometry, offering a
complementary approach to existing algorithms that could enable more
sustainable large-scale InSAR processing.

TL;DR: The paper introduces Brain2Model Transfer Learning (B2M), a method using human brain activity as teacher models to train artificial neural networks, resulting in faster convergence and higher predictive accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To leverage the efficiency of human brain representations in artificial neural networks for faster learning and improved performance in sensory and decision-making tasks.

Method: Two B2M strategies were proposed: (1) Brain Contrastive Transfer aligning brain activity with network activations, and (2) Brain Latent Transfer projecting brain-derived features onto student networks through supervised regression.

Result: Student networks trained using B2M converged faster and achieved higher predictive accuracy in memory-based decision-making and autonomous driving tasks compared to isolated training.

Conclusion: The paper demonstrates the brain's low-dimensional, abstract representations as a valuable resource for artificial learning, promising improved efficiency and performance in complex decision-making tasks.

Abstract: Transfer learning enhances the training of novel sensory and decision models
by employing rich feature representations from large, pre-trained teacher
models. Cognitive neuroscience shows that the human brain creates
low-dimensional, abstract representations for efficient sensorimotor coding.
Importantly, the brain can learn these representations with significantly fewer
data points and less computational power than artificial models require. We
introduce Brain2Model Transfer Learning (B2M), a framework where neural
activity from human sensory and decision-making tasks acts as the teacher model
for training artificial neural networks. We propose two B2M strategies: (1)
Brain Contrastive Transfer, which aligns brain activity and network activations
through a contrastive objective; and (2) Brain Latent Transfer, which projects
latent dynamics from similar cognitive tasks onto student networks via
supervised regression of brain-derived features. We validate B2M in
memory-based decision-making with a recurrent neural network and scene
reconstruction for autonomous driving with a variational autoencoder. The
results show that student networks benefiting from brain-based transfer
converge faster and achieve higher predictive accuracy than networks trained in
isolation. Our findings indicate that the brain's representations are valuable
for artificial learners, paving the way for more efficient learning of complex
decision-making representations, which would be costly or slow through purely
artificial training.

TL;DR: This paper introduces a stochastic quantum spiking (SQS) neuron model that combines neuromorphic and quantum computing advantages to enable scalable, event-driven probabilistic networks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to overcome limitations in existing quantum spiking models, such as reliance on classical memory and backpropagation on classical simulators, to better utilize the strengths of neuromorphic and quantum paradigms.

Method: The proposed SQS neuron leverages multi-qubit quantum circuits for creating a spiking unit with internal quantum memory and enables training through a local, hardware-friendly learning rule.

Result: The authors demonstrate that SQS neurons allow for event-driven spike generation without repeated measurements and eliminate the need for classical backpropagation, enabling modular and scalable networks.

Conclusion: The SQS neuron model effectively combines the energy-efficient time-series processing of neuromorphic computing with the vast state space of quantum computing, offering a path forward for scalable and trainable quantum spiking neural networks.

Abstract: Neuromorphic and quantum computing have recently emerged as promising
paradigms for advancing artificial intelligence, each offering complementary
strengths. Neuromorphic systems built on spiking neurons excel at processing
time-series data efficiently through sparse, event-driven computation,
consuming energy only upon input events. Quantum computing, on the other hand,
leverages superposition and entanglement to explore feature spaces that are
exponentially large in the number of qubits. Hybrid approaches combining these
paradigms have begun to show potential, but existing quantum spiking models
have important limitations. Notably, prior quantum spiking neuron
implementations rely on classical memory mechanisms on single qubits, requiring
repeated measurements to estimate firing probabilities, and they use
conventional backpropagation on classical simulators for training. Here we
propose a stochastic quantum spiking (SQS) neuron model that addresses these
challenges. The SQS neuron uses multi-qubit quantum circuits to realize a
spiking unit with internal quantum memory, enabling event-driven probabilistic
spike generation in a single shot. Furthermore, we outline how networks of SQS
neurons -- dubbed SQS neural networks (SQSNNs) -- can be trained via a
hardware-friendly local learning rule, eliminating the need for global
classical backpropagation. The proposed SQSNN model fuses the time-series
efficiency of neuromorphic computing with the exponentially large inner state
space of quantum computing, paving the way for quantum spiking neural networks
that are modular, scalable, and trainable on quantum hardware.

Motivation: Optimizing the trade-off between performance and computational efficiency in language models and instructional prompts to improve their deployment in AI systems.

Method: The authors applied a bi-objective optimization method using the NSGA-II algorithm coupled with prompt grammar on reasoning tasks, targeting the accuracy-token efficiency trade-off.

Result: The research identified diverse, high-performing SLM-prompt combinations and the trade-offs between accuracy and token usage, producing practical Pareto fronts for decision-making.

Conclusion: The automated optimization approach provides a foundational method for identifying effective human-AI interaction patterns, moving beyond manual tuning strategies.

Abstract: The concurrent optimization of language models and instructional prompts
presents a significant challenge for deploying efficient and effective AI
systems, particularly when balancing performance against computational costs
like token usage. This paper introduces and assesses a bi-objective
evolutionary search engine designed to navigate this complex space, focusing
specifically on Small Language Models (SLMs). We employ the NSGA-II algorithm
and prompt grammar to simultaneously optimize for task accuracy and token
efficiency across some reasoning tasks. Our results successfully identify
diverse, high-performing model-prompt combinations, quantitatively revealing
the critical trade-off between the two objectives. This research highlights
task-specific affinities between particular SLMs and prompt structures (e.g.,
instructions, context, chain of thought). The generated practical Pareto fronts
offer decision-makers a portfolio of optimized solutions adaptable to their
specific constraints. This automated approach moves beyond traditional manual
tuning, providing a foundational framework for discovering effective human-AI
interaction patterns.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper tackles high impact forces during robotic catching tasks using an impact-aware framework leveraging optimal motion planning during pre- and post-catching phases.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Robotic catching involves high forces that risk task failure and hardware damage, pushing the need for minimizing these forces when combined with object mass challenges.

Method: The framework involves pre-catching trajectory optimization to minimize impact forces and post-catching energy dissipation using human-inspired demonstrations, supported by hierarchical quadratic programming-based control.

Result: Experiments revealed that velocity matching reduces joint torques, while reflected mass minimization increases robustness, demonstrated across multiple Cartesian axes.

Conclusion: The approach improves robotic catching efficiency by mitigating impact and ensuring adaptability to various spatial tasks, addressing challenges from object masses.

Abstract: Robotic catching of flying objects typically generates high impact forces
that might lead to task failure and potential hardware damages. This is
accentuated when the object mass to robot payload ratio increases, given the
strong inertial components characterizing this task. This paper aims to address
this problem by proposing an implicitly impact-aware framework that
accomplishes the catching task in both pre- and post-catching phases. In the
first phase, a motion planner generates optimal trajectories that minimize
catching forces, while in the second, the object's energy is dissipated
smoothly, minimizing bouncing. In particular, in the pre-catching phase, a
real-time optimal planner is responsible for generating trajectories of the
end-effector that minimize the velocity difference between the robot and the
object to reduce impact forces during catching. In the post-catching phase, the
robot's position, velocity, and stiffness trajectories are generated based on
human demonstrations when catching a series of free-falling objects with
unknown masses. A hierarchical quadratic programming-based controller is used
to enforce the robot's constraints (i.e., joint and torque limits) and create a
stack of tasks that minimizes the reflected mass at the end-effector as a
secondary objective. The initial experiments isolate the problem along one
dimension to accurately study the effects of each contribution on the metrics
proposed. We show how the same task, without velocity matching, would be
infeasible due to excessive joint torques resulting from the impact. The
addition of reflected mass minimization is then investigated, and the catching

### [263] [Model-Based Real-Time Pose and Sag Estimation of Overhead Power Lines Using LiDAR for Drone Inspection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20812)
*Alexandre Girard,Steven A. Parkison,Philippe Hamelin*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces a LiDAR-based method for drones to effectively localize around power lines, addressing challenges like minimal surface detection, incomplete conductor visibility, and separating power lines from other objects.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Efficient and accurate drone inspection of energized power lines is needed, but localizing drones near conductors using LiDAR is challenging due to limited surface reflections, partial detections, and noise from nearby objects.

Method: The authors propose a global geometric model approach, minimizing errors between LiDAR scans and a holistic representation of conductor arrays instead of tracking each conductor individually.

Result: The experimental results show that the method achieves fast (under 50 ms/frame) and accurate localization, even with noisy data and partial observations, and handles up to twice as many outliers as valid measurements.

Conclusion: The proposed LiDAR estimation method improves drone inspections of power lines by addressing localization issues effectively, making the process more reliable under challenging conditions.

Abstract: Drones can inspect overhead power lines while they remain energized,
significantly simplifying the inspection process. However, localizing a drone
relative to all conductors using an onboard LiDAR sensor presents several
challenges: (1) conductors provide minimal surface for LiDAR beams limiting the
number of conductor points in a scan, (2) not all conductors are consistently
detected, and (3) distinguishing LiDAR points corresponding to conductors from
other objects, such as trees and pylons, is difficult. This paper proposes an
estimation approach that minimizes the error between LiDAR measurements and a
single geometric model representing the entire conductor array, rather than
tracking individual conductors separately. Experimental results, using data
from a power line drone inspection, demonstrate that this method achieves
accurate tracking, with a solver converging under 50 ms per frame, even in the
presence of partial observations, noise, and outliers. A sensitivity analysis
shows that the estimation approach can tolerate up to twice as many outlier
points as valid conductors measurements.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A new framework enables quadrotor drones to collaboratively track and encircle a moving target without external localization support.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a reliable system for multi-quadrotor operations in search-and-rescue scenarios, especially in environments where traditional localization methods may fail.

Method: The paper combines visual-inertial odometry, range measurements, modified and distributed Kalman filters, and oscillator-based formation control for enhanced localization and tracking.

Result: Indoor and outdoor experiments demonstrate robust performance in occluded environments, with fault tolerance for quadrotor failures.

Conclusion: The proposed framework shows potential for reliable and efficient multi-quadrotor deployment in challenging environments like search-and-rescue operations.

Abstract: A cooperative circumnavigation framework is proposed for multi-quadrotor
systems to enclose and track a moving target without reliance on external
localization systems. The distinct relationships between quadrotor-quadrotor
and quadrotor-target interactions are evaluated using a heterogeneous
perception strategy and corresponding state estimation algorithms. A modified
Kalman filter is developed to fuse visual-inertial odometry with range
measurements to enhance the accuracy of inter-quadrotor relative localization.
An event-triggered distributed Kalman filter is designed to achieve robust
target state estimation under visual occlusion by incorporating neighbor
measurements and estimated inter-quadrotor relative positions. Using the
estimation results, a cooperative circumnavigation controller is constructed,
leveraging an oscillator-based autonomous formation flight strategy. We conduct
extensive indoor and outdoor experiments to validate the efficiency of the
proposed circumnavigation framework in occluded environments. Furthermore, a
quadrotor failure experiment highlights the inherent fault tolerance property
of the proposed framework, underscoring its potential for deployment in
search-and-rescue operations.

Conclusion: By providing an overview and structured taxonomy, this paper supports VLA model development and aligns it with human-like motor learning principles, advancing the field of robotic manipulation.

Abstract: Vision-language-action (VLA) models extend vision-language models (VLM) by
integrating action generation modules for robotic manipulation. Leveraging
strengths of VLM in vision perception and instruction understanding, VLA models
exhibit promising generalization across diverse manipulation tasks. However,
applications demanding high precision and accuracy reveal performance gaps
without further adaptation. Evidence from multiple domains highlights the
critical role of post-training to align foundational models with downstream
applications, spurring extensive research on post-training VLA models. VLA
model post-training aims to address the challenge of improving an embodiment's
ability to interact with the environment for the given tasks, analogous to the
process of humans motor skills acquisition. Accordingly, this paper reviews
post-training strategies for VLA models through the lens of human motor
learning, focusing on three dimensions: environments, embodiments, and tasks. A
structured taxonomy is introduced aligned with human learning mechanisms: (1)
enhancing environmental perception, (2) improving embodiment awareness, (3)
deepening task comprehension, and (4) multi-component integration. Finally, key
challenges and trends in post-training VLA models are identified, establishing
a conceptual framework to guide future research. This work delivers both a
comprehensive overview of current VLA model post-training methods from a human
motor learning perspective and practical insights for VLA model development.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper proposes using conditional diffusion models to generate synthetic thermal images from existing RGB datasets, addressing the lack of thermal imagery for robotics applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Thermal cameras have advantages in detecting objects in low visibility environments, but limited datasets hinder their integration into robotics.

Method: Conditional diffusion models with self-attention are used to convert RGB images into synthetic thermal images.

Result: The method enables RGB datasets to be augmented with realistic thermal data.

Conclusion: Synthetic thermal imagery can accelerate the adoption of thermal cameras in autonomous systems and robotics.

Abstract: Autonomous systems rely on sensors to estimate the environment around them.
However, cameras, LiDARs, and RADARs have their own limitations. In nighttime
or degraded environments such as fog, mist, or dust, thermal cameras can
provide valuable information regarding the presence of objects of interest due
to their heat signature. They make it easy to identify humans and vehicles that
are usually at higher temperatures compared to their surroundings. In this
paper, we focus on the adaptation of thermal cameras for robotics and
automation, where the biggest hurdle is the lack of data. Several multi-modal
datasets are available for driving robotics research in tasks such as scene
segmentation, object detection, and depth estimation, which are the cornerstone
of autonomous systems. However, they are found to be lacking in thermal
imagery. Our paper proposes a solution to augment these datasets with synthetic
thermal data to enable widespread and rapid adaptation of thermal cameras. We
explore the use of conditional diffusion models to convert existing RGB images
to thermal images using self-attention to learn the thermal properties of
real-world objects.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The STEP framework improves long-horizon task planning by constructing a hierarchical subgoal tree, achieving higher success rates versus SOTA methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance robots' ability to perform complex, long-horizon tasks reliably, overcoming limitations of LLMs in reasoning for embodied tasks.

Method: STEP uses a hierarchical tree structure with two models: a subgoal decomposition model leveraging LLMs for breaking goals into subgoals and a leaf node termination model for real-time state feedback.

Result: Achieved success rates of up to 34% on the VirtualHome WAH-NL benchmark and 25% on real robots, outperforming state-of-the-art approaches.

Conclusion: The STEP framework is a promising approach for advancing long-horizon task reasoning and planning for robotic systems in practical settings.

Abstract: The ability to perform reliable long-horizon task planning is crucial for
deploying robots in real-world environments. However, directly employing Large
Language Models (LLMs) as action sequence generators often results in low
success rates due to their limited reasoning ability for long-horizon embodied
tasks. In the STEP framework, we construct a subgoal tree through a pair of
closed-loop models: a subgoal decomposition model and a leaf node termination
model. Within this framework, we develop a hierarchical tree structure that
spans from coarse to fine resolutions. The subgoal decomposition model
leverages a foundation LLM to break down complex goals into manageable
subgoals, thereby spanning the subgoal tree. The leaf node termination model
provides real-time feedback based on environmental states, determining when to
terminate the tree spanning and ensuring each leaf node can be directly
converted into a primitive action. Experiments conducted in both the
VirtualHome WAH-NL benchmark and on real robots demonstrate that STEP achieves
long-horizon embodied task completion with success rates up to 34% (WAH-NL) and
25% (real robot) outperforming SOTA methods.

Result: Experiments show that V2X-REALM outperforms current baselines in robustness, reasoning, safety, and planning accuracy under challenging driving conditions.

Conclusion: The proposed framework improves the scalability and performance of cooperative autonomous driving in rare, long-tail scenarios.

Abstract: Ensuring robust planning and decision-making under rare, diverse, and
visually degraded long-tail scenarios remains a fundamental challenge for
autonomous driving in urban environments. This issue becomes more critical in
cooperative settings, where vehicles and infrastructure jointly perceive and
reason across complex environments. To address this challenge, we propose
V2X-REALM, a vision-language model (VLM)-based framework with adaptive
multimodal learning for robust cooperative autonomous driving under long-tail
scenarios. V2X-REALM introduces three core innovations: (i) a prompt-driven
long-tail scenario generation and evaluation pipeline that leverages foundation
models to synthesize realistic long-tail conditions such as snow and fog across
vehicle- and infrastructure-side views, enriching training diversity
efficiently; (ii) a gated multi-scenario adaptive attention module that
modulates the visual stream using scenario priors to recalibrate ambiguous or
corrupted features; and (iii) a multi-task scenario-aware contrastive learning
objective that improves multimodal alignment and promotes cross-scenario
feature separability. Extensive experiments demonstrate that V2X-REALM
significantly outperforms existing baselines in robustness, semantic reasoning,
safety, and planning accuracy under complex, challenging driving conditions,
advancing the scalability of end-to-end cooperative autonomous driving.

Result: The proposed approach demonstrated better performance on robotic manipulation tasks, using only 25% of the expert demonstrations compared to image-based diffusion policies. It showed robustness across novel object types, and varying backgrounds and lighting.

Conclusion: This framework represents a significant advance in data-efficient robotic learning, leveraging external semantic knowledge to improve real-world manipulation tasks.

Abstract: Imitation learning has emerged as a powerful paradigm in robot manipulation,
yet its generalization capability remains constrained by object-specific
dependencies in limited expert demonstrations. To address this challenge, we
propose knowledge-driven imitation learning, a framework that leverages
external structural semantic knowledge to abstract object representations

knowledge template and develop a coarse-to-fine template-matching algorithm
that optimizes both structural consistency and semantic similarity. Evaluated
on three real-world robotic manipulation tasks, our method achieves superior
performance, surpassing image-based diffusion policies with only one-quarter of
the expert demonstrations. Extensive experiments further demonstrate its
robustness across novel objects, backgrounds, and lighting conditions. This
work pioneers a knowledge-driven approach to data-efficient robotic learning in

Motivation: To overcome challenges in traditional LiDAR SLAM systems that rely on large, storage-intensive 3D point cloud maps while achieving map continuity, compactness, and consistency.

Method: The authors use the CURL implicit encoding with spherical harmonics for compact map representation, apply a novel LiDAR pose estimation optimization, and integrate local Bundle Adjustment for simultaneous pose and map refinement.

Result: CURL-SLAM shows state-of-the-art mapping quality, competitive trajectory accuracy, and real-time sensor-rate performance (10 Hz) on a CPU.

Conclusion: CURL-SLAM provides a highly efficient alternative for 3D LiDAR mapping, merges compact storage with accurate localization, and will be shared with the research community for further advancements.

Abstract: This paper studies 3D LiDAR mapping with a focus on developing an updatable
and localizable map representation that enables continuity, compactness and
consistency in 3D maps. Traditional LiDAR Simultaneous Localization and Mapping
(SLAM) systems often rely on 3D point cloud maps, which typically require
extensive storage to preserve structural details in large-scale environments.
In this paper, we propose a novel paradigm for LiDAR SLAM by leveraging the
Continuous and Ultra-compact Representation of LiDAR (CURL) introduced in [1].
Our proposed LiDAR mapping approach, CURL-SLAM, produces compact 3D maps
capable of continuous reconstruction at variable densities using CURL's
spherical harmonics implicit encoding, and achieves global map consistency
after loop closure. Unlike popular Iterative Closest Point (ICP)-based LiDAR
odometry techniques, CURL-SLAM formulates LiDAR pose estimation as a unique
optimization problem tailored for CURL and extends it to local Bundle
Adjustment (BA), enabling simultaneous pose refinement and map correction.
Experimental results demonstrate that CURL-SLAM achieves state-of-the-art 3D
mapping quality and competitive LiDAR trajectory accuracy, delivering
sensor-rate real-time performance (10 Hz) on a CPU. We will release the
CURL-SLAM implementation to the community.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improve safe deployment of mobile robots among humans by addressing limitations in traditional planning techniques with uncertain and arbitrarily shaped trajectory predictions.

Method: Proposed DRA-MPPI, which combines MPPI with a Monte Carlo approach to estimate Collision Probability (CP) for sampled trajectories in real-time. It rejects unsafe samples or integrates CP into the navigation cost function.

Result: Experiments demonstrate that DRA-MPPI surpasses state-of-the-art motion planners like S-MPC, Frenet planner, and vanilla MPPI in terms of safety and performance.

Conclusion: DRA-MPPI effectively mitigates freezing robot problems and enhances safety in real-time, multi-dynamic obstacle environments.

Abstract: Deploying mobile robots safely among humans requires the motion planner to
account for the uncertainty in the other agents' predicted trajectories. This
remains challenging in traditional approaches, especially with arbitrarily
shaped predictions and real-time constraints. To address these challenges, we
propose a Dynamic Risk-Aware Model Predictive Path Integral control (DRA-MPPI),
a motion planner that incorporates uncertain future motions modelled with
potentially non-Gaussian stochastic predictions. By leveraging MPPI's
gradient-free nature, we propose a method that efficiently approximates the
joint Collision Probability (CP) among multiple dynamic obstacles for several
hundred sampled trajectories in real-time via a Monte Carlo (MC) approach. This
enables the rejection of samples exceeding a predefined CP threshold or the
integration of CP as a weighted objective within the navigation cost function.
Consequently, DRA-MPPI mitigates the freezing robot problem while enhancing
safety. Real-world and simulated experiments with multiple dynamic obstacles
demonstrate DRA-MPPI's superior performance compared to state-of-the-art
approaches, including Scenario-based Model Predictive Control (S-MPC), Frenet

Abstract: This paper introduces ACTLLM (Action Consistency Tuned Large Language Model),
a novel approach for robot manipulation in dynamic environments. Traditional

in both task execution and spatial reasoning, thereby limiting their
adaptability in dynamic environments. ACTLLM addresses these challenges by
harnessing language to craft structured scene descriptors, providing a uniform
interface for both spatial understanding and task performance through flexible
language instructions. Moreover, we introduce a novel action consistency
constraint that aligns visual perception with corresponding actions, thereby
enhancing the learning of actionable visual representations. Additionally, we
have reformulated the Markov decision process for manipulation tasks into a
multi-turn visual dialogue framework. This approach enables the modeling of
long-term task execution with enhanced contextual relevance derived from the

Method: The paper introduces an ADRC trajectory tracking controller and validates its effectiveness through simulations and real-world field tests.

Result: The ADRC controller reduces cross-track error compared to a PID controller but increases energy consumption, especially during sea trials.

Conclusion: ADRC improves tracking performance for USVs under disturbances, but its higher energy consumption may limit applicability in certain contexts.

Abstract: Unmanned Surface Vessels (USVs) face significant control challenges due to
uncertain environmental disturbances like waves and currents. This paper
proposes a trajectory tracking controller based on Active Disturbance Rejection
Control (ADRC) implemented on the DUS V2500. A custom simulation incorporating

controller's performance, supported by further validation through field tests
in the harbour of Scheveningen, the Netherlands, and at sea. Simulation results
demonstrate that ADRC significantly reduces cross-track error across all tested

Result: The system successfully estimates road roughness in real-time and integrates with a control system to enhance vehicle safety, demonstrated through experiments on variable surface conditions.

Conclusion: This Bayesian framework provides a robust solution to mitigate risks from rough road surfaces in autonomous vehicles, improving both safety and efficiency.

Abstract: This research addresses critical autonomous vehicle control challenges
arising from road roughness variation, which induces course deviations and
potential loss of road contact during steering operations. We present a novel
real-time road roughness estimation system employing Bayesian calibration
methodology that processes axle accelerations to predict terrain roughness with
quantifiable confidence measures. The technical framework integrates a Gaussian
process surrogate model with a simulated half-vehicle model, systematically
processing vehicle velocity and road surface roughness parameters to generate
corresponding axle acceleration responses. The Bayesian calibration routine
performs inverse estimation of road roughness from observed accelerations and
velocities, yielding posterior distributions that quantify prediction
uncertainty for adaptive risk management. Training data generation utilizes
Latin Hypercube sampling across comprehensive velocity and roughness parameter
spaces, while the calibrated model integrates seamlessly with a Simplex
controller architecture to dynamically adjust velocity limits based on
real-time roughness predictions. Experimental validation on stochastically
generated surfaces featuring varying roughness regions demonstrates robust

Vision-Language-Action (VLA) model and world model in one single framework. The
world model predicts future images by leveraging both action and image
understanding, with the purpose of learning the underlying physics of the
environment to improve action generation. Meanwhile, the action model generates
the subsequent actions based on image observations, aiding in visual
understanding and in turn helps visual generation of the world model. We
demonstrate that WorldVLA outperforms standalone action and world models,
highlighting the mutual enhancement between the world model and the action
model. In addition, we find that the performance of the action model
deteriorates when generating sequences of actions in an autoregressive manner.
This phenomenon can be attributed to the model's limited generalization
capability for action prediction, leading to the propagation of errors from
earlier actions to subsequent ones. To address this issue, we propose an
attention mask strategy that selectively masks prior actions during the
generation of the current action, which shows significant performance
improvement in the action chunk generation task.

*Srikar Reddy Gadusu,Larry Callahan,Samir Lababidi,Arunasri Nishtala,Sophia Healey,Hande McGinty*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper introduces a Python-based method for integrating Neo4j databases with OWL, enabling more accessible ontology creation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Ontology generation is crucial as data volumes grow, but challenges like integrating Neo4j databases with OWL make it necessary to develop user-friendly methodologies.

Method: The authors propose using Python and its rdflib library to simplify ontology creation by automatically generating classes and axioms from Neo4j database data.

Result: They demonstrate the approach with a Neo4j database populated using FDA's FAERS, showcasing smooth integration and ontology creation tailored for adverse drug event datasets.

Conclusion: This method facilitates easier ontology generation, addressing challenges in drug safety monitoring and public health through streamlined database-to-ontology workflows.

Abstract: As data and knowledge expand rapidly, adopting systematic methodologies for
ontology generation has become crucial. With the daily increases in data
volumes and frequent content changes, the demand for databases to store and
retrieve information for the creation of knowledge graphs has become
increasingly urgent. The previously established Knowledge Acquisition and
Representation Methodology (KNARM) outlines a systematic approach to address
these challenges and create knowledge graphs. However, following this
methodology highlights the existing challenge of seamlessly integrating Neo4j
databases with the Web Ontology Language (OWL). Previous attempts to integrate
data from Neo4j into an ontology have been discussed, but these approaches
often require an understanding of description logics (DL) syntax, which may not
be familiar to many users. Thus, a more accessible method is necessary to
bridge this gap. This paper presents a user-friendly approach that utilizes
Python and its rdflib library to support ontology development. We showcase our
novel approach through a Neo4j database we created by integrating data from the
Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS)
database. Using this dataset, we developed a Python script that automatically
generates the required classes and their axioms, facilitating a smoother
integration process. This approach offers a practical solution to the
challenges of ontology generation in the context of rapidly growing adverse
drug event datasets, supporting improved drug safety monitoring and public
health decision-making.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper reports empirical studies on domain-specific Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems in real-world use cases, focusing on their evaluation and lessons learned.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of empirical research on the practical implementation, evaluation, and challenges of RAG systems in diverse real-world scenarios.

Method: The paper presents five RAG-based systems incorporating features like multilingual OCR, vector-embedding semantic retrieval, domain-adapted LLMs, and user evaluations via six criteria with 100 participants.

Result: The evaluation highlighted user feedback on six dimensions, and the authors compiled twelve lessons learned regarding technical, operational, and ethical challenges in implementing RAG systems.

Conclusion: RAG systems are promising but face practical challenges; the paper provides insights into improving their reliability and usability based on both development and user feedback.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems are emerging as a key approach
for grounding Large Language Models (LLMs) in external knowledge, addressing
limitations in factual accuracy and contextual relevance. However, there is a
lack of empirical studies that report on the development of RAG-based
implementations grounded in real-world use cases, evaluated through general
user involvement, and accompanied by systematic documentation of lessons
learned. This paper presents five domain-specific RAG applications developed
for real-world scenarios across governance, cybersecurity, agriculture,
industrial research, and medical diagnostics. Each system incorporates
multilingual OCR, semantic retrieval via vector embeddings, and domain-adapted
LLMs, deployed through local servers or cloud APIs to meet distinct user needs.
A web-based evaluation involving a total of 100 participants assessed the
systems across six dimensions: (i) Ease of Use, (ii) Relevance, (iii)
Transparency, (iv) Responsiveness, (v) Accuracy, and (vi) Likelihood of
Recommendation. Based on user feedback and our development experience, we
documented twelve key lessons learned, highlighting technical, operational, and
ethical challenges affecting the reliability and usability of RAG systems in
practice.

### [283] [Complex Model Transformations by Reinforcement Learning with Uncertain Human Guidance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20883)
*Kyanna Dagenais,Istvan David*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper presents a reinforcement learning-based framework for improving complex model transformations (MTs) with uncertain human guidance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the difficulties and errors in manually developing complex model transformation sequences, commonly needed for tasks like model synchronization and design space exploration.

Method: The authors propose a technical framework that maps user-defined MTs onto RL primitives, incorporating uncertain human advice to improve RL-driven exploration of optimal MT sequences.

Result: The evaluation demonstrates that uncertain human guidance significantly enhances RL's performance and efficiency in handling complex MT problems.

Conclusion: The study indicates that human-in-the-loop RL can provide an effective way to improve the development of intricate MTs, balancing between the certainty and timeliness of human input.

Abstract: Model-driven engineering problems often require complex model transformations
(MTs), i.e., MTs that are chained in extensive sequences. Pertinent examples of
such problems include model synchronization, automated model repair, and design
space exploration. Manually developing complex MTs is an error-prone and often
infeasible process. Reinforcement learning (RL) is an apt way to alleviate
these issues. In RL, an autonomous agent explores the state space through trial
and error to identify beneficial sequences of actions, such as MTs. However, RL
methods exhibit performance issues in complex problems. In these situations,
human guidance can be of high utility. In this paper, we present an approach
and technical framework for developing complex MT sequences through RL, guided
by potentially uncertain human advice. Our framework allows user-defined MTs to
be mapped onto RL primitives, and executes them as RL programs to find optimal
MT sequences. Our evaluation shows that human guidance, even if uncertain,
substantially improves RL performance, and results in more efficient
development of complex MTs. Through a trade-off between the certainty and
timeliness of human advice, our method takes a step towards RL-driven
human-in-the-loop engineering methods.

### [284] [Boosting Vulnerability Detection with Inter-function Multilateral Association Insights](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21014)
*Shaojian Qiu,Mengyang Huang,Jiahao Cheng*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper introduces IFMA-VD, a framework for vulnerability detection that captures multilateral inter-function associations through a code behavior hypergraph and hypergraph networks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current deep learning-based vulnerability detection methods often neglect complex inter-function relationships, particularly multilateral associations, leading to missed vulnerabilities.

Method: The proposed framework constructs a code behavior hypergraph using program dependency graphs and extracts features through hyperedge convolution. A hypergraph network is then used to enhance vulnerability detection.

Result: Experiments on three vulnerability datasets show that IFMA-VD improves F-measure and Recall. The effectiveness of multilateral association features is also validated on real-world datasets.

Conclusion: IFMA-VD effectively addresses limitations of existing methods by leveraging multilateral associations, thus enhancing the detection capabilities of vulnerabilities in software systems.

Abstract: Vulnerability detection is a crucial yet challenging technique for ensuring
the security of software systems. Currently, most deep learning-based
vulnerability detection methods focus on stand-alone functions, neglecting the
complex inter-function interrelations, particularly the multilateral
associations. This oversight can fail to detect vulnerabilities in these
interrelations. To address this gap, we present an Inter-Function Multilateral
Association analysis framework for Vulnerability Detection (IFMA-VD). The
cornerstone of the IFMA-VD lies in constructing a code behavior hypergraph and
utilizing hyperedge convolution to extract multilateral association features.
Specifically, we first parse functions into a code property graph to generate
intra-function features. Following this, we construct a code behavior
hypergraph by segmenting the program dependency graph to isolate and encode
behavioral features into hyperedges. Finally, we utilize a hypergraph network
to capture the multilateral association knowledge for augmenting vulnerability
detection. We evaluate IFMA-VD on three widely used vulnerability datasets and
demonstrate improvements in F-measure and Recall compared to baseline methods.
Additionally, we illustrate that multilateral association features can boost
code feature representation and validate the effectiveness of IFMA-VD on
real-world datasets.

### [285] [How Good Are Synthetic Requirements ? Evaluating LLM-Generated Datasets for AI4RE](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21138)
*Abdelkarim El-Hajjami,Camille Salinesi*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The study introduces Synthline v1, a synthetic data generation method for AI in requirements engineering. It evaluates techniques like prompting, optimization, and curation, showing that synthetic data can surpass human-authored for certain tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of publicly available, labeled requirements datasets, a major bottleneck preventing progress in Artificial Intelligence for Requirements Engineering (AI4RE).

Method: Synthline v1 incorporates advanced generation strategies, including multi-sample prompting, automated prompt optimization (e.g., PACE), and post-generation curation. These techniques are applied to evaluate data quality for key classification tasks.

Result: Multi-sample prompting significantly enhances diversity and utility, PACE delivers mixed results depending on the classification task, and synthetic requirements data outperforms human-authored data in specific areas (+7.8 points for security and +15.4 points for defect classification).

Conclusion: Synthline v1 demonstrates the potential for synthetic data to alleviate dataset scarcity in requirements engineering, offering methods for improving and controlling generated data quality to advance AI4RE applications.

Abstract: The shortage of publicly available, labeled requirements datasets remains a
major barrier to advancing Artificial Intelligence for Requirements Engineering
(AI4RE). While Large Language Models offer promising capabilities for synthetic
data generation, systematic approaches to control and optimize the quality of
generated requirements remain underexplored. This paper presents Synthline v1,
an enhanced Product Line approach for generating synthetic requirements data
that extends our earlier v0 version with advanced generation strategies and
curation techniques. We investigate four research questions assessing how
prompting strategies, automated prompt optimization, and post-generation
curation affect data quality across four classification tasks: defect
detection, functional vs. non-functional, quality vs. non-quality, and security
vs. non-security. Our evaluation shows that multi-sample prompting
significantly boosts both utility and diversity over single-sample generation,
with F1-score gains from 6 to 44 points. The use of PACE (Prompt Actor-Critic
Editing) for automated prompt optimization yields task-dependent results,
greatly improving functional classification (+32.5 points) but reducing
performance on others. Interestingly, similarity-based curation improves
diversity but often harms classification performance, indicating that some
redundancy may help ML models. Most importantly, our results show that
synthetic requirements can match or outperform human-authored ones for specific
tasks, with synthetic data surpassing human data for security (+7.8 points) and
defect classification (+15.4 points). These findings offer practical insights
for AI4RE and chart a viable path to mitigating dataset scarcity through
systematic synthetic generation.

*Quanming Liu,Xupeng Bu,Zhichao Yan,Ru Li*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper explores improving Automatic Program Repair (APR) using Large Language Models (LLMs) and Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning techniques, proposing a new framework called $T^3$.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the limitations of applying Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning techniques in APR due to the multi-step reasoning and complex logic required, despite advancements in LLMs.

Method: The paper systematically evaluates existing CoT techniques for APR tasks and introduces $T^3$, a framework that integrates LLMs with tree search for better candidate repair generation.

Result: $T^3$ improves the precision of generating repair solutions and provides strategies for optimizing sample selection and repair approaches.

Conclusion: The proposed $T^3$ framework enhances the efficiency of automated debugging and highlights pathways for better APR methodologies by combining advanced reasoning of LLMs with tree search.

Abstract: Automatic Program Repair (APR) is a core technology in software development
and maintenance, with aims to enable automated defect repair with minimal human
intervention. In recent years, the substantial advancements in Large Language
Models (LLMs) and the Chain-of-Thought (CoT) techniques have significantly
enhanced the reasoning capabilities of these models. However, due to the
complex logic and multi-step reasoning ability needed, the application of CoT
techniques in the APR domain remains insufficient. This study systematically
evaluates the performance of several common CoT techniques in APR tasks and
proposes an innovative framework $T^3$, which integrates the powerful reasoning
capabilities of LLMs with tree search, effectively improving the precision of
generating candidate repair solutions. Furthermore, $T^3$ provides valuable
guidance for optimizing sample selection and repair strategies in APR tasks,
establishing a robust framework for achieving efficient automated debugging.

*Daniil Karol,Elizaveta Artser,Ilya Vlasov,Yaroslav Golubev,Hieke Keuning,Anastasiia Birillo*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: KOALA is a configurable tool for gathering data on students’ programming in JetBrains IDEs, enhancing data granularity and tracking IDE behaviors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations in existing tools for collecting detailed data about students' usage of programming features and performance within integrated development environments (IDEs).

Method: KOALA is a plugin for JetBrains IDEs that collects granular code snapshots, IDE actions, and user behaviors like hotkeys and focus switching. The data are stored on a server and converted into a standardized format.

Result: The authors demonstrated KOALA by gathering data from 28 students across two different courses, uncovering insights into their programming styles and behaviors.

Conclusion: KOALA overcomes the configuration and data limitations of prior tools, making it a useful resource for studying students' programming processes in educational contexts.

Abstract: Collecting data of students solving programming tasks is incredibly valuable
for researchers and educators. It allows verifying that the students correctly
apply the features and concepts they are taught, or finding students'
misconceptions. However, existing data collection tools have limitations, e.g.,
no control over the granularity of the collected code, not collecting the
specific events of the programming environment used, and overall being hard to
configure.
  To overcome these limitations, we propose KOALA, a convenient and highly
configurable tool for collecting code snapshots and feature usage from students
solving programming tasks in JetBrains IDEs. The plugin can be installed in
IDEs and configured to provide the students with the necessary tasks, enable or
disable certain IDE features like code completion, and run surveys. During
problem solving, the plugin collects code snapshots at the configured
granularity, all IDE actions like running and debugging, as well as some data
not collected in prior works, like employed hotkeys and switching focus between
files. The collected data is sent to the server that comes with the tool, where
it is stored and can be converted to the standardized ProgSnap2 format. To
showcase the tool, we collected data from 28 students solving tasks in two
courses within the IDE, highlighting some insights from this data.

*Ricardo Hideki Hangai Kojo,Luiz Fernando Corte Real,Renato Cordeiro Ferreira,Thatiane de Oliveira Rosa,Alfredo Goldman*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper evaluates the adoption of micro frontends architecture in an industry setting, analyzing its success and comparing it to alternatives.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the suitability and advantages of adopting micro frontends in industry contexts, particularly in resolving architectural and technology challenges.

Method: The authors studied micro frontends through academic and gray literature, implemented the architecture in a marketplace, and analyzed its efficacy via a semi-open developer questionnaire.

Result: Micro frontends architecture successfully resolved certain issues in the marketplace company but was not necessary for achieving goals, as alternatives like monolithic frontends could produce comparable outcomes.

Conclusion: Micro frontends were chosen largely due to compatibility with an existing microservices framework and team expertise, emphasizing context-specific decision-making rather than absolute suitability of the architecture.

Abstract: In the micro frontends architectural style, the frontend is divided into
smaller components, which can range from a simple button to an entire page. The
goal is to improve scalability, resilience, and team independence, albeit at
the cost of increased complexity and infrastructure demands. This paper seeks
to understand when it is worth adopting micro frontends, particularly in the
context of industry. To achieve this, we conducted an investigation into the
state of the art of micro frontends, based on both academic and gray
literature. We then implemented this architectural style in a marketplace for
handcrafted products, which already used microservices. Finally, we evaluated
the implementation through a semi-open questionnaire with the developers. At
the studied marketplace company, the need for architectural change arose due to
the tight coupling between their main system (a Java monolith) and a dedicated
frontend system. Additionally, there were deprecated technologies and poor
developer experience. To address these issues, the micro frontends architecture
was adopted, along with the API Gateway and Backend for Frontend patterns, and
technologies such as Svelte and Fastify. Although the adoption of Micro
Frontends was successful, it was not strictly necessary to meet the company's
needs. According to the analysis of the mixed questionnaire responses, other
alternatives, such as a monolithic frontend, could have achieved comparable
results. What made adopting micro frontends the most convenient choice in the
company's context was the monolith strangulation and microservices adoption,
which facilitated implementation through infrastructure reuse and knowledge
sharing between teams.

TL;DR: This paper introduces a core model consolidating features of existing IoT and process data models to facilitate integration and collaboration in process mining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the fragmentation in existing IoT and process data models, which hinders data sharing, integration, and collaboration in process mining research and applications.

Method: A core data model is synthesized based on common requirements of existing IoT and process data integration models, with a Python-based implementation used for evaluation against various use cases.

Result: The core model consolidates essential features of existing models, demonstrating compatibility with multiple use cases and meeting common requirements in process mining.

Conclusion: The proposed core model streamlines data exchange and collaboration, aiding in the effective integration of IoT and process data for process mining applications.

Abstract: Advances in Internet-of-Things (IoT) technologies have prompted the
integration of IoT devices with business processes (BPs) in many organizations
across various sectors, such as manufacturing, healthcare and smart spaces. The
proliferation of IoT devices leads to the generation of large amounts of IoT
data providing a window on the physical context of BPs, which facilitates the
discovery of new insights about BPs using process mining (PM) techniques.
However, to achieve these benefits, IoT data need to be combined with
traditional process (event) data, which is challenging due to the very
different characteristics of IoT and process data, for instance in terms of
granularity levels. Recently, several data models were proposed to integrate
IoT data with process data, each focusing on different aspects of data
integration based on different assumptions and requirements. This fragmentation
hampers data exchange and collaboration in the field of PM, e.g., making it
tedious for researchers to share data. In this paper, we present a core model
synthesizing the most important features of existing data models. As the core
model is based on common requirements, it greatly facilitates data sharing and
collaboration in the field. A prototypical Python implementation is used to
evaluate the model against various use cases and demonstrate that it satisfies
these common requirements.

*Saar Draznin Shiran,Boris Boltyansky,Alexandra Zhuravleva,Dmitry Scherbakov,Pavel Goldstein*

Main category: q-bio.NC

TL;DR: The study used natural language processing (NLP) to analyze chronic pain patients' narratives and predict their readiness for psychosocial treatment with high accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Chronic pain affects 20% of the global population. The reliance on a biomedical approach has fueled issues like the opioid crisis, while the biopsychosocial model is underutilized due to low uptake of psychosocial interventions.

Method: Twenty-four chronic pain patients provided spoken narratives about their pain. These were processed using a large-language model and machine-learning classifiers to predict readiness for psychotherapy.

Result: The study achieved high prediction accuracy: 95.7% for the perception domain and 83.3% for factors influencing pain. Sentence count also positively correlated with treatment readiness.

Conclusion: NLP analysis of pain narratives can reliably predict willingness for psychosocial care, aiding personalized treatment pathways and improving uptake of biopsychosocial interventions.

Abstract: Background. Chronic pain afflicts 20 % of the global population. A strictly
biomedical mind-set leaves many sufferers chasing somatic cures and has fuelled
the opioid crisis. The biopsychosocial model recognises pain subjective,
multifactorial nature, yet uptake of psychosocial care remains low. We
hypothesised that patients own pain narratives would predict their readiness to
engage in psychotherapy.
  Methods. In a cross-sectional pilot, 24 chronic-pain patients recorded
narrated pain stories on Painstory.science. Open questions probed perceived
pain source, interference and influencing factors. Narratives were cleaned,
embedded with a pretrained large-language model and entered into
machine-learning classifiers that output ready/not ready probabilities.
  Results. The perception-domain model achieved 95.7 % accuracy (specificity =
0.80, sensitivity = 1.00, AUC = 0.90). The factors-influencing-pain model
yielded 83.3 % accuracy (specificity = 0.60, sensitivity = 0.90, AUC = 0.75).
Sentence count correlated with readiness for perception narratives (r = 0.54, p
< .01) and factor narratives (r = 0.24, p < .05).
  Conclusion. Brief spoken pain narratives carry reliable signals of
willingness to start psychosocial treatment. NLP-based screening could help
clinicians match chronic-pain patients to appropriate interventions sooner,
supporting a patient-centred biopsychosocial pathway.

Main category: q-bio.NC

TL;DR: The study investigates procrastination as arising from competing motivations, using brain stimulation to confirm the value-driven mechanism and showing its long-term effects on reducing real-world procrastination.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Procrastination affects health and productivity, yet its neurocognitive mechanisms are poorly understood. The researchers aimed to address gaps in theoretical validation and intervention efficacy.

Method: A preregistered, double-blind, randomized controlled trial applied seven sessions of high-definition transcranial direct current stimulation (HD-tDCS) to the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex in chronic procrastinators. Intensive experience sampling method assessed short-term and long-term effects on procrastination.

Result: HD-tDCS reduced procrastination with sustained effects after a 6-month follow-up. Task outcome valuation was identified as the key mechanism driving behavioral improvement, not changes in task aversiveness.

Conclusion: The findings provide evidence that enhancing DLPFC activity mitigates procrastination by amplifying future reward value, establishing a value-driven pathway for self-control and offering a validated intervention strategy.

Abstract: Procrastination represents one of the most prevalent behavioral problems
affecting individual health and societal productivity. Although it is often
conceptualized as a form of self-control failure, its underlying neurocognitive
mechanisms are poorly understood. A leading model posits that procrastination
arises from imbalanced competing motivations: the avoidance of negative task
aversiveness and the pursuit of positive task outcomes, yet this theoretical
framework has not fully validated in real-world settings and not applied
effectively to guide interventions. Here, we addressed this gap with a
preregistered, double-blind, randomized controlled trial. We applied seven
sessions of high-definition transcranial direct current stimulation (HD-tDCS)
to the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), a key region for
self-control, in chronic procrastinators. Using the intensive experience
sampling method (iESM), we assessed the effect of anodal HD-tDCS on real-world
procrastination behavior at offline after-effect (2-day interval) and long-term
retention (6-month follow-up). We found that this neuromodulation produced a
lasting reduction in real-world procrastination, with effects sustained at a
6-month follow-up. While the intervention both decreased task aversiveness and
increased perceived task outcome value, causal mediation analysis revealed a
striking mechanism: the increase in task outcome value uniquely and
sufficiently mediated the entire behavioral improvement. In conclusion, these
findings provide causal evidence that enhancing DLPFC function mitigates
procrastination by selectively amplifying the valuation of future rewards, not
by simply reducing negative feelings about the task. This establishes a
precise, value-driven neurocognitive pathway for self-control and offers a
validated, theory-driven strategy for intervention.

TL;DR: This paper introduces a method called 'anonymized personalization' to create virtual brain twins, enabling personalized and lightweight neuroimaging model inference without compromising data privacy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to overcome limitations in creating virtual brain twins: current models rely on shared infrastructure unsuitable for personal data, and clinical applications need efficient and resource-light inference methods.

Method: The proposed method, 'anonymized personalization,' expands model priors to include individualization. It enables anonymous training via amortized inference while allowing personalized and lightweight predictions during inference.

Result: The approach has shown reliability through demonstration on an example and emphasizes its potential applicability in experimental and computational neuroscience.

Conclusion: The method successfully addresses privacy and resource challenges in training and applying virtual brain twins, advancing their utility in neuroscience applications. The code for implementation is openly shared.

Abstract: Virtual brain twins are personalized digital models of individual human
subject or patient's brains, allowing for mechanistic interpretation of
neuroimaging data features. Training and inference with these models however
presents a pair of challenges: large shared infrastructure do not allow for use
of personal data and inference in clinical applications should not require
significant resources. We introduce "anonymized personalization" to address
both by expanding model priors to include personalization which under amortized
inference allows training to be performed anonymously, while inference is both
personalized and lightweight. We illustrate the basic approach, demonstrate
reliability in an example, and discuss the impact on both experimental and
computational neuroscience. Code is available at

### [293] [Wirelessly transmitted subthalamic nucleus signals predict endogenous pain levels in Parkinson's disease patients](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21439)
*Abdi Reza,Takufumi Yanagisawa,Naoki Tani,Ryohei Fukuma,Takuto Emura,Satoru Oshino,Ben Seymour,Haruhiko Kishima*

Main category: q-bio.NC

TL;DR: This study investigates how subthalamic nucleus (STN) activity relates to pain fluctuations in Parkinson’s Disease (PD) patients using explainable machine learning and wireless STN signal monitoring.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The research aims to address the limited understanding of how bilateral STN activity contributes to pain fluctuations in PD, a factor heavily impacting patients' quality of life.

Method: Researchers collected wireless STN signal data alongside binary pain ratings during annotated pain episodes and used explainable machine learning algorithms to analyze the influence of STN activities on pain levels.

Result: The study revealed that both contralateral and ipsilateral STN activities significantly influence pain prediction, with contralateral gamma and beta bands and ipsilateral delta and theta bands playing key roles.

Conclusion: Bilateral STN biomarkers demonstrate a prominent role in endogenous pain fluctuation, providing insights into pain mechanisms in PD and potential for advanced therapeutic approaches.

Abstract: Parkinson disease (PD) patients experience pain fluctuations that
significantly reduce their quality of life. Despite the vast knowledge of the
subthalamic nucleus (STN) role in PD, the STN biomarkers for pain fluctuations
and the relationship between bilateral subthalamic nucleus (STN) activities and
pain occurrence are still less understood. This observational study used
data-driven methods by collecting annotated pain followed by a series of
corresponding binary pain ratings and wirelessly transmitted STN signals, then
leveraging the explainable machine learning algorithm to predict binary pain
levels and sort the feature influence. The binary pain levels could be
predicted among annotated pain reports corresponding to PD-related pain
characteristics. The STN activity from both sides could impact pain prediction,
with gamma and beta bands in the contralateral STN and delta and theta bands in
the ipsilateral STN showing a prominent role. This study emphasizes the role of
bilateral STN biomarkers on endogenous pain fluctuations.

### [294] [The assumptions that restrain us from understanding consciousness](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21485)
*Jaan Aru*

Main category: q-bio.NC

TL;DR: The paper critiques current assumptions in consciousness research, suggesting a need for fresh perspectives and deeper investigations into neural correlates, computational models, and internal conscious experiences.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To challenge foundational assumptions in the science of consciousness and encourage a broader exploration of its complexities.

Method: The author critiques current theoretical assumptions and explores alternative questions and perspectives for advancing consciousness research, emphasizing neural correlates, computations, and internal experiences.

Result: The paper highlights the limitations of existing theories, suggesting that computational models of consciousness might be oversimplified and that consciousness is more complex than traditionally thought.

Conclusion: A new theoretical framework and broader investigative approaches are necessary for advancing the science of consciousness.

Abstract: The science of consciousness has been successful over the last decades. Yet,
it seems that some of the key questions remain unanswered. Perhaps, as a
science of consciousness, we cannot move forward using the same theoretical
commitments that brought us here. It might be necessary to revise some
assumptions we have made along the way. In this piece, I offer no answers, but
I will question some of these fundamental assumptions. We will try to take a
fresh look at the classical question about the neural and explanatory
correlates of consciousness. A key assumption is that neural correlates are to
be found at the level of spiking responses. However, perhaps we should not
simply take it for granted that this assumption holds true. Another common
assumption is that we are close to understanding the computations underlying
consciousness. I will try to show that computations related to consciousness
might be far more complex than our current theories envision. There is little
reason to think that consciousness is an abstract computation, as traditionally
believed. Furthermore, I will try to demonstrate that consciousness research
could benefit from investigating internal changes of consciousness, such as
aha-moments. Finally, I will ask which theories the science of consciousness
really needs.

TL;DR: The paper tackles quasi-copula problems by providing a complete solution to Open Problem 5 using an analytical approach.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Quasi-copula problems, highlighted in the "Hitchhiker's Guide", gained attention in dependence modeling despite the lack of statistical interpretations. The authors aim to address a key problem identified in this guide.

Method: Initially, the authors employed a linear programming approach to advance solutions to Open Problem 5. In this paper, they use an analytical method for a comprehensive resolution.

Result: They solved Open Problem 5 up to dimension 17 and disproved a recent conjecture regarding it.

Conclusion: By leveraging an analytical approach, the authors provide a definitive answer to a significant quasi-copula question, furthering research in this domain.

Abstract: A recent survey, nicknamed "Hitchhiker's Guide", J.J. Arias-Garc{\i}a, R.
Mesiar, and B. De Baets, A hitchhiker's guide to quasi-copulas, Fuzzy Sets and
Systems 393 (2020) 1-28, has raised the rating of quasi-copula problems in the
dependence modeling community in spite of the lack of statistical
interpretation of quasi-copulas. In our previous work (arXiv:2410.19339,
accepted in Fuzzy Sets and Systems), we addressed the question of extreme
values of the mass distribution associated with multivariate quasi-copulas.
Using a linear programming approach, we were able to solve Open Problem 5 of
the "Guide" up to dimension d = 17 and disprove a recent conjecture on the
solution to that problem. In this paper, we use an analytical approach to
provide a complete answer to the original question.

### [296] [Stable Minima of ReLU Neural Networks Suffer from the Curse of Dimensionality: The Neural Shattering Phenomenon](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20779)
*Tongtong Liang,Dan Qiao,Yu-Xiang Wang,Rahul Parhi*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper explores how the implicit bias of flatness (low loss curvature) affects generalization in overparameterized ReLU networks for multivariate inputs and shows that this bias leads to poor performance in high dimensions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study is motivated by observed phenomena like minima stability and edge-of-stability during gradient descent training, with a focus on understanding how flatness influences generalization in multivariate input settings.

Method: The authors theoretically analyze flat solutions in two settings: generalization gap and MSE in nonparametric function estimation. They establish upper and lower bounds and use a novel packing argument with boundary-localized ReLU neurons to explain the deterioration in high-dimensional scenarios. They also validate their findings numerically.

Result: The findings reveal an exponential deterioration in generalization rates of flat solutions with increasing input dimension. These solutions perform worse compared to low-norm solutions, which are not affected by the curse of dimensionality.

Conclusion: The analysis demonstrates that while flat minima are generally believed to improve generalization, this advantage fails in high-dimensional settings, offering a systematic explanation for the limitations of flat solutions in such scenarios.

Abstract: We study the implicit bias of flatness / low (loss) curvature and its effects
on generalization in two-layer overparameterized ReLU networks with
multivariate inputs -- a problem well motivated by the minima stability and
edge-of-stability phenomena in gradient-descent training. Existing work either
requires interpolation or focuses only on univariate inputs. This paper
presents new and somewhat surprising theoretical results for multivariate
inputs. On two natural settings (1) generalization gap for flat solutions, and
(2) mean-squared error (MSE) in nonparametric function estimation by stable
minima, we prove upper and lower bounds, which establish that while flatness
does imply generalization, the resulting rates of convergence necessarily
deteriorate exponentially as the input dimension grows. This gives an
exponential separation between the flat solutions vis-\`a-vis low-norm
solutions (i.e., weight decay), which knowingly do not suffer from the curse of
dimensionality. In particular, our minimax lower bound construction, based on a
novel packing argument with boundary-localized ReLU neurons, reveals how flat
solutions can exploit a kind of ''neural shattering'' where neurons rarely
activate, but with high weight magnitudes. This leads to poor performance in
high dimensions. We corroborate these theoretical findings with extensive
numerical simulations. To the best of our knowledge, our analysis provides the
first systematic explanation for why flat minima may fail to generalize in high
dimensions.

Motivation: To address the challenge of improving prediction accuracy and computational efficiency in high-dimensional data using Gaussian Process regression.

Method: Jointly optimize a neural network for dimensionality reduction and a Gaussian Process regressor in latent space, guided by an active learning criterion minimizing global prediction error.

Result: Experiments on synthetic data show superior performance over random sequential learning, effectively handling complex, discontinuous functions.

Conclusion: The framework proves efficient and accurate for high-dimensional regression tasks with potential future improvements like better scalability and uncertainty-aware manifold learning.

Abstract: This paper introduces an active learning framework for manifold Gaussian
Process (GP) regression, combining manifold learning with strategic data

### [298] [Lower Bounds on the Size of Markov Equivalence Classes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20933)
*Erik Jahn,Frederick Eberhardt,Leonard J. Schulman*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: Markov equivalence classes, crucial in causal discovery, expand significantly when assumptions like acyclicity and causal sufficiency are relaxed.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate the impact of relaxing standard assumptions on the size of Markov equivalence classes in causal discovery.

Method: The study employs mathematical proofs to establish lower bounds for the size of Markov equivalence classes across various causal graph settings.

Result: The authors demonstrate that under relaxed assumptions, the expected size of Markov equivalence classes can grow exponentially in sparse random DAGs, random ADMGs, and random directed cyclic graphs.

Conclusion: Standard causal assumptions like acyclicity are critical, as relaxing them greatly increases the uncertainty in causal discovery due to larger equivalence classes.

Abstract: Causal discovery algorithms typically recover causal graphs only up to their
Markov equivalence classes unless additional parametric assumptions are made.
The sizes of these equivalence classes reflect the limits of what can be
learned about the underlying causal graph from purely observational data. Under
the assumptions of acyclicity, causal sufficiency, and a uniform model prior,
Markov equivalence classes are known to be small on average. In this paper, we
show that this is no longer the case when any of these assumptions is relaxed.
Specifically, we prove exponentially large lower bounds for the expected size
of Markov equivalence classes in three settings: sparse random directed acyclic
graphs, uniformly random acyclic directed mixed graphs, and uniformly random
directed cyclic graphs.

*Hsin-Hsiung Huang,Hayden Hampton*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper introduces STFT-VNNGP, a hybrid model for forecasting geopolitical conflicts using sparse and bursty event data, outperforming standard models like the TFT in long-term predictions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of standard models like TFT in handling sparse, bursty, and overdispersed data for forecasting geopolitical conflicts.

Method: STFT-VNNGP uses a two-stage hybrid architecture: TFT for complex temporal multiquantile forecasts and VNNGP for spatiotemporal smoothing and uncertainty quantification.

Result: The STFT-VNNGP model outperforms standalone TFT in predicting bursty events, especially for long-range forecasts, as demonstrated in case studies involving the Middle East and the U.S.

Conclusion: The proposed model provides a reliable framework for better intelligence on geopolitical events and ensures reproducibility by openly sharing code and workflows.

Abstract: Forecasting geopolitical conflict from data sources like the Global Database
of Events, Language, and Tone (GDELT) is a critical challenge for national
security. The inherent sparsity, burstiness, and overdispersion of such data
cause standard deep learning models, including the Temporal Fusion Transformer
(TFT), to produce unreliable long-horizon predictions. We introduce STFT-VNNGP,
a hybrid architecture that won the 2023 Algorithms for Threat Detection (ATD)
competition by overcoming these limitations. Designed to bridge this gap, our
model employs a two-stage process: first, a TFT captures complex temporal
dynamics to generate multi-quantile forecasts. These quantiles then serve as
informed inputs for a Variational Nearest Neighbor Gaussian Process (VNNGP),
which performs principled spatiotemporal smoothing and uncertainty
quantification. In a case study forecasting conflict dynamics in the Middle
East and the U.S., STFT-VNNGP consistently outperforms a standalone TFT,
showing a superior ability to predict the timing and magnitude of bursty event
periods, particularly at long-range horizons. This work offers a robust
framework for generating more reliable and actionable intelligence from
challenging event data, with all code and workflows made publicly available to
ensure reproducibility.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a scaled-down approach to simulate learning dynamics for multiple reinforcement learning agents in a finite-state Markov game by connecting their parameter updates to an ordinary differential equation (ODE).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the computational complexity and study the underlying dynamics of multi-agent reinforcement learning interactions in Markov games.

Method: Rescaled the learning dynamics with slower learning rates and higher update frequencies, proving convergence of this scaled process into an ODE.

Result: Demonstrated that the rescaled approach yields deterministic and tractable approximations of multi-agent learning processes under mild assumptions.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively simplifies and approximates multi-agent learning dynamics, offering a computational tool available through their implementation framework.

Abstract: This paper introduces a new approach for approximating the learning dynamics
of multiple reinforcement learning (RL) agents interacting in a finite-state
Markov game. The idea is to rescale the learning process by simultaneously
reducing the learning rate and increasing the update frequency, effectively
treating the agent's parameters as a slow-evolving variable influenced by the
fast-mixing game state. Under mild assumptions-ergodicity of the state process
and continuity of the updates-we prove the convergence of this rescaled process
to an ordinary differential equation (ODE). This ODE provides a tractable,
deterministic approximation of the agent's learning dynamics. An implementation

*Lukas Sablica,Kurt Hornik*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper introduces a new VAE architecture using the spCauchy distribution for better hyperspherical latent variable representation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations of Gaussian and von Mises-Fisher (vMF) distributions in hyperspherical representation and improve latent space expressiveness and stability.

Method: Adopts the spherical Cauchy (spCauchy) distribution for latent space, leveraging Möbius transformations for reparameterization and efficient KL divergence calculation.

Result: Improves training stability, computational efficiency, and representation expressiveness in high-dimensional generative modeling.

Conclusion: The spCauchy distribution offers a flexible, robust, and computationally efficient option for advancing VAE architectures, especially in hyperspherical domains.

Abstract: We propose a novel variational autoencoder (VAE) architecture that employs a
spherical Cauchy (spCauchy) latent distribution. Unlike traditional Gaussian
latent spaces or the widely used von Mises-Fisher (vMF) distribution, spCauchy
provides a more natural hyperspherical representation of latent variables,
better capturing directional data while maintaining flexibility. Its
heavy-tailed nature prevents over-regularization, ensuring efficient latent
space utilization while offering a more expressive representation.
Additionally, spCauchy circumvents the numerical instabilities inherent to vMF,
which arise from computing normalization constants involving Bessel functions.
Instead, it enables a fully differentiable and efficient reparameterization
trick via M\"obius transformations, allowing for stable and scalable training.
The KL divergence can be computed through a rapidly converging power series,
eliminating concerns of underflow or overflow associated with evaluation of
ratios of hypergeometric functions. These properties make spCauchy a compelling
alternative for VAEs, offering both theoretical advantages and practical
efficiency in high-dimensional generative modeling.

### [302] [Wild refitting for black box prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21460)
*Martin J. Wainwright*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper presents a computational method, called wild refitting, to calculate upper bounds on prediction error for penalized nonparametric estimates, requiring only one dataset and black-box access to the prediction method.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to efficiently compute high-probability bounds on instance-specific prediction error for nonparametric methods, addressing challenges in noisy and heterogenous data environments.

Method: The approach involves three steps: forming residuals, symmetrizing and scaling them using Rademacher residuals, and solving a modified prediction problem. It leverages concepts like wild bootstrap and theoretical guarantees.

Result: The authors establish under mild conditions that their method provides reliable upper bounds for prediction error, with detailed procedures for selecting noise parameters and residual construction.

Conclusion: The method is validated theoretically and applied to diverse problems such as structure-from-motion recovery, image restoration using deep neural networks, and kernel-based randomized sketching applications.

Abstract: We describe and analyze a computionally efficient refitting procedure for
computing high-probability upper bounds on the instance-wise mean-squared
prediction error of penalized nonparametric estimates based on least-squares
minimization. Requiring only a single dataset and black box access to the
prediction method, it consists of three steps: computing suitable residuals,
symmetrizing and scaling them with a pre-factor $\rho$, and using them to
define and solve a modified prediction problem recentered at the current
estimate. We refer to it as wild refitting, since it uses Rademacher residual
symmetrization as in a wild bootstrap variant. Under relatively mild conditions
allowing for noise heterogeneity, we establish a high probability guarantee on
its performance, showing that the wild refit with a suitably chosen wild noise
scale $\rho$ gives an upper bound on prediction error. This theoretical
analysis provides guidance into the design of such procedures, including how
the residuals should be formed, the amount of noise rescaling in the wild
sub-problem needed for upper bounds, and the local stability properties of the
block-box procedure. We illustrate the applicability of this procedure to
various problems, including non-rigid structure-from-motion recovery with
structured matrix penalties; plug-and-play image restoration with deep neural
network priors; and randomized sketching with kernel methods.

TL;DR: The paper develops Gaussian invariant sampling methods, improving efficiency and enabling variance reduction for high-dimensional targets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard sampling methods like RWM and MALA lack efficiency for certain types of distributions. The authors aim to enhance statistical efficiency and variance reduction by leveraging Gaussian invariance.

Method: They introduce modified versions of RWM, MALA, and second-order Hessian MALA that are Gaussian invariant. Exact analytical solutions to the Poisson equation for Gaussian targets enable the construction of effective control variates.

Result: Improved ergodic estimators and variance reduction are demonstrated. The samplers outperformed advanced methods in high-dimensional target problems in latent Gaussian models.

Conclusion: Gaussian invariant methods lead to more statistically efficient and theoretically robust estimators while performing exceptionally well in high-dimensional applications.

Abstract: We develop sampling methods, which consist of Gaussian invariant versions of
random walk Metropolis (RWM), Metropolis adjusted Langevin algorithm (MALA) and
second order Hessian or Manifold MALA. Unlike standard RWM and MALA we show
that Gaussian invariant sampling can lead to ergodic estimators with improved
statistical efficiency. This is due to a remarkable property of Gaussian
invariance that allows us to obtain exact analytical solutions to the Poisson
equation for Gaussian targets. These solutions can be used to construct
efficient and easy to use control variates for variance reduction of estimators
under any intractable target. We demonstrate the new samplers and estimators in
several examples, including high dimensional targets in latent Gaussian models
where we compare against several advanced methods and obtain state-of-the-art
results. We also provide theoretical results regarding geometric ergodicity,
and an optimal scaling analysis that shows the dependence of the optimal
acceptance rate on the Gaussianity of the target.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To establish a generalized framework for understanding the behavior and modeling capabilities of network automata beyond the traditional binary cellular automata like the Game of Life.

Method: The authors propose a topological generalization of cellular automata called "Life-like network automata," analyze their genotype (mean field curve and Derrida curve) and phenotype, and solve the firing squad synchronization problem as a case study.

Result: The proposed metrics for genotype and phenotype are shown to correlate and enable successful resolution of the firing squad synchronization problem with over a 90% success rate.

Conclusion: This framework provides a solid foundation for understanding and utilizing generalizations of cellular automata, demonstrating their practical utility in computational tasks like the firing squad problem.

Abstract: We present a strong theoretical foundation that frames a well-defined family
of outer-totalistic network automaton models as a topological generalisation of
binary outer-totalistic cellular automata, of which the Game of Life is one
notable particular case. These "Life-like network automata" are quantitatively
described by expressing their genotype (the mean field curve and Derrida curve)
and phenotype (the evolution of the state and defect averages). After
demonstrating that the genotype and phenotype are correlated, we illustrate the
utility of these essential metrics by tackling the firing squad synchronisation
problem in a bottom-up fashion, with results that exceed a 90% success rate.

TL;DR: This paper proposes an adaptive hybrid sorting paradigm that chooses the optimal sorting algorithm (Counting Sort, Radix Sort, or QuickSort) based on real-time data patterns and improves performance compared to static algorithms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Sorting efficiency is critical for large data systems and real-time/embedded systems, but no single algorithm is universally optimal for all data distributions.

Method: The system extracts key input characteristics (e.g., data volume, value range, entropy) and uses a Finite State Machine and XGBoost-based decision engine to select the best sorting algorithm adaptively.

Result: Experimental results on synthetic and real datasets demonstrate significant improvements in execution time, flexibility, and efficiency compared to traditional static sorting algorithms.

Conclusion: The proposed solution is scalable, high-performance, and applicable to tasks like big data analytics, edge computing, and resource-constrained environments.

Abstract: Sorting is an essential operation in computer science with direct
consequences on the performance of large scale data systems, real-time systems,
and embedded computation. However, no sorting algorithm is optimal under all
distributions of data. The new adaptive hybrid sorting paradigm proposed in
this paper is the paradigm that automatically selects the most effective
sorting algorithm Counting Sort, Radix Sort, or QuickSort based on real-time
monitoring of patterns in input data. The architecture begins by having a
feature extraction module to compute significant parameters such as data
volume, value range and entropy. These parameters are sent to a decision engine
involving Finite State Machine and XGBoost classifier to aid smart and
effective in choosing the optimal sorting strategy. It implements Counting Sort
on small key ranges, Radix Sort on large range structured input with
low-entropy keys and QuickSort on general purpose sorting. The experimental
findings of both synthetic and real life dataset confirm that the proposed
solution is actually inclined to excel significantly by comparison in execution
time, flexibility and the efficiency of conventional static sorting algorithms.
The proposed framework provides a scalable, high perhaps and applicable to a
wide range of data processing operations like big data analytics, edge
computing, and systems with hardware limitations.

*Ziyu Zheng,Yaming Yang,Ziyu Guan,Wei Zhao,Weigang Lu*

Main category: cs.SI

TL;DR: Heterophily in real-world networks has been studied less in heterogeneous graphs than homogeneous ones, with existing methods often failing to capture these patterns effectively. RASH, a new contrastive learning framework, addresses this by modeling heterogeneous interactions and separating homophilic and heterophilic patterns.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Heterogeneous graphs pose unique challenges due to their mixed node and edge types, combined with heterophily. Current approaches often lose heterophily patterns during graph conversion.

Method: RASH introduces dual heterogeneous hypergraphs to encode multi-relational bipartite subgraphs, dynamically constructs homophilic/heterophilic graphs, and employs a multi-relation contrastive loss to align different graph views.

Result: RASH achieves superior performance on benchmark datasets across multiple tasks, as it effectively models heterogeneity and heterophily in heterogeneous graphs.

Conclusion: The RASH framework offers a novel solution for addressing both heterophily and heterogeneity in heterogeneous graphs, providing valuable insights into complex graph relationships.

Abstract: Real-world networks usually have a property of node heterophily, that is, the
connected nodes usually have different features or different labels. This
heterophily issue has been extensively studied in homogeneous graphs but
remains under-explored in heterogeneous graphs, where there are multiple types
of nodes and edges. Capturing node heterophily in heterogeneous graphs is very
challenging since both node/edge heterogeneity and node heterophily should be
carefully taken into consideration. Existing methods typically convert
heterogeneous graphs into homogeneous ones to learn node heterophily, which
will inevitably lose the potential heterophily conveyed by heterogeneous
relations. To bridge this gap, we propose Relation-Aware Separation of
Homophily and Heterophily (RASH), a novel contrastive learning framework that
explicitly models high-order semantics of heterogeneous interactions and
adaptively separates homophilic and heterophilic patterns. Particularly, RASH
introduces dual heterogeneous hypergraphs to encode multi-relational bipartite
subgraphs and dynamically constructs homophilic graphs and heterophilic graphs
based on relation importance. A multi-relation contrastive loss is designed to
align heterogeneous and homophilic/heterophilic views by maximizing mutual
information. In this way, RASH simultaneously resolves the challenges of
heterogeneity and heterophily in heterogeneous graphs. Extensive experiments on
benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of RASH across various
downstream tasks. The code is available at:

Main category: physics.geo-ph

TL;DR: This study compares Temporal Fusion Transformers (TFT) with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks for rainfall-runoff modeling, finding TFT slightly outperforms LSTM and offers better explainability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation was to explore whether Temporal Fusion Transformers (TFT) could outperform LSTM networks in sequence modeling for rainfall-runoff predictions, and to address their explainability and handling of diverse datasets.

Method: The authors trained 10 randomly initialized TFT and LSTM models on 531 CAMELS catchments in the US, repeated with subsets of Caravan datasets from various countries, and analyzed their performance across catchments and datasets.

Result: TFT slightly outperformed LSTM, especially in midsection and peak hydrograph simulations, and demonstrated better handling of longer sequences and larger catchments, while both models saw reduced performance on Caravan datasets.

Conclusion: TFT is a promising tool for improving hydrological modeling due to its performance and explainability, but data quality should be addressed in certain datasets to maximize model effectiveness.

Abstract: Combining attention with recurrence has shown to be valuable in sequence
modeling, including hydrological predictions. Here, we explore the strength of
Temporal Fusion Transformers (TFTs) over Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks
in rainfall-runoff modeling. We train ten randomly initialized models, TFT and
LSTM, for 531 CAMELS catchments in the US. We repeat the experiment with five
subsets of the Caravan dataset, each representing catchments in the US,
Australia, Brazil, Great Britain, and Chile. Then, the performance of the
models, their variability regarding the catchment attributes, and the
difference according to the datasets are assessed. Our findings show that TFT
slightly outperforms LSTM, especially in simulating the midsection and peak of
hydrographs. Furthermore, we show the ability of TFT to handle longer sequences
and why it can be a better candidate for higher or larger catchments. Being an
explainable AI technique, TFT identifies the key dynamic and static variables,
providing valuable scientific insights. However, both TFT and LSTM exhibit a
considerable drop in performance with the Caravan dataset, indicating possible
data quality issues. Overall, the study highlights the potential of TFT in
improving hydrological modeling and understanding.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional PIC methods face performance bottlenecks during Charge Deposition (CD) due to particle-grid interactions, especially in parallelized simulations, limiting scalability.

Method: The authors propose a particle-thread binding approach that requires only four private grids per node, along with additional functions and flags, for efficient CD parallelization without requiring extensive changes to existing codes.

Result: Their method demonstrated improved scalability and performance in both shared and distributed memory systems, tested up to 1000 cores, while showing minimal hardware dependency.

Conclusion: The novel particle-thread binding strategy provides a scalable and adaptable solution for enhancing PIC simulations, overcoming conventional CD bottlenecks without significant hardware or architectural limitations.

Abstract: The Particle-In-Cell (PIC) method for plasma simulation tracks particle phase

costs in 2D and 3D device-scale PIC simulations necessitate parallelization,
with the Charge Deposition (CD) subroutine often becoming a bottleneck due to
frequent particle-grid interactions. Conventional methods mitigate dependencies
by generating private grids for each core, but this approach faces scalability
issues. We propose a novel approach based on a particle-thread binding strategy
that requires only four private grids per node in distributed memory systems or
four private grids in shared memory systems, enhancing CD scalability and
performance while maintaining conventional data structures and requiring
minimal changes to existing PIC codes. This method ensures complete
accessibility of grid data structure for concurrent threads and avoids
simultaneous access to particles within the same cell using additional
functions and flags. Performance evaluations using a PIC benchmark for
low-temperature partially magnetized E x B discharge simulation on a shared
memory as well as a distributed memory system (1000 cores) demonstrate the
method's scalability, and additionally, we show the method has little hardware
dependency.

### [309] [Effect of Haptic Feedback on Avoidance Behavior and Visual Exploration in Dynamic VR Pedestrian Environment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20952)
*Kyosuke Ishibashi,Atsushi Saito,Zin Y. Tun,Lucas Ray,Megan C. Coram,Akihiro Sakurai,Allison M. Okamura,Ko Yamamoto*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: The study examines the influence of haptic feedback on user walking behavior in crowded VR environments, finding it alters collision avoidance and increases awareness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore how haptic feedback influences walking behavior and collision awareness in dense pedestrian flows in VR, enhancing applications like emergency evacuation training.

Method: The study enabled user experiments in VR with haptic feedback to measure its effects on walking trajectory, pelvis angle, and collision awareness in crowded VR scenarios.

Result: Haptic feedback influenced walking behavior by increasing trajectory length, pelvis angle changes, and lateral displacements while enhancing visual exploration and awareness.

Conclusion: Haptic feedback improves collision sensitivity and awareness, suggesting its utility for enhancing immersion and user response in VR applications.

Abstract: Human crowd simulation in virtual reality (VR) is a powerful tool with
potential applications including emergency evacuation training and assessment
of building layout. While haptic feedback in VR enhances immersive experience,
its effect on walking behavior in dense and dynamic pedestrian flows is
unknown. Through a user study, we investigated how haptic feedback changes user
walking motion in crowded pedestrian flows in VR. The results indicate that
haptic feedback changed users' collision avoidance movements, as measured by
increased walking trajectory length and change in pelvis angle. The
displacements of users' lateral position and pelvis angle were also increased
in the instantaneous response to a collision with a non-player character (NPC),
even when the NPC was inside the field of view. Haptic feedback also enhanced
users' awareness and visual exploration when an NPC approached from the side
and back. Furthermore, variation in walking speed was increased by the haptic
feedback. These results suggested that the haptic feedback enhanced users'
sensitivity to a collision in VR environment.

### [310] [Exploring the Effects of Chatbot Anthropomorphism and Human Empathy on Human Prosocial Behavior Toward Chatbots](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20748)
*Jingshu Li,Zicheng Zhu,Renwen Zhang,Yi-Chieh Lee*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: The study investigates factors motivating people to help chatbots, focusing on chatbot anthropomorphism and human empathy. Experiment reveals increased prosocial behaviors towards human-like and emotionally expressive chatbots.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to explore how anthropomorphic features in chatbots influence human empathy and prosocial behaviors toward them, addressing the lack of research in this area.

Method: An online experiment involving 244 participants where chatbots made errors during image labeling tasks, followed by measuring participants' prosocial behaviors, intentions, and qualitative motivations.

Result: Chatbots with human-like identity and emotional expression significantly boosted prosocial behaviors and intentions among participants, with empathy serving as a mediator.

Conclusion: Human identity and emotional expression in chatbots enhance user empathy and prosocial responses, offering practical insights for designing empathetic and interactive chatbot systems.

Abstract: Chatbots are increasingly integrated into people's lives and are widely used
to help people. Recently, there has also been growing interest in the reverse
direction-humans help chatbots-due to a wide range of benefits including better
chatbot performance, human well-being, and collaborative outcomes. However,
little research has explored the factors that motivate people to help chatbots.
To address this gap, we draw on the Computers Are Social Actors (CASA)
framework to examine how chatbot anthropomorphism-including human-like
identity, emotional expression, and non-verbal expression-influences human
empathy toward chatbots and their subsequent prosocial behaviors and
intentions. We also explore people's own interpretations of their prosocial
behaviors toward chatbots. We conducted an online experiment (N = 244) in which
chatbots made mistakes in a collaborative image labeling task and explained the
reasons to participants. We then measured participants' prosocial behaviors and
intentions toward the chatbots. Our findings revealed that human identity and
emotional expression of chatbots increased participants' prosocial behavior and
intention toward chatbots, with empathy mediating these effects. Qualitative
analysis further identified two motivations for participants' prosocial
behaviors: empathy for the chatbot and perceiving the chatbot as human-like. We
discuss the implications of these results for understanding and promoting human
prosocial behaviors toward chatbots.

### [311] ["Who Should I Believe?": User Interpretation and Decision-Making When a Family Healthcare Robot Contradicts Human Memory](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21322)
*Hong Wang,Natalia Calvo-Barajas,Katie Winkle,Ginevra Castellano*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: The study investigates how a healthcare robot's transparency and sociability influence user trust, decision-making, and information interpretation when the robot's suggestions conflict with users' memories.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rise of intelligent healthcare robots for home use presents challenges related to user trust and decision-making, especially when the robot's information contradicts the user's memory.

Method: A 2x2 between-subjects study with 176 participants watching videos of a family healthcare assistant robot presenting conflicting medication advice. Transparency and sociability levels were varied across conditions.

Result: High transparency robots led participants to attribute discrepancies to external factors, while low transparency robots caused users to doubt their own memory. Participants showed a tendency to overtrust the robot, prioritizing its suggestions even when suspecting errors.

Conclusion: Transparency mechanisms significantly influence user trust and decision-making. However, over-reliance on robots in sensitive areas like healthcare underscores the need for effective access control and careful system design for multi-user environments.

Abstract: Advancements in robotic capabilities for providing physical assistance,
psychological support, and daily health management are making the deployment of
intelligent healthcare robots in home environments increasingly feasible in the
near future. However, challenges arise when the information provided by these
robots contradicts users' memory, raising concerns about user trust and
decision-making. This paper presents a study that examines how varying a
robot's level of transparency and sociability influences user interpretation,
decision-making and perceived trust when faced with conflicting information
from a robot. In a 2 x 2 between-subjects online study, 176 participants
watched videos of a Furhat robot acting as a family healthcare assistant and
suggesting a fictional user to take medication at a different time from that
remembered by the user. Results indicate that robot transparency influenced
users' interpretation of information discrepancies: with a low transparency
robot, the most frequent assumption was that the user had not correctly
remembered the time, while with the high transparency robot, participants were
more likely to attribute the discrepancy to external factors, such as a partner
or another household member modifying the robot's information. Additionally,
participants exhibited a tendency toward overtrust, often prioritizing the
robot's recommendations over the user's memory, even when suspecting system
malfunctions or third-party interference. These findings highlight the impact
of transparency mechanisms in robotic systems, the complexity and importance
associated with system access control for multi-user robots deployed in home
environments, and the potential risks of users' over reliance on robots in
sensitive domains such as healthcare.

TL;DR: The paper systematically reviews 62 publications on co-creative systems to identify design considerations for AI systems that actively collaborate with humans in creative tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To advance the development of AI systems that effectively support and enhance human creativity by analyzing existing research in the field of co-creative systems.

Method: A systematic literature review of 62 papers exploring co-creative systems across a variety of applications like art, design, and writing.

Result: Identified key dimensions for system design, such as creative process phases and user control. Found that higher user control leads to better satisfaction and that adaptive, proactive AI systems enhance collaboration.

Conclusion: The study offers 24 design considerations for co-creative systems, emphasizing user externalization, social presence, and system transparency while highlighting gaps like limited early-phase creative support and user adaptation challenges.

Abstract: The co creativity community is making significant progress in developing more
sophisticated and tailored systems to support and enhance human creativity.
Design considerations from prior work can serve as a valuable and efficient
foundation for future systems. To support this effort, we conducted a
systematic literature review of 62 papers on co-creative systems. These papers
cover a diverse range of applications, including visual arts, design, and
writing, where the AI acts not just as a tool but as an active collaborator in
the creative process. From this review, we identified several key dimensions
relevant to system design: phase of the creative process, creative task,
proactive behavior of the system, user control, system embodiment, and AI model
type. Our findings suggest that systems offering high user control lead to
greater satisfaction, trust, and a stronger sense of ownership over creative
outcomes. Furthermore, proactive systems, when adaptive and context sensitive,
can enhance collaboration. We also extracted 24 design considerations,
highlighting the value of encouraging users to externalize their thoughts and
of increasing the system's social presence and transparency to foster trust.
Despite recent advancements, important gaps remain, such as limited support for
early creative phases like problem clarification, and challenges related to
user adaptation to AI systems.

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: The study introduces a new dataset and trains multimodal visualization LLMs to enhance data extraction and chart reconstruction from visualizations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current multimodal models struggle in understanding visualizations due to their inability to decode data-to-visual mapping and extract structured information.

Method: The method combines chart images with vectorized representations, encoding schemes, and data features, enabling compact and accurate reconstruction of visualization content.

Result: Experimental outcomes show considerable improvements in data extraction accuracy and quality of chart reconstructions.

Conclusion: The proposed approach demonstrates potential in significantly enhancing the understanding of visualizations using multimodal large language models.

Abstract: Visualizations are crucial for data communication, yet understanding them
requires comprehension of both visual elements and their underlying data
relationships. Current multimodal large models, while effective in natural
image understanding, struggle with visualization due to their inability to
decode the data-to-visual mapping rules and extract structured information. To
address these challenges, we present a novel dataset and train multimodal
visualization LLMs specifically designed for understanding. Our approach
combines chart images with their corresponding vectorized representations,
encoding schemes, and data features. The proposed vector format enables compact
and accurate reconstruction of visualization content. Experimental results
demonstrate significant improvements in both data extraction accuracy and chart
reconstruction quality.

### [314] [DRAGON: Distributional Rewards Optimize Diffusion Generative Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15217)
*Yatong Bai,Jonah Casebeer,Somayeh Sojoudi,Nicholas J. Bryan*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: DRAGON is a framework for fine-tuning media generation models using flexible reward functions that evaluate individual or distributional outcomes. It delivers superior results across 20 target reward settings for audio-domain text-to-music model optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the limitations of traditional methods like RLHF or DPO by providing a more versatile framework for optimizing media generation models based on diverse reward functions.

Method: The framework constructs reward functions using encoders and reference example distributions. It contrasts scoring between positive and negative demonstration sets to maximize the desired reward.

Result: DRAGON showed an 81.45% average win rate across 20 target rewards and achieved a 60.95% human-voted music quality win rate without human preference training.

Conclusion: DRAGON offers a novel and flexible approach to designing reward functions, effectively enhancing media generation qualities while eliminating dependence on human preference annotations.

Abstract: We present Distributional RewArds for Generative OptimizatioN (DRAGON), a
versatile framework for fine-tuning media generation models towards a desired
outcome. Compared with traditional reinforcement learning with human feedback
(RLHF) or pairwise preference approaches such as direct preference optimization
(DPO), DRAGON is more flexible. It can optimize reward functions that evaluate
either individual examples or distributions of them, making it compatible with
a broad spectrum of instance-wise, instance-to-distribution, and
distribution-to-distribution rewards. Leveraging this versatility, we construct
novel reward functions by selecting an encoder and a set of reference examples
to create an exemplar distribution. When cross-modality encoders such as CLAP
are used, the reference examples may be of a different modality (e.g., text
versus audio). Then, DRAGON gathers online and on-policy generations, scores
them to construct a positive demonstration set and a negative set, and
leverages the contrast between the two sets to maximize the reward. For
evaluation, we fine-tune an audio-domain text-to-music diffusion model with 20
different reward functions, including a custom music aesthetics model, CLAP
score, Vendi diversity, and Frechet audio distance (FAD). We further compare
instance-wise (per-song) and full-dataset FAD settings while ablating multiple
FAD encoders and reference sets. Over all 20 target rewards, DRAGON achieves an
81.45% average win rate. Moreover, reward functions based on exemplar sets
indeed enhance generations and are comparable to model-based rewards. With an
appropriate exemplar set, DRAGON achieves a 60.95% human-voted music quality
win rate without training on human preference annotations. As such, DRAGON
exhibits a new approach to designing and optimizing reward functions for
improving human-perceived quality. Sound examples at

### [315] [Exploring Adapter Design Tradeoffs for Low Resource Music Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21298)
*Atharva Mehta,Shivam Chauhan,Monojit Choudhury*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: The paper investigates adapter configurations for fine-tuning large-scale music generation models (like MusicGen and Mustango), offering insights into performance trade-offs between convolution-based and transformer-based adapters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fine-tuning music generation models is computationally expensive, and this paper explores parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods to make adaptation feasible for low-resource music genres.

Method: The authors study various adapter configurations for two music AI models—MusicGen and Mustango—on Hindustani Classical and Turkish Makam genres, evaluating trade-offs in adapter design and computational efficiency.

Result: The authors found that convolution-based adapters excel in capturing local musical details, while transformer-based adapters handle long-range dependencies better. Mid-sized adapters (40M parameters) provide an optimal balance, and comparisons reveal that MusicGen is faster and better at quality output than Mustango, which is more diverse but less stable.

Conclusion: The study highlights how adapter configurations influence music generation performance and provides guidelines for balancing computational effort, expressiveness, and genre-specific requirements.

Abstract: Fine-tuning large-scale music generation models, such as MusicGen and
Mustango, is a computationally expensive process, often requiring updates to
billions of parameters and, therefore, significant hardware resources.
Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) techniques, particularly adapter-based
methods, have emerged as a promising alternative, enabling adaptation with
minimal trainable parameters while preserving model performance. However, the
design choices for adapters, including their architecture, placement, and size,
are numerous, and it is unclear which of these combinations would produce
optimal adapters and why, for a given case of low-resource music genre. In this
paper, we attempt to answer this question by studying various adapter
configurations for two AI music models, MusicGen and Mustango, on two genres:
Hindustani Classical and Turkish Makam music.
  Our findings reveal distinct trade-offs: convolution-based adapters excel in
capturing fine-grained local musical details such as ornamentations and short
melodic phrases, while transformer-based adapters better preserve long-range
dependencies crucial for structured improvisation. Additionally, we analyze
computational resource requirements across different adapter scales,
demonstrating how mid-sized adapters (40M parameters) achieve an optimal
balance between expressivity and quality. Furthermore, we find that Mustango, a
diffusion-based model, generates more diverse outputs with better adherence to
the description in the input prompt while lacking in providing stability in
notes, rhythm alignment, and aesthetics. Also, it is computationally intensive
and requires significantly more time to train. In contrast, autoregressive
models like MusicGen offer faster training and are more efficient, and can
produce better quality output in comparison, but have slightly higher
redundancy in their generations.

TL;DR: This paper investigates hierarchical classification in identifying musical instrument activities, using the MedleyDB dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance music cataloging and discovery by addressing the limitations of existing instrument recognition methods, especially for instruments with insufficient fine-grained annotations.

Method: The study uses the Hornbostel-Sachs classification to build and evaluate hierarchical classification systems, employing MedleyDB data to develop models for hierarchical music prediction.

Result: It achieves improved coarse-level instrument detection by integrating hierarchical structures, providing more accurate recognition even with limited data.

Conclusion: Bridging detailed instrument identification and group-level recognition improves reliability and sets the stage for subsequent advancements in music information retrieval.

Abstract: Identifying instrument activities within audio excerpts is vital in music
information retrieval, with significant implications for music cataloging and
discovery. Prior deep learning endeavors in musical instrument recognition have
predominantly emphasized instrument classes with ample data availability.
Recent studies have demonstrated the applicability of hierarchical
classification in detecting instrument activities in orchestral music, even
with limited fine-grained annotations at the instrument level. Based on the
Hornbostel-Sachs classification, such a hierarchical classification system is
evaluated using the MedleyDB dataset, renowned for its diversity and richness
concerning various instruments and music genres. This work presents various
strategies to integrate hierarchical structures into models and tests a new
class of models for hierarchical music prediction. This study showcases more
reliable coarse-level instrument detection by bridging the gap between detailed
instrument identification and group-level recognition, paving the way for
further advancements in this domain.

TL;DR: The study introduces the SZUR-Acoustic Dataset and uses a BMCNN model to analyze vehicle noise and speed. It achieves high classification accuracy and suggests applications in smart-city traffic management.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the gap in acoustic-based vehicle speed classification and provide a robust dataset for modeling vehicular noise with driving speed.

Method: Developed and tested a Bimodal-Feature-Fusion Deep Convolutional Neural Network (BMCNN) using deliberate preprocessing and feature extraction strategies.

Result: Achieved 87.56% accuracy on SZUR-Acoustic Dataset and 96.28% on the public IDMT-Traffic dataset, with robust performance validated through tests and ablation studies.

Conclusion: The method is effective and valuable for smart-city integration, aiding sustainable urban planning through noise and traffic monitoring.

Abstract: This study presents and publicly releases the Suzhou Urban Road Acoustic
Dataset (SZUR-Acoustic Dataset), which is accompanied by comprehensive
data-acquisition protocols and annotation guidelines to ensure transparency and
reproducibility of the experimental workflow. To model the coupling between
vehicular noise and driving speed, we propose a bimodal-feature-fusion deep
convolutional neural network (BMCNN). During preprocessing, an adaptive
denoising and normalization strategy is applied to suppress environmental
background interference; in the network architecture, parallel branches extract
Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCCs) and wavelet-packet energy features,
which are subsequently fused via a cross-modal attention mechanism in the
intermediate feature space to fully exploit time-frequency information.
Experimental results demonstrate that BMCNN achieves a classification accuracy
of 87.56% on the SZUR-Acoustic Dataset and 96.28% on the public IDMT-Traffic
dataset. Ablation studies and robustness tests on the Suzhou dataset further
validate the contributions of each module to performance improvement and
overfitting mitigation. The proposed acoustics-based speed classification
method can be integrated into smart-city traffic management systems for
real-time noise monitoring and speed estimation, thereby optimizing traffic
flow control, reducing roadside noise pollution, and supporting sustainable
urban planning.

*Kehan Sui,Jinxu Xiang,Fang Jin*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: SmoothSinger introduces a conditional diffusion model to synthesize high-quality singing voices directly without relying on vocoders.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing singing voice synthesis methods struggle with naturalness and high-quality output due to artifacts caused by complex acoustic and musical characteristics.

Method: The proposed SmoothSinger uses a dual-branch architecture with reference-guided denoising and enhanced U-Net for better pitch and spectral modeling. It trains with degraded ground truth audio to improve alignment.

Result: SmoothSinger achieves state-of-the-art performance on the Opencpop dataset in terms of both objective and subjective evaluations.

Conclusion: SmoothSinger reduces artifacts and improves the naturalness and quality of synthesized singing voices, addressing limitations of two-stage pipelines.

Abstract: Singing voice synthesis (SVS) aims to generate expressive and high-quality
vocals from musical scores, requiring precise modeling of pitch, duration, and
articulation. While diffusion-based models have achieved remarkable success in
image and video generation, their application to SVS remains challenging due to
the complex acoustic and musical characteristics of singing, often resulting in
artifacts that degrade naturalness. In this work, we propose SmoothSinger, a
conditional diffusion model designed to synthesize high quality and natural
singing voices. Unlike prior methods that depend on vocoders as a final stage
and often introduce distortion, SmoothSinger refines low-quality synthesized
audio directly in a unified framework, mitigating the degradation associated
with two-stage pipelines. The model adopts a reference-guided dual-branch
architecture, using low-quality audio from any baseline system as a reference
to guide the denoising process, enabling more expressive and context-aware
synthesis. Furthermore, it enhances the conventional U-Net with a parallel
low-frequency upsampling path, allowing the model to better capture pitch
contours and long term spectral dependencies. To improve alignment during
training, we replace reference audio with degraded ground truth audio,
addressing temporal mismatch between reference and target signals. Experiments
on the Opencpop dataset, a large-scale Chinese singing corpus, demonstrate that
SmoothSinger achieves state-of-the-art results in both objective and subjective
evaluations. Extensive ablation studies confirm its effectiveness in reducing
artifacts and improving the naturalness of synthesized voices.

TL;DR: This paper introduces a differentiable version of the Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT) to enable gradient-based optimization of its parameters and improve non-stationary signal analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional STFT parameter tuning relies on manual or computationally expensive methods, which can be suboptimal for analyzing non-stationary signals. The authors aim to simplify and optimize this process.

Method: The authors propose a unified differentiable formulation of the STFT that allows gradient-based tuning and real-time optimization using neural networks.

Result: The proposed approach improves time-frequency representations (TFRs) and enhances performance in downstream tasks, as demonstrated through experiments.

Conclusion: Differentiable STFT provides a more effective and seamless tuning process for STFT parameters, integrating well with neural networks and outperforming traditional tuning methods.

Abstract: The short-time Fourier transform (STFT) is widely used for analyzing
non-stationary signals. However, its performance is highly sensitive to its
parameters, and manual or heuristic tuning often yields suboptimal results. To
overcome this limitation, we propose a unified differentiable formulation of
the STFT that enables gradient-based optimization of its parameters. This
approach addresses the limitations of traditional STFT parameter tuning
methods, which often rely on computationally intensive discrete searches. It
enables fine-tuning of the time-frequency representation (TFR) based on any
desired criterion. Moreover, our approach integrates seamlessly with neural
networks, allowing joint optimization of the STFT parameters and network
weights. The efficacy of the proposed differentiable STFT in enhancing TFRs and
improving performance in downstream tasks is demonstrated through experiments
on both simulated and real-world data.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Estimating counterfactual outcomes in spatial-temporal contexts is essential but remains challenging due to the limitations of classical statistical models in performance and generalization.

Method: The study uses a Transformer-based framework to estimate counterfactual outcomes, ensuring consistency and asymptotic normality under mild assumptions, validated through simulation and real-world data experiments.

Result: Simulation experiments demonstrate the superior estimation capabilities of the proposed method compared to baselines. Real-world evaluations provide insights into the causal effects of conflicts on forest loss in Colombia.

Conclusion: The proposed Transformer framework effectively enhances counterfactual estimation with spatial-temporal attributes, outperforming traditional methods and yielding practical insights in real-world applications.

Abstract: The real world naturally has dimensions of time and space. Therefore,
estimating the counterfactual outcomes with spatial-temporal attributes is a
crucial problem. However, previous methods are based on classical statistical
models, which still have limitations in performance and generalization. This
paper proposes a novel framework for estimating counterfactual outcomes with
spatial-temporal attributes using the Transformer, exhibiting stronger
estimation ability. Under mild assumptions, the proposed estimator within this
framework is consistent and asymptotically normal. To validate the
effectiveness of our approach, we conduct simulation experiments and real data
experiments. Simulation experiments show that our estimator has a stronger
estimation capability than baseline methods. Real data experiments provide a
valuable conclusion to the causal effect of conflicts on forest loss in
Colombia. The source code is available at

*Xiaoyun Gong,Sloan Nietert,Ziv Goldfeld*

Main category: math.ST

TL;DR: The paper addresses outlier sensitivity in Gromov-Wasserstein (GW) alignment and proposes using partial GW distance for robust alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GW alignment is powerful for matching heterogeneous datasets but suffers from sensitivity to outliers, leading to distorted matchings.

Method: Proposes an estimator leveraging partial GW distance, which trims out a fraction of data mass, ensuring robust alignment under contamination.

Result: Shows minimax optimality of the proposed estimator in population settings and near-optimality in finite-sample scenarios.

Conclusion: Partial GW distance provides a robust alternative to classical GW distance, making it viable when dealing with contaminated datasets.

Abstract: The Gromov-Wasserstein (GW) problem provides a powerful framework for
aligning heterogeneous datasets by matching their internal structures in a way
that minimizes distortion. However, GW alignment is sensitive to data
contamination by outliers, which can greatly distort the resulting matching
scheme. To address this issue, we study robust GW alignment, where upon
observing contaminated versions of the clean data distributions, our goal is to
accurately estimate the GW alignment cost between the original (uncontaminated)
measures. We propose an estimator based on the partial GW distance, which trims
out a fraction of the mass from each distribution before optimally aligning the
rest. The estimator is shown to be minimax optimal in the population setting
and is near-optimal in the finite-sample regime, where the optimality gap
originates only from the suboptimality of the plug-in estimator in the
empirical estimation setting (i.e., without contamination). Towards the
analysis, we derive new structural results pertaining to the approximate
pseudo-metric structure of the partial GW distance. Overall, our results endow
the partial GW distance with an operational meaning by posing it as a robust
surrogate of the classical distance when the observed data may be contaminated.

*Hoa La,Ahan Gupta,Alex Morehead,Jianlin Cheng,Minjia Zhang*

Main category: q-bio.BM

TL;DR: The paper introduces MegaFold, a system designed to accelerate and enhance the scalability of AlphaFold3 training by addressing compute and memory bottlenecks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AlphaFold3 achieves significant advancements in protein structure prediction but faces scalability issues due to resource-intensive components like memory-hogging operations, 2D attention mechanisms, and retrieval-augmented data pipelines.

Method: MegaFold addresses these limitations with three techniques: ahead-of-time caching for reducing GPU idle times, Triton-based kernels for efficient EvoAttention, and deep fusion for optimizing critical operations.

Result: MegaFold reduces peak memory use by up to 1.23×, speeds up per-iteration training time by 1.73× on NVIDIA GPUs and 1.62× on AMD GPUs, and enables training on 1.35× longer sequences without memory issues.

Conclusion: MegaFold enhances the scalability of protein structure prediction models like AlphaFold3 and is openly available for the research community.

Abstract: Protein structure prediction models such as AlphaFold3 (AF3) push the
frontier of biomolecular modeling by incorporating science-informed
architectural changes to the transformer architecture. However, these advances
come at a steep system cost, introducing: compute- and memory-intensive
operators, 2D attention mechanisms, and retrieval-augmented data pipelines,
which collectively hinder the scalability of AF3 training. In this work, we
present MegaFold, a cross-platform system to accelerate AF3 training. MegaFold
tackles key bottlenecks through ahead-of-time caching to eliminate GPU idle
time from the retrieval-augmented data pipeline, Triton-based kernels for
memory-efficient EvoAttention on heterogeneous devices, and deep fusion for
common and critical small operators in AF3. Evaluation on both NVIDIA H200 and
AMD MI250 GPUs shows that MegaFold reduces peak memory usage of AF3 training by
up to 1.23$\times$ and improves per-iteration training time by up-to
1.73$\times$ and 1.62$\times$ respectively. More importantly, MegaFold enables
training on 1.35$\times$ longer sequence lengths compared to PyTorch baselines
without running out-of-memory, significantly improving the scalability of
modern protein folding models. We open source our code at

*Yangzhe Peng,Kaiyuan Gao,Liang He,Yuheng Cong,Haiguang Liu,Kun He,Lijun Wu*

Main category: q-bio.BM

TL;DR: CovDocker introduces a benchmark addressing covalent docking challenges, enhancing structure prediction with adapted state-of-the-art models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing docking methods struggle to model covalent bonding and associated structural changes, prompting the need for an improved framework.

Method: The authors propose CovDocker, a benchmark dividing covalent docking into three subtasks: reactive location prediction, covalent reaction simulation, and docking, utilizing adapted models like Uni-Mol and Chemformer.

Result: Baseline performances using adapted models validate CovDocker's accuracy in predicting reactive sites and molecular transformations during covalent binding.

Conclusion: CovDocker offers a robust tool accelerating covalent drug design research, addressing fundamental issues in therapeutic development with innovative data-driven capabilities.

Abstract: Molecular docking plays a crucial role in predicting the binding mode of
ligands to target proteins, and covalent interactions, which involve the
formation of a covalent bond between the ligand and the target, are
particularly valuable due to their strong, enduring binding nature. However,
most existing docking methods and deep learning approaches hardly account for
the formation of covalent bonds and the associated structural changes. To
address this gap, we introduce a comprehensive benchmark for covalent docking,
CovDocker, which is designed to better capture the complexities of covalent
binding. We decompose the covalent docking process into three main tasks:
reactive location prediction, covalent reaction prediction, and covalent
docking. By adapting state-of-the-art models, such as Uni-Mol and Chemformer,
we establish baseline performances and demonstrate the effectiveness of the
benchmark in accurately predicting interaction sites and modeling the molecular
transformations involved in covalent binding. These results confirm the role of
the benchmark as a rigorous framework for advancing research in covalent drug
design. It underscores the potential of data-driven approaches to accelerate
the discovery of selective covalent inhibitors and addresses critical
challenges in therapeutic development.

### [325] [EraRAG: Efficient and Incremental Retrieval Augmented Generation for Growing Corpora](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20963)
*Fangyuan Zhang,Zhengjun Huang,Yingli Zhou,Qintian Guo,Zhixun Li,Wensheng Luo,Di Jiang,Yixiang Fang,Xiaofang Zhou*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: EraRAG introduces a dynamic Graph-RAG framework that efficiently updates without requiring costly graph reconstruction, outperforming existing systems in update time, token consumption, and accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Graph-RAG approaches are inefficient for dynamic environments as they assume a static corpus and require entire graph reconstructions when new data is added.

Method: EraRAG uses hyperplane-based Locality-Sensitive Hashing (LSH) to build hierarchical graph structures, allowing localized insertions and updates without disrupting the overall topology.

Result: EraRAG achieves up to a tenfold reduction in update time and token consumption compared to existing systems while maintaining superior retrieval accuracy.

Conclusion: EraRAG resolves scalability and adaptability challenges in dynamic RAG systems, offering an efficient, accurate, and practical solution for evolving corpora.

Abstract: Graph-based Retrieval-Augmented Generation (Graph-RAG) enhances large
language models (LLMs) by structuring retrieval over an external corpus.
However, existing approaches typically assume a static corpus, requiring
expensive full-graph reconstruction whenever new documents arrive, limiting
their scalability in dynamic, evolving environments. To address these
limitations, we introduce EraRAG, a novel multi-layered Graph-RAG framework
that supports efficient and scalable dynamic updates. Our method leverages
hyperplane-based Locality-Sensitive Hashing (LSH) to partition and organize the
original corpus into hierarchical graph structures, enabling efficient and
localized insertions of new data without disrupting the existing topology. The
design eliminates the need for retraining or costly recomputation while
preserving high retrieval accuracy and low latency. Experiments on large-scale
benchmarks demonstrate that EraRag achieves up to an order of magnitude
reduction in update time and token consumption compared to existing Graph-RAG
systems, while providing superior accuracy performance. This work offers a
practical path forward for RAG systems that must operate over continually
growing corpora, bridging the gap between retrieval efficiency and
adaptability. Our code and data are available at

*Siyu Mu,Wei Xuan Chan,Choon Hwai Yap*

Main category: physics.med-ph

TL;DR: This paper introduces "IMC-PINN-FE," a physics-informed neural network framework combining motion analysis and finite element (FE) modeling for efficient and personalized cardiac biomechanics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the need for computationally efficient and accurate modeling of myocardial biomechanics, which is essential for understanding cardiac physiology but limited by traditional finite element (FE) approaches.

Method: The proposed IMC-PINN-FE integrates imaged motion consistency (IMC) with FE modeling, processes cardiac motion derived from imaging (using pre-trained or unsupervised networks), extracts motion modes, estimates myocardial stiffness and active tension, and performs FE simulations at higher accuracy and speed.

Result: IMC-PINN-FE achieves a 75x speedup in FE modeling over traditional methods, improves the average Dice metric for motion accuracy (from 0.849 to 0.927), and maintains realistic cardiac pressure-volume behavior.

Conclusion: IMC-PINN-FE provides a robust, accurate, and efficient tool for patient-specific and image-consistent cardiac biomechanics, advancing the limitations of traditional methods and previous PINN-FE models.

Abstract: Elucidating the biomechanical behavior of the myocardium is crucial for
understanding cardiac physiology, but cannot be directly inferred from clinical
imaging and typically requires finite element (FE) simulations. However,
conventional FE methods are computationally expensive and often fail to
reproduce observed cardiac motions. We propose IMC-PINN-FE, a physics-informed
neural network (PINN) framework that integrates imaged motion consistency (IMC)
with FE modeling for patient-specific left ventricular (LV) biomechanics.
Cardiac motion is first estimated from MRI or echocardiography using either a
pre-trained attention-based network or an unsupervised cyclic-regularized
network, followed by extraction of motion modes. IMC-PINN-FE then rapidly
estimates myocardial stiffness and active tension by fitting clinical pressure
measurements, accelerating computation from hours to seconds compared to
traditional inverse FE. Based on these parameters, it performs FE modeling
across the cardiac cycle at 75x speedup. Through motion constraints, it matches
imaged displacements more accurately, improving average Dice from 0.849 to
0.927, while preserving realistic pressure-volume behavior. IMC-PINN-FE
advances previous PINN-FE models by introducing back-computation of material
properties and better motion fidelity. Using motion from a single subject to
reconstruct shape modes also avoids the need for large datasets and improves
patient specificity. IMC-PINN-FE offers a robust and efficient approach for
rapid, personalized, and image-consistent cardiac biomechanical modeling.

*Tamim Al Mahmud,B M Mainul Hossain,Dilshad Ara*

Main category: cs.DL

TL;DR: The paper introduces an automated system to select the most suitable referees for academic paper reviews using citation metrics, research keywords, and online data extraction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address inefficiencies in the peer-review system due to the increasing volume of research papers and the mismatch in reviewer expertise, especially in emerging research fields.

Method: The method involves analyzing references in a paper to identify potential reviewers, using web extraction to gather topic keywords, and ranking candidates based on h-index, i10-index, citations, and affiliation criteria, while excluding co-authors or colleagues.

Result: The proposed system identifies suitable reviewers from the academic community with minimal manual intervention, demonstrating an efficient and automated selection process.

Conclusion: The research concludes that their automated methodology improves the accuracy of selecting expert referees for research paper peer review, solving a critical challenge in academic publishing.

Abstract: Everyday, a vast stream of research documents is submitted to conferences,
anthologies, journals, newsletters, annual reports, daily papers, and various
periodicals. Many such publications use independent external specialists to
review submissions. This process is called peer review, and the reviewers are
called referees. However, it is not always possible to pick the best referee
for reviewing. Moreover, new research fields are emerging in every sector, and
the number of research papers is increasing dramatically. To review all these
papers, every journal assigns a small team of referees who may not be experts
in all areas. For example, a research paper in communication technology should
be reviewed by an expert from the same field. Thus, efficiently selecting the
best reviewer or referee for a research paper is a big challenge.
  In this research, we propose and implement program that uses a new strategy
to automatically select the best reviewers for a research paper. Every research
paper contains references at the end, usually from the same area. First, we
collect the references and count authors who have at least one paper in the
references. Then, we automatically browse the web to extract research topic
keywords. Next, we search for top researchers in the specific topic and count
their h-index, i10-index, and citations for the first n authors. Afterward, we
rank the top n authors based on a score and automatically browse their
homepages to retrieve email addresses. We also check their co-authors and
colleagues online and discard them from the list. The remaining top n authors,
generally professors, are likely the best referees for reviewing the research
paper.

### [328] [Faster Fixed-Point Methods for Multichain MDPs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20910)
*Matthew Zurek,Yudong Chen*

Main category: math.OC

TL;DR: This paper proposes enhanced value-iteration algorithms for solving average-reward Markov decision processes (MDPs), particularly under the complex multichain setting, achieving faster convergence and improved theoretical insights.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation lies in addressing the theoretical challenges of solving average-reward MDPs, especially the multichain variety, where optimal policies require solving not only optimization within components but also navigation between connected components.

Method: The authors propose algorithms that improve the navigation subproblem in multichain MDPs, alongside developing novel connections between average-reward and discounted problems, fixed-point methods for discounted VI, and refined suboptimality decompositions.

Result: The results include faster convergence rates for solving both discounted and average-reward MDPs, sublinear convergence rates for discounted value errors, and sharper complexity measures compared to prior research.

Conclusion: The research contributes faster and theoretically robust VI algorithms for multichain average-reward MDPs, advancing the methodology and theoretical understanding of such problems.

Abstract: We study value-iteration (VI) algorithms for solving general (a.k.a.
multichain) Markov decision processes (MDPs) under the average-reward
criterion, a fundamental but theoretically challenging setting. Beyond the
difficulties inherent to all average-reward problems posed by the lack of
contractivity and non-uniqueness of solutions to the Bellman operator, in the
multichain setting an optimal policy must solve the navigation subproblem of
steering towards the best connected component, in addition to optimizing
long-run performance within each component. We develop algorithms which better
solve this navigational subproblem in order to achieve faster convergence for
multichain MDPs, obtaining improved rates of convergence and sharper measures
of complexity relative to prior work. Many key components of our results are of
potential independent interest, including novel connections between
average-reward and discounted problems, optimal fixed-point methods for
discounted VI which extend to general Banach spaces, new sublinear convergence
rates for the discounted value error, and refined suboptimality decompositions
for multichain MDPs. Overall our results yield faster convergence rates for
discounted and average-reward problems and expand the theoretical foundations
of VI approaches.

*Alain Bensoussan,Minh-Binh Tran,Bangjie Wang*

Main category: math.OC

TL;DR: The paper explores a novel problem in control theory by focusing on optimizing and controlling operator coefficients in parabolic and hyperbolic PDEs, with applications to neural networks viewed as PDEs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address a gap in control theory related to optimizing the coefficients of operators in PDE systems, which has direct relevance to supervised learning and neural networks.

Method: The authors propose a dual system formulation for the control and optimization of parabolic PDEs, prove minimizers exist, and study related problems for hyperbolic PDEs, including approximations.

Result: The study provides theoretical proofs for the existence of minimizers in parabolic PDEs and solutions to approximated control problems for hyperbolic PDEs.

Conclusion: The work introduces a novel perspective in control theory and lays the groundwork for future research, particularly numerical schemes for controlling operator coefficients in PDEs.

Abstract: Although there is a substantial body of literature on control and
optimization problems for parabolic and hyperbolic systems, the specific
problem of controlling and optimizing the coefficients of the associated
operators within such systems has not yet been thoroughly explored. In this
work, we aim to initiate a line of research in control theory focused on
optimizing and controlling the coefficients of these operators-a problem that
naturally arises in the context of neural networks and supervised learning.
  In supervised learning, the primary objective is to transport initial data
toward target data through the layers of a neural network. We propose a novel
perspective: neural networks can be interpreted as partial differential
equations (PDEs). From this viewpoint, the control problem traditionally
studied in the context of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) is
reformulated as a control problem for PDEs, specifically targeting the
optimization and control of coefficients in parabolic and hyperbolic operators.
To the best of our knowledge, this specific problem has not yet been
systematically addressed in the control theory of PDEs.
  To this end, we propose a dual system formulation for the control and
optimization problem associated with parabolic PDEs, laying the groundwork for
the development of efficient numerical schemes in future research. We also
provide a theoretical proof showing that the control and optimization problem
for parabolic PDEs admits minimizers. Finally, we investigate the control
problem associated with hyperbolic PDEs and prove the existence of solutions
for a corresponding approximated control problem.

Main category: q-bio.CB

TL;DR: The paper presents scMamba, a novel tool for integrating single-cell multi-omics data using a tokenization strategy and contrastive learning to enhance biological insight extraction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current single-cell multi-omics integration methods often discard crucial biological information during preprocessing, hampering the understanding of cellular functions and disease mechanisms.

Method: scMamba uses a patch-based cell tokenization strategy that treats genomic regions as tokens and cells as sentences. It integrates data with a contrastive learning approach enhanced with cosine similarity regularization.

Result: scMamba significantly outperformed state-of-the-art methods in preserving biological variation, aligning omics layers, and improving tasks like clustering and cell type annotation during benchmarking.

Conclusion: scMamba is a breakthrough tool for integrating large-scale single-cell multi-omics data, offering superior insights and advancing biological discovery.

Abstract: The advent of single-cell multi-omics technologies has enabled the
simultaneous profiling of diverse omics layers within individual cells.
Integrating such multimodal data provides unprecedented insights into cellular
identity, regulatory processes, and disease mechanisms. However, it remains
challenging, as current methods often rely on selecting highly variable genes
or peaks during preprocessing, which may inadvertently discard crucial
biological information. Here, we present scMamba, a foundation model designed
to integrate single-cell multi-omics data without the need for prior feature
selection while preserving genomic positional information. scMamba introduces a
patch-based cell tokenization strategy that treats genomics regions as words
(tokens) and cells as sentences. Building upon the concept of state space
duality, scMamba distills rich biological insights from high-dimensional,
sparse single-cell multi-omics data. Additionally, our novel contrastive
learning approach, enhanced with cosine similarity regularization, enables
superior alignment across omics layers compared to traditional methods.
Systematic benchmarking across multiple datasets demonstrates that scMamba
significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in preserving biological
variation, aligning omics layers, and enhancing key downstream tasks such as
clustering, cell type annotation, and trajectory inference. Our findings
position scMamba as a powerful tool for large-scale single-cell multi-omics
integration, capable of handling large-scale atlases and advancing biological
discovery.

### [331] [On Uniform Weighted Deep Polynomial approximation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21306)
*Kingsley Yeon,Steven B. Damelin*

Main category: math.NA

TL;DR: This paper introduces a weighted deep polynomial framework for approximating asymmetric functions that grow unbounded on one side and decay on the other, achieving superior results compared to traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Classical rational functions efficiently approximate certain non-smooth functions, but polynomial approximations perform less effectively. New composite polynomial architectures show potential in addressing this issue, leading to a gap in approximating functions with asymmetric characteristics.

Method: The study designs weighted deep polynomial approximants by multiplying a learnable deep polynomial with a one-sided weight. A stable graph-based parameterization strategy is proposed for practical optimization.

Result: The proposed framework numerically outperforms Taylor, Chebyshev, and standard deep polynomial approximations, given the same number of parameters.

Conclusion: Weighted deep polynomial approximants offer a better solution for asymmetric functions, combining local non-smoothness handling and global growth representation.

Abstract: It is a classical result in rational approximation theory that certain
non-smooth or singular functions, such as $|x|$ and $x^{1/p}$, can be
efficiently approximated using rational functions with root-exponential
convergence in terms of degrees of freedom \cite{Sta, GN}. In contrast,
polynomial approximations admit only algebraic convergence by Jackson's theorem
\cite{Lub2}. Recent work shows that composite polynomial architectures can
recover exponential approximation rates even without smoothness \cite{KY}. In
this work, we introduce and analyze a class of weighted deep polynomial
approximants tailored for functions with asymmetric behavior-growing unbounded
on one side and decaying on the other. By multiplying a learnable deep
polynomial with a one-sided weight, we capture both local non-smoothness and
global growth. We show numerically that this framework outperforms Taylor,
Chebyshev, and standard deep polynomial approximants, even when all use the
same number of parameters. To optimize these approximants in practice, we
propose a stable graph-based parameterization strategy building on \cite{Jar}.

Motivation: To improve the accuracy and reliability of predictive modeling in structural materials while incorporating uncertainties and utilizing extensive existing data.

Method: The study employs a mixed density network (MDN) model to analyze dislocation density distributions and integrate these predictions into plasticity models for improved stress-strain outcomes.

Result: Accurate stress-strain predictions were achieved with explicit uncertainty quantification, which enhances the reliability of modeling and material design.

Conclusion: The methodology enhances mechanical property predictions and contributes to optimizing alloy design, aiding advancements in materials development.

Abstract: Machine learning has significantly advanced the understanding and application
of structural materials, with an increasing emphasis on integrating existing
data and quantifying uncertainties in predictive modeling. This study presents
a comprehensive methodology utilizing a mixed density network (MDN) model,
trained on extensive experimental data from literature. This approach uniquely
predicts the distribution of dislocation density, inferred as a latent
variable, and the resulting stress distribution at the grain level. The
incorporation of statistical parameters of those predicted distributions into a
dislocation-mediated plasticity model allows for accurate stress-strain
predictions with explicit uncertainty quantification. This strategy not only
improves the accuracy and reliability of mechanical property predictions but
also plays a vital role in optimizing alloy design, thereby facilitating the
development of new materials in a rapidly evolving industry.

TL;DR: VideoTex is a novel framework addressing spatial and temporal inconsistencies in texture synthesis by incorporating video generation models and geometry-aware conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for texture synthesis struggle with achieving global context and geometric consistency, while video generation models have shown success in maintaining temporal consistency.

Method: VideoTex leverages video generation models, geometry-aware conditions, and a UV diffusion strategy to generate spatially and temporally coherent 3D textures.

Result: VideoTex improves texture fidelity, seam blending, and stability, achieving smoother transitions and temporally stable textures across video frames.

Conclusion: VideoTex represents a significant advancement, paving the way for real-time applications requiring visually coherent and temporally stable textures.

Abstract: Current texture synthesis methods, which generate textures from fixed
viewpoints, suffer from inconsistencies due to the lack of global context and
geometric understanding. Meanwhile, recent advancements in video generation
models have demonstrated remarkable success in achieving temporally consistent
videos. In this paper, we introduce VideoTex, a novel framework for seamless
texture synthesis that leverages video generation models to address both
spatial and temporal inconsistencies in 3D textures. Our approach incorporates
geometry-aware conditions, enabling precise utilization of 3D mesh structures.
Additionally, we propose a structure-wise UV diffusion strategy, which enhances
the generation of occluded areas by preserving semantic information, resulting
in smoother and more coherent textures. VideoTex not only achieves smoother
transitions across UV boundaries but also ensures high-quality, temporally
stable textures across video frames. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
VideoTex outperforms existing methods in texture fidelity, seam blending, and
stability, paving the way for dynamic real-time applications that demand both
visual quality and temporal coherence.

TL;DR: This paper proposes Generative Blocks World, a method enabling interactive manipulation of generated image scenes by editing geometric abstractions represented by convex 3D primitives.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve the editability and visual fidelity of generated images while preserving the identity and consistency of texture for objects and scenes.

Method: Scenes are represented as assemblies of convex 3D primitives, enabling hierarchical editing of structures or details. Image generation uses a flow-based model conditioned on depth and modified texture hints.

Result: Experiments show superior performance in visual fidelity, editability, and compositional generalization compared to prior works.

Conclusion: The method provides an effective way to manipulate scene geometry and render images with high fidelity and texture consistency after edits, advancing interactive image generation technologies.

Abstract: We describe Generative Blocks World to interact with the scene of a generated
image by manipulating simple geometric abstractions. Our method represents
scenes as assemblies of convex 3D primitives, and the same scene can be
represented by different numbers of primitives, allowing an editor to move
either whole structures or small details. Once the scene geometry has been
edited, the image is generated by a flow-based method which is conditioned on
depth and a texture hint. Our texture hint takes into account the modified 3D
primitives, exceeding texture-consistency provided by existing key-value
caching techniques. These texture hints (a) allow accurate object and camera
moves and (b) largely preserve the identity of objects depicted. Quantitative
and qualitative experiments demonstrate that our approach outperforms prior
works in visual fidelity, editability, and compositional generalization.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome limitations in prior models that entangle hair and face modeling, thus hindering flexible editing and synthesis of 3D human heads.

Method: The paper introduces a template-based 3D Gaussian Splatting representation and a GAN architecture with dual generators and cross-attention mechanisms, trained on synthetic renderings.

Result: The model effectively achieves unconditional full-head synthesis and facilitates flexible hairstyle editing, validated through qualitative and quantitative comparisons with state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: 3DGH successfully separates hair and face modeling, improving the capabilities of 3D head generation and editing, and demonstrating advancements over existing methodologies.

Abstract: We present 3DGH, an unconditional generative model for 3D human heads with
composable hair and face components. Unlike previous work that entangles the
modeling of hair and face, we propose to separate them using a novel data
representation with template-based 3D Gaussian Splatting, in which deformable
hair geometry is introduced to capture the geometric variations across
different hairstyles. Based on this data representation, we design a 3D
GAN-based architecture with dual generators and employ a cross-attention
mechanism to model the inherent correlation between hair and face. The model is
trained on synthetic renderings using carefully designed objectives to
stabilize training and facilitate hair-face separation. We conduct extensive
experiments to validate the design choice of 3DGH, and evaluate it both
qualitatively and quantitatively by comparing with several state-of-the-art 3D
GAN methods, demonstrating its effectiveness in unconditional full-head image
synthesis and composable 3D hairstyle editing. More details will be available

*Jiayi Zheng,Xiaodong Cun*

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: FairyGen is a system for turning a child’s drawing into a story-driven cartoon video, incorporating structured storytelling, visual style preservation, and cinematic shot design.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create story-driven cartoon animations from children's drawings while maintaining their artistic style and ensuring coherent storytelling.

Method: FairyGen uses an MLLM to generate structured storyboards, style-propagation adapters to preserve artistic style, motion customization for realistic animations, and diffusion models for video generation.

Result: FairyGen achieves animations that are narratively structured, stylistically faithful, and showcase natural motion, enhancing personalized storytelling experiences.

Conclusion: FairyGen demonstrates significant advancements in automated and style-consistent storytelling through animations, highlighting its potential for creative applications in personalized cartoon production.

Abstract: We propose FairyGen, an automatic system for generating story-driven cartoon
videos from a single child's drawing, while faithfully preserving its unique
artistic style. Unlike previous storytelling methods that primarily focus on
character consistency and basic motion, FairyGen explicitly disentangles
character modeling from stylized background generation and incorporates
cinematic shot design to support expressive and coherent storytelling. Given a
single character sketch, we first employ an MLLM to generate a structured
storyboard with shot-level descriptions that specify environment settings,
character actions, and camera perspectives. To ensure visual consistency, we
introduce a style propagation adapter that captures the character's visual
style and applies it to the background, faithfully retaining the character's
full visual identity while synthesizing style-consistent scenes. A shot design
module further enhances visual diversity and cinematic quality through frame
cropping and multi-view synthesis based on the storyboard. To animate the
story, we reconstruct a 3D proxy of the character to derive physically
plausible motion sequences, which are then used to fine-tune an MMDiT-based
image-to-video diffusion model. We further propose a two-stage motion
customization adapter: the first stage learns appearance features from
temporally unordered frames, disentangling identity from motion; the second
stage models temporal dynamics using a timestep-shift strategy with frozen
identity weights. Once trained, FairyGen directly renders diverse and coherent
video scenes aligned with the storyboard. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that our system produces animations that are stylistically faithful,
narratively structured natural motion, highlighting its potential for
personalized and engaging story animation. The code will be available at

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: The paper introduces a hybrid quantum-classical reinforcement learning framework for stock market sector rotation, and highlights the gap between high training rewards achieved by quantum models and their underperformance in real-world investment metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the potential of quantum-enhanced reinforcement learning models in financial sector rotation while addressing challenges in reward design and performance discrepancies.

Method: The framework employs Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) and integrates classical models like LSTM and Transformers with quantum-enhanced models (QNN, QRWKV, QASA). Financial indicators are automatically extracted for consistent input, and performance is evaluated through backtesting and metrics.

Result: Quantum-enhanced models achieved better rewards during training but underperformed classical models in key investment metrics like cumulative return and Sharpe ratio due to issues like reward misalignment and quantum circuit instability.

Conclusion: The study highlights challenges in applying quantum RL in finance, such as the mismatch between reward signals and investment objectives, and suggests improvements like reward shaping, regularization, and early stopping to enhance deployment prospects.

Abstract: We propose a hybrid quantum-classical reinforcement learning framework for
sector rotation in the Taiwan stock market. Our system employs Proximal Policy
Optimization (PPO) as the backbone algorithm and integrates both classical

QASA) as policy and value networks. An automated feature engineering pipeline
extracts financial indicators from capital share data to ensure consistent
model input across all configurations. Empirical backtesting reveals a key
finding: although quantum-enhanced models consistently achieve higher training
rewards, they underperform classical models in real-world investment metrics
such as cumulative return and Sharpe ratio. This discrepancy highlights a core
challenge in applying reinforcement learning to financial domains -- namely,
the mismatch between proxy reward signals and true investment objectives. Our
analysis suggests that current reward designs may incentivize overfitting to
short-term volatility rather than optimizing risk-adjusted returns. This issue
is compounded by the inherent expressiveness and optimization instability of
quantum circuits under Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) constraints. We
discuss the implications of this reward-performance gap and propose directions
for future improvement, including reward shaping, model regularization, and
validation-based early stopping. Our work offers a reproducible benchmark and
critical insights into the practical challenges of deploying quantum
reinforcement learning in real-world finance.

*Matteo Guardiani,Vincent Eberle,Margret Westerkamp,Julian Rüstig,Philipp Frank,Torsten Enßlin*

Main category: astro-ph.IM

TL;DR: This paper introduces a Bayesian model for reconstructing astrophysical emission using latent-space diagnostics, applied to synthetic and observational X-ray data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the challenge of accurately separating astrophysical components from complex observational data affected by noise and instrument effects.

Method: A multi-frequency Bayesian model that uses latent-space tension to identify and correct model misspecifications, enabling automated reconstruction and separation of emission components.

Result: Demonstrated precise astrophysical reconstruction on both synthetic data and observational X-ray data (eROSITA), showcasing high accuracy in localization, emission separation, and uncertainty quantification.

Conclusion: The methodology provides a robust and general framework for astronomical data analysis, suited for next-generation surveys and multi-wavelength datasets.

Abstract: Modern observatories are designed to deliver increasingly detailed views of
astrophysical signals. To fully realize the potential of these observations,
principled data-analysis methods are required to effectively separate and
reconstruct the underlying astrophysical components from data corrupted by
noise and instrumental effects. In this work, we introduce a novel
multi-frequency Bayesian model of the sky emission field that leverages
latent-space tension as an indicator of model misspecification, enabling
automated separation of diffuse, point-like, and extended astrophysical
emission components across wavelength bands. Deviations from latent-space prior
expectations are used as diagnostics for model misspecification, thus
systematically guiding the introduction of new sky components, such as
point-like and extended sources. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this
method on synthetic multi-frequency imaging data and apply it to observational
X-ray data from the eROSITA Early Data Release (EDR) of the SN1987A region in
the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC). Our results highlight the method's capability
to reconstruct astrophysical components with high accuracy, achieving sub-pixel
localization of point sources, robust separation of extended emission, and
detailed uncertainty quantification. The developed methodology offers a general
and well-founded framework applicable to a wide variety of astronomical
datasets, and is therefore well suited to support the analysis needs of
next-generation multi-wavelength and multi-messenger surveys.

*Alexander Selivanov,Philip Müller,Özgün Turgut,Nil Stolt-Ansó,Daniel Rückert*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: This paper introduces PTACL, a framework that uses multimodal contrastive learning to enhance ECG capabilities by integrating insights from CMR. It improves cardiac diagnostics using ECG.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ECG is cost-effective but lacks functional cardiac measurements like ventricular volumes, unlike the gold-standard CMR which is expensive and less accessible. Bridging this gap can enhance affordable diagnostics.

Method: The proposed PTACL framework combines ECG and CMR information using global and local contrastive loss methods to enrich ECG with functional cardiac data without extra learnable weights.

Result: PTACL outperformed baseline methods in tasks such as retrieving patients with similar cardiac phenotypes and predicting CMR-derived cardiac function parameters, validated on data from 27,951 subjects.

Conclusion: PTACL demonstrates the potential to enrich ECG diagnostics by leveraging CMR data, improving accessibility to functional cardiac insights in a cost-effective manner.

Abstract: An electrocardiogram (ECG) is a widely used, cost-effective tool for
detecting electrical abnormalities in the heart. However, it cannot directly
measure functional parameters, such as ventricular volumes and ejection
fraction, which are crucial for assessing cardiac function. Cardiac magnetic
resonance (CMR) is the gold standard for these measurements, providing detailed
structural and functional insights, but is expensive and less accessible. To
bridge this gap, we propose PTACL (Patient and Temporal Alignment Contrastive
Learning), a multimodal contrastive learning framework that enhances ECG
representations by integrating spatio-temporal information from CMR. PTACL uses
global patient-level contrastive loss and local temporal-level contrastive
loss. The global loss aligns patient-level representations by pulling ECG and
CMR embeddings from the same patient closer together, while pushing apart
embeddings from different patients. Local loss enforces fine-grained temporal
alignment within each patient by contrasting encoded ECG segments with
corresponding encoded CMR frames. This approach enriches ECG representations
with diagnostic information beyond electrical activity and transfers more
insights between modalities than global alignment alone, all without
introducing new learnable weights. We evaluate PTACL on paired ECG-CMR data
from 27,951 subjects in the UK Biobank. Compared to baseline approaches, PTACL
achieves better performance in two clinically relevant tasks: (1) retrieving
patients with similar cardiac phenotypes and (2) predicting CMR-derived cardiac
function parameters, such as ventricular volumes and ejection fraction. Our
results highlight the potential of PTACL to enhance non-invasive cardiac
diagnostics using ECG. The code is available at:

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: The paper introduces U-R-Veda, a deep learning model that integrates multiple advanced features to improve semantic segmentation of cardiac MRI images, achieving high accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate delineation of cardiac images is critical for diagnosing and managing cardiac disorders through automated medical image analysis.

Method: The proposed U-R-Veda model employs enhanced UNet architecture with convolution blocks, vision transformers, attention mechanisms, and edge-detection skip-connections to extract features and enhance segmentation accuracy.

Result: U-R-Veda achieves an impressive average accuracy of 95.2% based on DSC metrics, outperforming other models, especially in delineating right ventricle and left ventricle myocardium.

Conclusion: The model demonstrates significant improvements in automated cardiac image segmentation and could be transformative for medical image analysis and cardiac disorder diagnosis.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence, including deep learning models, will play a
transformative role in automated medical image analysis for the diagnosis of
cardiac disorders and their management. Automated accurate delineation of
cardiac images is the first necessary initial step for the quantification and
automated diagnosis of cardiac disorders. In this paper, we propose a deep
learning based enhanced UNet model, U-R-Veda, which integrates convolution
transformations, vision transformer, residual links, channel-attention, and
spatial attention, together with edge-detection based skip-connections for an
accurate fully-automated semantic segmentation of cardiac magnetic resonance
(CMR) images. The model extracts local-features and their interrelationships
using a stack of combination convolution blocks, with embedded channel and
spatial attention in the convolution block, and vision transformers. Deep
embedding of channel and spatial attention in the convolution block identifies
important features and their spatial localization. The combined edge
information with channel and spatial attention as skip connection reduces
information-loss during convolution transformations. The overall model
significantly improves the semantic segmentation of CMR images necessary for
improved medical image analysis. An algorithm for the dual attention module
(channel and spatial attention) has been presented. Performance results show
that U-R-Veda achieves an average accuracy of 95.2%, based on DSC metrics. The
model outperforms the accuracy attained by other models, based on DSC and HD
metrics, especially for the delineation of right-ventricle and
left-ventricle-myocardium.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The adoption of 3D ultrasound (US) in liver tumor ablation is limited due to challenges in tumor identification in US images. The need is to improve this integration into clinical workflows.

Method: The proposed framework includes a 2D US-CT/MRI registration method using 3D US as an intermediary to simplify registration. Additionally, a multimodal image visualization technique was employed for verification.

Result: The 2D US-CT/MRI registration achieved a landmark distance error of 2-4 mm with a runtime of 0.22s per image pair. Non-rigid registration reduced alignment error by 40% against rigid registration.

Conclusion: The framework effectively integrates 3D US into liver tumor ablation workflows, demonstrating improved registration performance and potential to enhance therapeutic applications in clinical settings.

Abstract: 3D ultrasound (US) imaging has shown significant benefits in enhancing the
outcomes of percutaneous liver tumour ablation. Its clinical integration is
crucial for transitioning 3D US into the therapeutic domain. However,
challenges of tumour identification in US images continue to hinder its broader
adoption. In this work, we propose a novel framework for integrating 3D US into
the standard ablation workflow. We present a key component, a clinically viable
2D US-CT/MRI registration approach, leveraging 3D US as an intermediary to
reduce registration complexity. To facilitate efficient verification of the
registration workflow, we also propose an intuitive multimodal image
visualization technique. In our study, 2D US-CT/MRI registration achieved a
landmark distance error of approximately 2-4 mm with a runtime of 0.22s per
image pair. Additionally, non-rigid registration reduced the mean alignment
error by approximately 40% compared to rigid registration. Results demonstrated
the efficacy of the proposed 2D US-CT/MRI registration workflow. Our
integration framework advanced the capabilities of 3D US imaging in improving
percutaneous tumour ablation, demonstrating the potential to expand the
therapeutic role of 3D US in clinical interventions.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a deep learning-based method for spectral analysis that enhances accuracy in the presence of B0 inhomogeneity by using modeled spectra. Results show significant improvement compared to traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need to address inaccuracies in spectral analysis caused by static magnetic field (B0) inhomogeneity during MR spectroscopy.

Method: The approach involves utilizing a deep learning model trained on modeled spectra derived from B0 maps and metabolite ratios. The B0 map was split into subregion patches, and metabolite components were averaged. These models were then compared to both simulated and measured spectra.

Result: The proposed method demonstrated reduced mean squared errors (MSEs) and mean absolute percentage errors (MAPEs) compared to traditional LCModel analysis, with performance improving as the number of modeled spectra increased.

Conclusion: The proposed deep learning model using modeled spectra significantly enhances the accuracy of spectral analysis, demonstrating potential for mitigating the effects of B0 inhomogeneity.

Abstract: Purpose:To develop a method that enhances the accuracy of spectral analysis
in the presence of static magnetic field B0 inhomogeneity. Methods:The authors
proposed a new spectral analysis method utilizing a deep learning model trained
on modeled spectra that consistently represent the spectral variations induced
by B0 inhomogeneity. These modeled spectra were generated from the B0 map and
metabolite ratios of the healthy human brain. The B0 map was divided into a
patch size of subregions, and the separately estimated metabolites and baseline
components were averaged and then integrated. The quality of the modeled
spectra was visually and quantitatively evaluated against the measured spectra.
The analysis models were trained using measured, simulated, and modeled
spectra. The performance of the proposed method was assessed using mean squared
errors (MSEs) of metabolite ratios. The mean absolute percentage errors (MAPEs)
of the metabolite ratios were also compared to LCModel when analyzing the
phantom spectra acquired under two types of B0 inhomogeneity. Results:The
modeled spectra exhibited broadened and narrowed spectral peaks depending on
the B0 inhomogeneity and were quantitatively close to the measured spectra. The
analysis model trained using measured spectra with modeled spectra improved
MSEs by 49.89% compared to that trained using measured spectra alone, and by
26.66% compared to that trained using measured spectra with simulated spectra.
The performance improved as the number of modeled spectra increased from 0 to
1,000. This model showed significantly lower MAPEs than LCModel under both
types of B0 inhomogeneity. Conclusion:A new spectral analysis-trained deep
learning model using the modeled spectra was developed. The results suggest
that the proposed method has the potential to improve the accuracy of spectral
analysis by increasing the training samples of spectra.

TL;DR: This study investigates how Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) can be optimized for 3D radiology report generation, achieving notable results in the AMOS-MM challenge.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve the automation and accuracy of radiology report generation, particularly in leveraging 3D imaging data using MLLMs.

Method: The paper explores various design elements for 3D MLLMs, including visual input formats, projectors, language models, and fine-tuning strategies. It also introduces knowledge-based report augmentation methods.

Result: The study improves GREEN score performance by up to 10% and achieves 2nd place in the MICCAI 2024 AMOS-MM challenge. It finds that the size of the LLM and volume size adjustments have nuanced effects on performance, while adding segmentation masks enhances results.

Conclusion: RRG can benefit from targeted adjustments in design features and augmentation strategies, and the approach is not highly dependent on the size of the LLM when processes are standardized.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have emerged as a promising way to
automate Radiology Report Generation (RRG). In this work, we systematically
investigate the design space of 3D MLLMs, including visual input
representation, projectors, Large Language Models (LLMs), and fine-tuning
techniques for 3D CT report generation. We also introduce two knowledge-based
report augmentation methods that improve performance on the GREEN score by up
to 10\%, achieving the 2nd place on the MICCAI 2024 AMOS-MM challenge. Our
results on the 1,687 cases from the AMOS-MM dataset show that RRG is largely
independent of the size of LLM under the same training protocol. We also show
that larger volume size does not always improve performance if the original ViT
was pre-trained on a smaller volume size. Lastly, we show that using a
segmentation mask along with the CT volume improves performance. The code is

*Jing Yang,Qunliang Xing,Mai Xu,Minglang Qiao*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: The paper proposes an Advanced DCT-domain JPEG Quality Enhancement (AJQE) method that leverages correlations in JPEG DCT coefficients to improve image quality efficiently.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve JPEG image quality while reducing computational costs by addressing the limitations of existing pixel-based and DCT-domain enhancement methods.

Method: The proposed AJQE method identifies and exploits two types of correlations in DCT coefficients, adapting pixel-domain enhancement models to the DCT domain.

Result: The AJQE method achieves a significant performance improvement, showing a 0.35 dB gain in PSNR and 60.5% higher enhancement throughput compared to pixel-domain methods.

Conclusion: The AJQE method offers a superior, efficient approach for JPEG quality enhancement by optimizing the use of DCT-domain data and leveraging existing models.

Abstract: Joint Photographic Experts Group (JPEG) achieves data compression by
quantizing Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) coefficients, which inevitably
introduces compression artifacts. Most existing JPEG quality enhancement
methods operate in the pixel domain, suffering from the high computational
costs of decoding. Consequently, direct enhancement of JPEG images in the DCT
domain has gained increasing attention. However, current DCT-domain methods
often exhibit limited performance. To address this challenge, we identify two
critical types of correlations within the DCT coefficients of JPEG images.
Building on this insight, we propose an Advanced DCT-domain JPEG Quality
Enhancement (AJQE) method that fully exploits these correlations. The AJQE
method enables the adaptation of numerous well-established pixel-domain models
to the DCT domain, achieving superior performance with reduced computational
complexity. Compared to the pixel-domain counterparts, the DCT-domain models
derived by our method demonstrate a 0.35 dB improvement in PSNR and a 60.5%
increase in enhancement throughput on average.

*Hojat Asgariandehkordi,Mostafa Sharifzadeh,Hassan Rivaz*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a zero-shot denoising approach for Ultrasound Coherent Plane Wave Compounding (CPWC) to improve image quality while maintaining frame rate and preserving anatomical structures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current CPWC techniques struggle with noise handling and require numerous transmissions for quality, which lowers frame rates and causes blurring in fast-moving targets.

Method: Zero-shot denoising framework using self-supervised residual learning. Transmission angles are divided into subsets to form images with varying noise levels, enabling a lightweight deep model to suppress noise and retain structures.

Result: The approach demonstrated superior contrast enhancement and anatomical structure preservation across simulations, phantom tests, and in vivo data, outperforming classical and deep learning-based denoising methods.

Conclusion: The proposed method is efficient, adaptable, and eliminates the need for paired data or domain-specific training, providing a robust denoising solution for CPWC imaging.

Abstract: Ultrasound Coherent Plane Wave Compounding (CPWC) enhances image contrast by
combining echoes from multiple steered transmissions. While increasing the
number of angles generally improves image quality, it drastically reduces the
frame rate and can introduce blurring artifacts in fast-moving targets.
Moreover, compounded images remain susceptible to noise, particularly when
acquired with a limited number of transmissions. We propose a zero-shot
denoising framework tailored for low-angle CPWC acquisitions, which enhances
contrast without relying on a separate training dataset. The method divides the
available transmission angles into two disjoint subsets, each used to form
compound images that include higher noise levels. The new compounded images are
then used to train a deep model via a self-supervised residual learning scheme,
enabling it to suppress incoherent noise while preserving anatomical
structures. Because angle-dependent artifacts vary between the subsets while
the underlying tissue response is similar, this physics-informed pairing allows
the network to learn to disentangle the inconsistent artifacts from the
consistent tissue signal. Unlike supervised methods, our model requires no
domain-specific fine-tuning or paired data, making it adaptable across
anatomical regions and acquisition setups. The entire pipeline supports
efficient training with low computational cost due to the use of a lightweight
architecture, which comprises only two convolutional layers. Evaluations on
simulation, phantom, and in vivo data demonstrate superior contrast enhancement
and structure preservation compared to both classical and deep learning-based
denoising methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Arabic dialect recognition is challenging due to linguistic diversity and lack of annotated datasets, especially for underrepresented dialects.

Method: Two hybrid models combining signal processing features (MFCC, DWT) with deep learning architectures (CNN, RNN) were trained on a dialect-filtered subset of the Common Voice Arabic dataset.

Result: The MFCC + CNN model outperformed DWT + RNN with a 91.2% accuracy, highlighting the superior performance of convolutional models with spectral features.

Conclusion: This study establishes a baseline for Arabic dialect recognition while proposing larger datasets, self-supervised learning, and advanced models like Transformers for future research.

Abstract: Arabic dialect recognition presents a significant challenge in speech
technology due to the linguistic diversity of Arabic and the scarcity of large
annotated datasets, particularly for underrepresented dialects. This research
investigates hybrid modeling strategies that integrate classical signal
processing techniques with deep learning architectures to address this problem
in low-resource scenarios. Two hybrid models were developed and evaluated: (1)
Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC) combined with a Convolutional Neural
Network (CNN), and (2) Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) features combined with
a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN). The models were trained on a dialect-filtered
subset of the Common Voice Arabic dataset, with dialect labels assigned based
on speaker metadata. Experimental results demonstrate that the MFCC + CNN
architecture achieved superior performance, with an accuracy of 91.2% and
strong precision, recall, and F1-scores, significantly outperforming the
Wavelet + RNN configuration, which achieved an accuracy of 66.5%. These
findings highlight the effectiveness of leveraging spectral features with
convolutional models for Arabic dialect recognition, especially when working
with limited labeled data. The study also identifies limitations related to
dataset size, potential regional overlaps in labeling, and model optimization,
providing a roadmap for future research. Recommendations for further
improvement include the adoption of larger annotated corpora, integration of
self-supervised learning techniques, and exploration of advanced neural
architectures such as Transformers. Overall, this research establishes a strong

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the limitations of using mel-spectrograms alone for mixed audio classification by leveraging subtle audio cues through additional features and improving model performance with refined labels and datasets.

Method: The method enhances mel-spectral features with additional audio features, introduces an agent-based label correction, and refines the training dataset by removing irrelevant data and incorporating external data.

Result: The system achieves a relative improvement of up to 14.7% for the CA-SDRi metric compared to the baseline in DCASE 2025 Challenge Task 4.

Conclusion: The proposed combination of additional features, enhanced label correction, and dataset refinement significantly improves the spatial semantic segmentation performance of an audio-tagging system.

Abstract: This technical report presents submission systems for Task 4 of the DCASE
2025 Challenge. This model incorporates additional audio features (spectral
roll-off and chroma features) into the embedding feature extracted from the
mel-spectral feature to im-prove the classification capabilities of an
audio-tagging model in the spatial semantic segmentation of sound scenes (S5)
system. This approach is motivated by the fact that mixed audio often contains
subtle cues that are difficult to capture with mel-spectrograms alone. Thus,
these additional features offer alterna-tive perspectives for the model.
Second, an agent-based label correction system is applied to the outputs
processed by the S5 system. This system reduces false positives, improving the
final class-aware signal-to-distortion ratio improvement (CA-SDRi) metric.
Finally, we refine the training dataset to enhance the classi-fication accuracy
of low-performing classes by removing irrele-vant samples and incorporating
external data. That is, audio mix-tures are generated from a limited number of
data points; thus, even a small number of out-of-class data points could
degrade model performance. The experiments demonstrate that the submit-ted
systems employing these approaches relatively improve CA-SDRi by up to 14.7%
compared to the baseline of DCASE 2025 Challenge Task 4.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Challenges in generating high-fidelity audio that capture the visual content nuances such as dynamics, environment, and temporal relationships.

Method: Three stages: foundational foley generation, interactive object-centric audio refinement, and targeted editing using natural language instructions integrated via multimodal reasoning.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance in video-to-audio generation and surpasses benchmarks in challenging scenarios.

Conclusion: Demonstrates the potential of structured reasoning with multimodal alignment for producing high-quality audio tailored to video content.

Abstract: While end-to-end video-to-audio generation has greatly improved, producing
high-fidelity audio that authentically captures the nuances of visual content
remains challenging. Like professionals in the creative industries, such
generation requires sophisticated reasoning about items such as visual
dynamics, acoustic environments, and temporal relationships. We present
\textbf{ThinkSound}, a novel framework that leverages Chain-of-Thought (CoT)
reasoning to enable stepwise, interactive audio generation and editing for
videos. Our approach decomposes the process into three complementary stages:
foundational foley generation that creates semantically coherent soundscapes,
interactive object-centric refinement through precise user interactions, and
targeted editing guided by natural language instructions. At each stage, a
multimodal large language model generates contextually aligned CoT reasoning
that guides a unified audio foundation model. Furthermore, we introduce
\textbf{AudioCoT}, a comprehensive dataset with structured reasoning
annotations that establishes connections between visual content, textual
descriptions, and sound synthesis. Experiments demonstrate that ThinkSound
achieves state-of-the-art performance in video-to-audio generation across both

### [352] [Structural System Identification via Validation and Adaptation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20799)
*Cristian López,Keegan J. Moore*

Main category: math.DS

TL;DR: The paper introduces a method for estimating equation parameters in complex systems using generative modeling and neural networks, validated through experiments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To integrate experimental data with scientific theories for understanding, validating, and predicting the dynamics of complex systems.

Method: A neural network generates parameter values by mapping random noise, producing fake accelerations compared to real data using loss functions. A discriminator network validates these parameters on independent datasets.

Result: Experiments, both analytical and real-world, demonstrate accurate parameter estimation and validation in nonlinear structural systems.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively identifies system structure, quantifies uncertainty, and validates models, offering robust accuracy in dynamic system analysis.

Abstract: Estimating the governing equation parameter values is essential for
integrating experimental data with scientific theory to understand, validate,
and predict the dynamics of complex systems. In this work, we propose a new
method for structural system identification (SI), uncertainty quantification,
and validation directly from data. Inspired by generative modeling frameworks,
a neural network maps random noise to physically meaningful parameters. These
parameters are then used in the known equation of motion to obtain fake
accelerations, which are compared to real training data via a mean square error
loss. To simultaneously validate the learned parameters, we use independent
validation datasets. The generated accelerations from these datasets are
evaluated by a discriminator network, which determines whether the output is
real or fake, and guides the parameter-generator network. Analytical and real
experiments show the parameter estimation accuracy and model validation for
different nonlinear structural systems.

### [353] [Poster: Enhancing GNN Robustness for Network Intrusion Detection via Agent-based Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20806)
*Zhonghao Zhan,Huichi Zhou,Hamed Haddadi*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel method using LLM-based agents to enhance the robustness of GNNs in intrusion detection, especially against adversarial attacks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current GNN-based intrusion systems struggle with distribution drift and adversarial robustness, and there is a lack of realistic evaluation methods for adversarial attacks.

Method: The approach integrates Large Language Models as simulated cybersecurity agents to analyze graph structures, identifying adversarial elements before GNN processing.

Result: Experiments with realistic datasets show significant improvement in the resilience of GNN-based NIDS when LLM analysis is incorporated.

Conclusion: LLM-based analysis can act as a valuable complementary layer to increase robustness and generalization in GNN intrusion detection systems.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) show great promise for Network Intrusion
Detection Systems (NIDS), particularly in IoT environments, but suffer
performance degradation due to distribution drift and lack robustness against
realistic adversarial attacks. Current robustness evaluations often rely on
unrealistic synthetic perturbations and lack demonstrations on systematic
analysis of different kinds of adversarial attack, which encompass both
black-box and white-box scenarios. This work proposes a novel approach to
enhance GNN robustness and generalization by employing Large Language Models
(LLMs) in an agentic pipeline as simulated cybersecurity expert agents. These
agents scrutinize graph structures derived from network flow data, identifying
and potentially mitigating suspicious or adversarially perturbed elements
before GNN processing. Our experiments, using a framework designed for
realistic evaluation and testing with a variety of adversarial attacks
including a dataset collected from physical testbed experiments, demonstrate
that integrating LLM analysis can significantly improve the resilience of
GNN-based NIDS against challenges, showcasing the potential of LLM agent as a
complementary layer in intrusion detection architectures.

### [354] [ZKPROV: A Zero-Knowledge Approach to Dataset Provenance for Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20915)
*Mina Namazi,Alexander Nemecek,Erman Ayday*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: ZKPROV is a cryptographic framework ensuring zero-knowledge proofs of LLM provenance, aiding sensitive domains like healthcare.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Ensuring trustworthy LLM provenance in sensitive sectors such as healthcare, where dataset usage regulations exist.

Method: Cryptographic framework using dataset-signed metadata and compact model parameter commitments to bind trained models to authorized datasets.

Result: Demonstrated efficiency, scalability, and security in generating and verifying proofs in real-world deployments.

Conclusion: ZKPROV ensures dataset confidentiality, preserves privacy, and provides reliable assurances for LLM computational provenance.

Abstract: As the deployment of large language models (LLMs) grows in sensitive domains,
ensuring the integrity of their computational provenance becomes a critical
challenge, particularly in regulated sectors such as healthcare, where strict
requirements are applied in dataset usage. We introduce ZKPROV, a novel
cryptographic framework that enables zero-knowledge proofs of LLM provenance.
It allows users to verify that a model is trained on a reliable dataset without
revealing sensitive information about it or its parameters. Unlike prior
approaches that focus on complete verification of the training process
(incurring significant computational cost) or depend on trusted execution
environments, ZKPROV offers a distinct balance. Our method cryptographically
binds a trained model to its authorized training dataset(s) through
zero-knowledge proofs while avoiding proof of every training step. By
leveraging dataset-signed metadata and compact model parameter commitments,
ZKPROV provides sound and privacy-preserving assurances that the result of the
LLM is derived from a model trained on the claimed authorized and relevant
dataset. Experimental results demonstrate the efficiency and scalability of the
ZKPROV in generating this proof and verifying it, achieving a practical
solution for real-world deployments. We also provide formal security
guarantees, proving that our approach preserves dataset confidentiality while
ensuring trustworthy dataset provenance.

Result: PhishKey achieves up to 98.70% F1 Score and demonstrates resilience against adversarial manipulations like injection attacks, sustaining minimal performance degradation.

Conclusion: PhishKey proves effective in improving phishing detection accuracy and robustness against complex adversarial tactics.

Abstract: Phishing attacks pose a significant cybersecurity threat, evolving rapidly to
bypass detection mechanisms and exploit human vulnerabilities. This paper
introduces PhishKey to address the challenges of adaptability, robustness, and
efficiency. PhishKey is a novel phishing detection method using automatic
feature extraction from hybrid sources. PhishKey combines character-level
processing with Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for URL classification, and
a Centroid-Based Key Component Phishing Extractor (CAPE) for HTML content at
the word level. CAPE reduces noise and ensures complete sample processing
avoiding crop operations on the input data. The predictions from both modules
are integrated using a soft-voting ensemble to achieve more accurate and
reliable classifications. Experimental evaluations on four state-of-the-art
datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of PhishKey. It achieves up to 98.70% F1
Score and shows strong resistance to adversarial manipulations such as
injection attacks with minimal performance degradation.

### [356] [Empowering Digital Agriculture: A Privacy-Preserving Framework for Data Sharing and Collaborative Research](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20872)
*Osama Zafar,Rosemarie Santa González,Mina Namazi,Alfonso Morales,Erman Ayday*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper proposes a privacy-preserving framework for data-sharing in agriculture by using techniques like PCA, differential privacy, and federated learning to address privacy concerns while maintaining data utility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Farmers are hesitant to share their data due to privacy risks like discrimination and resource manipulation, which hinders progress in data-driven agriculture.

Method: The framework applies dimensionality reduction (e.g., PCA), Laplacian noise for differential privacy, and techniques like federated learning to facilitate secure data sharing and collaboration.

Result: Experiments on real-life datasets demonstrated robust privacy protection against attacks and utility performance comparable to centralized systems.

Conclusion: Adopting the framework can enable secure data integration, help policymakers and researchers innovate responsibly, and drive sustainable advances in agricultural data systems.

Abstract: Data-driven agriculture, which integrates technology and data into
agricultural practices, has the potential to improve crop yield, disease
resilience, and long-term soil health. However, privacy concerns, such as
adverse pricing, discrimination, and resource manipulation, deter farmers from
sharing data, as it can be used against them. To address this barrier, we
propose a privacy-preserving framework that enables secure data sharing and
collaboration for research and development while mitigating privacy risks. The
framework combines dimensionality reduction techniques (like Principal
Component Analysis (PCA)) and differential privacy by introducing Laplacian
noise to protect sensitive information. The proposed framework allows
researchers to identify potential collaborators for a target farmer and train
personalized machine learning models either on the data of identified
collaborators via federated learning or directly on the aggregated
privacy-protected data. It also allows farmers to identify potential
collaborators based on similarities. We have validated this on real-life
datasets, demonstrating robust privacy protection against adversarial attacks
and utility performance comparable to a centralized system. We demonstrate how
this framework can facilitate collaboration among farmers and help researchers
pursue broader research objectives. The adoption of the framework can empower
researchers and policymakers to leverage agricultural data responsibly, paving
the way for transformative advances in data-driven agriculture. By addressing
critical privacy challenges, this work supports secure data integration,
fostering innovation and sustainability in agricultural systems.

### [357] [When Servers Meet Species: A Fab-to-Grave Lens on Computing's Biodiversity Impact](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20442)
*Tianyao Shi,Ritbik Kumar,Inez Hua,Yi Ding*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: The paper investigates the overlooked relationship between computing and biodiversity loss, introducing metrics and a modeling framework to assess this impact.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address the gap in sustainability research in computing that has largely focused on carbon and water while neglecting biodiversity due to the absence of suitable metrics.

Method: The authors propose two metrics, Embodied Biodiversity Index (EBI) and Operational Biodiversity Index (OBI), and develop a modeling framework called FABRIC to analyze computing systems' impact on biodiversity.

Result: The evaluation demonstrates the necessity of incorporating biodiversity considerations into computing system design and optimization for sustainability.

Conclusion: The paper emphasizes that biodiversity should be a critical factor in sustainable computing practices and provides tools to integrate it into system analysis.

Abstract: Biodiversity loss is a critical planetary boundary, yet its connection to
computing remains largely unexamined. Prior sustainability efforts in computing
have focused on carbon and water, overlooking biodiversity due to the lack of
appropriate metrics and modeling frameworks. This paper presents the first
end-to-end analysis of biodiversity impact from computing systems. We introduce
two new metrics--Embodied Biodiversity Index (EBI) and Operational Biodiversity
Index (OBI)--to quantify biodiversity impact across the lifecycle, and present
FABRIC, a modeling framework that links computing workloads to biodiversity
impacts. Our evaluation highlights the need to consider biodiversity alongside
carbon and water in sustainable computing design and optimization. The code is
available at https://github.com/TianyaoShi/FABRIC.

### [358] [Our Coding Adventure: Using LLMs to Personalise the Narrative of a Tangible Programming Robot for Preschoolers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20982)
*Martin Ruskov*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: The paper proposes a method to integrate Large Language Models (LLMs) into education by enabling teachers to generate personalized narratives for preschool children using the Cubetto robot without exposing them directly to LLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address challenges in using LLMs in education, particularly with young children, due to risks like excessive screen time and potential misunderstanding of the technology.

Method: The paper introduces an action research approach using open weight LLMs to generate personalized storytelling material for preschool children. This process involves testing the models on 4 task scenarios and analyzing issues like consistency and hallucinations.

Result: The approach was successful in aiding teachers with storytelling, using 5 different LLMs. Challenges like consistency and hallucinations were identified, and solutions were partially effective.

Conclusion: The method enables teachers to leverage LLMs indirectly for educational purposes while avoiding exposing children directly to the technology. The approach is suitable for preschool classes and will be tested in real-world educational settings.

Abstract: Finding balanced ways to employ Large Language Models (LLMs) in education is
a challenge due to inherent risks of poor understanding of the technology and
of a susceptible audience. This is particularly so with younger children, who
are known to have difficulties with pervasive screen time. Working with a
tangible programming robot called Cubetto, we propose an approach to benefit
from the capabilities of LLMs by employing such models in the preparation of
personalised storytelling, necessary for preschool children to get accustomed
to the practice of commanding the robot. We engage in action research to
develop an early version of a formalised process to rapidly prototype game
stories for Cubetto. Our approach has both reproducible results, because it
employs open weight models, and is model-agnostic, because we test it with 5
different LLMs. We document on one hand the process, the used materials and
prompts, and on the other the learning experience and outcomes. We deem the
generation successful for the intended purposes of using the results as a
teacher aid. Testing the models on 4 different task scenarios, we encounter
issues of consistency and hallucinations and document the corresponding
evaluation process and attempts (some successful and some not) to overcome
these issues. Importantly, the process does not expose children to LLMs
directly. Rather, the technology is used to help teachers easily develop
personalised narratives on children's preferred topics. We believe our method
is adequate for preschool classes and we are planning to further experiment in
real-world educational settings.

*Andréa Ducos,Audrey Denizot,Thomas Guyet,Hugues Berry*

Main category: q-bio.QM

TL;DR: The paper addresses challenges in characterizing biological systems using PDE discovery techniques to link micro-scale data to meso-scale dynamics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Biological systems are complex, multi-scale, and governed by partly unknown principles, posing challenges in characterizing their behavior.

Method: The authors integrate particle-based simulations with PDE discovery and evaluate five methods on calcium diffusion data from astrocytes.

Result: Several methods successfully recovered the diffusion term and captured macroscopic dynamics from microscopic data.

Conclusion: PDE discovery shows promise for understanding biological systems by bridging micro and meso scales, as preliminarily demonstrated in the experiments.

Abstract: Biological systems are non-linear, include unobserved variables and the
physical principles that govern their dynamics are partly unknown. This makes
the characterization of their behavior very challenging. Notably, their
activity occurs on multiple interdependent spatial and temporal scales that
require linking mechanisms across scales. To address the challenge of bridging
gaps between scales, we leverage partial differential equations (PDE)
discovery. PDE discovery suggests meso-scale dynamics characteristics from
micro-scale data. In this article, we present our framework combining
particle-based simulations and PDE discovery and conduct preliminary
experiments to assess equation discovery in controlled settings. We evaluate
five state-of-the-art PDE discovery methods on particle-based simulations of
calcium diffusion in astrocytes. The performances of the methods are evaluated
on both the form of the discovered equation and the forecasted temporal
variations of calcium concentration. Our results show that several methods
accurately recover the diffusion term, highlighting the potential of PDE
discovery for capturing macroscopic dynamics in biological systems from
microscopic data.
