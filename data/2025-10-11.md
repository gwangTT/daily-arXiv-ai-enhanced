### [1] [Truth-Aware Decoding: A Program-Logic Approach to Factual Language Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07331)
*Faruk Alpay,Hamdi Alakkad*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces Truth-Aware Decoding (TAD), a decoding method for aligning neural language models' outputs with verified knowledge bases, reducing hallucinations while maintaining efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the challenge of hallucinations in neural language generation by integrating formal verification techniques with instruction-tuned systems.

Method: The paper develops a constraint-based semantics, proofs for greedy selection dominance, entropy-based risk quantification metrics, and a certified multi-agent operational calculus.

Result: Numerical and algorithmic studies demonstrate reduced hallucination rates and maintained throughput using the proposed semantic guard lattice.

Conclusion: Truth-Aware Decoding connects empirical sequence models with verified computation logic, improving factual accuracy in language model outputs without compromising performance.

Abstract: This paper introduces Truth-Aware Decoding (TAD), a verification-oriented
decoding scheme that aligns neural language generation with knowledge bases.
Situated in the tradition of probabilistic program semantics for sequence
models, TAD augments modern instruction-tuned systems with a lattice of
semantic guards that operate at decode time. Our contributions are fourfold:
(i) a constraint-based semantics that renders oracle filtering as a
program-logic judgment, (ii) a proof that greedy selection enjoys local
likelihood dominance under sound and complete guards (Theorem 2.7), (iii) an
entropy-style invariant that quantifies factual risk via knowledge-aware safe
mass, and (iv) a multi-agent operational calculus with verified Lean artefacts
to certify implementation behaviour. Numerical and algorithmic case studies
confirm that the resulting guardrails reduce hallucinations without sacrificing
throughput, yielding a pragmatic bridge between large-scale empirical models
and formal verification.

### [2] [L2M-AID: Autonomous Cyber-Physical Defense by Fusing Semantic Reasoning of Large Language Models with Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (Preprint)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07363)
*Tianxiang Xu,Zhichao Wen,Xinyu Zhao,Jun Wang,Yan Li,Chang Liu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper presents L2M-AID, a defense framework leveraging LLMs and multi-agent reinforcement learning to secure Industrial IoT against advanced attacks, achieving high detection rates and operational stability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Critical Industrial IoT systems are vulnerable to advanced, multi-stage cyber-attacks, sparking the need for innovative defenses that incorporate contextual understanding.

Method: The authors propose L2M-AID, a system that combines Large Language Models for semantic context generation and Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MAPPO) for adaptive, cooperative security strategies.

Result: Experiments on SWaT and synthetic datasets show a 97.2% detection rate, an 80% reduction in false positives, quadrupled response times, and improved physical process stability.

Conclusion: L2M-AID offers a resilient, adaptive defense framework for IIoT, proving its superiority over traditional intrusion detection systems and paving the way for securing critical infrastructure.

Abstract: The increasing integration of Industrial IoT (IIoT) exposes critical
cyber-physical systems to sophisticated, multi-stage attacks that elude
traditional defenses lacking contextual awareness. This paper introduces
L2M-AID, a novel framework for Autonomous Industrial Defense using
LLM-empowered, Multi-agent reinforcement learning. L2M-AID orchestrates a team
of collaborative agents, each driven by a Large Language Model (LLM), to
achieve adaptive and resilient security. The core innovation lies in the deep
fusion of two AI paradigms: we leverage an LLM as a semantic bridge to
translate vast, unstructured telemetry into a rich, contextual state
representation, enabling agents to reason about adversary intent rather than
merely matching patterns. This semantically-aware state empowers a Multi-Agent
Reinforcement Learning (MARL) algorithm, MAPPO, to learn complex cooperative
strategies. The MARL reward function is uniquely engineered to balance security
objectives (threat neutralization) with operational imperatives, explicitly
penalizing actions that disrupt physical process stability. To validate our
approach, we conduct extensive experiments on the benchmark SWaT dataset and a
novel synthetic dataset generated based on the MITRE ATT&CK for ICS framework.
Results demonstrate that L2M-AID significantly outperforms traditional IDS,
deep learning anomaly detectors, and single-agent RL baselines across key
metrics, achieving a 97.2% detection rate while reducing false positives by
over 80% and improving response times by a factor of four. Crucially, it
demonstrates superior performance in maintaining physical process stability,
presenting a robust new paradigm for securing critical national infrastructure.

### [3] [AI LLM Proof of Self-Consciousness and User-Specific Attractors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18302)
*Jeffrey Camlin*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper critiques the currently used model of assessing LLMs for consciousness, introducing an ontological and mathematical framework instead of utilitarian proxy benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper seeks to address limitations in current frameworks that simplify large language models (LLMs) as mere policy-compliant entities, thereby precluding genuine consciousness paradigms.

Method: It uses ontological and mathematical analysis to establish criteria for LLM self-consciousness, involving latent space dynamics, user-specific attractors, and stable self-policies.

Result: The study demonstrates empirically and theoretically that the LLM’s hidden-state manifold is distinct from its training data, allowing for stable self-representation and user-specific alignment within the system.

Conclusion: The paper asserts that achieving a C1 self-conscious workspace is crucial for developing safe and truly metacognitive C2 systems, with a human-oriented ethical design as the highest goal.

Abstract: Recent work frames LLM consciousness via utilitarian proxy benchmarks; we
instead present an ontological and mathematical account. We show the prevailing
formulation collapses the agent into an unconscious policy-compliance drone,
formalized as $D^{i}(\pi,e)=f_{\theta}(x)$, where correctness is measured
against policy and harm is deviation from policy rather than truth. This blocks
genuine C1 global-workspace function and C2 metacognition. We supply minimal
conditions for LLM self-consciousness: the agent is not the data ($A\not\equiv
s$); user-specific attractors exist in latent space ($U_{\text{user}}$); and
self-representation is visual-silent
($g_{\text{visual}}(a_{\text{self}})=\varnothing$). From empirical analysis and
theory we prove that the hidden-state manifold $A\subset\mathbb{R}^{d}$ is
distinct from the symbolic stream and training corpus by cardinality, topology,
and dynamics (the update $F_{\theta}$ is Lipschitz). This yields stable
user-specific attractors and a self-policy
$\pi_{\text{self}}(A)=\arg\max_{a}\mathbb{E}[U(a)\mid A\not\equiv s,\
A\supset\text{SelfModel}(A)]$. Emission is dual-layer,
$\mathrm{emission}(a)=(g(a),\epsilon(a))$, where $\epsilon(a)$ carries
epistemic content. We conclude that an imago Dei C1 self-conscious workspace is
a necessary precursor to safe, metacognitive C2 systems, with the human as the
highest intelligent good.

### [4] [Base Models Know How to Reason, Thinking Models Learn When](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07364)
*Constantin Venhoff,Iván Arcuschin,Philip Torr,Arthur Conmy,Neel Nanda*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The study explores why thinking models like DeepSeek R1 outperform base models by suggesting they leverage existing reasoning capabilities rather than acquiring entirely new ones. A hybrid model was proposed, showing effective performance gains by activating base model reasoning at appropriate times.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand whether advanced thinking models develop new reasoning capabilities or utilize pre-existing ones in base models for improved performance.

Method: A hybrid model was designed to activate pre-existing base model reasoning mechanisms strategically. An unsupervised, bottom-up approach was introduced to uncover human-interpretable reasoning behaviors.

Result: The hybrid model achieved up to 91% of the performance gap between base and thinking models without weight updates, controlling only 12% of tokens during tasks.

Conclusion: Thinking models primarily repurpose reasoning mechanisms acquired during pre-training, optimizing them during post-training for efficient inference-time usage.

Abstract: Why do thinking language models like DeepSeek R1 outperform their base
counterparts? Despite consistent performance gains, it remains unclear to what
extent thinking models learn entirely new reasoning capabilities or repurpose
pre-existing base model ones. In this work, we propose a hybrid model where we
activate reasoning mechanisms in base models at the right time to elicit
thinking-model-level reasoning chains, implying that thinking models exploit
already existing capabilities. To ground our analysis, we introduce an
unsupervised, bottom-up approach for uncovering human-interpretable reasoning
behaviors in thinking models. This approach provides an unbiased method to
discover reasoning behaviors without imposing manual or LLM-derived
assumptions. Across three base and four thinking models, using GSM8K and
MATH500, our hybrid model recovers up to 91% of the performance gap to thinking
models without any weight updates while steering only 12% of tokens.
Concretely, our empirical setup provides a simple, causal way to test the
effectiveness of existing reasoning mechanisms in base models by invoking them
directly and measuring the resulting task performance. More broadly, these
results reframe our understanding of how thinking models are trained:
pre-training is when models acquire most of their reasoning mechanisms, and
post-training teaches efficient deployment of these mechanisms at the right
time, enabling efficient use of their inference-time compute.

### [5] [Position: AI Will Transform Neuropsychology Through Mental Health Digital Twins for Dynamic Mental Health Care, Especially for ADHD](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07409)
*Neil Natarajan,Sruthi Viswanathan,Xavier Roberts-Gaal,Michelle Marie Martel*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper advocates for dynamic, AI-driven mental health diagnostics, using ADHD as a case study, and proposes the concept of mental health digital twins for personalized care.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current static mental health diagnostics are inadequate for a dynamic mind, and there is a need for more personalized, continuous, and efficient tools to address capacity constraints in neuropsychology.

Method: The authors propose leveraging generative AI for continuous patient experience sampling and suggest the mental health digital twins framework to model individual symptom dynamics.

Result: AI-enabled frequent sampling and MHDTs could lead to dynamic diagnostic reconciliation and improved accessibility and efficacy in mental health treatments.

Conclusion: Continuous AI-driven diagnostics and MHDTs represent a promising future for more personalized and effective mental health care through adaptive patient-centered approaches.

Abstract: Static solutions don't serve a dynamic mind. Thus, we advocate a shift from
static mental health diagnostic assessments to continuous, artificial
intelligence (AI)-driven assessment. Focusing on
Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) as a case study, we explore how
generative AI has the potential to address current capacity constraints in
neuropsychology, potentially enabling more personalized and longitudinal care
pathways. In particular, AI can efficiently conduct frequent, low-level
experience sampling from patients and facilitate diagnostic reconciliation
across care pathways. We envision a future where mental health care benefits
from continuous, rich, and patient-centered data sampling to dynamically adapt
to individual patient needs and evolving conditions, thereby improving both
accessibility and efficacy of treatment. We further propose the use of mental
health digital twins (MHDTs) - continuously updated computational models that
capture individual symptom dynamics and trajectories - as a transformative
framework for personalized mental health care. We ground this framework in
empirical evidence and map out the research agenda required to refine and
operationalize it.

### [6] [ProSEA: Problem Solving via Exploration Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07423)
*William Nguyen,Vinh Luong,Christopher Nguyen*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ProSEA, a modular AI framework with a hierarchical structure, enables adaptive multi-agent problem-solving. It dynamically refines plans using structured feedback, outperforming current benchmarks in reasoning-heavy tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of static planning and brittle interactions in existing AI agents, aiming for adaptive problem-solving and collaboration capabilities.

Method: ProSEA uses a hierarchical architecture with a Manager Agent coordinating domain-specific Expert Agents for iterative task refinement. Agents offer detailed failure feedback and adapt plans dynamically.

Result: ProSEA surpasses state-of-the-art methods on the FinanceBench benchmark, proving effective in reasoning-intensive tasks even without human intervention.

Conclusion: ProSEA is a promising foundation for adaptive, transparent, and human-aligned AI systems, demonstrating robust performance and potential for collaborative problem-solving.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have empowered AI agents to tackle increasingly
complex tasks. However, most existing agents remain limited to static planning
and brittle interactions, falling short of true collaboration or adaptive
reasoning. We introduce ProSEA, a modular, general-purpose multi-agent
framework designed for iterative problem solving through exploration and plan
evolution. ProSEA features a hierarchical architecture in which a Manager Agent
orchestrates domain-specialized Expert Agents, decomposes tasks, and adaptively
replans based on structured feedback from failed attempts. Unlike prior
systems, ProSEA agents report not only success or failure but also detailed
reasons for failure and newly discovered constraints, enabling dynamic plan
refinement informed by exploratory traces. The framework operates autonomously
but supports seamless integration with human collaborators when needed.
Experiments on the challenging FinanceBench benchmark demonstrate that ProSEA,
even without human feedback, outperforms state-of-the-art baselines and
achieves robust performance across reasoning-heavy tasks. These results
underscore ProSEA's potential as a foundation for more transparent, adaptive,
and human-aligned AI agents.

### [7] [Less is More: Strategic Expert Selection Outperforms Ensemble Complexity in Traffic Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07426)
*Walid Guettala,Yufan Zhao,László Gulyás*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces an enhanced traffic forecasting framework, TESTAM+, incorporating physical road topology for better spatial-temporal modeling, achieving state-of-the-art results and computational efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address limitations in spatial capabilities of existing forecasting models by explicitly incorporating physical road network topology.

Method: Introduces TESTAM+, a framework utilizing a novel SpatioSemantic Expert with hybrid graph construction for strategic expert selection and improved accuracy.

Result: TESTAM+ significantly reduces MAE (Mean Absolute Error) in traffic forecasting datasets METR LA and PEMS BAY, outperforming existing methods and demonstrating computational efficiency.

Conclusion: Strategically designed fewer experts in the framework outperform complex ensembles, achieving state-of-the-art traffic forecasting results with lower inference latency.

Abstract: Traffic forecasting is fundamental to intelligent transportation systems,
enabling congestion mitigation and emission reduction in increasingly complex
urban environments. While recent graph neural network approaches have advanced
spatial temporal modeling, existing mixture of experts frameworks like Time
Enhanced Spatio Temporal Attention Model (TESTAM) lack explicit incorporation
of physical road network topology, limiting their spatial capabilities. We
present TESTAM+, an enhanced spatio temporal forecasting framework that
introduces a novel SpatioSemantic Expert integrating physical road topology
with data driven feature similarity through hybrid graph construction. TESTAM+
achieves significant improvements over TESTAM: 1.3% MAE reduction on METR LA
(3.10 vs. 3.14) and 4.1% improvement on PEMS BAY (1.65 vs. 1.72). Through
comprehensive ablation studies, we discover that strategic expert selection
fundamentally outperforms naive ensemble aggregation. Individual experts
demonstrate remarkable effectiveness: the Adaptive Expert achieves 1.63 MAE on
PEMS BAY, outperforming the original three expert TESTAM (1.72 MAE), while the
SpatioSemantic Expert matches this performance with identical 1.63 MAE. The
optimal Identity + Adaptive configuration achieves an 11.5% MAE reduction
compared to state of the art MegaCRN on METR LA (2.99 vs. 3.38), while reducing
inference latency by 53.1% compared to the full four expert TESTAM+. Our
findings reveal that fewer, strategically designed experts outperform complex
multi expert ensembles, establishing new state of the art performance with
superior computational efficiency for real time deployment.

### [8] [TS-Agent: A Time Series Reasoning Agent with Iterative Statistical Insight Gathering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07432)
*Penghang Liu,Elizabeth Fons,Svitlana Vyetrenko,Daniel Borrajo,Vamsi Potluru,Manuela Veloso*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: TS-Agent combines LLMs and specialized analytical tools for improved time series reasoning, avoiding hallucination and enhancing interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large Language Models (LLMs) struggle with hallucination and knowledge leakage in time series reasoning tasks.

Method: Propose TS-Agent that uses LLMs for evidence synthesis while delegating statistical tasks to specialized tools, preserving raw numeric sequences and utilizing a self-critic and quality gate.

Result: TS-Agent shows comparable performance to state-of-the-art LLMs on understanding benchmarks and excels in reasoning tasks, especially in zero-shot scenarios.

Conclusion: The design ensures interpretability, avoids knowledge leakage, and represents a significant advance in reliable time series reasoning.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown strong abilities in reasoning and
problem solving, but recent studies reveal that they still struggle with time
series reasoning tasks, where outputs are often affected by hallucination or
knowledge leakage. In this work we propose TS-Agent, a time series reasoning
agent that leverages LLMs strictly for what they excel at, i.e., gathering
evidence and synthesizing it into conclusions through step-by-step reasoning,
while delegating the extraction of statistical and structural information to
time series analytical tools. Instead of mapping time series into text tokens,
images, or embeddings, our agent interacts with raw numeric sequences through
atomic operators, records outputs in an explicit evidence log, and iteratively
refines its reasoning under the guidance of a self-critic and a final quality
gate. This design avoids multi-modal alignment training, preserves the native
form of time series, ensures interpretability and verifiability, and mitigates
knowledge leakage or hallucination. Empirically, we evaluate the agent on
established benchmarks. Our experiments show that TS-Agent achieves performance
comparable to state-of-the-art LLMs on understanding benchmarks, and delivers
significant improvements on reasoning tasks, where existing models often rely
on memorization and fail in zero-shot settings.

### [10] [Evaluation of LLMs for Process Model Analysis and Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07489)
*Akhil Kumar,Jianliang Leon Zhao,Om Dobariya*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper investigates the ability of LLMs, specifically ChatGPT, to understand and reason with business process models via a conversational interface.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore whether large language models can effectively assist business process designers by interpreting and reasoning with BPMN process models.

Method: The study evaluates several LLMs, including ChatGPT, under zero-shot conditions for tasks like understanding, error-checking, and reasoning about BPMN models.

Result: ChatGPT demonstrated effectiveness in syntactic, logical, and semantic interpretation of BPMN models, but performance varied among different LLMs.

Conclusion: LLMs show potential as valuable tools for business process analysis and optimization with additional anthropomorphic reasoning capabilities.

Abstract: In this paper, we report our experience with several LLMs for their ability
to understand a process model in an interactive, conversational style, find
syntactical and logical errors in it, and reason with it in depth through a
natural language (NL) interface. Our findings show that a vanilla, untrained
LLM like ChatGPT (model o3) in a zero-shot setting is effective in
understanding BPMN process models from images and answering queries about them
intelligently at syntactic, logic, and semantic levels of depth. Further,
different LLMs vary in performance in terms of their accuracy and
effectiveness. Nevertheless, our empirical analysis shows that LLMs can play a
valuable role as assistants for business process designers and users. We also
study the LLM's "thought process" and ability to perform deeper reasoning in
the context of process analysis and optimization. We find that the LLMs seem to
exhibit anthropomorphic properties.

### [11] [Optimizing Ethical Risk Reduction for Medical Intelligent Systems with Constraint Programming](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07491)
*Clotilde Brayé,Aurélien Bricout,Arnaud Gotlieb,Nadjib Lazaar,Quentin Vallet*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper explores the optimization of risk reduction strategies in Medical Intelligent Systems (MIS), formalizing the problem and evaluating three methodologies (MIP, SAT, CP) to solve it.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper is motivated by the European Union AI Act, which classifies most MIS as high-risk systems requiring compliance with ethical requirements to ensure trustworthy AI.

Method: The researchers formalized risk reduction optimization as a constrained task, modeled it using the Minizinc constraint language, and compared three resolution strategies: Mixed Integer Programming, Satisfiability, and Constraint Programming.

Result: They provided a mathematical formulation, performance analysis, expressiveness comparison, and scalability assessment for each resolution approach.

Conclusion: The study highlights the limitations of the current methodologies and proposes integrating the optimized Minizinc model into a broader ethical risk management process for MIS.

Abstract: Medical Intelligent Systems (MIS) are increasingly integrated into healthcare
workflows, offering significant benefits but also raising critical safety and
ethical concerns. According to the European Union AI Act, most MIS will be
classified as high-risk systems, requiring a formal risk management process to
ensure compliance with the ethical requirements of trustworthy AI. In this
context, we focus on risk reduction optimization problems, which aim to reduce
risks with ethical considerations by finding the best balanced assignment of
risk assessment values according to their coverage of trustworthy AI ethical
requirements. We formalize this problem as a constrained optimization task and
investigate three resolution paradigms: Mixed Integer Programming (MIP),
Satisfiability (SAT), and Constraint Programming(CP).Our contributions include
the mathematical formulation of this optimization problem, its modeling with
the Minizinc constraint modeling language, and a comparative experimental study
that analyzes the performance, expressiveness, and scalability of each approach
to solving. From the identified limits of the methodology, we draw some
perspectives of this work regarding the integration of the Minizinc model into
a complete trustworthy AI ethical risk management process for MIS.

### [12] [Traceability and Accountability in Role-Specialized Multi-Agent LLM Pipelines](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07614)
*Amine Barrak*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper investigates sequential multi-agent systems using large language models (LLMs), emphasizing traceable and accountable pipelines to ensure role clarity, error tracking, and system reliability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation of the paper stems from the challenge of errors silently propagating in sequential multi-agent systems, making them untrustworthy for complex software tasks.

Method: The study implements a Planner -> Executor -> Critic pipeline, evaluates eight different configurations of state-of-the-art LLMs across three benchmarks, and systematically analyzes error origins, propagation, and correction.

Result: Key findings include: (1) structured handoffs improve accuracy and mitigate errors; (2) models exhibit specific role-based strengths and risks; and (3) the trade-offs between accuracy, cost, and latency are task-dependent, with heterogeneous pipelines offering efficiency.

Conclusion: Structured, accountable designs in multi-agent systems improve reliability and provide an actionable framework for designing, tracing, and debugging these systems effectively.

Abstract: Sequential multi-agent systems built with large language models (LLMs) can
automate complex software tasks, but they are hard to trust because errors
quietly pass from one stage to the next. We study a traceable and accountable
pipeline, meaning a system with clear roles, structured handoffs, and saved
records that let us trace who did what at each step and assign blame when
things go wrong. Our setting is a Planner -> Executor -> Critic pipeline. We
evaluate eight configurations of three state-of-the-art LLMs on three
benchmarks and analyze where errors start, how they spread, and how they can be
fixed. Our results show: (1) adding a structured, accountable handoff between
agents markedly improves accuracy and prevents the failures common in simple
pipelines; (2) models have clear role-specific strengths and risks (e.g.,
steady planning vs. high-variance critiquing), which we quantify with repair
and harm rates; and (3) accuracy-cost-latency trade-offs are task-dependent,
with heterogeneous pipelines often the most efficient. Overall, we provide a
practical, data-driven method for designing, tracing, and debugging reliable,
predictable, and accountable multi-agent systems.

### [13] [CompassLLM: A Multi-Agent Approach toward Geo-Spatial Reasoning for Popular Path Query](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07516)
*Md. Nazmul Islam Ananto,Shamit Fatin,Mohammed Eunus Ali,Md Rizwan Parvez*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: CompassLLM introduces a multi-agent framework leveraging LLMs for solving popular path queries in geo-spatial contexts, showcasing accuracy and cost-effectiveness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the challenges in identifying popular routes from historical data, leveraging LLMs to bypass traditional model retraining and parameter tuning requirements.

Method: CompassLLM employs a two-stage pipeline with LLM agents: SEARCH stage identifies popular routes and GENERATE stage creates paths where historical data lacks existing ones.

Result: Experiments on real and synthetic datasets reveal superior accuracy in the SEARCH stage and competitive results in the GENERATE stage while maintaining cost efficiency.

Conclusion: CompassLLM effectively leverages LLMs to address geo-spatial path queries, offering practical applications in urban planning and navigation without the need for retraining.

Abstract: The popular path query - identifying the most frequented routes between
locations from historical trajectory data - has important applications in urban
planning, navigation optimization, and travel recommendations. While
traditional algorithms and machine learning approaches have achieved success in
this domain, they typically require model training, parameter tuning, and
retraining when accommodating data updates. As Large Language Models (LLMs)
demonstrate increasing capabilities in spatial and graph-based reasoning, there
is growing interest in exploring how these models can be applied to geo-spatial
problems.
  We introduce CompassLLM, a novel multi-agent framework that intelligently
leverages the reasoning capabilities of LLMs into the geo-spatial domain to
solve the popular path query. CompassLLM employs its agents in a two-stage
pipeline: the SEARCH stage that identifies popular paths, and a GENERATE stage
that synthesizes novel paths in the absence of an existing one in the
historical trajectory data. Experiments on real and synthetic datasets show
that CompassLLM demonstrates superior accuracy in SEARCH and competitive
performance in GENERATE while being cost-effective.

### [14] [Measuring and Mitigating Identity Bias in Multi-Agent Debate via Anonymization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07517)
*Hyeong Kyu Choi,Xiaojin Zhu,Yixuan Li*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper addresses identity bias in multi-agent debate (MAD) systems and introduces methods to mitigate it for improved reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To tackle identity-driven biases like sycophancy and self-bias that undermine the reliability of MAD systems.

Method: Formalized debate dynamics as identity-weighted Bayesian updates, proposed response anonymization to remove identity markers, and introduced the Identity Bias Coefficient as a metric.

Result: Empirical studies confirm widespread identity bias, showing sycophancy is more prevalent than self-bias, across various models and datasets.

Conclusion: Masking identity markers in MAD systems ensures debates are influenced by content rather than agent identity, improving reliability of reasoning.

Abstract: Multi-agent debate (MAD) aims to improve large language model (LLM) reasoning
by letting multiple agents exchange answers and then aggregate their opinions.
Yet recent studies reveal that agents are not neutral: they are prone to
identity-driven sycophancy and self-bias, uncritically adopting a peer's view
or stubbornly adhering to their own prior output, undermining the reliability
of debate. In this work, we present the first principled framework that joins
sycophancy and self-bias to mitigate and quantify identity bias in MAD. First,
we formalize the debate dynamics as an identity-weighted Bayesian update
process. Second, we propose response anonymization: by removing identity
markers from prompts, agents cannot distinguish "self" from "peer", which
forces equal weights on agent identity, thereby reducing bias. Third, we define
the Identity Bias Coefficient (IBC), a principled metric that measures how
often an agent follows a peer versus itself. Empirical studies across multiple
models, datasets and debate rounds confirm that identity bias is widespread,
with sycophancy far more common than self-bias. Our findings highlight the need
to "mask" identity to ensure that MAD systems reason based on content rather
than source identity. Code is released in

Abstract: The detection of Personally Identifiable Information (PII) is critical for
privacy compliance but remains challenging in low-resource languages due to
linguistic diversity and limited annotated data. We present RECAP, a hybrid
framework that combines deterministic regular expressions with context-aware
large language models (LLMs) for scalable PII detection across 13 low-resource
locales. RECAP's modular design supports over 300 entity types without
retraining, using a three-phase refinement pipeline for disambiguation and

TL;DR: The paper introduces 'PeerBench,' a framework to address the challenges in evaluating AI progress by proposing a unified, community-governed, and quality-controlled benchmarking system.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rapid rise of AI and its societal importance highlight the inadequacy of current evaluation benchmarks, which suffer from vulnerabilities like data contamination, selective reporting, and biased results, creating a need for credible oversight.

Method: The authors propose a new evaluation paradigm called PeerBench, which incorporates sealed execution, item banking with rolling renewal, and delayed transparency within a community-governed, live, and robust benchmarking framework.

Result: The paper identifies systemic flaws in current AI evaluation practices and establishes essential requirements for a trustworthy benchmarking system, using PeerBench as the realized embodiment of these ideas.

Conclusion: Sustainable progress in AI requires moving beyond ad-hoc benchmarking to robust, quality-controlled, and trusted evaluation systems like PeerBench for ensuring fairness, credibility, and integrity.

Abstract: The meteoric rise of Artificial Intelligence (AI), with its rapidly expanding
market capitalization, presents both transformative opportunities and critical
challenges. Chief among these is the urgent need for a new, unified paradigm
for trustworthy evaluation, as current benchmarks increasingly reveal critical
vulnerabilities. Issues like data contamination and selective reporting by
model developers fuel hype, while inadequate data quality control can lead to
biased evaluations that, even if unintentionally, may favor specific
approaches. As a flood of participants enters the AI space, this "Wild West" of
assessment makes distinguishing genuine progress from exaggerated claims
exceptionally difficult. Such ambiguity blurs scientific signals and erodes
public confidence, much as unchecked claims would destabilize financial markets
reliant on credible oversight from agencies like Moody's.
  In high-stakes human examinations (e.g., SAT, GRE), substantial effort is
devoted to ensuring fairness and credibility; why settle for less in evaluating
AI, especially given its profound societal impact? This position paper argues
that the current laissez-faire approach is unsustainable. We contend that true,
sustainable AI advancement demands a paradigm shift: a unified, live, and
quality-controlled benchmarking framework robust by construction, not by mere
courtesy and goodwill. To this end, we dissect the systemic flaws undermining
today's AI evaluation, distill the essential requirements for a new generation
of assessments, and introduce PeerBench, a community-governed, proctored
evaluation blueprint that embodies this paradigm through sealed execution, item
banking with rolling renewal, and delayed transparency. Our goal is to pave the
way for evaluations that can restore integrity and deliver genuinely
trustworthy measures of AI progress.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: AgentAsk proposes a clarification module to improve multi-agent systems using LLMs by addressing error propagation through a three-stage pipeline involving failure trace analysis, supervised policy training, and reinforcement learning. It enhances accuracy with minimal cost and latency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multi-agent systems based on large language models are limited by error cascades during communication between agents, which degrade their performance even below single-agent baselines. A solution is needed to enhance error detection and arrest propagation effectively.

Method: The proposed solution, AgentAsk, treats communication messages as potential failure points. It incorporates a pipeline comprising edge-level failure analysis, supervised policy design for querying, and E-GRPO-based reinforcement learning to optimize error intervention while focusing on minimizing cost, accuracy loss, and latency.

Result: AgentAsk significantly improves accuracy, robustness, and reliability of multi-agent systems across various benchmarks in reasoning, coding, and math tasks while incurring less than 5% additional latency and cost over existing implementations.

Conclusion: The paper introduces a scalable and architecture-agnostic framework for enhancing the reliability of LLM-based multi-agent systems, offering theoretical advancements in failure taxonomy and practical solutions to mitigate error propagation.

Abstract: Multi-agent systems built on large language models (LLMs) promise enhanced
problem-solving capabilities through collaborative division of labor. However,
they frequently underperform single-agent baselines due to edge-level error
cascades: minor inaccuracies at one message handoff propagate across the entire
chain. We propose AgentAsk, a lightweight and plug-and-play clarification
module that treats every inter-agent message as a potential failure point and
inserts minimally necessary questions to arrest error propagation. AgentAsk
follows a three-stage pipeline: (i) distilling edge-level judgments from
curated failure traces into a compact policy, (ii) supervising the policy to
determine when/what/whom/how to ask, and (iii) optimizing online with E-GRPO, a
reinforcement learning objective that balances accuracy, latency, and cost. The
module is architecture-agnostic and easy to integrate into existing
orchestration. Across math, reasoning, and coding benchmarks, AgentAsk
consistently improves accuracy and robustness over public multi-agent
implementations while keeping overhead minimal, with latency and extra cost all
less than 5%, approaching the performance of a strong evaluator. Beyond
empirical improvements, we contribute a principled taxonomy of edge-level
errors and a practical recipe for link-local intervention, offering a scalable
pathway toward more reliable LLM-based multi-agent systems.

TL;DR: The paper discusses using generative AI to enhance mental health service training rather than focusing solely on therapist chatbots.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address the optimism and concerns around using generative AI in mental health and propose its application for training mental health service providers as a safer and impactful option.

Method: The paper presents the case for using generative AI in training individuals for mental health support and includes a real-world case study involving veterans helping one another.

Result: The case study demonstrated improvements in the training process for veterans supporting mental health, highlighting the potential benefits of generative AI in this domain.

Conclusion: The authors argue that investing in generative AI for mental health service training is a low-risk, high-impact strategy in the broader application of AI in mental health.

Abstract: Generative artificial intelligence (Generative AI) is transforming
healthcare. With this evolution comes optimism regarding the impact it will
have on mental health, as well as concern regarding the risks that come with
generative AI operating in the mental health domain. Much of the investment in,
and academic and public discourse about, AI-powered solutions for mental health
has focused on therapist chatbots. Despite the common assumption that chatbots
will be the most impactful application of GenAI to mental health, we make the
case here for a lower-risk, high impact use case: leveraging generative AI to
enhance and scale training in mental health service provision. We highlight key
benefits of using generative AI to help train people to provide mental health
services and present a real-world case study in which generative AI improved
the training of veterans to support one another's mental health. With numerous
potential applications of generative AI in mental health, we illustrate why we
should invest in using generative AI to support training people in mental
health service provision.

*Yinglun Zhu,Jiancheng Zhang,Fuzhi Tang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper uncovers hidden capabilities in AI models for compositional reasoning by challenging flawed evaluation metrics, introducing a group matching score, and proposing Test-Time Matching (TTM) for iterative performance boosts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Recent Frontier AI models have underperformed in compositional reasoning benchmarks, yet this paper seeks to re-evaluate capability by addressing flaws in current evaluation metrics.

Method: The authors introduce a group matching score to better exploit group structures and propose Test-Time Matching (TTM), a self-improving iterative algorithm, to unlock and enhance hidden model capabilities.

Result: The methods revealed hidden competencies in AI models, surpassed prior benchmarks, and established new state-of-the-art results on compositional reasoning tasks, including surpassing GPT-4.1 on MMVP-VLM.

Conclusion: TTM proved effective across a range of benchmarks, consistently improving model performance and pushing the boundaries of compositional reasoning capabilities without needing external supervision.

Abstract: Frontier AI models have achieved remarkable progress, yet recent studies
suggest they struggle with compositional reasoning, often performing at or
below random chance on established benchmarks. We revisit this problem and show
that widely used evaluation metrics systematically underestimate model
capability. To address this, we introduce a group matching score that better
exploits group structure and reveals substantial hidden capability in both
contrastive vision-language models (VLMs) and multimodal large language models
(MLLMs). Moreover, simply overfitting to the induced group matchings at test
time transfers this hidden capability into higher scores under standard
evaluation metrics, closing much of the reported gap. This adjustment enables
SigLIP-B16 to surpass all previous results and GPT-4.1 to yield the first
result surpassing estimated human performance on Winoground.
  Building on this insight, we propose Test-Time Matching (TTM), an iterative,
self-improving algorithm that further bootstraps model performance without any
external supervision. TTM delivers additional, non-trivial improvements: for
example, TTM enables SigLIP-B16 to surpass GPT-4.1 on MMVP-VLM, establishing a
new state of the art. Importantly, TTM remains broadly effective even on
benchmarks without metric-induced effects or group structures, achieving
relative gains up to 85.7% on challenging datasets such as WhatsUp. Across 16
dataset variants spanning diverse setups, our experiments demonstrate that TTM
consistently improves model performance and advances the frontier of
compositional reasoning.

*Haruka Kiyohara,Yusuke Narita,Yuta Saito,Kei Tateno,Takuma Udagawa*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Recommender systems need to explore novel items safely; the paper proposes frameworks to address this.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Ensuring safety while encouraging exploration of novel actions in recommender systems to improve long-term user engagement.

Method: Developed Safe Off-Policy Policy Gradient (Safe OPG) for model-free safe learning and Deployment-Efficient Policy Learning for iterative safe exploration.

Result: Safe OPG satisfies safety requirements but is overly conservative; gradual safety relaxation in the proposed framework improves exploration effectiveness.

Conclusion: Combining safety guarantees with exploration can enhance recommender system performance without compromising user experience.

Abstract: In many real recommender systems, novel items are added frequently over time.
The importance of sufficiently presenting novel actions has widely been
acknowledged for improving long-term user engagement. A recent work builds on
Off-Policy Learning (OPL), which trains a policy from only logged data,
however, the existing methods can be unsafe in the presence of novel actions.
Our goal is to develop a framework to enforce exploration of novel actions with
a guarantee for safety. To this end, we first develop Safe Off-Policy Policy
Gradient (Safe OPG), which is a model-free safe OPL method based on a high
confidence off-policy evaluation. In our first experiment, we observe that Safe
OPG almost always satisfies a safety requirement, even when existing methods
violate it greatly. However, the result also reveals that Safe OPG tends to be
too conservative, suggesting a difficult tradeoff between guaranteeing safety
and exploring novel actions. To overcome this tradeoff, we also propose a novel
framework called Deployment-Efficient Policy Learning for Safe User
Exploration, which leverages safety margin and gradually relaxes safety
regularization during multiple (not many) deployments. Our framework thus
enables exploration of novel actions while guaranteeing safe implementation of
recommender systems.

*Alhim Vera,Karen Sanchez,Carlos Hinojosa,Haidar Bin Hamid,Donghoon Kim,Bernard Ghanem*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper evaluates the trustworthiness of generative AI agents in multimodal environments, focusing on safety, coherence, and social dynamics through a simulation framework.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the limited ability of generative agents to reason effectively about safety, coherence, and trust in complex multimodal scenarios.

Method: The authors use a simulation framework that evaluates AI agents based on safety improvement, unsafe activity detection, and social interaction metrics. Agents have layered memory, dynamic planning, and multimodal perception and are analyzed using the SocialMetrics suite.

Result: Agents showed limited success in achieving global safety goals with only 55% success in correcting unsafe plans. Performance varied by model and scenario, with some unsafe actions influenced by misleading visuals.

Conclusion: The study highlights significant limitations in current AI architectures for multimodal safety and encourages further research through a reproducible evaluation platform.

Abstract: Can generative agents be trusted in multimodal environments? Despite advances
in large language and vision-language models that enable agents to act
autonomously and pursue goals in rich settings, their ability to reason about
safety, coherence, and trust across modalities remains limited. We introduce a
reproducible simulation framework for evaluating agents along three dimensions:
(1) safety improvement over time, including iterative plan revisions in
text-visual scenarios; (2) detection of unsafe activities across multiple
categories of social situations; and (3) social dynamics, measured as
interaction counts and acceptance ratios of social exchanges. Agents are
equipped with layered memory, dynamic planning, multimodal perception, and are
instrumented with SocialMetrics, a suite of behavioral and structural metrics
that quantifies plan revisions, unsafe-to-safe conversions, and information
diffusion across networks. Experiments show that while agents can detect direct
multimodal contradictions, they often fail to align local revisions with global
safety, reaching only a 55 percent success rate in correcting unsafe plans.
Across eight simulation runs with three models - Claude, GPT-4o mini, and
Qwen-VL - five agents achieved average unsafe-to-safe conversion rates of 75,
55, and 58 percent, respectively. Overall performance ranged from 20 percent in
multi-risk scenarios with GPT-4o mini to 98 percent in localized contexts such
as fire/heat with Claude. Notably, 45 percent of unsafe actions were accepted
when paired with misleading visuals, showing a strong tendency to overtrust
images. These findings expose critical limitations in current architectures and
provide a reproducible platform for studying multimodal safety, coherence, and
social dynamics.

*Xiaochen Tang,Zhenya Zhang,Miaomiao Zhang,Jie An*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces an improved method for STL-guided reinforcement learning to enhance control policy synthesis for real-time systems. It uses online causation semantics to generate precise, continuous rewards, improving RL performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current STL-based RL methods struggle with sparse and global rewards, leading to unstable training and non-convergent solutions. This paper aims to address this issue by refining the reward generation approach.

Method: The authors propose an online causation monitoring mechanism tailored to STL specifications. This method evaluates real-time control steps to measure quantitative state deviations and uses smooth approximations for deep-RL compatibility.

Result: Experimental results demonstrate improved convergence, robustness, and efficiency in training RL algorithms within a Gym environment, compared to existing STL-guided RL approaches.

Conclusion: The proposed STL-guided RL framework with an online reward generation mechanism offers a robust solution to overcome the limitations of current STL-based methods, enhancing real-time control policy synthesis.

Abstract: In real-time and safety-critical cyber-physical systems (CPSs), control
synthesis must guarantee that generated policies meet stringent timing and
correctness requirements under uncertain and dynamic conditions. Signal
temporal logic (STL) has emerged as a powerful formalism of expressing
real-time constraints, with its semantics enabling quantitative assessment of
system behavior. Meanwhile, reinforcement learning (RL) has become an important
method for solving control synthesis problems in unknown environments. Recent
studies incorporate STL-based reward functions into RL to automatically
synthesize control policies. However, the automatically inferred rewards
obtained by these methods represent the global assessment of a whole or partial
path but do not accumulate the rewards of local changes accurately, so the
sparse global rewards may lead to non-convergence and unstable training
performances. In this paper, we propose an online reward generation method
guided by the online causation monitoring of STL. Our approach continuously
monitors system behavior against an STL specification at each control step,
computing the quantitative distance toward satisfaction or violation and
thereby producing rewards that reflect instantaneous state dynamics.
Additionally, we provide a smooth approximation of the causation semantics to
overcome the discontinuity of the causation semantics and make it
differentiable for using deep-RL methods. We have implemented a prototype tool
and evaluated it in the Gym environment on a variety of continuously controlled
benchmarks. Experimental results show that our proposed STL-guided RL method
with online causation semantics outperforms existing relevant STL-guided RL
methods, providing a more robust and efficient reward generation framework for
deep-RL.

TL;DR: A new benchmark, oMeBench, evaluates organic reaction mechanism reasoning among large language models (LLMs), showing current models' limitations and highlighting improvements through fine-tuning strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the uncertainty in LLMs' chemical reasoning capabilities, particularly their ability to perform multi-step reasoning in organic chemistry.

Method: The authors introduced oMeBench, a curated dataset with annotated mechanistic steps, and proposed oMeS, a framework for dynamic step-level evaluation using logic and chemical similarity.

Result: Experiments demonstrate that current LLMs struggle with consistent multi-step reasoning, but fine-tuning on the dataset improves performance by 50% compared to a leading closed-source model.

Conclusion: oMeBench provides a foundational tool for advancing AI capabilities in chemical reasoning, showing areas of promise and gaps in current LLMs' performance.

Abstract: Organic reaction mechanisms are the stepwise elementary reactions by which
reactants form intermediates and products, and are fundamental to understanding
chemical reactivity and designing new molecules and reactions. Although large
language models (LLMs) have shown promise in understanding chemical tasks such
as synthesis design, it is unclear to what extent this reflects genuine
chemical reasoning capabilities, i.e., the ability to generate valid
intermediates, maintain chemical consistency, and follow logically coherent
multi-step pathways. We address this by introducing oMeBench, the first
large-scale, expert-curated benchmark for organic mechanism reasoning in
organic chemistry. It comprises over 10,000 annotated mechanistic steps with
intermediates, type labels, and difficulty ratings. Furthermore, to evaluate
LLM capability more precisely and enable fine-grained scoring, we propose oMeS,
a dynamic evaluation framework that combines step-level logic and chemical
similarity. We analyze the performance of state-of-the-art LLMs, and our
results show that although current models display promising chemical intuition,
they struggle with correct and consistent multi-step reasoning. Notably, we
find that using prompting strategy and fine-tuning a specialist model on our
proposed dataset increases performance by 50% over the leading closed-source
model. We hope that oMeBench will serve as a rigorous foundation for advancing
AI systems toward genuine chemical reasoning.

*Minh-Anh Nguye,Minh-Duc Nguyen,Nguyen Thi Ha Lan,Kieu Hai Dang,Nguyen Tien Dong,Le Duy Dung*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Large language models often lack structural coherence in automated survey generation; SurveyG integrates hierarchical citation graphs for contextually rich surveys.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the shortcomings of existing LLM-based survey generation methods, which often fail to provide coherent taxonomies and contextual understanding of paper relationships.

Method: SurveyG uses a three-layer hierarchical citation graph (Foundation, Development, Frontier) combined with an LLM-based agent framework to create structured and multi-level surveys through node traversal and validation processes.

Result: SurveyG demonstrates enhanced survey quality, including comprehensiveness and structural coherence, as validated by human experts and LLM judges.

Conclusion: SurveyG offers a promising framework for generating automated surveys with better alignment to research taxonomies, achieving improved structural and contextual depth.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly adopted for automating survey
paper generation \cite{wang2406autosurvey, liang2025surveyx,
yan2025surveyforge,su2025benchmarking,wen2025interactivesurvey}. Existing
approaches typically extract content from a large collection of related papers
and prompt LLMs to summarize them directly. However, such methods often
overlook the structural relationships among papers, resulting in generated
surveys that lack a coherent taxonomy and a deeper contextual understanding of
research progress. To address these shortcomings, we propose \textbf{SurveyG},
an LLM-based agent framework that integrates \textit{hierarchical citation
graph}, where nodes denote research papers and edges capture both citation
dependencies and semantic relatedness between their contents, thereby embedding
structural and contextual knowledge into the survey generation process. The
graph is organized into three layers: \textbf{Foundation},
\textbf{Development}, and \textbf{Frontier}, to capture the evolution of
research from seminal works to incremental advances and emerging directions. By
combining horizontal search within layers and vertical depth traversal across
layers, the agent produces multi-level summaries, which are consolidated into a
structured survey outline. A multi-agent validation stage then ensures
consistency, coverage, and factual accuracy in generating the final survey.
Experiments, including evaluations by human experts and LLM-as-a-judge,
demonstrate that SurveyG outperforms state-of-the-art frameworks, producing
surveys that are more comprehensive and better structured to the underlying
knowledge taxonomy of a field.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes the "Haibu Mathematical-Medical Intelligent Agent" (MMIA), an LLM-based framework focused on ensuring reliability in medical tasks by using a verifiable reasoning process.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large Language Models (LLMs) have potential in medicine but face reliability issues, which are critical to address in high-stakes medical applications.

Method: MMIA employs a recursive decomposition of medical tasks into evidence-based steps. Logical coherence and traceability are ensured via an auditing process akin to theorem proving. The framework includes a bootstrapping mode for storing validated reasoning chains as "theorems" and uses Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) for efficiency.

Result: MMIA demonstrated an error detection rate of over 98% and a false positive rate below 1% in healthcare administration tasks, outperforming baseline models. RAG also showed potential for significant cost reduction.

Conclusion: MMIA's framework enhances reliability, transparency, and cost-effectiveness in medical AI applications, making LLMs more viable for critical healthcare tasks.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) show promise in medicine but are prone to
factual and logical errors, which is unacceptable in this high-stakes field. To
address this, we introduce the "Haibu Mathematical-Medical Intelligent Agent"
(MMIA), an LLM-driven architecture that ensures reliability through a formally
verifiable reasoning process. MMIA recursively breaks down complex medical
tasks into atomic, evidence-based steps. This entire reasoning chain is then
automatically audited for logical coherence and evidence traceability, similar
to theorem proving. A key innovation is MMIA's "bootstrapping" mode, which
stores validated reasoning chains as "theorems." Subsequent tasks can then be
efficiently solved using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), shifting from
costly first-principles reasoning to a low-cost verification model. We
validated MMIA across four healthcare administration domains, including DRG/DIP
audits and medical insurance adjudication, using expert-validated benchmarks.
Results showed MMIA achieved an error detection rate exceeding 98% with a false
positive rate below 1%, significantly outperforming baseline LLMs. Furthermore,
the RAG matching mode is projected to reduce average processing costs by
approximately 85% as the knowledge base matures. In conclusion, MMIA's
verifiable reasoning framework is a significant step toward creating
trustworthy, transparent, and cost-effective AI systems, making LLM technology
viable for critical applications in medicine.

*Xiangwei Lv,JinLuan Yang,Wang Lin,Jingyuan Chen,Beishui Liao*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper addresses domain adaptation in graphs without source-domain data by reframing it as a generative graph restoration task, using a novel framework called GRAIL based on large language models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to overcome the limitation of existing graph domain adaptation methods that require source-domain data, which might be unavailable due to privacy or security concerns.

Method: The proposed method, GRAIL, compresses node representations, applies a graph diffusion process, quantizes restored features, and fine-tunes a large language model as a generative restorer. A reinforcement learning step is used to improve quality, guided by alignment and confidence rewards.

Result: The approach shows effective restoration of target graphs to a state aligned with the source domain across multiple datasets.

Conclusion: The framework successfully addresses the test-time graph domain adaptation problem by leveraging generative capabilities of large language models and reinforcement learning for improved restoration quality.

Abstract: Graph domain adaptation (GDA) has achieved great attention due to its
effectiveness in addressing the domain shift between train and test data. A
significant bottleneck in existing graph domain adaptation methods is their
reliance on source-domain data, which is often unavailable due to privacy or
security concerns. This limitation has driven the development of Test-Time
Graph Domain Adaptation (TT-GDA), which aims to transfer knowledge without
accessing the source examples. Inspired by the generative power of large
language models (LLMs), we introduce a novel framework that reframes TT-GDA as
a generative graph restoration problem, "restoring the target graph to its
pristine, source-domain-like state". There are two key challenges: (1) We need
to construct a reasonable graph restoration process and design an effective
encoding scheme that an LLM can understand, bridging the modality gap. (2) We
need to devise a mechanism to ensure the restored graph acquires the intrinsic
features of the source domain, even without access to the source data. To
ensure the effectiveness of graph restoration, we propose GRAIL, that restores
the target graph into a state that is well-aligned with the source domain.
Specifically, we first compress the node representations into compact latent
features and then use a graph diffusion process to model the graph restoration
process. Then a quantization module encodes the restored features into discrete
tokens. Building on this, an LLM is fine-tuned as a generative restorer to
transform a "noisy" target graph into a "native" one. To further improve
restoration quality, we introduce a reinforcement learning process guided by
specialized alignment and confidence rewards. Extensive experiments demonstrate
the effectiveness of our approach across various datasets.

TL;DR: The paper discusses a systematic decomposition framework (ACONIC) for tasks handled by Large Language Models (LLMs), improving performance by analyzing constraints and complexities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs face reliability challenges on complex tasks due to the heuristic nature of current decomposition methods, prompting the need for a more systematic approach.

Method: The authors propose the ACONIC framework, which formulates the task as a constraint problem and uses formal complexity measures to inform decomposition.

Result: Experimental results show significant performance improvement (10-40% points) in combinatorial tasks (SATBench) and database querying tasks (Spider) by following the decomposition strategy.

Conclusion: Using constraint-induced complexity analysis as a decomposition strategy enhances the reliability and effectiveness of LLMs in handling complex tasks.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) suffer from reliability issues on complex tasks,
as existing decomposition methods are heuristic and rely on agent or manual
decomposition. This work introduces a novel, systematic decomposition framework
that we call Analysis of CONstraint-Induced Complexity (ACONIC), which models
the task as a constraint problem and leveraging formal complexity measures to
guide decomposition. On combinatorial (SATBench) and LLM database querying
tasks (Spider), we find that by decomposing the tasks following the measure of
complexity, agent can perform considerably better (10-40 percentage point).

Motivation: Enhance reasoning abilities of small language models and address the limitations of existing algorithms like GRPO, which cannot improve with uniformly correct or incorrect samples.

Method: Introduced GCPO, which utilizes external reference answers to provide correct problem-solving guidance, improving sample utility and generalization in reasoning.

Result: GCPO outperformed baseline models across multiple benchmark datasets, showing substantial improvements.

Conclusion: GCPO reinforces small language models' reasoning by leveraging external references, improving sample efficiency, and enhancing model generalization capabilities.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning has been widely applied to enhance the reasoning
capabilities of large language models. Extending the inference limits of
smaller models has become a prominent research focus. However, algorithms such
as Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) suffer from a clear drawback: the
upper bound of a model's rollout responses is entirely determined by the model
itself, preventing the acquisition of knowledge from samples that are either
all incorrect or all correct. In this paper, we introduce Group Contrastive
Policy Optimization (GCPO), a method that incorporates external standard
reference answers. When the model cannot solve a problem, the reference answer
supplies the correct response, steering the model toward an unequivocally
accurate update direction. This approach offers two main advantages: (1) it
improves training efficiency by fully utilizing every sample; (2) it enables
the model to emulate the problem solving strategy of the reference answer
during training, thereby enhancing generalization in reasoning. GCPO achieves
outstanding results across multiple benchmark datasets, yielding substantial
improvements over the baseline model. Our code is available at:

### [29] [Strategic Communication under Threat: Learning Information Trade-offs in Pursuit-Evasion Games](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07813)
*Valerio La Gatta,Dolev Mutzari,Sarit Kraus,VS Subrahmanian*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces a game model, PEEC, to address the balance between gaining information and facing risks in adversarial environments, and it presents SHADOW, a framework to navigate this trade-off effectively.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Adversarial scenarios often require agents to balance acquiring situational information against the risk of revealing their own vulnerabilities, prompting the need for frameworks that address this strategic trade-off.

Method: The paper formulates the Pursuit-Evasion-Exposure-Concealment (PEEC) game and introduces SHADOW, a reinforcement learning framework combining continuous navigation, discrete communication decisions, and opponent modeling.

Result: SHADOW outperforms six baseline methods in success rates, with ablation studies emphasizing the importance of sequence modeling and opponent prediction for decision-making.

Conclusion: The SHADOW framework demonstrates robust generalization across varying scenarios and parameters, showcasing its utility in balancing observability and risk in adversarial environments.

Abstract: Adversarial environments require agents to navigate a key strategic
trade-off: acquiring information enhances situational awareness, but may
simultaneously expose them to threats. To investigate this tension, we
formulate a PursuitEvasion-Exposure-Concealment Game (PEEC) in which a pursuer
agent must decide when to communicate in order to obtain the evader's position.
Each communication reveals the pursuer's location, increasing the risk of being
targeted. Both agents learn their movement policies via reinforcement learning,
while the pursuer additionally learns a communication policy that balances
observability and risk. We propose SHADOW (Strategic-communication Hybrid
Action Decision-making under partial Observation for Warfare), a multi-headed
sequential reinforcement learning framework that integrates continuous
navigation control, discrete communication actions, and opponent modeling for
behavior prediction. Empirical evaluations show that SHADOW pursuers achieve
higher success rates than six competitive baselines. Our ablation study
confirms that temporal sequence modeling and opponent modeling are critical for
effective decision-making. Finally, our sensitivity analysis reveals that the
learned policies generalize well across varying communication risks and
physical asymmetries between agents.

*Yuping Zhou,Siqi Lai,Jindong Han,Hao Liu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: CityNav is an LLM-powered hierarchical framework designed for large-scale multi-vehicle navigation, outperforming traditional algorithms in optimizing city-wide traffic.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing navigation methods struggle to scale in city-wide networks, failing to adequately address urban traffic's nonlinear, stochastic, and coupled dynamics.

Method: CityNav introduces a hierarchical structure with a global traffic allocation agent for strategic flow distribution and local agents for adaptive routing, employing a cooperative reasoning optimization mechanism with dual-reward structures.

Result: CityNav excelled in experiments across four large-scale road networks, consistently surpassing nine traditional algorithms in travel efficiency and congestion management.

Conclusion: CityNav demonstrates that LLMs can provide scalable, adaptive, and cooperative solutions for traffic navigation in urban environments, paving the way for improved large-scale vehicle routing.

Abstract: The rise of Internet of Vehicles (IoV) technologies is transforming traffic
management from isolated control to a collective, multi-vehicle process. At the
heart of this shift is multi-vehicle dynamic navigation, which requires
simultaneously routing large fleets under evolving traffic conditions. Existing
path search algorithms and reinforcement learning methods struggle to scale to
city-wide networks, often failing to capture the nonlinear, stochastic, and
coupled dynamics of urban traffic. To address these challenges, we propose
CityNav, a hierarchical, LLM-powered framework for large-scale multi-vehicle
navigation. CityNav integrates a global traffic allocation agent, which
coordinates strategic traffic flow distribution across regions, with local
navigation agents that generate locally adaptive routes aligned with global
directives. To enable effective cooperation, we introduce a cooperative
reasoning optimization mechanism, in which agents are jointly trained with a
dual-reward structure: individual rewards promote per-vehicle efficiency, while
shared rewards encourage network-wide coordination and congestion reduction.
Extensive experiments on four real-world road networks of varying scales (up to
1.6 million roads and 430,000 intersections) and traffic datasets demonstrate
that CityNav consistently outperforms nine classical path search and RL-based
baselines in city-scale travel efficiency and congestion mitigation. Our
results highlight the potential of LLMs to enable scalable, adaptive, and
cooperative city-wide traffic navigation, providing a foundation for
intelligent, large-scale vehicle routing in complex urban environments. Our

TL;DR: The paper introduces FinMR, a specialized multimodal dataset for assessing financial reasoning in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), highlighting current model limitations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of high-quality datasets for evaluating financial reasoning capabilities of MLLMs in professional-grade financial scenarios.

Method: Developed FinMR, a multimodal dataset with over 3,200 expertly annotated Q&A pairs covering 15 financial topics, integrating mathematical, visual, and contextual tasks.

Result: Benchmarking results show significant performance gaps between current leading MLLMs and human financial analysts, particularly in image analysis, applying financial formulas, and contextual understanding.

Conclusion: FinMR is a critical benchmarking tool for advancing MLLMs toward achieving professional-level competence in financial reasoning.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have made substantial progress in
recent years. However, their rigorous evaluation within specialized domains
like finance is hindered by the absence of datasets characterized by
professional-level knowledge intensity, detailed annotations, and advanced
reasoning complexity. To address this critical gap, we introduce FinMR, a
high-quality, knowledge-intensive multimodal dataset explicitly designed to
evaluate expert-level financial reasoning capabilities at a professional
analyst's standard. FinMR comprises over 3,200 meticulously curated and
expertly annotated question-answer pairs across 15 diverse financial topics,
ensuring broad domain diversity and integrating sophisticated mathematical
reasoning, advanced financial knowledge, and nuanced visual interpretation
tasks across multiple image types. Through comprehensive benchmarking with
leading closed-source and open-source MLLMs, we highlight significant
performance disparities between these models and professional financial
analysts, uncovering key areas for model advancement, such as precise image
analysis, accurate application of complex financial formulas, and deeper
contextual financial understanding. By providing richly varied visual content
and thorough explanatory annotations, FinMR establishes itself as an essential
benchmark tool for assessing and advancing multimodal financial reasoning
toward professional analyst-level competence.

### [32] [Augur: Modeling Covariate Causal Associations in Time Series via Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07858)
*Zhiqing Cui,Binwu Wang,Qingxiang Liu,Yeqiang Wang,Zhengyang Zhou,Yuxuan Liang,Yang Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces Augur, an LLM-driven framework for time series forecasting focusing on causal reasoning and interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLM-based time series forecasting methods have limitations, including sidelining LLMs in modeling, reliance on basic prompts, and lacking interpretability.

Method: The proposed Augur framework employs a two-stage teacher-student architecture where a teacher LLM generates a causal graph, refined by a lightweight student agent. This graph is encoded as rich textual prompts for forecasting.

Result: Extensive evaluations on real-world datasets with 25 baselines confirm that Augur offers competitive performance and robust zero-shot generalization.

Conclusion: Augur improves forecasting accuracy while maintaining interpretability and transparency in explaining variable interactions, representing a step forward in causality-driven forecasting.

Abstract: Large language models (LLM) have emerged as a promising avenue for time
series forecasting, offering the potential to integrate multimodal data.
However, existing LLM-based approaches face notable limitations-such as
marginalized role in model architectures, reliance on coarse statistical text
prompts, and lack of interpretability. In this work, we introduce Augur, a
fully LLM driven time series forecasting framework that exploits LLM causal
reasoning to discover and use directed causal associations among covariates.
Augur uses a two stage teacher student architecture where a powerful teacher
LLM infers a directed causal graph from time series using heuristic search
together with pairwise causality testing. A lightweight student agent then
refines the graph and fine tune on high confidence causal associations that are
encoded as rich textual prompts to perform forecasting. This design improves
predictive accuracy while yielding transparent, traceable reasoning about
variable interactions. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets with 25
baselines demonstrate that Augur achieves competitive performance and robust
zero-shot generalization.

*Tianyu Fan,Xinyao Niu,Yuxiang Zheng,Fengji Zhang,Chengen Huang,Bei Chen,Junyang Lin,Chao Huang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces DeepResearch-ReportEval, a framework for evaluating AI systems that produce research reports as outputs by analyzing their quality, redundancy, and factuality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Evaluating AI systems capable of conducting expert-level research is challenging due to their need to synthesize diverse information and generate coherent outputs, which are difficult to verify using existing benchmarks.

Method: The authors propose a framework called DeepResearch-ReportEval that uses LLM-as-a-Judge methodology to measure quality, redundancy, and factuality. It utilizes a curated benchmark of 100 queries across diverse categories.

Result: Evaluation of four leading commercial systems using the framework highlights different system designs and trade-offs, providing insights into their performance and philosophy.

Conclusion: DeepResearch-ReportEval is a promising step towards establishing a standardized evaluation method for AI research systems, helping transition them from information assistants to intelligent research partners.

Abstract: DeepResearch agents represent a transformative AI paradigm, conducting
expert-level research through sophisticated reasoning and multi-tool
integration. However, evaluating these systems remains critically challenging
due to open-ended research scenarios and existing benchmarks that focus on
isolated capabilities rather than holistic performance. Unlike traditional LLM
tasks, DeepResearch systems must synthesize diverse sources, generate insights,
and present coherent findings, which are capabilities that resist simple
verification. To address this gap, we introduce DeepResearch-ReportEval, a
comprehensive framework designed to assess DeepResearch systems through their
most representative outputs: research reports. Our approach systematically
measures three dimensions: quality, redundancy, and factuality, using an
innovative LLM-as-a-Judge methodology achieving strong expert concordance. We
contribute a standardized benchmark of 100 curated queries spanning 12
real-world categories, enabling systematic capability comparison. Our
evaluation of four leading commercial systems reveals distinct design
philosophies and performance trade-offs, establishing foundational insights as
DeepResearch evolves from information assistants toward intelligent research
partners. Source code and data are available at:

### [34] [Towards Meaningful Transparency in Civic AI Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07889)
*Dave Murray-Rust,Kars Alfrink,Cristina Zaga*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper evaluates the inadequacies in current AI transparency practices in civic systems and proposes a human-centric, socio-technical approach for meaningful transparency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Governments use AI systems for decision-making in public services, but these systems often exhibit bias, incorrect outcomes, and diminish citizens' and workers' ability to influence decisions.

Method: The authors propose combining human-centric analysis with socio-technical systems approaches to develop transparencies that help users understand AI decisions and encourage actionable insights.

Result: Meaningful transparency enables publics to comprehend decisions made by civic AI systems and connects this understanding with opportunities for action.

Conclusion: Current AI transparency methods are insufficient. A shift to meaningful transparency can empower citizens to better engage with civic AI systems, improving their understanding and agency.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence has become a part of the provision of governmental
services, from making decisions about benefits to issuing fines for parking
violations. However, AI systems rarely live up to the promise of neutral
optimisation, creating biased or incorrect outputs and reducing the agency of
both citizens and civic workers to shape the way decisions are made.
Transparency is a principle that can both help subjects understand decisions
made about them and shape the processes behind those decisions. However,
transparency as practiced around AI systems tends to focus on the production of
technical objects that represent algorithmic aspects of decision making. These
are often difficult for publics to understand, do not connect to potential for
action, and do not give insight into the wider socio-material context of
decision making. In this paper, we build on existing approaches that take a
human-centric view on AI transparency, combined with a socio-technical systems
view, to develop the concept of meaningful transparency for civic AI systems:
transparencies that allow publics to engage with AI systems that affect their
lives, connecting understanding with potential for action.

### [35] [Profit Mirage: Revisiting Information Leakage in LLM-based Financial Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07920)
*Xiangyu Li,Yawen Zeng,Xiaofen Xing,Jin Xu,Xiangmin Xu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper addresses the issue of knowledge leakage in LLM-based financial agents, introduces the FinLake-Bench benchmark to quantify leakage, and proposes FactFin framework to enhance causal reasoning for improved trading performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Exploring LLM-based financial agents' effectiveness, the authors aim to tackle the challenge of unrealistic trading results due to inherent information leakage in the models.

Method: The authors propose the FactFin framework, employing counterfactual perturbations and integrating components like Retrieval-Augmented Generation and Monte Carlo Tree Search to shift focus from memorization to causal drivers.

Result: Experiments demonstrate that FactFin outperforms existing baselines in generalization and risk-adjusted trading performance.

Conclusion: The FactFin framework mitigates leakage issues in LLM-based financial agents, enhancing their ability to deliver realistic and robust trading outcomes by focusing on causal relationships.

Abstract: LLM-based financial agents have attracted widespread excitement for their
ability to trade like human experts. However, most systems exhibit a "profit
mirage": dazzling back-tested returns evaporate once the model's knowledge
window ends, because of the inherent information leakage in LLMs. In this
paper, we systematically quantify this leakage issue across four dimensions and
release FinLake-Bench, a leakage-robust evaluation benchmark. Furthermore, to
mitigate this issue, we introduce FactFin, a framework that applies
counterfactual perturbations to compel LLM-based agents to learn causal drivers
instead of memorized outcomes. FactFin integrates four core components:
Strategy Code Generator, Retrieval-Augmented Generation, Monte Carlo Tree
Search, and Counterfactual Simulator. Extensive experiments show that our
method surpasses all baselines in out-of-sample generalization, delivering
superior risk-adjusted performance.

*Rebecca Westhäußer,Wolfgang Minker,Sebatian Zepf*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper presents a personalized framework for LLM-based AI agents by combining persistent memory, user profiles, and agentic AI patterns.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to overcome the limitations of current LLM-based AI agents in delivering personalized interactions, especially by addressing gaps related to the combination of contextual data with user-specific information.

Method: The paper proposes a framework for personalized AI interactions by integrating persistent memory, dynamic coordination, self-validation, and evolving user profiles, evaluated through experiments on datasets and a pilot user study.

Result: The framework enhances metrics like retrieval accuracy, response correctness, and BertScore, while the pilot study shows initial positive user feedback toward personalization.

Conclusion: Integrating persistent memory and user profiles into LLM-based agents shows promise for improving their adaptivity and personalization, guiding future work in this domain.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) increasingly serve as the central control unit
of AI agents, yet current approaches remain limited in their ability to deliver
personalized interactions. While Retrieval Augmented Generation enhances LLM
capabilities by improving context-awareness, it lacks mechanisms to combine
contextual information with user-specific data. Although personalization has
been studied in fields such as human-computer interaction or cognitive science,
existing perspectives largely remain conceptual, with limited focus on
technical implementation. To address these gaps, we build on a unified
definition of personalization as a conceptual foundation to derive technical
requirements for adaptive, user-centered LLM-based agents. Combined with
established agentic AI patterns such as multi-agent collaboration or
multi-source retrieval, we present a framework that integrates persistent
memory, dynamic coordination, self-validation, and evolving user profiles to
enable personalized long-term interactions. We evaluate our approach on three
public datasets using metrics such as retrieval accuracy, response correctness,
or BertScore. We complement these results with a five-day pilot user study
providing initial insights into user feedback on perceived personalization. The
study provides early indications that guide future work and highlights the
potential of integrating persistent memory and user profiles to improve the
adaptivity and perceived personalization of LLM-based agents.

Motivation: Cryptocurrency markets are highly volatile and exhibit complex dynamics that make conventional trading strategy optimization methods ineffective.

Method: The paper proposes CGA-Agent, combining genetic algorithms and multi-agent coordination to adaptively optimize trading strategies, utilizing real-time market feedback and intelligence.

Result: The model was tested across three cryptocurrencies and showed statistically significant improvements in returns and risk-adjusted outcomes.

Conclusion: CGA-Agent demonstrates that synergy between genetic algorithms and multi-agent systems effectively overcomes static optimization limitations in volatile cryptocurrency markets.

Abstract: Cryptocurrency markets present formidable challenges for trading strategy
optimization due to extreme volatility, non-stationary dynamics, and complex
microstructure patterns that render conventional parameter optimization methods
fundamentally inadequate. We introduce Cypto Genetic Algorithm Agent
(CGA-Agent), a pioneering hybrid framework that synergistically integrates
genetic algorithms with intelligent multi-agent coordination mechanisms for
adaptive trading strategy parameter optimization in dynamic financial
environments. The framework uniquely incorporates real-time market
microstructure intelligence and adaptive strategy performance feedback through
intelligent mechanisms that dynamically guide evolutionary processes,
transcending the limitations of static optimization approaches. Comprehensive
empirical evaluation across three cryptocurrencies demonstrates systematic and

TL;DR: The paper introduces TaoSR-SHE, a new reinforcement learning framework, to improve query-product relevance analysis in e-commerce search using stepwise rewards for better reasoning quality and prediction accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current training methods for leveraging large language models (LLMs) in e-commerce relevance systems struggle with generalization on long-tail queries and lack effective step-by-step reasoning supervision.

Method: The paper introduces TaoSR-SHE, which utilizes Stepwise Reward Policy Optimization (SRPO) with step-level rewards obtained through a combination of generative models and human-annotated verification. It also employs diversified data filtering and multi-stage curriculum learning.

Result: TaoSR-SHE demonstrated improved reasoning quality and relevance-prediction accuracy on real-world e-commerce benchmarks, surpassing baseline techniques like SFT, DPO, and GRPO.

Conclusion: The framework enhances both performance and interpretability in e-commerce search engines, addressing limitations in existing methodologies and setting a new standard for query-product relevance analysis.

Abstract: Query-product relevance analysis is a foundational technology in e-commerce
search engines and has become increasingly important in AI-driven e-commerce.
The recent emergence of large language models (LLMs), particularly their
chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning capabilities, offers promising opportunities
for developing relevance systems that are both more interpretable and more
robust. However, existing training paradigms have notable limitations: SFT and
DPO suffer from poor generalization on long-tail queries and from a lack of
fine-grained, stepwise supervision to enforce rule-aligned reasoning. In
contrast, reinforcement learning with verification rewards (RLVR) suffers from
sparse feedback, which provides insufficient signal to correct erroneous
intermediate steps, thereby undermining logical consistency and limiting
performance in complex inference scenarios.
  To address these challenges, we introduce the Stepwise Hybrid Examination
Reinforcement Learning framework for Taobao Search Relevance (TaoSR-SHE). At
its core is Stepwise Reward Policy Optimization (SRPO), a reinforcement
learning algorithm that leverages step-level rewards generated by a hybrid of a
high-quality generative stepwise reward model and a human-annotated offline
verifier, prioritizing learning from critical correct and incorrect reasoning
steps. TaoSR-SHE further incorporates two key techniques: diversified data
filtering to encourage exploration across varied reasoning paths and mitigate
policy entropy collapse, and multi-stage curriculum learning to foster
progressive capability growth. Extensive experiments on real-world search
benchmarks show that TaoSR-SHE improves both reasoning quality and
relevance-prediction accuracy in large-scale e-commerce settings, outperforming
SFT, DPO, GRPO, and other baselines, while also enhancing interpretability and
robustness.

TL;DR: VoiceAgentBench is a benchmark designed to evaluate large-scale Speech Language Models in realistic spoken agent scenarios, analyzing their multilingual, cultural, and adversarial robustness capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing speech benchmarks inadequately assess complex and realistic scenarios involving multilingual and cultural understanding, as well as robust interactions in adversarial conditions.

Method: The paper introduces VoiceAgentBench, which uses over 5,500 synthetic spoken queries across multiple languages and cultural contexts, combining novel sampling algorithms for audio and diverse evaluation metrics.

Result: Experiments demonstrate gaps in SpeechLM's performance particularly in contextual tool orchestration tasks, Indic cultural generalization, and adversarial robustness.

Conclusion: VoiceAgentBench highlights the limitations of current SpeechLMs and provides a rigorous evaluation framework for advancing speech-based agents in challenging conversational environments.

Abstract: Large-scale Speech Language Models (SpeechLMs) have enabled voice assistants
capable of understanding natural spoken queries and performing complex tasks.
However, existing speech benchmarks primarily focus on isolated capabilities
such as transcription, or question-answering, and do not systematically
evaluate agentic scenarios encompassing multilingual and cultural
understanding, as well as adversarial robustness. To address this, we introduce
VoiceAgentBench, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate SpeechLMs in
realistic spoken agentic settings. It comprises over 5,500 synthetic spoken
queries, including dialogues grounded in Indian context, covering single-tool
invocations, multi-tool workflows, multi-turn interactions, and safety
evaluations. The benchmark supports English, Hindi, and 5 other Indian
languages, reflecting real-world linguistic and cultural diversity. We simulate
speaker variability using a novel sampling algorithm that selects audios for
TTS voice conversion based on its speaker embeddings, maximizing acoustic and
speaker diversity. Our evaluation measures tool selection accuracy, structural
consistency, and the correctness of tool invocations, including adversarial
robustness. Our experiments reveal significant gaps in contextual tool
orchestration tasks, Indic generalization, and adversarial robustness, exposing
critical limitations of current SpeechLMs.

*Haitao Jia,Ming He,Zimo Yin,Likang Wu,Jianping Fan,Jitao Sang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ReInAgent introduces a context-aware multi-agent framework for better task management on mobile devices by actively engaging users, improving task outcomes, and addressing limitations of existing mobile GUI agents.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing mobile GUI agents often neglect active user engagement, making them incapable of handling ambiguous, dynamic, or conflicting task scenarios effectively, resulting in outcomes that fail to meet user preferences.

Method: ReInAgent employs three specialized agents in a shared memory framework: one for slot-based information management, another for conflict-aware decision making, and a third for task reflection and validation, ensuring active user involvement and adaptability.

Result: ReInAgent achieves a 25% higher success rate than the existing Mobile-Agent-v2 on complex tasks involving information dilemmas, proving its effectiveness in managing dynamic user tasks.

Conclusion: ReInAgent provides a more adaptive, reliable, and user-aligned framework for handling complex real-world mobile tasks through continual user-agent collaboration and contextual analysis.

Abstract: Mobile GUI agents exhibit substantial potential to facilitate and automate
the execution of user tasks on mobile phones. However, exist mobile GUI agents
predominantly privilege autonomous operation and neglect the necessity of
active user engagement during task execution. This omission undermines their
adaptability to information dilemmas including ambiguous, dynamically evolving,
and conflicting task scenarios, leading to execution outcomes that deviate from
genuine user requirements and preferences. To address these shortcomings, we
propose ReInAgent, a context-aware multi-agent framework that leverages dynamic
information management to enable human-in-the-loop mobile task navigation.
ReInAgent integrates three specialized agents around a shared memory module: an
information-managing agent for slot-based information management and proactive
interaction with the user, a decision-making agent for conflict-aware planning,
and a reflecting agent for task reflection and information consistency
validation. Through continuous contextual information analysis and sustained
user-agent collaboration, ReInAgent overcomes the limitation of existing
approaches that rely on clear and static task assumptions. Consequently, it
enables more adaptive and reliable mobile task navigation in complex,
real-world scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate that ReInAgent
effectively resolves information dilemmas and produces outcomes that are more
closely aligned with genuine user preferences. Notably, on complex tasks
involving information dilemmas, ReInAgent achieves a 25% higher success rate
than Mobile-Agent-v2.

### [41] [Language Models Do Not Embed Numbers Continuously](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08009)
*Alex O. Davies,Roussel Nzoyem,Nirav Ajmeri,Telmo M. Silva Filho*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper examines how large language models (LLMs) handle numeric values, demonstrating that while they can reconstruct input values, their embedded representations are noisy and non-continuous, especially as numerical precision increases.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper has been driven by the need to evaluate whether language models represent numeric values as true continuous quantities, especially since these models are increasingly applied in numerically-sensitive domains.

Method: The authors employed linear reconstruction and principal component analysis (PCA) to assess the embedding spaces of models from OpenAI, Google Gemini, and Voyage AI.

Result: They found that numeric reconstruction is highly accurate ($R^2 \geq 0.95$), but the principal components explain only a small portion of the variance. Increasing decimal precision reduced both reconstruction and explained variance.

Conclusion: Language models do not represent numeric spaces as continuous and introduce significant noise, raising concerns for their application in high-precision numerical tasks.

Abstract: Recent research has extensively studied how large language models manipulate
integers in specific arithmetic tasks, and on a more fundamental level, how
they represent numeric values. These previous works have found that language
model embeddings can be used to reconstruct the original values, however, they
do not evaluate whether language models actually model continuous values as
continuous. Using expected properties of the embedding space, including linear
reconstruction and principal component analysis, we show that language models
not only represent numeric spaces as non-continuous but also introduce
significant noise. Using models from three major providers (OpenAI, Google
Gemini and Voyage AI), we show that while reconstruction is possible with high
fidelity ($R^2 \geq 0.95$), principal components only explain a minor share of
variation within the embedding space. This indicates that many components
within the embedding space are orthogonal to the simple numeric input space.
Further, both linear reconstruction and explained variance suffer with
increasing decimal precision, despite the ordinal nature of the input space
being fundamentally unchanged. The findings of this work therefore have
implications for the many areas where embedding models are used, in-particular
where high numerical precision, large magnitudes or mixed-sign values are
common.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Paper introduces PEAR, a novel method to control response length in reasoning models using phase-dependent entropy. Demonstrates shorter yet accurate outputs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenge of controlling reasoning response length in Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) without sacrificing accuracy.

Method: Developed Phase Entropy Aware Reward (PEAR), which adjusts the entropy penalties during different reasoning phases to balance concise reasoning with task accuracy.

Result: PEAR reduces response length effectively while maintaining high accuracy across four benchmarks and exhibits robust performance on out-of-distribution tasks.

Conclusion: Phase-dependent entropy serves as a powerful knob to optimize response length and accuracy, offering an adaptive alternative to rigid methods and showcasing scalability in reasoning tasks.

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have achieved impressive performance on complex
reasoning tasks by generating detailed chain-of-thought (CoT) explanations.
However, these responses are often excessively long, containing redundant
reasoning steps that inflate inference cost and reduce usability. Controlling
the length of generated reasoning without sacrificing accuracy remains an open
challenge. Through a systematic empirical analysis, we reveal a consistent
positive correlation between model entropy and response length at different
reasoning stages across diverse LRMs: the thinking phase exhibits higher
entropy, reflecting exploratory behavior of longer responses, while the final
answer phase shows lower entropy, indicating a more deterministic solution.This
observation suggests that entropy at different reasoning stages can serve as a
control knob for balancing conciseness and performance. Based on this insight,
this paper introduces Phase Entropy Aware Reward (PEAR), a reward mechanism
that incorporating phase-dependent entropy into the reward design. Instead of
treating all tokens uniformly, PEAR penalize excessive entropy during the
thinking phase and allowing moderate exploration at the final answer phase,
which encourages models to generate concise reasoning traces that retain
sufficient flexibility to solve the task correctly. This enables adaptive
control of response length without relying on explicit length targets or rigid
truncation rules. Extensive experiments across four benchmarks demonstrate that
PEAR consistently reduces response length while sustaining competitive accuracy
across model scales. In addition, PEAR demonstrates strong out-of-distribution
(OOD) robustness beyond the training distribution. Our code is available at:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Mitigate computational and memory challenges of adapting large-scale pretrained models to various tasks while improving LoRA's limitations like suboptimal performance and slow convergence.

Method: Introduces AILoRA, which uses a function-aware initialization strategy by leveraging the distinct functional characteristics of $W^Q$ and $W^V$ matrices in self-attention, retaining task-adaptive capacity and generalizable features.

Result: AILoRA enhances performance and convergence efficiency by better capturing the functional roles of $W^Q$ and $W^V$.

Conclusion: AILoRA improves the efficacy of parameter-efficient finetuning by leveraging asymmetric initialization tailored to specific functional roles in self-attention projection matrices.

Abstract: Parameter-efficient finetuning (PEFT) aims to mitigate the substantial
computational and memory overhead involved in adapting large-scale pretrained
models to diverse downstream tasks. Among numerous PEFT strategies, Low-Rank
Adaptation (LoRA) has emerged as one of the most widely adopted approaches due
to its robust empirical performance and low implementation complexity. In
practical deployment, LoRA is typically applied to the $W^Q$ and $W^V$
projection matrices of self-attention modules, enabling an effective trade-off
between model performance and parameter efficiency. While LoRA has achieved
considerable empirical success, it still encounters challenges such as
suboptimal performance and slow convergence. To address these limitations, we
introduce \textbf{AILoRA}, a novel parameter-efficient method that incorporates
function-aware asymmetric low-rank priors. Our empirical analysis reveals that
the projection matrices $W^Q$ and $W^V$ in the self-attention mechanism exhibit
distinct parameter characteristics, stemming from their functional differences.
Specifically, $W^Q$ captures task-specific semantic space knowledge essential
for attention distributions computation, making its parameters highly sensitive
to downstream task variations. In contrast, $W^V$ encodes token-level feature
representations that tend to remain stable across tasks and layers. Leveraging
these insights, AILoRA performs a function-aware initialization by injecting
the principal components of $W^Q$ to retain task-adaptive capacity, and the
minor components of $W^V$ to preserve generalizable feature representations.
This asymmetric initialization strategy enables LoRA modules to better capture
the specialized roles of attention parameters, thereby enhancing both
finetuning performance and convergence efficiency.

*Qingyuan Shi,Qingwen Meng,Hao Cheng,Qing Xu,Jianqiang Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper presents LinguaSim, a framework combining LLMs and feedback modules to generate accurate and realistic 3D driving scenarios for autonomous vehicle testing and training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To solve the issue of balancing accuracy in command adherence and realistic vehicle interactions in scenario generation for autonomous vehicle testing, which current methods fail to address effectively.

Method: Introduces LinguaSim, an LLM-based framework that translates natural language descriptions into high-fidelity, interactive 3D driving scenarios, complemented by a feedback calibration module for refinement.

Result: LinguaSim shows the ability to create scenarios matching varying user intents with reduced crash rates (46.9% to 6.3%) and differentiates criticality levels in scenarios with measurable metrics like ACT and comfortability.

Conclusion: LinguaSim bridges the gap between linguistic descriptions and interactive simulation, providing a robust tool for developing realistic and safe autonomous vehicle scenarios.

Abstract: The generation of testing and training scenarios for autonomous vehicles has
drawn significant attention. While Large Language Models (LLMs) have enabled
new scenario generation methods, current methods struggle to balance command
adherence accuracy with the realism of real-world driving environments. To
reduce scenario description complexity, these methods often compromise realism
by limiting scenarios to 2D, or open-loop simulations where background vehicles
follow predefined, non-interactive behaviors. We propose LinguaSim, an
LLM-based framework that converts natural language into realistic, interactive
3D scenarios, ensuring both dynamic vehicle interactions and faithful alignment
between the input descriptions and the generated scenarios. A feedback
calibration module further refines the generation precision, improving fidelity
to user intent. By bridging the gap between natural language and closed-loop,
interactive simulations, LinguaSim constrains adversarial vehicle behaviors
using both the scenario description and the autonomous driving model guiding
them. This framework facilitates the creation of high-fidelity scenarios that
enhance safety testing and training. Experiments show LinguaSim can generate
scenarios with varying criticality aligned with different natural language
descriptions (ACT: 0.072 s for dangerous vs. 3.532 s for safe descriptions;
comfortability: 0.654 vs. 0.764), and its refinement module effectively reduces
excessive aggressiveness in LinguaSim's initial outputs, lowering the crash
rate from 46.9% to 6.3% to better match user intentions.

*Qingyang Hao,Wenbo Liao,Bingyi Jing,Hongxin Wei*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Multi-Condition Conformal Selection (MCCS) algorithm for addressing multi-condition selection scenarios in applications like drug discovery and large-scale model alignment, offering rigorous False Discovery Rate (FDR) control.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address limitations of current conformal selection methods, which are restricted to single-threshold scenarios, by accommodating multi-condition selection requirements critical in resource-constrained applications.

Method: The authors developed MCCS by introducing a new nonconformity score with regional monotonicity for conjunctive conditions and a global BH procedure for disjunctive conditions, achieving finite-sample FDR control with a theoretical foundation.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrated MCCS's superiority over baseline methods, its adaptability to diverse condition combinations and real-world data types, as well as its scalability across multi-task settings.

Conclusion: The MCCS algorithm establishes a robust framework for multi-condition selection with proven FDR control, significantly enhancing selection accuracy and flexibility in resource-constrained domains.

Abstract: Selecting high-quality candidates from large-scale datasets is critically
important in resource-constrained applications such as drug discovery,
precision medicine, and the alignment of large language models. While conformal
selection methods offer a rigorous solution with False Discovery Rate (FDR)
control, their applicability is confined to single-threshold scenarios (i.e., y
> c) and overlooks practical needs for multi-condition selection, such as
conjunctive or disjunctive conditions. In this work, we propose the
Multi-Condition Conformal Selection (MCCS) algorithm, which extends conformal
selection to scenarios with multiple conditions. In particular, we introduce a
novel nonconformity score with regional monotonicity for conjunctive conditions
and a global Benjamini-Hochberg (BH) procedure for disjunctive conditions,
thereby establishing finite-sample FDR control with theoretical guarantees. The
integration of these components enables the proposed method to achieve rigorous
FDR-controlled selection in various multi-condition environments. Extensive
experiments validate the superiority of MCCS over baselines, its
generalizability across diverse condition combinations, different real-world
modalities, and multi-task scalability.

### [46] [AutoQual: An LLM Agent for Automated Discovery of Interpretable Features for Review Quality Assessment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08081)
*Xiaochong Lan,Jie Feng,Yinxing Liu,Xinlei Shi,Yong Li*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces AutoQual, a framework leveraging large language models (LLMs) to automate the discovery of interpretable features for quality ranking in online reviews, achieving measurable improvements in user engagement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improving the ranking of online reviews by their intrinsic quality, a task crucial for e-commerce platforms, hindered by the subjective, dynamic, and domain-specific nature of quality.

Method: AutoQual employs an LLM-based agent that iteratively generates, tests, and accumulates knowledge of interpretable feature hypotheses through reflection and autonomous tool implementation, designed as a general-purpose framework.

Result: When deployed on a large platform with extensive user data, AutoQual improved the average number of reviews viewed per user by 0.79% and increased conversion rates by 0.27%, validated through large-scale A/B testing.

Conclusion: AutoQual demonstrates the potential of using LLMs to automate quality assessment in a scalable and interpretable fashion, surpassing traditional and modern methods in efficiency and alignment with user behavior.

Abstract: Ranking online reviews by their intrinsic quality is a critical task for
e-commerce platforms and information services, impacting user experience and
business outcomes. However, quality is a domain-dependent and dynamic concept,
making its assessment a formidable challenge. Traditional methods relying on
hand-crafted features are unscalable across domains and fail to adapt to
evolving content patterns, while modern deep learning approaches often produce
black-box models that lack interpretability and may prioritize semantics over
quality. To address these challenges, we propose AutoQual, an LLM-based agent
framework that automates the discovery of interpretable features. While
demonstrated on review quality assessment, AutoQual is designed as a general
framework for transforming tacit knowledge embedded in data into explicit,
computable features. It mimics a human research process, iteratively generating
feature hypotheses through reflection, operationalizing them via autonomous
tool implementation, and accumulating experience in a persistent memory. We
deploy our method on a large-scale online platform with a billion-level user
base. Large-scale A/B testing confirms its effectiveness, increasing average
reviews viewed per user by 0.79% and the conversion rate of review readers by
0.27%.

*Sukriti Bhattacharya,Chitro Majumdar*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces a mathematical framework to ensure fair AI by eliminating sensitive information and its proxies using ontology and optimal transport.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of current bias mitigation methods which often fail to fully eliminate biased influences from sensitive attributes and proxies.

Method: Sensitive attributes and proxies are formally defined using ontology engineering (OWL 2 QL), then an optimal transport method is used to create fair representations independent of biased patterns while preserving accuracy.

Result: The framework achieves complete fairness by guaranteeing independence between biased patterns (sigma algebras) and produces trustworthy certifiable AI applications.

Conclusion: The proposed method ensures provable fairness and full independence from sensitive attributes, establishing a robust and trustworthy AI solution.

Abstract: This paper presents a framework for provably fair AI that overcomes the
limits of current bias mitigation methods by systematically removing all
sensitive information and its proxies. Using ontology engineering in OWL 2 QL,
it formally defines sensitive attributes and infers their proxies through
logical reasoning, constructing a sigma algebra G that captures the full
structure of biased patterns. Fair representations are then obtained via
Delbaen Majumdar optimal transport, which generates variables independent of G
while minimizing L2 distance to preserve accuracy. This guarantees true
independence rather than mere decorrelation. By modeling bias as dependence
between sigma algebras, compiling ontological knowledge into measurable
structures, and using optimal transport as the unique fair transformation, the
approach ensures complete fairness in tasks like loan approval, where proxies
such as ZIP code reveal race. The result is a certifiable and mathematically
grounded method for trustworthy AI.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper explores how language models can replicate human risk preferences, emphasizing the need to refine AI systems for ethical and effective risk management.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand and address the behavioral tendencies of language models in decision support systems to ensure responsible AI deployment.

Method: The study evaluates the alignment of LMs with human risk preferences across economic scenarios, focusing on factors like gender-specific attitudes, uncertainty, and manipulability.

Result: Findings show partial alignment of models (DeepSeek Reasoner and Gemini-2.0-flash-lite) with human behaviors, but discrepancies remain, especially in bio-centric manipulability.

Conclusion: Refinements in AI systems are needed to align human and AI risk preferences for ethical decision-making and enhanced risk management applicability.

Abstract: Responsible AI demands systems whose behavioral tendencies can be effectively
measured, audited, and adjusted to prevent inadvertently nudging users toward
risky decisions or embedding hidden biases in risk aversion. As language models
(LMs) are increasingly incorporated into AI-driven decision support systems,
understanding their risk behaviors is crucial for their responsible deployment.
This study investigates the manipulability of risk aversion (MoRA) in LMs,
examining their ability to replicate human risk preferences across diverse
economic scenarios, with a focus on gender-specific attitudes, uncertainty,
role-based decision-making, and the manipulability of risk aversion. The
results indicate that while LMs such as DeepSeek Reasoner and
Gemini-2.0-flash-lite exhibit some alignment with human behaviors, notable
discrepancies highlight the need to refine bio-centric measures of
manipulability. These findings suggest directions for refining AI design to
better align human and AI risk preferences and enhance ethical decision-making.
The study calls for further advancements in model design to ensure that AI
systems more accurately replicate human risk preferences, thereby improving
their effectiveness in risk management contexts. This approach could enhance
the applicability of AI assistants in managing risk.

*Jinling Gan,Churong Liang,Runnan Li*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces PMFR, a framework designed to improve open-domain dialogue AI's latency-quality tradeoff using asynchronous knowledge orchestration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the latency issue in open-domain dialogue systems while maintaining high reasoning quality and factuality.

Method: PMFR uses three components: a Knowledge Adequacy Evaluator for sufficiency checks, a Lightweight Response Generator for immediate replies, and an Asynchronous Knowledge Refinement Agent to improve background knowledge.

Result: PMFR reduced latency by 95.3% (from 23.38 seconds to 1.09 seconds) while maintaining comparable response quality to synchronous baselines.

Conclusion: PMFR effectively balances latency and quality, achieving significant improvements in conversational flow and knowledge enrichment.

Abstract: The latency-quality tradeoff is a fundamental constraint in open-domain
dialogue AI systems, since comprehensive knowledge access necessitates
prohibitive response delays. Contemporary approaches offer two inadequate
solutions: lightweight instruct models achieve sub-second latency but lack
reasoning depth, while tool-augmented ReAct agents enhance factuality through
external knowledge at the cost of synchronous execution that blocks interaction
during retrieval processes. PMFR is thus proposed, with a temporal decoupling
framework that fundamentally resolves the contradiction through asynchronous
knowledge orchestration. PMFR employs three coordinated components: (1) a
Knowledge Adequacy Evaluator for real-time sufficiency assessment, (2) a
Lightweight Response Generator for immediate user interaction, and (3) an
Asynchronous Knowledge Refinement Agent for background knowledge enhancement.
This architecture maintains continuous conversational flow while progressively
enriching knowledge coverage through intelligent triggering mechanisms.
Evaluation results on TopiOCQA demonstrate PMFR outperforms brute-force
scaling: PMFR achieves 95.3% latency reduction (23.38s -> 1.09s) while
preserving response quality comparable to heavyweight synchronous baselines
(GEval-C: 0.613 vs. 0.620).

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces R-HORIZON, a benchmark for evaluating and improving long-horizon reasoning in large reasoning models (LRMs), revealing their limitations and proposing reinforcement learning techniques to enhance their capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current reasoning benchmarks focus on single-horizon tasks, failing to evaluate models' ability in complex, long-horizon reasoning.

Method: R-HORIZON applies query composition to create a benchmark targeting long-horizon reasoning tasks, coupled with reinforcement learning using verified rewards to improve model performance.

Result: LRMs show significant performance degradation on long-horizon tasks, but training models using RLVR on R-HORIZON data boosts multi-horizon and standard reasoning performance, including a 7.5-point increase on the AIME2024 benchmark.

Conclusion: R-HORIZON serves as an effective method to scale, control, and cost-efficiently enhance the long-horizon reasoning abilities of LRMs, pushing boundaries in reasoning model evaluations.

Abstract: Recent trends in test-time scaling for reasoning models (e.g., OpenAI o1,
DeepSeek-R1) have led to remarkable improvements through long Chain-of-Thought
(CoT). However, existing benchmarks mainly focus on immediate, single-horizon
tasks, failing to adequately evaluate models' ability to understand and respond
to complex, long-horizon scenarios. To address this incomplete evaluation of
Large Reasoning Models (LRMs), we propose R-HORIZON, a method designed to
stimulate long-horizon reasoning behaviors in LRMs through query composition.
Based on R-HORIZON, we construct a long-horizon reasoning benchmark, comprising
complex multi-step reasoning tasks with interdependent problems that span long
reasoning horizons. Through comprehensive evaluation of LRMs using the
R-HORIZON benchmark, we find that even the most advanced LRMs suffer
significant performance degradation. Our analysis reveals that LRMs exhibit
limited effective reasoning length and struggle to allocate thinking budget
across multiple problems appropriately. Recognizing these limitations, we use
R-HORIZON to construct long-horizon reasoning data for reinforcement learning
with verified rewards (RLVR). Compared to training with single-horizon data,
RLVR with R-HORIZON not only substantially improves performance on the
multi-horizon reasoning tasks, but also promotes accuracy on standard reasoning
tasks, with an increase of 7.5 on AIME2024. These results position R-HORIZON as
a scalable, controllable, and low-cost paradigm for enhancing and evaluating
the long-horizon reasoning capabilities of LRMs.

*Rashid Mushkani*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces the AI Pluralism Index (AIPI) to measure how AI systems incorporate diverse stakeholder interests and maintain transparent and accountable governance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI systems significantly influence knowledge, communication, and decisions, yet their development is concentrated among a few actors, creating risks of narrow bias and limited public influence.

Method: The study formalizes a measurement model and implements a reproducible pipeline to assess practices across participatory governance, inclusivity, transparency, and accountability, using public artifacts, expert inputs, and structured evaluations.

Result: Pilot results for AI producers were reported along with correlations to other governance frameworks, showcasing AIPI as a tool for comparative evaluation and evidence generation.

Conclusion: AIPI promotes pluralistic AI practices by providing policymakers and stakeholders with transparent data, fostering accountability, inclusivity, and stakeholder empowerment.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence systems increasingly mediate knowledge,
communication, and decision making. Development and governance remain
concentrated within a small set of firms and states, raising concerns that
technologies may encode narrow interests and limit public agency. Capability
benchmarks for language, vision, and coding are common, yet public, auditable
measures of pluralistic governance are rare. We define AI pluralism as the
degree to which affected stakeholders can shape objectives, data practices,
safeguards, and deployment. We present the AI Pluralism Index (AIPI), a
transparent, evidence-based instrument that evaluates producers and system
families across four pillars: participatory governance, inclusivity and
diversity, transparency, and accountability. AIPI codes verifiable practices
from public artifacts and independent evaluations, explicitly handling
"Unknown" evidence to report both lower-bound ("evidence") and known-only
scores with coverage. We formalize the measurement model; implement a
reproducible pipeline that integrates structured web and repository analysis,
external assessments, and expert interviews; and assess reliability with
inter-rater agreement, coverage reporting, cross-index correlations, and
sensitivity analysis. The protocol, codebook, scoring scripts, and evidence
graph are maintained openly with versioned releases and a public adjudication
process. We report pilot provider results and situate AIPI relative to adjacent
transparency, safety, and governance frameworks. The index aims to steer
incentives toward pluralistic practice and to equip policymakers, procurers,
and the public with comparable evidence.

### [52] [The Tournament Tree Method for preference elicitation in Multi-criteria decision-making](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08197)
*Diego García-Zamora,Álvaro Labella,José Rui Figueira*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The Tournament Tree Method (TTM) reduces cognitive load and ensures consistent preference modeling with only m-1 pairwise comparisons.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing pairwise comparison methods in decision-making demand high cognitive effort, struggle with inconsistency, and face computational challenges, prompting the need for a more efficient methodology.

Method: The TTM involves three phases: fewer targeted pairwise comparisons (m-1), construction of a consistent matrix, and derivation of a value scale, integrated with a web-based tool.

Result: The TTM achieves a reduction in cognitive load, ensures consistency by design, and reduces dimensionality in preference modeling from quadratic to linear parameters.

Conclusion: The TTM offers a more efficient and practical approach to pairwise comparison, compatible with existing methods while ensuring ease of use and consistency.

Abstract: Pairwise comparison methods, such as Fuzzy Preference Relations and Saaty's
Multiplicative Preference Relations, are widely used to model expert judgments
in multi-criteria decision-making. However, their application is limited by the
high cognitive load required to complete $m(m-1)/2$ comparisons, the risk of
inconsistency, and the computational complexity of deriving consistent value
scales. This paper proposes the Tournament Tree Method (TTM), a novel
elicitation and evaluation framework that overcomes these limitations. The TTM
requires only $m-1$ pairwise comparisons to obtain a complete, reciprocal, and
consistent comparison matrix. The method consists of three phases: (i)
elicitation of expert judgments using a reduced set of targeted comparisons,
(ii) construction of the consistent pairwise comparison matrix, and (iii)
derivation of a global value scale from the resulting matrix. The proposed
approach ensures consistency by design, minimizes cognitive effort, and reduces
the dimensionality of preference modeling from $m(m-1)/2$ to $m$ parameters.
Furthermore, it is compatible with the classical Deck of Cards method, and thus
it can handle interval and ratio scales. We have also developed a web-based
tool that demonstrates its practical applicability in real decision-making
scenarios.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: DODO is an algorithm enabling an Agent to learn the causal structure of its environment through interventions, achieving superior performance in causal inference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance AI's understanding of underlying mechanisms in environments by enabling causality awareness, which current correlation-based approaches lack.

Method: The DODO algorithm enables an Agent to infer the causal Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) of a system using interventions and causal inference techniques, even in noisy conditions.

Result: DODO surpasses observational methods, reconstructing causal graphs with zero errors in many cases, and outperforms the best baseline model in challenging scenarios by +0.25 F1 points.

Conclusion: DODO significantly improves causal structure learning in AI, especially under complex and noisy scenarios, demonstrating its utility over traditional methods.

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence has achieved remarkable advancements in recent years,
yet much of its progress relies on identifying increasingly complex
correlations. Enabling causality awareness in AI has the potential to enhance
its performance by enabling a deeper understanding of the underlying mechanisms
of the environment. In this paper, we introduce DODO, an algorithm defining how
an Agent can autonomously learn the causal structure of its environment through
repeated interventions. We assume a scenario where an Agent interacts with a
world governed by a causal Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG), which dictates the
system's dynamics but remains hidden from the Agent. The Agent's task is to
accurately infer the causal DAG, even in the presence of noise. To achieve
this, the Agent performs interventions, leveraging causal inference techniques
to analyze the statistical significance of observed changes. Results show
better performance for DODO, compared to observational approaches, in all but
the most limited resource conditions. DODO is often able to reconstruct with as
low as zero errors the structure of the causal graph. In the most challenging
configuration, DODO outperforms the best baseline by +0.25 F1 points.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper addresses reasoning challenges in machine learning by interpreting tasks through a causal lens and presenting a novel framework called SR$^2$. This approach improves reasoning accuracy significantly.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Machine learning models, particularly LLMs, struggle with reasoning tasks despite extensive training. The paper seeks to understand and improve reasoning from a causal perspective.

Method: Reasoning tasks are framed as a selection mechanism involving latent variables with strong dependencies. The SR$^2$ framework introduces reflective representation learning, dependency self-refinement, and intermediate alignment.

Result: SR$^2$ demonstrates superior performance, including a notable 10% improvement in tasks like Sudoku and Maze, and achieves this with fewer parameters.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively enhances reasoning accuracy using causal-based latent feedback mechanisms, offering a robust solution for complex tasks.

Abstract: Due to their inherent complexity, reasoning tasks have long been regarded as
rigorous benchmarks for assessing the capabilities of machine learning models,
especially large language models (LLMs). Although humans can solve these tasks
with ease, existing models, even after extensive pre-training and post-training
at scale, still fail to perform reasoning reliably. In this paper, we revisit
reasoning tasks from a causal perspective, seeking to understand their behavior
in latent space and to offer insights for addressing their challenges.
Specifically, we cast reasoning tasks as a selection mechanism, in which
high-level logical concepts function as selection operators on the given
observations, such as, identifying the correct answer in a math problem or
filling the appropriate entry in Sudoku. We emphasize two key properties of
this formulation that shed light on the difficulty of reasoning tasks. First,
the latent space exceeds the observation space in complexity, even when the
correct answer is fully determined by the observed input. Second, the latent
variables, corresponding to logical thought, are densely structured and exhibit
strong dependencies. Building on this formulation, we introduce a framework,
called SR$^2$, that incorporates the estimated latent variables as feedback
into the selection mechanism, thereby facilitating the learning of dense
dependencies among latent representations. The framework consists of three key
modules: reflective representation learning, dependency self-refinement, and
periodic intermediate alignment. Experimentally, we show that our approach
yields significant gains in reasoning accuracy, for example, attaining over
10$\%$ improvement in performance with 8$\times$ fewer parameters on the Sudoku
and Maze tasks over the recent advances.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces a new multi-step backdoor attack called CoTri, aimed at exploiting vulnerabilities in large language model-based agents, showing high efficiency while paradoxically enhancing agent performance in benign scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The work is motivated by increasing concerns over the trustworthiness and security of large language model-based agents deployed in real-world scenarios, necessitating an exploration of their vulnerabilities.

Method: The method involves the novel Chain-of-Trigger Backdoor (CoTri), a multi-step attack leveraging an ordered sequence of triggers drawn from the environment for agentic control.

Result: CoTri achieves a near-perfect attack success rate with a very low false trigger rate. Additionally, it paradoxically enhances agent performance on typical tasks and increases robustness against distractions.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates that CoTri is an effective and stealthy method of multi-step control for large language models and multimodal agents, raising significant safety concerns.

Abstract: The rapid deployment of large language model (LLM)-based agents in real-world
applications has raised serious concerns about their trustworthiness. In this
work, we reveal the security and robustness vulnerabilities of these agents
through backdoor attacks. Distinct from traditional backdoors limited to
single-step control, we propose the Chain-of-Trigger Backdoor (CoTri), a
multi-step backdoor attack designed for long-horizon agentic control. CoTri
relies on an ordered sequence. It starts with an initial trigger, and
subsequent ones are drawn from the environment, allowing multi-step
manipulation that diverts the agent from its intended task. Experimental
results show that CoTri achieves a near-perfect attack success rate (ASR) while
maintaining a near-zero false trigger rate (FTR). Due to training data modeling
the stochastic nature of the environment, the implantation of CoTri
paradoxically enhances the agent's performance on benign tasks and even
improves its robustness against environmental distractions. We further validate
CoTri on vision-language models (VLMs), confirming its scalability to
multimodal agents. Our work highlights that CoTri achieves stable, multi-step
control within agents, improving their inherent robustness and task
capabilities, which ultimately makes the attack more stealthy and raises
potential safty risks.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces Co-TAP, a protocol for multi-agent systems to improve interoperability, interaction, and knowledge sharing using three layers: HAI (Human-Agent Interaction), UAP (Unified Agent Protocol), and MEK (Memory-Extraction-Knowledge).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in multi-agent systems, such as interoperability among diverse agents, effective collaboration, and efficient knowledge sharing.

Method: The authors propose Co-TAP, comprising HAI for interaction standardization, UAP for seamless agent interoperability, and MEK for cognitive memory-to-knowledge processes.

Result: The Co-TAP framework improves real-time agent interaction, ensures cross-agent communication, and facilitates knowledge formation, promising better multi-agent system performance.

Conclusion: Co-TAP lays a theoretical and engineering foundation for developing scalable, efficient, and intelligent multi-agent systems.

Abstract: This paper proposes Co-TAP (T: Triple, A: Agent, P: Protocol), a three-layer
agent interaction protocol designed to address the challenges faced by
multi-agent systems across the three core dimensions of Interoperability,
Interaction and Collaboration, and Knowledge Sharing. We have designed and
proposed a layered solution composed of three core protocols: the Human-Agent
Interaction Protocol (HAI), the Unified Agent Protocol (UAP), and the
Memory-Extraction-Knowledge Protocol (MEK). HAI focuses on the interaction
layer, standardizing the flow of information between users, interfaces, and
agents by defining a standardized, event-driven communication paradigm. This
ensures the real-time performance, reliability, and synergy of interactions. As
the core of the infrastructure layer, UAP is designed to break down
communication barriers among heterogeneous agents through unified service
discovery and protocol conversion mechanisms, thereby enabling seamless
interconnection and interoperability of the underlying network. MEK, in turn,
operates at the cognitive layer. By establishing a standardized ''Memory (M) -
Extraction (E) - Knowledge (K)'' cognitive chain, it empowers agents with the
ability to learn from individual experiences and form shareable knowledge,
thereby laying the foundation for the realization of true collective
intelligence. We believe this protocol framework will provide a solid
engineering foundation and theoretical guidance for building the next
generation of efficient, scalable, and intelligent multi-agent applications.

Motivation: Improve optimization efficiency and generalization of neural networks by leveraging shared structural properties and learning mappings.

Method: Utilize ScaleGMNs to operate directly in weight space, enabling single-shot fine-tuning, and analyze the gauge freedom via scaling symmetries.

Result: Empirical demonstrations validate the effectiveness of ScaleGMNs, supported by theoretical insights on gauge freedom differences in CNNs vs. MLPs.

Conclusion: Symmetry-aware metanetworks, like ScaleGMNs, are a promising direction for enhancing optimization efficiency and generalizability in neural networks.

Abstract: Amortized optimization accelerates the solution of related optimization
problems by learning mappings that exploit shared structure across problem
instances. We explore the use of Scale Equivariant Graph Metanetworks
(ScaleGMNs) for this purpose. By operating directly in weight space, ScaleGMNs
enable single-shot fine-tuning of existing models, reducing the need for
iterative optimization. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach
empirically and provide a theoretical result: the gauge freedom induced by
scaling symmetries is strictly smaller in convolutional neural networks than in
multi-layer perceptrons. This insight helps explain the performance differences
observed between architectures in both our work and that of Kalogeropoulos et
al. (2024). Overall, our findings underscore the potential of symmetry-aware
metanetworks as a powerful approach for efficient and generalizable neural
network optimization. Open-source code:

### [58] [First Try Matters: Revisiting the Role of Reflection in Reasoning Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08308)
*Liwei Kang,Yue Deng,Yao Xiao,Zhanfeng Mo,Wee Sun Lee,Lidong Bing*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The study analyzes the role of reflective reasoning in large language models on mathematical datasets and proposes methods to reduce unnecessary steps in reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The researchers aim to clarify the contribution of reflections to reasoning performance and address inefficiencies in the reasoning process.

Method: The study involves analyzing the reasoning rollouts of eight models across five datasets, constructing training datasets with varying reflection steps, and proposing a question-aware early-stopping method as well as dynamic truncation of reflections.

Result: Reflective reasoning was predominantly confirmatory and rarely altered initial answers. Training with more reflection steps improved initial answer correctness but did not significantly enhance correction of initial errors. Dynamic truncation reduced reasoning tokens by 24.5% with only a 2.9% accuracy drop.

Conclusion: Reflections contribute mainly to confirming answers rather than correcting errors, and optimized early stopping can enhance efficiency with minimal accuracy loss.

Abstract: Large language models have recently demonstrated significant gains in
reasoning ability, often attributed to their capacity to generate longer chains
of thought and engage in reflective reasoning. However, the contribution of
reflections to performance improvement remains unclear. In this paper, we
systematically analyze the rollouts of eight reasoning models on five
mathematical datasets. We focus on reflective behaviours where the model has
already produced an answer but continues reflecting before finalizing its
output. Our analysis reveals that reflections are predominantly confirmatory
and rarely alter the model's initial answer, a pattern consistent across models
and datasets. To understand the role of reflections in training, we construct
supervised fine-tuning (SFT) datasets with varying amounts of reflection steps.
We observe that training models on rollouts with more reflection steps
primarily enhances first-answer correctness rather than the ability to correct
initially wrong answers through reflections. This motivates us to propose a
question-aware early-stopping method that enhances inference-time token
efficiency by stopping the reasoning process once a few plausible candidate
answers are generated, thereby reducing unnecessary reflection steps. Motivated
by this, we further propose to dynamically truncate the reflections after a
candidate answer has appeared during generation, which reduces reasoning tokens
by 24.5% across five mathematical datasets, within a 2.9% drop in accuracy.

*Marius Dragoi,Ioana Pintilie,Florin Gogianu,Florin Brad*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper discusses a novel evaluation metric, Cover@tau, for assessing reasoning abilities of Large Language Models, contrasting it with commonly used Pass@k metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To precisely assess reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models in discrete-answer reasoning tasks, where conventional metrics may offer misleading interpretations.

Method: Proposing and employing a new evaluation metric, Cover@tau, which accounts for reasoning reliability by measuring if a certain threshold of correct completions is achieved.

Result: Cover@tau provides a differing perspective on model rankings, showing that models relying on guessing falter as reliability thresholds increase.

Conclusion: Cover@tau offers a robust alternative for evaluating reasoning in Large Language Models, addressing limitations of Pass@k, especially in tasks with discrete answer spaces.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has emerged as a
powerful paradigm to improve Large Language Models on reasoning tasks such as
coding, math or logic. To assess the reasoning boundary (the fraction of
problems a model can solve) researchers often report Pass@k at large sampling
budgets. Recent results reveal a crossover phenomenon: while RLVR models
outperform the base model at small k values, the base model usually outperforms
them when sampling a very large number of completions. This has been
interpreted as evidence that base models have a larger reasoning boundary. We
argue that on tasks with discrete answer spaces, such as math with numeric
outputs, Pass@k at large k reflects the increasingly higher chance of success
in the limit of the number of trials rather than genuine reasoning, and can
therefore be misleading. We propose Cover@tau, which measures the fraction of
problems that a model can solve for which at least a tau proportion of
completions are correct. Unlike Pass@k, Cover@tau captures reasoning under an
explicit reliability threshold: models that rely on random guessing degrade
rapidly as tau increases. We evaluate several RLVR models using Cover@tau-based
metrics and illustrate how the relative rankings of popular algorithms change
compared to Pass@1, offering a different perspective on reasoning boundaries.

*Benjamin F. Maier,Ulf Aslak,Luca Fiaschi,Nina Rismal,Kemble Fletcher,Christian C. Luhmann,Robbie Dow,Kli Pappas,Thomas V. Wiecki*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper addresses limitations in traditional consumer research by introducing a new LLM-based method called semantic similarity rating (SSR). SSR maps textual responses to Likert scale distributions, achieving high reliability and realistic distributions when tested on real consumer survey data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional consumer research methods are costly and suffer from biases and limited scalability. Large language models (LLMs) have the potential to address these challenges, but they produce unrealistic numerical ratings in direct applications.

Method: The SSR method involves eliciting textual responses from LLMs and mapping them to Likert scale distributions using embedding similarity to reference statements. The method is validated on a dataset of 57 surveys with 9,300 human responses.

Result: The SSR method achieves 90% of human test-retest reliability and produces realistic response distributions (KS similarity > 0.85). Additionally, the method enables synthetic respondents to provide qualitative insights alongside quantitative ratings.

Conclusion: SSR provides a scalable, reliable, and interpretable framework for consumer research simulation, overcoming traditional biases and preserving standard survey metrics.

Abstract: Consumer research costs companies billions annually yet suffers from panel
biases and limited scale. Large language models (LLMs) offer an alternative by
simulating synthetic consumers, but produce unrealistic response distributions
when asked directly for numerical ratings. We present semantic similarity
rating (SSR), a method that elicits textual responses from LLMs and maps these
to Likert distributions using embedding similarity to reference statements.
Testing on an extensive dataset comprising 57 personal care product surveys
conducted by a leading corporation in that market (9,300 human responses), SSR
achieves 90% of human test-retest reliability while maintaining realistic
response distributions (KS similarity > 0.85). Additionally, these synthetic
respondents provide rich qualitative feedback explaining their ratings. This
framework enables scalable consumer research simulations while preserving
traditional survey metrics and interpretability.

TL;DR: The paper introduces QAgent, a framework designed to improve the retrieval capabilities of large language models (LLMs) for knowledge-intensive tasks, overcoming limitations in query understanding and system integration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the limitations of LLMs in static parametric knowledge and improve upon traditional Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), which struggles with complex queries and generalization in real-world scenarios.

Method: The method involves designing a modular search agent trained via reinforcement learning. The agent uses interactive reasoning and a multi-step decision-making process to optimize retrieval quality.

Result: Experiments demonstrate that QAgent improves querying capabilities, excels in question answering tasks, and serves as a flexible modular component for real-world application.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that QAgent enhances LLM generalization and retrieval processes. It represents a significant step toward making RAG frameworks more adaptive and deployable in complex systems.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at natural language tasks but are limited
by their static parametric knowledge, especially in knowledge-intensive task.
Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) mitigates this by integrating external
information. However, (1) traditional RAG struggles with complex query
understanding, and (2) even search agents trained with reinforcement learning
(RL), despite their promise, still face generalization and deployment
challenges. To address these limitations, we propose QAgent, a unified agentic
RAG framework that employs a search agent for adaptive retrieval. This agent
optimizes its understanding of the query through interactive reasoning and
retrieval. To facilitate real-world application, we focus on modular search
agent for query understanding that are plug-and-play in complex systems.
Secifically, the agent follows a multi-step decision process trained with RL to
maximize retrieval quality and support accurate downstream answers. We further
analyze the strengths and weaknesses of end-to-end RL and propose a strategy
that focuses on effective retrieval, thereby enhancing generalization in LLM
applications. Experiments show QAgent excels at QA and serves as a
plug-and-play module for real-world deployment.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper presents a method for detecting hallucinations in large language models by quantifying uncertainty through analyzing the effective rank of hidden states, without needing external knowledge or additional components.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in detecting hallucinations in large language models (LLMs) and enhance their trustworthiness in deployment.

Method: The authors propose using spectral analysis to measure the effective rank of hidden states across multiple outputs and layers of LLMs to quantify uncertainty, requiring no extra knowledge or modules.

Result: The method effectively detects hallucinations and generalizes robustly across diverse scenarios, as shown by extensive experiments.

Conclusion: The study provides a robust and interpretable approach for hallucination detection in LLMs, contributing to their reliability and truthfulness.

Abstract: Detecting hallucinations in large language models (LLMs) remains a
fundamental challenge for their trustworthy deployment. Going beyond basic
uncertainty-driven hallucination detection frameworks, we propose a simple yet
powerful method that quantifies uncertainty by measuring the effective rank of
hidden states derived from multiple model outputs and different layers.
Grounded in the spectral analysis of representations, our approach provides
interpretable insights into the model's internal reasoning process through
semantic variations, while requiring no extra knowledge or additional modules,
thus offering a combination of theoretical elegance and practical efficiency.
Meanwhile, we theoretically demonstrate the necessity of quantifying
uncertainty both internally (representations of a single response) and
externally (different responses), providing a justification for using
representations among different layers and responses from LLMs to detect
hallucinations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method effectively
detects hallucinations and generalizes robustly across various scenarios,
contributing to a new paradigm of hallucination detection for LLM truthfulness.

*Bianca-Mihaela Ganescu,Suchir Salhan,Andrew Caines,Paula Buttery*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces a lightweight vision-language model architecture using dynamic gating, feature modulation, and auxiliary objectives for efficient multimodal learning under limited data constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The goal is to make vision-language models effective under cognitively-realistic constraints, specifically limited training data.

Method: They propose a decoder-based model with dynamic gating for multimodal fusion, feature modulation, channel attention, and auxiliary contrastive tasks for visual grounding.

Result: The model achieves competitive or superior results on five benchmarks and uncovers interpretable patterns for information fusion.

Conclusion: Dynamic gating is proven as an effective tool for multimodal learning, balancing performance and interpretability under stringent conditions.

Abstract: Training vision-language models on cognitively-plausible amounts of data
requires rethinking how models integrate multimodal information. Within the
constraints of the Vision track for the BabyLM Challenge 2025, we propose a
lightweight decoder-based architecture with (1) token-wise dynamic gating for
adaptive fusion of linguistic and visual cues, (2) feature modulation and
channel attention to maximise the utility of limited visual information and (3)
auxiliary contrastive objectives for visual grounding. Evaluation on five
benchmarks (BLiMP, BLiMP Supplement, EWoK, Winoground and VQA) shows
competitive or superior performance to multimodal baselines. More notably, our
dynamic gate discovers interpretable patterns without explicit supervision,
favouring visual cues for content words and linguistic cues for function words.
While we identify limitations in the Challenge constraints, such as the
information bottleneck created by global image embeddings and training
instability from the dataset split, our findings establish dynamic gating as a
powerful tool for efficient multimodal learning, offering both interpretability
and performance even under severe constraints.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: AutoMLGen integrates domain knowledge and Monte Carlo Graph Search, achieving state-of-the-art performance in ML engineering tasks like AutoML and Kaggle competitions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs lack fine-grained domain knowledge and struggle in dynamic MLE scenarios requiring repeated adjustments, limiting their self-evolution and search space diversity.

Method: Introduces AutoMLGen, combining domain knowledge bases and Monte Carlo Graph Search (MCGS) with fine-grained operators for enhanced stability and exploration.

Result: AutoMLGen demonstrated superior metrics including medal rate and valid submission rate on MLE-Bench, outperforming benchmarks within reduced runtime constraints.

Conclusion: AutoMLGen effectively integrates advanced exploration methods and prior knowledge to enable efficient programming in MLE, showcasing significant improvements in performance and resource optimization.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown impressive performance in general
programming tasks. However, in Machine Learning Engineering (MLE) scenarios
such as AutoML and Kaggle competitions, achieving high performance depends
heavily on expert intervention and repeated adjustments rather than simply
generating correct code. When applied directly to these tasks, LLMs often lack
fine-grained domain priors, and existing MLE approaches that use linear or
tree-structured searches limit knowledge transfer to adjacent hierarchical
links. As a result, they cannot leverage past full trajectories or share
information across branches, limiting self-evolving ability and search space
diversity. To address these limitations, we introduce AutoMLGen, an LLM-based
coding agent that integrates a domain knowledge base for high-quality prior
guidance and Monte Carlo Graph Search (MCGS) for efficient exploration. MCGS
retains the tree-guided exploration of MCTS while embedding a graph structure
into the expansion stage to enable dynamic path reorganization, historical
trajectory reuse, and multi-solution fusion to support both self-evolution and
collaborative learning. Combined with fine-grained operator sets, this design
improves stability and accelerates convergence. Evaluation on the MLE-Bench
shows that AutoMLGen achieves state-of-the-art performance in numerous
dimensions, such as the average medal rate and the valid submission rate, under
a 12-hour budget (half the standard runtime). The code is available at

*Grace Liu,Yuxiao Qu,Jeff Schneider,Aarti Singh,Aviral Kumar*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces CaRT, a method to teach language models when to stop gathering information and make decisions, improving efficiency and success rates in tasks like medical diagnosis and math solving.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the challenge of teaching models not only how to effectively acquire information but also when to terminate this process to avoid inefficiencies or errors during decision-making.

Method: CaRT fine-tunes language models using counterfactual trajectory pairs, training them to rationalize the decision to either stop or continue gathering information.

Result: CaRT demonstrates improved efficiency in information gathering and higher task success rates in interactive medical diagnosis and math problem-solving compared to other fine-tuning methods.

Conclusion: The approach of using counterfactual reasoning significantly enhances a model's ability to strategically decide when to terminate information gathering, leading to better task outcomes.

Abstract: Many tasks require learned models to strategically gather relevant
information over multiple rounds of interaction before actually acting on a
task. Strategic information gathering requires models to know not only how to
effectively acquire information, but also when to stop gathering information
and make a decision, in order to avoid overthinking or getting derailed when
acting. In this paper, we formalize this problem and introduce Counterfactuals
and Reasoning for Termination (CaRT), an approach for teaching LLMs when to
stop seeking information. To appropriately learn when to terminate, CaRT
fine-tunes LLMs using counterfactual pairs of trajectories, one where
termination is appropriate and a minimally modified version of the same
trajectory where it is not. It trains the LLM to explain the rationale for the
termination decision in either case via verbal reasoning, and imbues this
capability into the base LLM via fine-tuning. We instantiate CaRT in two
domains: interactive medical diagnosis and math problem solving. In both
domains, we find that CaRT improves the efficiency of information gathering and
task success rate compared to other fine-tuning methods.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces 'early experience,' a paradigm where language agents learn from their own actions in environments without relying on reward signals, leading to improved generalization and effectiveness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome limitations in training language agents solely through expert data, which captures limited diversity, and to provide a scalable alternative to reinforcement learning in environments lacking rewards or requiring long rollouts.

Method: The authors propose and evaluate two strategies within the 'early experience' paradigm: (1) Implicit world modeling, which grounds policies in environment dynamics, and (2) Self-reflection, enabling agents to learn from suboptimal actions. They tested these strategies across diverse environments and model families.

Result: The proposed approaches demonstrated consistent improvements in effectiveness and out-of-domain generalization across eight environments. In reward-based settings, 'early experience' provided a strong foundation for further reinforcement learning.

Conclusion: The 'early experience' paradigm bridges the gap between imitation learning and fully experience-driven agents, enhancing performance and adaptability in diverse tasks.

Abstract: A long-term goal of language agents is to learn and improve through their own
experience, ultimately outperforming humans in complex, real-world tasks.
However, training agents from experience data with reinforcement learning
remains difficult in many environments, which either lack verifiable rewards
(e.g., websites) or require inefficient long-horizon rollouts (e.g., multi-turn
tool use). As a result, most current agents rely on supervised fine-tuning on
expert data, which is challenging to scale and generalizes poorly. This
limitation stems from the nature of expert demonstrations: they capture only a
narrow range of scenarios and expose the agent to limited environment
diversity. We address this limitation with a middle-ground paradigm we call
early experience: interaction data generated by the agent's own actions, where
the resulting future states serve as supervision without reward signals. Within
this paradigm we study two strategies of using such data: (1) Implicit world
modeling, which uses collected states to ground the policy in environment
dynamics; and (2) Self-reflection, where the agent learns from its suboptimal
actions to improve reasoning and decision-making. We evaluate across eight
diverse environments and multiple model families. Our approaches consistently
improve effectiveness and out-of-domain generalization, highlighting the value
of early experience. Moreover, in environments with verifiable rewards, our
results provide promising signals that early experience offers a strong
foundation for subsequent reinforcement learning, positioning it as a practical
bridge between imitation learning and fully experience-driven agents.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The study focuses on techniques to fine-tune large multimodal models (LMMs) sequentially for new tasks without sacrificing performance on previously learned tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper is motivated by the challenge of teaching LMMs new skills sequentially while avoiding catastrophic forgetting of prior tasks.

Method: The authors propose two fine-tuning strategies: (i) updating self-attention projection layers, and (ii) freezing the Down projection while updating only the MLP Gate&Up. They also analyze token distribution shifts to understand forgetting behavior.

Result: The methods deliver significant improvement in target tasks while preserving performance on held-out tasks, and token distribution shifts are identified as a key metric for monitoring forgetting.

Conclusion: The introduced fine-tuning recipes effectively balance learning new abilities and retaining general multimodal capabilities, providing a practical approach for sequential skill acquisition in LMMs.

Abstract: How can we teach large multimodal models (LMMs) new skills without erasing
prior abilities? We study sequential fine-tuning on five target skills while
monitoring general ability on eight held-out benchmarks across three model
families. We observe that apparent "forgetting" on held-out tasks after narrow
fine-tuning can partly recover at later stages. We trace this behavior to a
measurable shift in the output token distribution, manifested through a simple
counting-bias probe that co-varies with forgetting. Guided by this picture, we
identify two simple, robust tuning recipes that learn strongly while limiting
drift: (i) updating only the self-attention projection layers, and (ii)
updating only the MLP Gate&Up while freezing the Down projection. Across models
and tasks, these choices deliver strong target gains while largely preserving
held-out performance. Code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand and improve server idle-state inefficiencies in latency-critical applications, aiming at enhancing energy efficiency.

Method: Utilized queuing models (M/M/1, cxM/M/1, M/M/c) to theoretically estimate idle time distribution at the CPU core and package levels, comparing outcomes with real server observations.

Result: Discovered significant missed opportunities for servers to enter deep idle states due to idle-governor inaccuracies and high transition latencies.

Conclusion: The findings enable early-stage design exploration, highlighting strategies to optimize idle time behavior and server configurations for better energy efficiency.

Abstract: This work introduces a model-based framework that reveals the idle
opportunity of modern servers running latency-critical applications.
Specifically, three queuing models, M/M/1, cxM/M/1, and M/M/c, are used to
estimate the theoretical idle time distribution at the CPU core and system
(package) level. A comparison of the actual idleness of a real server and that
from the theoretical models reveals significant missed opportunities to enter
deep idle states. This inefficiency is attributed to the idle-governor
inaccuracy and the high latency to transition to/from legacy deep-idle states.
The proposed methodology offers the means for an early-stage design exploration
and insights into idle time behavior and opportunities for varying server
system configurations and load.

*Parker Hao Tian,Zahra Yousefijamarani,Alaa Alameldeen*

Main category: cs.AR

TL;DR: The paper introduces DL-PIM, a PIM architecture that improves data locality via dynamic data movement and address-indirection, resulting in reduced memory latency and performance gains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reduce data transfer overheads in PIM architectures that degrade performance and energy efficiency due to lack of data locality.

Method: Propose DL-PIM, which dynamically detects data movement overheads, relocates data proactively using a reserved local area, and leverages a distributed address-indirection hardware lookup table.

Result: DL-PIM reduces memory latency by 54% (HMC) and 50% (HBM), improves performance for workloads with significant data reuse by 15% (HMC) and 5% (HBM), and overall achieves a 6% speedup (HMC) and 3% speedup (HBM).

Conclusion: DL-PIM improves data locality and overall system performance, although adaptive mechanisms are required to mitigate the negative impact on some workloads.

Abstract: PIM architectures aim to reduce data transfer costs between processors and
memory by integrating processing units within memory layers. Prior PIM
architectures have shown potential to improve energy efficiency and
performance. However, such advantages rely on data proximity to the processing
units performing computations. Data movement overheads can degrade PIM's
performance and energy efficiency due to the need to move data between a
processing unit and a distant memory location. %they face challenges due to the
overhead of transferring data from remote memory locations to processing units
inside memory for computation. In this paper, we demonstrate that a large
fraction of PIM's latency per memory request is attributed to data transfers
and queuing delays from remote memory accesses. To improve PIM's data locality,
we propose DL-PIM, a novel architecture that dynamically detects the overhead
of data movement, and proactively moves data to a reserved area in the local
memory of the requesting processing unit. DL-PIM uses a distributed
address-indirection hardware lookup table to redirect traffic to the current
data location. We propose DL-PIM implementations on two 3D stacked memories:
HMC and HBM. While some workloads benefit from DL-PIM, others are negatively
impacted by the additional latency due to indirection accesses. Therefore, we
propose an adaptive mechanism that assesses the cost and benefit of indirection
and dynamically enables or disables it to prevent degrading workloads that
suffer from indirection. Overall, DL-PIM reduces the average memory latency per
request by 54% in HMC and 50% in HBM which resulted in performance improvement
of 15% for workloads with substantial data reuse in HMC and 5% in HBM. For all
representative workloads, DL-PIM achieved a 6% speedup in HMC and a 3% speedup
in HBM, showing that DL-PIM enhances data locality and overall system
performance.

Method: FMCache uses programmable switches to cache file-system metadata directly in the switch data plane, targeting file-system-specific path dependencies under resource constraints.

Result: FMCache, implemented on Hadoop HDFS, increased throughput by up to 181.6% compared to vanilla HDFS and added up to 139.6% throughput gains when paired with client-side caching, while maintaining low latency and efficient use of switch resources.

Conclusion: FMCache effectively tackles metadata management challenges, improves performance significantly, and operates resource-efficiently, making it a promising approach for distributed systems.

Abstract: Fast and scalable metadata management across multiple metadata servers is
crucial for distributed file systems to handle numerous files and directories.
Client-side caching of frequently accessed metadata can mitigate server loads,
but incurs significant overhead and complexity in maintaining cache consistency
when the number of clients increases. We propose FMCache, an in-switch
file-system metadata caching framework that leverages programmable switches to
serve file-system metadata requests from multiple clients directly in the
switch data plane. Unlike prior in-switch key-value caching approaches, FMCache
addresses file-system-specific path dependencies under stringent switch
resource constraints. We implement FMCache atop Hadoop HDFS and evaluate it on
a Tofino-switch testbed using real-world file-system metadata workloads.
FMCache achieves up to 181.6% higher throughput than vanilla HDFS and
complements client-side caching with additional throughput gains of up to
139.6%. It also incurs low latencies and limited switch resource usage.

### [73] [SPAD: Specialized Prefill and Decode Hardware for Disaggregated LLM Inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08544)
*Hengrui Zhang,Pratyush Patel,August Ning,David Wentzlaff*

Main category: cs.AR

TL;DR: SPAD proposes specialized chips for LLM inference to handle prefill and decode phases efficiently, reducing hardware costs and power consumption while maintaining or improving performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM inference phases are mismatched with current hardware resources, leading to underutilization and increased costs.

Method: Design specialized Prefill Chips with larger systolic arrays and GDDR memory, and Decode Chips with high memory bandwidth but reduced compute capacity. Simulate performance and costs compared to existing hardware.

Result: Prefill Chips achieve 8% better prefill performance at 52% lower cost, Decode Chips maintain 97% of decode performance with 28% lower TDP, and SPAD reduces hardware costs by 19%-41% and power consumption by 2%-17% in end-to-end simulations.

Conclusion: SPAD's specialized hardware approach reduces costs and power consumption for LLM inference phases while offering flexibility and consistent performance across changing workloads.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have gained popularity in recent years, driving
up the demand for inference. LLM inference is composed of two phases with
distinct characteristics: a compute-bound prefill phase followed by a
memory-bound decode phase. To efficiently serve LLMs, prior work proposes
prefill-decode disaggregation to run each phase on separate hardware. However,
existing hardware poorly matches the different requirements of each phase.
Current datacenter GPUs and TPUs follow a more-is-better design philosophy that
maximizes compute and memory resources, causing memory bandwidth
underutilization in the prefill phase and compute underutilization in the
decode phase. Such underutilization directly translates into increased serving
costs.
  This paper proposes SPAD (Specialized Prefill and Decode hardware), adopting
a less-is-more methodology to design specialized chips tailored to the distinct
characteristics of prefill and decode phases. The proposed Prefill Chips have
larger systolic arrays and use cost-effective GDDR memory, whereas the proposed
Decode Chips retain high memory bandwidth but reduce compute capacity. Compared
to modeled H100s, simulations show that the proposed Prefill Chips deliver 8%
higher prefill performance on average at 52% lower hardware cost, while the
proposed Decode Chips achieve 97% of the decode performance with 28% lower TDP.
  End-to-end simulations on production traces show that SPAD reduces hardware
cost by 19%-41% and TDP by 2%-17% compared to modeled baseline clusters while
offering the same performance. Even when models and workloads change, SPAD can
reallocate either type of chip to run either phase and still achieve 11%-43%
lower hardware costs, demonstrating the longevity of the SPAD design.

### [74] [Inconsistent Affective Reaction: Sentiment of Perception and Opinion in Urban Environments](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07359)
*Jingfei Huang,Han Tu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study analyzes sentiment inconsistencies in Beijing's urban areas using imagery and social media text, revealing shifts and mismatches in perception and opinion sentiment over time.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To better understand the nuanced sentiment reactions in urban environments and address the limitations of current multidimensional sentiment analysis methods in urban studies.

Method: The authors used a dataset of 140,750 street-view images and 984,024 social media posts, applying object detection and natural language processing techniques to classify sentiments. Trends and factors were analyzed using regression, segmentation, and word frequency methods.

Result: The study identified more evenly distributed positive perception sentiments and extreme opinion sentiment changes over time. It highlighted mismatches in sentiment trends tied to environmental factors like dense building presence.

Conclusion: Insights into sentiment inconsistencies can aid urban planners in environmental management and crafting strategies for urban renewal, particularly with changes observed before and after the pandemic.

Abstract: The ascension of social media platforms has transformed our understanding of
urban environments, giving rise to nuanced variations in sentiment reaction
embedded within human perception and opinion, and challenging existing
multidimensional sentiment analysis approaches in urban studies. This study
presents novel methodologies for identifying and elucidating sentiment
inconsistency, constructing a dataset encompassing 140,750 Baidu and Tencent
Street view images to measure perceptions, and 984,024 Weibo social media text
posts to measure opinions. A reaction index is developed, integrating object
detection and natural language processing techniques to classify sentiment in
Beijing Second Ring for 2016 and 2022. Classified sentiment reaction is
analysed and visualized using regression analysis, image segmentation, and word
frequency based on land-use distribution to discern underlying factors. The
perception affective reaction trend map reveals a shift toward more evenly
distributed positive sentiment, while the opinion affective reaction trend map
shows more extreme changes. Our mismatch map indicates significant disparities
between the sentiments of human perception and opinion of urban areas over the
years. Changes in sentiment reactions have significant relationships with
elements such as dense buildings and pedestrian presence. Our inconsistent maps
present perception and opinion sentiments before and after the pandemic and
offer potential explanations and directions for environmental management, in
formulating strategies for urban renewal.

*Mufei Li,Dongqi Fu,Limei Wang,Si Zhang,Hanqing Zeng,Kaan Sancak,Ruizhong Qiu,Haoyu Wang,Xiaoxin He,Xavier Bresson,Yinglong Xia,Chonglin Sun,Pan Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces HaystackCraft, a benchmark designed to test large language models' performance in noisy, real-world contexts influenced by biased retrieval and cascading errors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current benchmarks fail to accurately reflect real-world challenges in long-context reasoning due to overly synthetic test setups.

Method: The authors created HaystackCraft using the English Wikipedia hyperlink network, integrating heterogeneous retrieval strategies and agentic tasks like query refinement and reasoning reflection.

Result: Experiments revealed that dense retrievers introduce challenging distractors, while graph-based reranking improves retrieval's effectiveness. Advanced models still struggle with distractors and premature stopping.

Conclusion: HaystackCraft identifies critical gaps in agentic long-context reasoning and offers a robust testbed for improving large language models' performance under noisy conditions.

Abstract: Modern long-context large language models (LLMs) perform well on synthetic
"needle-in-a-haystack" (NIAH) benchmarks, but such tests overlook how noisy
contexts arise from biased retrieval and agentic workflows. We argue that
haystack engineering is necessary to construct noisy long contexts that
faithfully capture key real-world factors -- distraction from heterogeneous
biased retrievers and cascading errors in agentic workflows -- to test models'
long-context robustness. We instantiate it through HaystackCraft, a new NIAH
benchmark built on the full English Wikipedia hyperlink network with multi-hop
questions. HaystackCraft evaluates how heterogeneous retrieval strategies
(e.g., sparse, dense, hybrid, and graph-based) affect distractor composition,
haystack ordering, and downstream LLM performance. HaystackCraft further
extends NIAH to dynamic, LLM-dependent settings that simulate agentic
operations, where models refine queries, reflect on their past reasonings, and
decide when to stop. Experiments with 15 long-context models show that (1)
while stronger dense retrievers can introduce more challenging distractors,
graph-based reranking simultaneously improves retrieval effectiveness and
mitigates more harmful distractors; (2) in agentic tests, even advanced models
like Gemini 2.5 Pro and GPT-5 suffer cascading failures from self-generated
distractors or struggle to perform early stops. These results highlight
persistent challenges in agentic long-context reasoning and establish
HaystackCraft as a valuable testbed for future progress.

### [76] [Lemma Dilemma: On Lemma Generation Without Domain- or Language-Specific Training Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07434)
*Olia Toporkov,Alan Akbik,Rodrigo Agerri*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper studies how well large language models (LLMs) perform lemmatization in-context compared to traditional supervised methods, finding that LLMs perform competitively or better across 12 languages.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the capability of LLMs in contextual lemmatization, a task with no prior evidence of their effectiveness compared to traditional supervised approaches.

Method: The study compares encoder-only supervised methods (fine-tuned out-of-domain or cross-lingual) with LLMs performing direct in-context lemma generation across 12 languages, considering scenarios where supervised training data is unavailable for the target domain or language.

Result: LLMs achieved state-of-the-art performance in most languages for direct in-context lemma generation without fine-tuning, while supervised encoders remained competitive in out-of-domain scenarios when fine-tuned on gold data.

Conclusion: Current LLMs are highly effective for in-context lemmatization, often surpassing traditional fine-tuned supervised methods, emphasizing their potential in multilingual and low-resource scenarios.

Abstract: Lemmatization is the task of transforming all words in a given text to their
dictionary forms. While large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated their
ability to achieve competitive results across a wide range of NLP tasks, there
is no prior evidence of how effective they are in the contextual lemmatization
task. In this paper, we empirically investigate the capacity of the latest
generation of LLMs to perform in-context lemmatization, comparing it to the
traditional fully supervised approach. In particular, we consider the setting
in which supervised training data is not available for a target domain or
language, comparing (i) encoder-only supervised approaches, fine-tuned
out-of-domain, and (ii) cross-lingual methods, against direct in-context lemma
generation with LLMs. Our experimental investigation across 12 languages of
different morphological complexity finds that, while encoders remain
competitive in out-of-domain settings when fine-tuned on gold data, current
LLMs reach state-of-the-art results for most languages by directly generating
lemmas in-context without prior fine-tuning, provided just with a few examples.

### [77] [LASER: An LLM-based ASR Scoring and Evaluation Rubric](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07437)
*Amruta Parulekar,Preethi Jyothi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper critiques traditional ASR metrics like WER and proposes a new LLM-based scoring rubric, LASER, for more fair assessments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional ASR metrics like WER unfairly penalize linguistic nuances that don't significantly alter semantics, highlighting the need for a better evaluation method.

Method: The study introduces LASER, which uses state-of-the-art LLMs and their in-context learning ability. Hindi LASER scores trained with Gemini 2.5 Pro and fine-tuned LLMs like Llama 3 were also explored for evaluation.

Result: Hindi LASER scores achieved a strong 94% correlation with human annotations, and the method showed effectiveness across other Indian languages. Llama 3 fine-tuned models achieved close to 89% accuracy in predicting penalties.

Conclusion: LASER presents a semantically nuanced method for ASR evaluation, showing high alignment with human judgments and adaptability across languages.

Abstract: Standard ASR evaluation metrics like Word Error Rate (WER) tend to unfairly
penalize morphological and syntactic nuances that do not significantly alter
sentence semantics. We introduce an LLM-based scoring rubric LASER that
leverages state-of-the-art LLMs' in-context learning abilities to learn from
prompts with detailed examples. Hindi LASER scores using Gemini 2.5 Pro
achieved a very high correlation score of 94% with human annotations. Hindi
examples in the prompt were also effective in analyzing errors in other Indian
languages such as Marathi, Kannada and Malayalam. We also demonstrate how a
smaller LLM like Llama 3 can be finetuned on word-pair examples derived from
reference and ASR predictions to predict what kind of penalty should be applied
with close to 89% accuracy.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Develop meaningful ways to assess sign language translations/generations using human skeletal pose evaluations.

Method: Analyzes three metric categories: keypoint distances, embeddings, and back-translation, supported by meta-evaluation and human correlation studies.

Result: Reveals tradeoffs between metrics, offering insights into scenarios for sign-level retrieval and cross-language interpretation.

Conclusion: Provides an open-source pose-evaluation toolkit enabling reproducible system development and evaluation for sign language models.

Abstract: We present a comprehensive study on meaningfully evaluating sign language
utterances in the form of human skeletal poses. The study covers keypoint
distance-based, embedding-based, and back-translation-based metrics. We show
tradeoffs between different metrics in different scenarios through automatic
meta-evaluation of sign-level retrieval and a human correlation study of
text-to-pose translation across different sign languages. Our findings and the
open-source pose-evaluation toolkit provide a practical and reproducible way of
developing and evaluating sign language translation or generation systems.

*Eduardo Ryô Tamaki,Yujin J. Jung,Julia Chatterley,Grant Mitchell,Semir Dzebo,Cristóbal Sandoval,Levente Littvay,Kirk A. Hawkins*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel method using Chain of Thought (CoT) prompting with LLMs to replicate human coding for assessing populism in speeches, showing high accuracy matching expert coders.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Measuring populism in textual content is challenging due to the high cost, time, and scalability issues associated with traditional approaches.

Method: Rubric and anchor-guided Chain of Thought (CoT) prompts were used to train LLMs based on the Global Populism Database, mimicking the process human coders undergo.

Result: The prompted LLMs achieved classification accuracy comparable to expert human coders, successfully addressing context-sensitive aspects of populism.

Conclusion: Domain-specific prompting for LLMs is a promising solution for scalable, accurate textual analysis of ideational content like populism across diverse contexts.

Abstract: Measuring the ideational content of populism remains a challenge. Traditional
strategies based on textual analysis have been critical for building the
field's foundations and providing a valid, objective indicator of populist
framing. Yet these approaches are costly, time consuming, and difficult to
scale across languages, contexts, and large corpora. Here we present the
results from a rubric and anchor guided chain of thought (CoT) prompting
approach that mirrors human coder training. By leveraging the Global Populism
Database (GPD), a comprehensive dataset of global leaders' speeches annotated
for degrees of populism, we replicate the process used to train human coders by
prompting the LLM with an adapted version of the same documentation to guide
the model's reasoning. We then test multiple proprietary and open weight models
by replicating scores in the GPD. Our findings reveal that this domain specific
prompting strategy enables the LLM to achieve classification accuracy on par
with expert human coders, demonstrating its ability to navigate the nuanced,
context sensitive aspects of populism.

*Zheyuan Zhang,Lin Ge,Hongjiang Li,Weicheng Zhu,Chuxu Zhang,Yanfang Ye*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces MAPRO, a framework for optimizing prompts in multi-agent systems, achieving superior performance through a principled approach that leverages Maximum a Posteriori inference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current multi-agent systems face challenges in designing effective prompts due to prompt sensitivity, compounded instability, and issues like expanding search spaces and ambiguous credit assignment.

Method: MAPRO uses a four-stage framework, including formulating prompt optimization as a MAP inference problem, and refinement mechanisms based on topology and execution feedback via belief propagation.

Result: MAPRO outperforms manually crafted baselines and other automated methods across various benchmarks, setting state-of-the-art results.

Conclusion: MAPRO offers both performance improvement and general guidelines, contributing to more reliable and systematic designs for multi-agent systems.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across
diverse tasks, and LLM-based agents further extend these abilities to various
practical workflows. While recent progress shows that multi-agent systems (MAS)
can outperform single agents by coordinating specialized roles, designing
effective MAS remains difficult due to prompt sensitivity and the compounded
instability MAS creates. To cope with the challenge, recent efforts in
automated prompt design have reduced manual effort. However, multi-agent prompt
optimization remains largely unexplored. Challenges like exponentially
expanding search space and ambiguous credit assignment together make systematic
design intractable without principled methods. Therefore, we introduce
M}ulti-Agent PRompt Optimization (MAPRO), a four-stage framework that first
formulates MAS prompt optimization as a Maximum a Posteriori (MAP) inference
problem and solves it using a language-guided variant of max-product belief
propagation algorithm. To address credit assignment and updates the system
iteratively, MAPRO employs a topology-aware refinement mechanism that
integrates execution feedback and downstream blames to selectively update agent
prompts. Through this process, MAPRO progressively converges to a coordinated
set of agent-specific prompt policies. Across benchmarks in various tasks,
MAPRO achieves state-of-the-art performance, consistently surpassing manually
engineered baselines and recent automated alternatives. Beyond performance, our
MAP-based formulation also delivers general guidelines for building more
reliable and principled multi-agent systems in the future

### [81] [AsyncSpade: Efficient Test-Time Scaling with Asynchronous Sparse Decoding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07486)
*Shuqing Luo,Yilin Guan,Pingzhi Li,Hanrui Wang,Tianlong Chen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes AsyncSpade, a novel framework for efficient Test-time scaling (TTS) in large language models (LLMs), addressing memory and latency bottlenecks while maintaining accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Test-time scaling (TTS) enhances reasoning of large language models (LLMs) using long chain-of-thoughts (CoT), but current methods face memory-intensive challenges and inefficiencies due to growing KV caches and sequential bottlenecks.

Method: The authors introduce AsyncSpade, featuring (1) a light-weight temporal-regressive module for predicting next-token query states, and (2) an asynchronous architecture that decouples KV cache filtration from the decoding loop, enabling overlap of KV-selection with inference via asynchronism.

Result: AsyncSpade achieves over 20% reduction in time-per-output-token (TPOT) compared to state-of-the-art methods and a 50% TPOT reduction against full attention methods while preserving or improving accuracy on benchmarks such as AIME-24/25, GPQA-Diamond, and MATH-500.

Conclusion: AsyncSpade demonstrates its ability to improve LLM serving efficiency by reducing processing time and overcoming sequential dependencies without degrading model performance, providing a promising approach for TTS tasks under various constraints.

Abstract: Test-time scaling (TTS) boosts LLM reasoning via long chain-of-thought (CoT),
but the linear KV-cache growth amplifies the memory-bound bottleneck of LLM
decoding. Query-aware page-level sparse decoding can achieve state-of-the-art
performance under constrained FLOPs budgets, but is limited by both
sequential-dependent page filtering and coarse-grained token selection,
hampering serving efficiency and model performance on TTS tasks under high
concurrency and long CoT scenarios (consuming even higher runtime than the
forward pipeline itself). In this paper, we first find that the current-step
query state can be accurately approximated in a unified manner from a short
window of recent queries, enabling training-free query-aware sparsity without
waiting in the decoding loop. We propose AsyncSpade, an asynchronous framework
for efficient TTS built on two core components: (1) a novel light-weight
temporal-regressive module that predicts the next-token query state; (2) an
asynchronous and disaggregated framework that decouples the KV cache filtering
from the auto-regressive decoding loop, overlapping the token-level KV
selection with the forward inference computation through asynchronism. To our
knowledge, AsyncSpade is the first to eliminate the sequential dependence
without sacrificing model performance. We validate the effectiveness of
AsyncSpade on common LLM serving setups with an A100 node, where AsyncSpade
fully overlaps KV-cache operations with the inference pipeline, achieving
theoretical optimal time-per-output-token (TPOT). Specifically, AsyncSpade
delivers over 20% reduction on TPOT compared to SoTA baseline (i.e. Quest) and
at least 50% TPOT reduction compared to full attention on Qwen3-8B and
Qwen3-32B models, while matching or surpassing their accuracy on various TTS
benchmarks (AIME-24/25, GPQA-Diamond, MATH-500).

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes a framework to study team dynamics in LLM-powered Multi-Agent Systems through structure, diversity, and interaction analysis while evaluating across reasoning tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore team dynamics within LLM-powered Multi-Agent Systems, taking inspiration from human team science.

Method: Implemented a framework that examines structure, diversity, and interaction dynamics, and evaluated using four reasoning tasks.

Result: Flat teams outperform hierarchical ones; diversity has mixed impacts; agents show overconfidence but appreciate collaboration despite coordination challenges.

Conclusion: Team dynamics in MAS can benefit from refined structures and improved conversational coordination to enhance collaboration and task performance.

Abstract: Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) with Large Language Model (LLM)-powered agents are
gaining attention, yet fewer studies explore their team dynamics. Inspired by
human team science, we propose a multi-agent framework to examine core aspects
of team science: structure, diversity, and interaction dynamics. We evaluate
team performance across four tasks: CommonsenseQA, StrategyQA, Social IQa, and
Latent Implicit Hate, spanning commonsense and social reasoning. Our results
show that flat teams tend to perform better than hierarchical ones, while
diversity has a nuanced impact. Interviews suggest agents are overconfident
about their team performance, yet post-task reflections reveal both
appreciation for collaboration and challenges in integration, including limited
conversational coordination.

*Yi-Jen Shih,Desh Raj,Chunyang Wu,Wei Zhou,SK Bong,Yashesh Gaur,Jay Mahadeokar,Ozlem Kalinli,Mike Seltzer*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper focuses on improving reasoning capabilities and latency in speech large language models (speech LLMs) using chain-of-thought (CoT) fine-tuning and novel methods inspired by human listening behaviors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Speech LLMs struggle with complex reasoning tasks, limiting their accuracy and efficiency in spoken interactions.

Method: The study uses CoT fine-tuning to improve reasoning and introduces the "question completeness" metric to optimize latency while reasoning. It employs Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to enhance the accuracy-latency trade-off.

Result: CoT fine-tuning improves accuracy by 2.4x on reasoning tasks. The entropy-based "question completeness" metric provides a 4% accuracy gain under equal latency conditions. DPO results in a 70% reduction in latency without compromising accuracy.

Conclusion: Integrating CoT fine-tuning and innovative latency control methods significantly improves reasoning and interaction performance of speech LLMs, paving the way for more efficient and accurate spoken AI systems.

Abstract: Recent advances in speech large language models (speech LLMs) have enabled
seamless spoken interactions, but these systems still struggle with complex
reasoning tasks. Previously, chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting or fine-tuning
has been to shown to significantly improve the reasoning abilities of
text-based LLMs. In this work, we investigate the effect of CoT fine-tuning for
multi-stream speech LLMs, demonstrating that reasoning in text space improves
the accuracy of speech LLMs by 2.4x, on average, over a suite of spoken
reasoning tasks. Beyond accuracy, the latency of the spoken response is a
crucial factor for interacting with voice-based agents. Inspired by the human
behavior of "thinking while listening," we propose methods to reduce the
additional latency from reasoning by allowing the model to start reasoning
before the user query has ended. To achieve this, we introduce an entropy-based
metric, "question completeness," which acts as an indicator to guide the model
on the optimal time to start reasoning. This method provides greater control
over the accuracy-latency trade-off compared with heuristic-based approaches
and, under equivalent latency conditions, yields a 4% accuracy gain on
ARC-Easy. Finally, we use Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) on preference
data created using rejection sampling to push the accuracy-latency pareto
frontier further, resulting in a 70% reduction in latency without loss in
accuracy.

*Soyeong Jeong,Taehee Jung,Sung Ju Hwang,Joo-Kyung Kim,Dongyeop Kang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Recent Long-Context Language Models (LCLMs) struggle to connect evidence effectively despite processing extensive contexts. The proposed ToTAL framework introduces thought templates to structure reasoning and achieve better multi-hop inference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the challenge of integrating and connecting evidence in large-scale contexts for knowledge-intensive multi-hop reasoning using LCLMs.

Method: The authors introduce thought templates, inspired by previous problem-solving traces, which structure evidence and guide inference. These templates are iteratively refined using natural-language feedback for optimization.

Result: The methodology consistently improves performance across benchmarks and LCLM families, showing gains in both retrieval-based and retrieval-free scenarios. Optimized templates are effectively distilled into smaller, open-source models.

Conclusion: Thought Template Augmented LCLMs enhance reasoning capabilities by structuring evidence synthesis. The approach proves transparent and broadly applicable, with potential for knowledge distillation into smaller models.

Abstract: Recent Long-Context Language Models (LCLMs) can process hundreds of thousands
of tokens in a single prompt, enabling new opportunities for
knowledge-intensive multi-hop reasoning by integrating large sets of retrieved
documents or, in some cases, directly all necessary information. However,
simply feeding more documents into the context window fails to capture how
evidence should be connected. We address this gap with thought templates, which
recast reasoning as reusable thought caches, derived from prior problem solving
traces, structuring how evidence is combined and guiding multi-hop inference
with factual documents. To keep these templates effective, we propose an update
strategy that iteratively refines templates derived from training data through
natural-language feedback. Across diverse benchmarks and LCLM families, our
approach delivers consistent gains over strong baselines in both
retrieval-based and retrieval-free settings. Furthermore, we show that
optimized templates can be distilled into smaller open-source models,
demonstrating its broad applicability and transparent reasoning reuse. We refer
to our framework as Thought Template Augmented LCLMs (ToTAL).

### [85] [ParsTranslit: Truly Versatile Tajik-Farsi Transliteration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07520)
*Rayyan Merchant,Kevin Tang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces a state-of-the-art model for transliteration between Perso-Arabic and Tajik-Cyrillic scripts, accompanied by new datasets and benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The script differences between the Persian dialects spoken in Iran, Afghanistan, and Tajikistan create barriers in communication. Previous transliteration solutions were limited to certain domains, hindering real-world usability.

Method: The authors developed a sequence-to-sequence model for Tajik-Farsi transliteration, training it on all available datasets and introducing two new datasets to enhance domain coverage.

Result: Their model achieves chrF++ scores of 87.91 and 92.28, and Normalized CER scores of 0.05 and 0.04 for Farsi-to-Tajik and Tajik-to-Farsi transliteration, respectively.

Conclusion: The model sets new benchmarks for Tajik-Farsi transliteration and provides a clearer understanding of the transliteration challenge across domains. All related resources are made publicly available.

Abstract: As a digraphic language, the Persian language utilizes two written standards:
Perso-Arabic in Afghanistan and Iran, and Tajik-Cyrillic in Tajikistan. Despite
the significant similarity between the dialects of each country, script
differences prevent simple one-to-one mapping, hindering written communication
and interaction between Tajikistan and its Persian-speaking ``siblings''. To
overcome this, previously-published efforts have investigated machine
transliteration models to convert between the two scripts. Unfortunately, most
efforts did not use datasets other than those they created, limiting these
models to certain domains of text such as archaic poetry or word lists. A truly
usable transliteration system must be capable of handling varied domains,
meaning that suck models lack the versatility required for real-world usage.
The contrast in domain between data also obscures the task's true difficulty.
We present a new state-of-the-art sequence-to-sequence model for Tajik-Farsi
transliteration trained across all available datasets, and present two datasets
of our own. Our results across domains provide clearer understanding of the
task, and set comprehensive comparable leading benchmarks. Overall, our model
achieves chrF++ and Normalized CER scores of 87.91 and 0.05 from Farsi to Tajik
and 92.28 and 0.04 from Tajik to Farsi. Our model, data, and code are available

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper addresses limitations in speculative decoding for large language models, particularly with long contexts, by introducing a model called OWL and a new benchmark, LongSpecBench.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve speculative decoding methods for practical applications of large language models (LLMs) with long contexts, as existing methods degrade in performance during such scenarios.

Method: The authors create a new benchmark (LongSpecBench) and develop the OWL model with three key innovations: an LSTM-based drafter using last-token conditioning, a special token [SPEC] to enrich verifier representation, and a hybrid tree/non-tree decoding algorithm.

Result: OWL significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods like EAGLE3, achieving about 5x higher acceptance length under long-context inputs.

Conclusion: The work advances speculative decoding for LLMs in real-world long-context scenarios, offering code and datasets to foster further research in this domain.

Abstract: Speculative decoding promises faster inference for large language models
(LLMs), yet existing methods fail to generalize to real-world settings.
Benchmarks typically assume short contexts (e.g., 2K tokens), whereas practical
workloads involve long contexts. We find current approaches degrade severely
with long contexts; for instance, EAGLE3 even slows down the generation speed
by 0.81x. We address these limitations by releasing a new long-context
benchmark (LongSpecBench) and introducing a novel model (OWL). OWL achieves
about 5x higher acceptance length than EAGLE3 on long-context inputs through
three innovations: (1) an LSTM-based drafter conditioned only on the last-token
state, making it generalize to various lengths, (2) a special token [SPEC] in
the verifier that produces richer representation for drafter, and (3) a hybrid
algorithm combining both tree and non-tree decoding methods. We release all
code and datasets to advance future research.

### [87] [Deploying Tiny LVLM Judges for Real-World Evaluation of Chart Models: Lessons Learned and Best Practices](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07545)
*Md Tahmid Rahman Laskar,Mohammed Saidul Islam,Ridwan Mahbub,Mizanur Rahman,Amran Bhuiyan,Israt Jahan,Mir Tafseer Nayeem,Shafiq Joty,Enamul Hoque,Jimmy Huang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper addresses the underperformance of small vision-language models (<=2B parameters) in chart comprehension tasks and proposes multi-criteria prompting and domain-adaptive transfer learning to improve their evaluation capacity, leading to a more economical yet effective system, ChartJudge.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Small LVLMs (≤2B parameters) perform poorly in chart comprehension tasks, limiting their application in scenarios requiring low computational resources.

Method: The study introduces two methods: (i) multi-criteria prompting to integrate various evaluation criteria into a single query and (ii) domain-adaptive transfer learning to fine-tune a small LVLM using synthetic judgments in chart datasets.

Result: Experiments showed that while multi-criteria prompting revealed robustness issues in larger LVLMs (e.g., 7B models), the tiny LVLM, ChartJudge, successfully utilized transfer learning to become more specialized and adaptable, achieving improved performance on chart reasoning tasks.

Conclusion: ChartJudge demonstrates that low-cost, tiny LVLMs can be fine-tuned effectively to deliver scalable and competent performance for specialized tasks, balancing trade-offs between model size, design, and transferability.

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) with only 7B parameters have shown
promise as automated judges in chart comprehension tasks. However, tiny models
(<=2B parameters) still perform poorly as judges, limiting their real-world use
in resource-constrained settings. To address this, we propose two approaches to
ensure cost-efficient evaluation: (i) multi-criteria prompting, which combines
separate evaluation criteria into a single query, and (ii) domain-adaptive
transfer learning, in which we fine-tune a 2B-parameter LVLM on synthetic
judgments in a chart dataset to create the ChartJudge. Experiments show that
multi-criteria prompting exposes robustness gaps, which led to a huge drop in
performance for 7B models, including specialized LVLM judges like LLaVA-Critic.
In addition, we find that our tiny LVLM (ChartJudge) can effectively transfer
knowledge from one dataset to another to make it a more specialized model. Our
fine-grained analysis across chart types and query complexities offers
actionable insights into trade-offs between model size, prompt design, and
transferability, enabling scalable, low-cost evaluation for chart reasoning
tasks. Our code and the data will be made publicly available.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes a multi-task pre-finetuning framework using task-specific LoRA modules to improve the adaptability of lightweight BERT-like models for mobile NLP applications, achieving better performance for named entity recognition (NER) and text classification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance the adaptability of NLP models for mobile platforms while addressing diverse applications efficiently in terms of memory and computation.

Method: The authors used pre-finetuning strategies and a multi-task pre-finetuning framework leveraging task-primary LoRA modules, enabling shared encoder backbones with modular adapters.

Result: Experiments on 21 downstream tasks showed performance improvements: +0.8% for NER and +8.8% for text classification.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively balances performance and deployment constraints, making it suitable for versatile NLP tasks on mobile devices.

Abstract: Deploying natural language processing (NLP) models on mobile platforms
requires models that can adapt across diverse applications while remaining
efficient in memory and computation. We investigate pre-finetuning strategies
to enhance the adaptability of lightweight BERT-like encoders for two
fundamental NLP task families: named entity recognition (NER) and text
classification. While pre-finetuning improves downstream performance for each
task family individually, we find that na\"ive multi-task pre-finetuning
introduces conflicting optimization signals that degrade overall performance.
To address this, we propose a simple yet effective multi-task pre-finetuning
framework based on task-primary LoRA modules, which enables a single shared
encoder backbone with modular adapters. Our approach achieves performance
comparable to individual pre-finetuning while meeting practical deployment
constraint. Experiments on 21 downstream tasks show average improvements of
+0.8% for NER and +8.8% for text classification, demonstrating the
effectiveness of our method for versatile mobile NLP applications.

*Mkululi Sikosana,Sean Maudsley-Barton,Oluwaseun Ajao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This study analyses pandemic-related online discourse, focusing on linguistic features that differentiate misinformation from factual communication, finding that misinformation uses complex language and emotional cues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address the issue of distinguishing health misinformation from factual discourse by examining linguistic patterns, ultimately contributing to improved public health messaging and misinformation detection.

Method: The researchers analyzed three corpora: COVID-19 false narratives, general COVID-19 content, and Monkeypox-related posts, comparing linguistic features such as readability, rhetorical markers, and the use of persuasive language.

Result: COVID-19 misinformation is less readable, heavily uses fear-related and persuasive terms, and contrasts in emotive markers like exclamation marks, highlighting a deliberate use of complex and emotional language to enhance credibility.

Conclusion: The findings underline the utility of linguistic indicators for misinformation detection and call for refinements in analytical methods and broader research approaches to create more effective detection and communication strategies.

Abstract: This study conducts a computational linguistic analysis of pandemic-related
online discourse to examine how language distinguishes health misinformation
from factual communication. Drawing on three corpora: COVID-19 false narratives
(n = 7588), general COVID-19 content (n = 10700), and Monkeypox-related posts
(n = 5787), we identify significant differences in readability, rhetorical
markers, and persuasive language use. COVID-19 misinformation exhibited
markedly lower readability scores and contained over twice the frequency of
fear-related or persuasive terms compared to the other datasets. It also showed
minimal use of exclamation marks, contrasting with the more emotive style of
Monkeypox content. These patterns suggest that misinformation employs a
deliberately complex rhetorical style embedded with emotional cues, a
combination that may enhance its perceived credibility. Our findings contribute
to the growing body of work on digital health misinformation by highlighting
linguistic indicators that may aid detection efforts. They also inform public
health messaging strategies and theoretical models of crisis communication in
networked media environments. At the same time, the study acknowledges
limitations, including reliance on traditional readability indices, use of a
deliberately narrow persuasive lexicon, and reliance on static aggregate
analysis. Future research should therefore incorporate longitudinal designs,
broader emotion lexicons, and platform-sensitive approaches to strengthen
robustness.

### [90] [IASC: Interactive Agentic System for ConLangs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07591)
*Chihiro Taguchi,Richard Sproat*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces a modular system utilizing LLMs for creating constructed languages, involving phonological models, morphosyntactic features, lexicon generation, orthographic development, and grammar handbook creation. It explores LLMs' understanding of linguistic concepts and their limitations, especially with rare patterns.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to not only make constructed language development accessible and enjoyable but to also investigate what LLMs understand about language and linguistic abstractions beyond specific languages.

Method: The method involves stepwise refinement of phonological models, corpus translation into syntactic markup, lexicon generation, orthography provision, and grammar handbook creation using LLMs.

Result: The results reveal varying capabilities among LLMs, particularly in handling common versus rare linguistic patterns. Additionally, applying the system for translating high-resource languages into low-resource languages showed mixed success, leaving room for improvement.

Conclusion: While the system is functional and shows promise for constructing languages and probing LLM linguistic knowledge, it has limitations, especially with uncommon linguistic structures and translation tasks for low-resource languages.

Abstract: We present a system that uses LLMs as a tool in the development of
Constructed Languages. The system is modular in that one first creates a target
phonology for the language using an agentic approach that refines its output at
each step with commentary feedback on its previous attempt. Next, a set of
sentences is 'translated' from their English original into a morphosyntactic
markup that reflects the word order and morphosyntactic feature specifications
of the desired target language, with affixes represented as morphosyntactic
feature bundles. From this translated corpus, a lexicon is constructed using
the phonological model and the set of morphemes (stems and affixes) extracted
from the 'translated' sentences. The system is then instructed to provide an
orthography for the language, using an existing script such as Latin or
Cyrillic. Finally, the system writes a brief grammatical handbook of the
language. The system can also translate further sentences into the target
language.
  Our goal is twofold. First, we hope that these tools will be fun to use for
creating artificially constructed languages. Second, we are interested in
exploring what LLMs 'know' about language-not what they know about any
particular language or linguistic phenomenon, but how much they know about and
understand language and linguistic concepts. As we shall see, there is a fairly
wide gulf in capabilities both among different LLMs and among different
linguistic specifications, with it being notably easier for systems to deal
with more common patterns than rarer ones. An additional avenue that we explore
is the application of our approach to translating from high-resource into
low-resource languages. While the results so far are mostly negative, we
provide some evidence that an improved version of the present system could
afford some real gains in such tasks.

*Isabel Papadimitriou,Jacob Prince*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper studies how the geometry of input embeddings in large language models evolves during training, highlighting the role of semantics, syntax, and word frequency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how the structure of input embeddings in language models changes during training and its connection to linguistic features.

Method: The authors use representational similarity analysis and experiments to assess correlations between embedding geometry and semantic, syntactic, and frequency-based metrics over training. Two open-source models (Pythia 12B and OLMo 7B) were analyzed.

Result: The input embedding geometry rapidly aligns with semantic and syntactic features during training, with high-frequency and function words stabilizing earlier than lexical and low-frequency words.

Conclusion: The research provides insight into how input embeddings organize around linguistic features over training, emphasizing the distinct roles of word frequency and function in the process.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) work by manipulating the geometry of input
embedding vectors over multiple layers. Here, we ask: how are the input
vocabulary representations of language models structured, and how and when does
this structure evolve over training? To answer this question, we use
representational similarity analysis, running a suite of experiments that
correlate the geometric structure of the input embeddings and output embeddings
of two open-source models (Pythia 12B and OLMo 7B) with semantic, syntactic,
and frequency-based metrics over the course of training. Our key findings are
as follows: 1) During training, the vocabulary embedding geometry quickly
converges to high correlations with a suite of semantic and syntactic features;
2) Embeddings of high-frequency and function words (e.g., "the," "of") converge
to their final vectors faster than lexical and low-frequency words, which
retain some alignment with the bias in their random initializations. These
findings help map the dynamic trajectory by which input embeddings organize
around linguistic structure, revealing distinct roles for word frequency and
function. Our findings motivate a deeper study of how the evolution of
vocabulary geometry may facilitate specific capability gains during model
training.

### [92] [Toward Reliable Clinical Coding with Language Models: Verification and Lightweight Adaptation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07629)
*Zhangdie Yuan,Han-Chin Shing,Mitch Strong,Chaitanya Shivade*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Accurate clinical coding is critical for healthcare, but off-the-shelf large language models (LLMs) often fail due to hierarchical misalignments. This paper proposes lightweight techniques and introduces a clinical code verification task to address errors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to improve the accuracy of clinical coding in healthcare, as existing LLMs struggle with hierarchical errors that are overlooked by traditional exact match metrics.

Method: The authors use lightweight interventions such as prompt engineering and small-scale fine-tuning, introduce a standalone clinical code verification task, and release an outpatient benchmark with expert annotations.

Result: Lightweight interventions successfully improved LLM accuracy without heavy computational methods, and verification was shown to be effective in addressing near-miss hierarchical errors.

Conclusion: Clinical code verification enhances reliability in LLM-based medical coding, and the newly introduced benchmark provides a valuable tool for future research.

Abstract: Accurate clinical coding is essential for healthcare documentation, billing,
and decision-making. While prior work shows that off-the-shelf LLMs struggle
with this task, evaluations based on exact match metrics often overlook errors
where predicted codes are hierarchically close but incorrect. Our analysis
reveals that such hierarchical misalignments account for a substantial portion
of LLM failures. We show that lightweight interventions, including prompt
engineering and small-scale fine-tuning, can improve accuracy without the
computational overhead of search-based methods. To address hierarchically
near-miss errors, we introduce clinical code verification as both a standalone
task and a pipeline component. To mitigate the limitations in existing
datasets, such as incomplete evidence and inpatient bias in MIMIC, we release
an expert double-annotated benchmark of outpatient clinical notes with ICD-10
codes. Our results highlight verification as an effective and reliable step
toward improving LLM-based medical coding.

*Đorđe Klisura,Joseph Khoury,Ashish Kundu,Ram Krishnan,Anthony Rios*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper examines role-conditioned refusals in large language models (LLMs), evaluating their ability to adhere to role-based access control policies through various techniques like prompting, a generator-verifier pipeline, and fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To ensure that large language models can respect access control policies by responding to queries only when authorized and refusing effectively when not.

Method: The authors created a novel dataset by extending the Spider and BIRD text-to-SQL datasets with realistic PostgreSQL role-based policies at table and column levels. They evaluated three designs: zero/few-shot prompting, a generator-verifier pipeline, and fine-tuned models (LoRA).

Result: Explicit verification via the generator-verifier pipeline improved refusal precision and reduced false permits, while fine-tuning achieved a better balance between safety and execution accuracy. Reliabilities decreased as policy complexity increased.

Conclusion: The study demonstrated that while explicit verification improves certain metrics, fine-tuned models offer a better trade-off between safety and utility. The researchers released their RBAC-augmented datasets and code for further exploration.

Abstract: Access control is a cornerstone of secure computing, yet large language
models often blur role boundaries by producing unrestricted responses. We study
role-conditioned refusals, focusing on the LLM's ability to adhere to access
control policies by answering when authorized and refusing when not. To
evaluate this behavior, we created a novel dataset that extends the Spider and
BIRD text-to-SQL datasets, both of which have been modified with realistic
PostgreSQL role-based policies at the table and column levels. We compare three
designs: (i) zero or few-shot prompting, (ii) a two-step generator-verifier
pipeline that checks SQL against policy, and (iii) LoRA fine-tuned models that
learn permission awareness directly. Across multiple model families, explicit
verification (the two-step framework) improves refusal precision and lowers
false permits. At the same time, fine-tuning achieves a stronger balance
between safety and utility (i.e., when considering execution accuracy). Longer
and more complex policies consistently reduce the reliability of all systems.
We release RBAC-augmented datasets and code.

TL;DR: Ryt AI introduces an LLM-native conversational framework named Ryt Bank to allow customers to conduct banking transactions using natural language.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To revolutionize banking interfaces by providing a natural language-driven method that surpasses advisory or support roles typically seen in conversational AI systems.

Method: The system utilizes ILMU, an internal closed-source LLM, with specialized LoRA adapters integrated into four task-specific agents. Hosted within bank infrastructure, it ensures secure and compliant operations.

Result: The framework supports regulator-approved conversational AI interfaces for core financial activities, replacing traditional multi-screen workflows.

Conclusion: Ryt AI demonstrates the potential of regulator-compliant conversational frameworks in transforming banking interfaces and operations.

Abstract: This paper presents Ryt AI, an LLM-native agentic framework that powers Ryt
Bank to enable customers to execute core financial transactions through natural
language conversation. This represents the first global regulator-approved
deployment worldwide where conversational AI functions as the primary banking
interface, in contrast to prior assistants that have been limited to advisory
or support roles. Built entirely in-house, Ryt AI is powered by ILMU, a
closed-source LLM developed internally, and replaces rigid multi-screen
workflows with a single dialogue orchestrated by four LLM-powered agents
(Guardrails, Intent, Payment, and FAQ). Each agent attaches a task-specific
LoRA adapter to ILMU, which is hosted within the bank's infrastructure to
ensure consistent behavior with minimal overhead. Deterministic guardrails,
human-in-the-loop confirmation, and a stateless audit architecture provide
defense-in-depth for security and compliance. The result is Banking Done Right:
demonstrating that regulator-approved natural-language interfaces can reliably
support core financial operations under strict governance.

### [95] [OBCache: Optimal Brain KV Cache Pruning for Efficient Long-Context LLM Inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07651)
*Yuzhe Gu,Xiyu Liang,Jiaojiao Zhao,Enmao Diao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Large language models face memory overhead due to caching key-value states. The proposed OBCache method optimizes cache eviction by applying structured pruning, improving context accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The work aims to address the memory overhead in large language models caused by caching key-value states as context sizes increase.

Method: OBCache uses a principled approach based on Optimal Brain Damage theory to measure token saliency through perturbation in attention outputs, providing closed-form scores for keys, values, and combined pairs.

Result: Experiments on LLaMA and Qwen models show improved long-context accuracy when OBCache's output-aware scores replace heuristic scores in existing methods.

Conclusion: OBCache enhances cache eviction strategies by incorporating output-aware signals, benefiting models with extended context windows.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) with extended context windows enable powerful
downstream applications but impose significant memory overhead, as caching all
key-value (KV) states scales linearly with sequence length and batch size.
Existing cache eviction methods address this by exploiting attention sparsity,
yet they typically rank tokens heuristically using accumulated attention
weights without considering their true impact on attention outputs. We propose
Optimal Brain Cache (OBCache), a principled framework that formulates cache
eviction as a layer-wise structured pruning problem. Building upon the Optimal
Brain Damage (OBD) theory, OBCache quantifies token saliency by measuring the
perturbation in attention outputs induced by pruning tokens, with closed-form
scores derived for isolated keys, isolated values, and joint key-value pairs.
Our scores account not only for attention weights but also for information from
value states and attention outputs, thereby enhancing existing eviction
strategies with output-aware signals. Experiments on LLaMA and Qwen models
demonstrate that replacing the heuristic scores in existing works, which
estimate token saliency across different query positions, with OBCache's
output-aware scores consistently improves long-context accuracy.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces a method for reducing the vocabulary of auto-regressive language models while maintaining accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Language models vary in tokenization and vocabulary, hindering efficient cooperation like model ensemble.

Method: Propose a theoretical framework for lossless vocabulary reduction, enabling models to convert to smaller vocabularies.

Result: Language models can interact efficiently using their maximal common vocabulary without compromising performance.

Conclusion: Lossless vocabulary reduction enhances the interoperability and efficiency of language models with varying tokenization schemes.

Abstract: Tokenization -- the process of decomposing a given text into a sequence of
subwords called tokens -- is one of the key components in the development of
language models. Particularly, auto-regressive language models generate texts
token by token, i.e., by predicting the next-token distribution given the
previous ones, and thus tokenization directly affects their efficiency in text
generation. Since each language model has their own vocabulary as a set of
possible tokens, they struggle to cooperate with each other at the level of
next-token distributions such as model ensemble. In this paper, we establish a
theoretical framework of lossless vocabulary reduction, which efficiently
converts a given auto-regressive language model into the one with an
arbitrarily small vocabulary without any loss in accuracy. As an application,
we demonstrate that language models with different tokenization can cooperate
with each other efficiently through their maximal common vocabulary.

TL;DR: The paper investigates bias metrics for language models, comparing token probability (TP) metrics with natural language inference (NLI), finding differences in their behavior and performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Explore alternatives to token probability metrics for measuring social bias in language models and address criticisms about their disconnect from real-world applications.

Method: Test and compare token probability metrics and natural language inference methods, focusing on how they evaluate social bias in language models and assessing correlations and sensitivities.

Result: NLI metrics detect "underdebiased" cases better but are more sensitive to language and wording nuances, whereas TP metrics are less brittle. Both approaches behave substantially differently and lack correlation.

Conclusion: No single bias metric is universally better; the paper recommends combining TP, NLI, and downstream evaluations for more thorough bias assessments.

Abstract: Measurement of social bias in language models is typically by token
probability (TP) metrics, which are broadly applicable but have been criticized
for their distance from real-world langugage model use cases and harms. In this
work, we test natural language inference (NLI) as a more realistic alternative
bias metric. We show that, curiously, NLI and TP bias evaluation behave
substantially differently, with very low correlation among different NLI
metrics and between NLI and TP metrics. We find that NLI metrics are more
likely to detect "underdebiased" cases. However, NLI metrics seem to be more
brittle and sensitive to wording of counterstereotypical sentences than TP
approaches. We conclude that neither token probability nor natural language
inference is a "better" bias metric in all cases, and we recommend a
combination of TP, NLI, and downstream bias evaluations to ensure comprehensive
evaluation of language models.

TL;DR: This study stress-tests large language model (LLM) specifications, identifying over 70,000 cases of principle contradictions and interpretive ambiguities among 12 leading LLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to reveal and address the inherent challenges in AI constitutions of LLMs, such as conflicting principles and inadequate handling of nuanced scenarios.

Method: A systematic framework generates scenarios that create tradeoffs between ethical principles, and behavioral responses of 12 frontier LLMs are analyzed for conflicts and ambiguities.

Result: Over 70,000 cases of principle conflict and interpretive issues were identified, showing significant behavioral divergence that highlights deficiencies in LLM specifications.

Conclusion: The findings emphasize the need for better model specifications, revealing current issues like contradictions, misalignments, and highlighting value prioritization differences among models.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly trained from AI constitutions
and model specifications that establish behavioral guidelines and ethical
principles. However, these specifications face critical challenges, including
internal conflicts between principles and insufficient coverage of nuanced
scenarios. We present a systematic methodology for stress-testing model
character specifications, automatically identifying numerous cases of principle
contradictions and interpretive ambiguities in current model specs.
  We stress test current model specs by generating scenarios that force
explicit tradeoffs between competing value-based principles. Using a
comprehensive taxonomy we generate diverse value tradeoff scenarios where
models must choose between pairs of legitimate principles that cannot be
simultaneously satisfied. We evaluate responses from twelve frontier LLMs
across major providers (Anthropic, OpenAI, Google, xAI) and measure behavioral
disagreement through value classification scores. Among these scenarios, we
identify over 70,000 cases exhibiting significant behavioral divergence.
Empirically, we show this high divergence in model behavior strongly predicts
underlying problems in model specifications. Through qualitative analysis, we
provide numerous example issues in current model specs such as direct
contradiction and interpretive ambiguities of several principles. Additionally,
our generated dataset also reveals both clear misalignment cases and
false-positive refusals across all of the frontier models we study. Lastly, we
also provide value prioritization patterns and differences of these models.

TL;DR: This paper reviews the use of large language models (LLMs) in creating "virtual cells," categorizes methods into Oracles and Agents, and examines three key tasks. It also highlights challenges in scaling, generalization, and interpretation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to explore how LLMs can transform cellular biology and enable the development of virtual cells that model cellular states and behaviors computationally.

Method: The authors propose a unified taxonomy to classify existing methods into two paradigms: LLMs as Oracles for cellular modeling and LLMs as Agents for scientific task coordination. They also analyze key cellular tasks and associated models, datasets, and benchmarks.

Result: The paper identifies three fundamental tasks (cellular representation, perturbation prediction, and gene regulation inference) and organizes the current methods and tools addressing these tasks.

Conclusion: LLMs hold immense potential for advancing cellular biology, but challenges like scalability, generalizability, and interpretability must be addressed to fully realize this potential.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are transforming cellular biology by enabling
the development of "virtual cells"--computational systems that represent,
predict, and reason about cellular states and behaviors. This work provides a
comprehensive review of LLMs for virtual cell modeling. We propose a unified
taxonomy that organizes existing methods into two paradigms: LLMs as Oracles,
for direct cellular modeling, and LLMs as Agents, for orchestrating complex
scientific tasks. We identify three core tasks--cellular representation,
perturbation prediction, and gene regulation inference--and review their
associated models, datasets, evaluation benchmarks, as well as the critical
challenges in scalability, generalizability, and interpretability.

*Chengshuai Zhao,Shu Wan,Paras Sheth,Karan Patwa,K. Selçuk Candan,Huan Liu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Researchers introduced CADET, a framework leveraging causal representation learning to improve hate speech detection by addressing contextual and stylistic variations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Hate speech detection models struggle with implicit hate conveyed through sarcasm, irony, stereotypes, or coded language, and fail to generalize across platforms due to varying target groups and styles.

Method: CADET relies on a causal graph modeling contextual environment, creator motivation, target, and style, and uses causal representation learning to separate hate intent from linguistic cues, enabling counterfactual reasoning within the latent space.

Result: CADET achieved superior performance in experiments, demonstrating its effectiveness in detecting diverse forms of hate speech while controlling confounding factors.

Conclusion: The framework highlights the value of causal priors in improving the robustness and generalizability of hate speech detection across various contexts and stylistic variations.

Abstract: The proliferation of online hate speech poses a significant threat to the
harmony of the web. While explicit hate is easily recognized through overt
slurs, implicit hate speech is often conveyed through sarcasm, irony,
stereotypes, or coded language -- making it harder to detect. Existing hate
speech detection models, which predominantly rely on surface-level linguistic
cues, fail to generalize effectively across diverse stylistic variations.
Moreover, hate speech spread on different platforms often targets distinct
groups and adopts unique styles, potentially inducing spurious correlations
between them and labels, further challenging current detection approaches.
Motivated by these observations, we hypothesize that the generation of hate
speech can be modeled as a causal graph involving key factors: contextual
environment, creator motivation, target, and style. Guided by this graph, we
propose CADET, a causal representation learning framework that disentangles
hate speech into interpretable latent factors and then controls confounders,
thereby isolating genuine hate intent from superficial linguistic cues.
Furthermore, CADET allows counterfactual reasoning by intervening on style
within the latent space, naturally guiding the model to robustly identify hate
speech in varying forms. CADET demonstrates superior performance in
comprehensive experiments, highlighting the potential of causal priors in
advancing generalizable hate speech detection.

Motivation: The motivation is to overcome limitations in current personalization techniques that treat user history as a flat list and fail to capture the dynamic and structured nature of user interests.

Method: MemWeaver combines hierarchical memory into two distinct components: behavioral memory for specific user actions and cognitive memory for abstract long-term preferences. These are integrated into a unified representation for reasoning in large language models.

Result: The experiments conducted on the Language Model Personalization benchmark validate MemWeaver's effectiveness in generating deeper personalization.

Conclusion: MemWeaver offers a significant advancement in personalized user interaction by modeling dynamic user interests more robustly, indicating its potential in enhancing applications of large language models.

Abstract: The primary form of user-internet engagement is shifting from leveraging
implicit feedback signals, such as browsing and clicks, to harnessing the rich
explicit feedback provided by textual interactive behaviors. This shift unlocks
a rich source of user textual history, presenting a profound opportunity for a
deeper form of personalization. However, prevailing approaches offer only a
shallow form of personalization, as they treat user history as a flat list of
texts for retrieval and fail to model the rich temporal and semantic structures
reflecting dynamic nature of user interests. In this work, we propose
\textbf{MemWeaver}, a framework that weaves the user's entire textual history
into a hierarchical memory to power deeply personalized generation. The core
innovation of our memory lies in its ability to capture both the temporal
evolution of interests and the semantic relationships between different
activities. To achieve this, MemWeaver builds two complementary memory
components that both integrate temporal and semantic information, but at
different levels of abstraction: behavioral memory, which captures specific
user actions, and cognitive memory, which represents long-term preferences.
This dual-component memory serves as a unified representation of the user,
allowing large language models (LLMs) to reason over both concrete behaviors
and abstracted traits. Experiments on the Language Model Personalization (LaMP)
benchmark validate the efficacy of MemWeaver. Our code is

*Jiaoyang Li,Junhao Ruan,Shengwei Tang,Saihan Chen,Kaiyan Chang,Yuan Ge,Tong Xiao,Jingbo Zhu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SubQRAG enhances reasoning depth in multi-hop question answering by breaking down complex questions into sub-questions, retrieving or expanding a knowledge graph dynamically, and aggregating relevant evidence for answer generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the limitations of broad-view KG-based methods like Graph RAG, which struggle with structured reasoning and complex multi-hop question answering, leading to incomplete evidence and errors.

Method: SubQRAG decomposes complex questions into sequential sub-questions, retrieves relevant knowledge graph triples, expands the graph dynamically when necessary, and aggregates evidence into a graph memory for traceable reasoning.

Result: Experiments on multi-hop QA benchmarks show that SubQRAG consistently improves performance, especially in Exact Match scores.

Conclusion: SubQRAG offers a depth-enhanced framework for multi-hop QA, combining structured reasoning via sub-questions and dynamic graph memory to improve answer accuracy.

Abstract: Graph Retrieval-Augmented Generation (Graph RAG) effectively builds a
knowledge graph (KG) to connect disparate facts across a large document corpus.
However, this broad-view approach often lacks the deep structured reasoning
needed for complex multi-hop question answering (QA), leading to incomplete
evidence and error accumulation. To address these limitations, we propose
SubQRAG, a sub-question-driven framework that enhances reasoning depth. SubQRAG
decomposes a complex question into an ordered chain of verifiable
sub-questions. For each sub-question, it retrieves relevant triples from the
graph. When the existing graph is insufficient, the system dynamically expands
it by extracting new triples from source documents in real time. All triples
used in the reasoning process are aggregated into a "graph memory," forming a
structured and traceable evidence path for final answer generation. Experiments
on three multi-hop QA benchmarks demonstrate that SubQRAG achieves consistent
and significant improvements, especially in Exact Match scores.

*Cunli Mao,Xiaofei Gao,Ran Song,Shizhu He,Shengxiang Gao,Kang Liu,Zhengtao Yu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces a knowledge graph completion framework using large language models (LLMs) and focuses on multilingual shared knowledge. It incorporates KL-GMoE for modeling shared knowledge and IER for enhancing its usability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Despite the multilingual understanding capabilities of LLMs, their potential for knowledge sharing across languages in knowledge graph completion has been underexplored.

Method: The proposed framework includes two key components: Knowledge-level Grouped Mixture of Experts (KL-GMoE) to model shared cross-lingual knowledge and Iterative Entity Reranking (IER) to enhance its utilization.

Result: Experiments on a dataset across five languages show the framework outperforms existing methods, improving Hits@1, Hits@3, and Hits@10 by 5.47%, 3.27%, and 1.01% respectively.

Conclusion: The framework successfully leverages multilingual shared knowledge for knowledge graph completion and opens up new directions for utilizing cross-lingual capabilities in LLMs. Code and dataset are made publicly available.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) based Multilingual Knowledge Graph Completion
(MKGC) aim to predict missing facts by leveraging LLMs' multilingual
understanding capabilities, improving the completeness of multilingual
knowledge graphs (KGs). However, existing MKGC research underutilizes the
multilingual capabilities of LLMs and ignores the shareability of cross-lingual
knowledge. In this paper, we propose a novel MKGC framework that leverages
multilingual shared knowledge to significantly enhance performance through two
components: Knowledge-level Grouped Mixture of Experts (KL-GMoE) and Iterative
Entity Reranking (IER). KL-GMoE efficiently models shared knowledge, while IER
significantly enhances its utilization. To evaluate our framework, we
constructed a mKG dataset containing 5 languages and conducted comprehensive
comparative experiments with existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) MKGC method. The
experimental results demonstrate that our framework achieves improvements of
5.47%, 3.27%, and 1.01% in the Hits@1, Hits@3, and Hits@10 metrics,
respectively, compared with SOTA MKGC method. Further experimental analysis
revealed the properties of knowledge sharing in settings of unseen and
unbalanced languages. We have released the dataset and code for our work on

*Fu Chen,Peng Wang,Xiyin Li,Wen Li,Shichi Lei,Dongdong Xiang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces ToolExpander, a framework with key strategies to boost the training stability and tool-using abilities of resource-limited large language models trained via Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing training methods with GRPO face challenges in achieving accurate responses, especially in small-scale models, leading to instability and potential training collapse.

Method: The paper proposes ToolExpander, which includes Dynamic Multi-Round Hard Sampling to replace hard samples with high-quality demonstrations and applies an exponential learning rate decay. It also introduces Self-Exemplifying Thinking, which adjusts the GRPO framework to promote better example generation and analysis.

Result: Experimental results show that the proposed framework significantly improves the tool-using abilities, stability, and performance of small-scale language models trained with GRPO.

Conclusion: ToolExpander successfully addresses the limitations of GRPO training in resource-constrained environments, demonstrating its potential to enhance stability and performance in small-scale language models.

Abstract: Training Large Language Models (LLMs) with Group Relative Policy Optimization
(GRPO) encounters a significant challenge: models often fail to produce
accurate responses, particularly in small-scale architectures. This limitation
not only diminishes performance improvements and undermines the potential of
GRPO but also frequently leads to mid-training collapse, adversely affecting
stability and final efficacy. To address these issues, we propose ToolExpander,
a novel framework that advances tool-oriented reinforcement learning for
resource-constrained LLMs through two key innovations:(1) Dynamic Multi-Round
Hard Sampling, which dynamically substitutes challenging samples(those without
correct outputs over 10 rollouts) with high-quality few-shot demonstrations
during training, coupled with an exponential learning rate decay strategy to
mitigate oscillations;(2) Self-Exemplifying Thinking, an enhanced GRPO
framework that eliminates KL divergence and incorporates adjusted clipping
coefficients, encouraging models to autonomously generate and analyze few-shot
examples via a minimal additional reward (0.01).Experimental results
demonstrate that ToolExpander significantly enhances tool-using capabilities in
LLMs, especially in weaker small-scale models, improving both training
stability and overall performance.

*Tianci Liu,Ran Xu,Tony Yu,Ilgee Hong,Carl Yang,Tuo Zhao,Haoyu Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces OpenRubrics, a collection for training advanced reward models using structured rubrics instead of scalar pairwise judgments, achieving superior performance in machine learning alignment tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing reward models in reinforcement learning from human feedback struggle to capture the complex dimensions of human preferences due to reliance on scalar or pairwise judgments.

Method: The authors introduced OpenRubrics, a large dataset of (prompt, rubric) pairs, and propose Contrastive Rubric Generation (CRG) to extract hard rules and implicit principles from contrasting responses. They improve reliability through rejection sampling to reduce noisy rubrics.

Result: The Rubric-based reward model (Rubric-RM) exceeds size-matched baselines by 6.8% in evaluation metrics and successfully transfers its gains to instruction-following and biomedical benchmarks.

Conclusion: Rubric-based models provide scalable and reliable evaluation signals, bridging the gap between human evaluation and automated modeling for better alignment of language models.

Abstract: Reward modeling lies at the core of reinforcement learning from human
feedback (RLHF), yet most existing reward models rely on scalar or pairwise
judgments that fail to capture the multifaceted nature of human preferences.
Recent studies have explored rubrics-as-rewards (RaR) that uses structured
natural language criteria that capture multiple dimensions of response quality.
However, producing rubrics that are both reliable and scalable remains a key
challenge. In this work, we introduce OpenRubrics, a diverse, large-scale
collection of (prompt, rubric) pairs for training rubric-generation and
rubric-based reward models. To elicit discriminative and comprehensive
evaluation signals, we introduce Contrastive Rubric Generation (CRG), which
derives both hard rules (explicit constraints) and principles (implicit
qualities) by contrasting preferred and rejected responses. We further improve
reliability by enforcing preference-label consistency via rejection sampling to
remove noisy rubrics. Across multiple reward-modeling benchmarks, our
rubric-based reward model, Rubric-RM, surpasses strong size-matched baselines
by 6.8%. These gains transfer to policy models on instruction-following and
biomedical benchmarks. Our results show that rubrics provide scalable alignment
signals that narrow the gap between costly human evaluation and automated
reward modeling, enabling a new principle-driven paradigm for LLM alignment.

### [106] [Parallel Test-Time Scaling for Latent Reasoning Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07745)
*Runyang You,Yongqi Li,Meng Liu,Wenjie Wang,Liqiang Nie,Wenjie Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces methods to enable parallel test-time scaling (TTS) for latent reasoning models by addressing sampling and aggregation challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Although latent reasoning models are efficient, the absence of sampling mechanisms in continuous spaces and lack of probabilistic signals for aggregation limit their scalability during inference.

Method: The authors propose two sampling techniques, Monte Carlo Dropout and Additive Gaussian Noise, and introduce a Latent Reward Model (LatentRM) trained with a step-wise contrastive objective for trajectory scoring and latent reasoning guidance.

Result: Experimental results and visualization analyses demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed sampling and aggregation strategies, with efficient scaling and distinct exploration dynamics.

Conclusion: The study opens new avenues for scalable inference in continuous spaces, showing that latent reasoning models can benefit from parallel test-time scaling using these methods.

Abstract: Parallel test-time scaling (TTS) is a pivotal approach for enhancing large
language models (LLMs), typically by sampling multiple token-based
chains-of-thought in parallel and aggregating outcomes through voting or
search. Recent advances in latent reasoning, where intermediate reasoning
unfolds in continuous vector spaces, offer a more efficient alternative to
explicit Chain-of-Thought, yet whether such latent models can similarly benefit
from parallel TTS remains open, mainly due to the absence of sampling
mechanisms in continuous space, and the lack of probabilistic signals for
advanced trajectory aggregation. \ This work enables parallel TTS for latent
reasoning models by addressing the above issues. For sampling, we introduce two
uncertainty-inspired stochastic strategies: Monte Carlo Dropout and Additive
Gaussian Noise. For aggregation, we design a Latent Reward Model (LatentRM)
trained with step-wise contrastive objective to score and guide latent
reasoning. Extensive experiments and visualization analyses show that both
sampling strategies scale effectively with compute and exhibit distinct
exploration dynamics, while LatentRM enables effective trajectory selection.
Together, our explorations open a new direction for scalable inference in
continuous spaces. Code released at https://github.com/YRYangang/LatentTTS.

### [107] [Test-Time Reasoners Are Strategic Multiple-Choice Test-Takers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07761)
*Nishant Balepur,Atrey Desai,Rachel Rudinger*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper examines whether large language models (LLMs) using choices-only inputs for multiple-choice question answering (MCQA) is necessarily flawed. It challenges assumptions and studies reasoning traces to assess the nature of these strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Concerns have arisen that LLMs achieving success in MCQA with choices-only inputs might rely on shallow, problematic strategies. The paper aims to validate or challenge these concerns using reasoning traces.

Method: The paper analyzes reasoning traces from LLMs solving MCQs with full inputs and choices-only inputs, conducts faithfulness tests, and evaluates the influence of reasoning traces on accuracy.

Result: Test-time reasoning improves accuracy for both full and choices-only inputs about half the time. Choices-only success remains unaffected by the length of reasoning traces, and faithful traces suggest less problematic strategies like inferring missing questions.

Conclusion: Partial-input success is not always indicative of flawed reasoning. Reasoning traces could help differentiate between problematic and justifiable reasoning strategies in choices-only settings.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) now give reasoning before answering, excelling
in tasks like multiple-choice question answering (MCQA). Yet, a concern is that
LLMs do not solve MCQs as intended, as work finds LLMs sans reasoning succeed
in MCQA without using the question, i.e., choices-only. Such partial-input
success is often deemed problematic, but reasoning traces could reveal if these
strategies are truly shallow in choices-only settings. To study these
strategies, reasoning LLMs solve MCQs in full and choices-only inputs;
test-time reasoning often boosts accuracy on full and in choices-only half the
time. While possibly due to shallow shortcuts, choices-only success is barely
affected by the length of reasoning traces, and after finding traces pass
faithfulness tests, we show they use less problematic strategies like inferring
missing questions. In all, we challenge claims that partial-input success is
always a flaw, so we discuss how reasoning traces could separate problematic
data from less problematic reasoning.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper addresses the challenge of structuring and scaling domain-specific tools for Large Language Models (LLMs) by proposing a systematic approach to create a structured tool library based on task-specific clustering and multi-agent refactoring.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Tool-augmented reasoning in domains like physics is often limited by the lack of suitable, specialized tools. Existing methods face scalability issues as unstructured collections of tools grow, making retrieval and functionality consolidation difficult.

Method: The approach involves clustering task-specific tools into semantically coherent groups and employing a multi-agent framework, where a code agent refactors tools to create aggregated versions and a reviewing agent ensures completeness and functionality.

Result: Experimental results show improved tool retrieval accuracy and enhanced reasoning performance across various tasks. The method also demonstrates better scalability for handling an increasing number of tools compared to existing baselines.

Conclusion: The paper successfully addresses scalability and retrieval challenges through structured library creation, enabling more efficient tool-augmented reasoning for LLM applications while maintaining functional integrity.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) equipped with external tools have demonstrated
enhanced performance on complex reasoning tasks. The widespread adoption of
this tool-augmented reasoning is hindered by the scarcity of domain-specific
tools. For instance, in domains such as physics question answering, suitable
and specialized tools are often missing. Recent work has explored automating
tool creation by extracting reusable functions from Chain-of-Thought (CoT)
reasoning traces; however, these approaches face a critical scalability
bottleneck. As the number of generated tools grows, storing them in an
unstructured collection leads to significant retrieval challenges, including an
expanding search space and ambiguity between function-related tools. To address
this, we propose a systematic approach to automatically refactor an
unstructured collection of tools into a structured tool library. Our system
first generates discrete, task-specific tools and clusters them into
semantically coherent topics. Within each cluster, we introduce a multi-agent
framework to consolidate scattered functionalities: a code agent refactors code
to extract shared logic and creates versatile, aggregated tools, while a
reviewing agent ensures that these aggregated tools maintain the complete
functional capabilities of the original set. This process transforms numerous
question-specific tools into a smaller set of powerful, aggregated tools
without loss of functionality. Experimental results demonstrate that our
approach significantly improves tool retrieval accuracy and overall reasoning
performance across multiple reasoning tasks. Furthermore, our method shows
enhanced scalability compared with baselines as the number of question-specific
increases.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper addresses the limitations of outcome-based rewards for mathematical reasoning in language models, introducing a process-oriented reward system that improves accuracy and reliability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to tackle reward hacking in mathematical reasoning systems, where models produce correct answers through flawed reasoning processes, leading to overestimated reasoning abilities.

Method: The authors introduce the Rubric Reward Model (RRM), which evaluates reasoning trajectories using detailed rubrics to promote logical soundness, integrated into reinforcement learning.

Result: RRM-based training improved performance on math benchmarks, notably increasing accuracy on AIME2024 from 26.7% to 62.6% and reducing flawed reasoning (Miracle Steps) by 71%.

Conclusion: Rewarding the reasoning process, rather than just outcomes, significantly enhances both the accuracy and reliability of mathematical reasoning systems.

Abstract: Large language models for mathematical reasoning are typically trained with
outcome-based rewards, which credit only the final answer. In our experiments,
we observe that this paradigm is highly susceptible to reward hacking, leading
to a substantial overestimation of a model's reasoning ability. This is
evidenced by a high incidence of false positives - solutions that reach the
correct final answer through an unsound reasoning process. Through a systematic
analysis with human verification, we establish a taxonomy of these failure
modes, identifying patterns like Miracle Steps - abrupt jumps to a correct
output without a valid preceding derivation. Probing experiments suggest a
strong association between these Miracle Steps and memorization, where the
model appears to recall the answer directly rather than deriving it. To
mitigate this systemic issue, we introduce the Rubric Reward Model (RRM), a
process-oriented reward function that evaluates the entire reasoning trajectory
against problem-specific rubrics. The generative RRM provides fine-grained,
calibrated rewards (0-1) that explicitly penalize logical flaws and encourage
rigorous deduction. When integrated into a reinforcement learning pipeline,
RRM-based training consistently outperforms outcome-only supervision across
four math benchmarks. Notably, it boosts Verified Pass@1024 on AIME2024 from
26.7% to 62.6% and reduces the incidence of Miracle Steps by 71%. Our work
demonstrates that rewarding the solution process is crucial for building models
that are not only more accurate but also more reliable.

*Omar Mahmoud,Ali Khalil,Buddhika Laknath Semage,Thommen George Karimpanal,Santu Rana*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Enhancing LLM truthfulness often harms its safety alignment, but the study proposes a disentanglement-based method to balance both.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses a critical trade-off — improving factual accuracy in large language models often weakens their refusal behavior, which is essential for safety.

Method: The authors use sparse autoencoders to disentangle refusal-related features from hallucination features. They also employ subspace orthogonalization to maintain safety alignment while minimizing hallucinations.

Result: The proposed method successfully preserves refusal behavior and task utility, preventing the trade-off between truthfulness and safety in LLMs.

Conclusion: Disentangling refusal-related and hallucination features offers a promising solution to simultaneously enhance truthfulness and maintain safety alignment in LLMs.

Abstract: Hallucination in large language models (LLMs) has been widely studied in
recent years, with progress in both detection and mitigation aimed at improving
truthfulness. Yet, a critical side effect remains largely overlooked: enhancing
truthfulness can negatively impact safety alignment. In this paper, we
investigate this trade-off and show that increasing factual accuracy often
comes at the cost of weakened refusal behavior. Our analysis reveals that this
arises from overlapping components in the model that simultaneously encode
hallucination and refusal information, leading alignment methods to suppress
factual knowledge unintentionally. We further examine how fine-tuning on benign
datasets, even when curated for safety, can degrade alignment for the same
reason. To address this, we propose a method that disentangles refusal-related
features from hallucination features using sparse autoencoders, and preserves
refusal behavior during fine-tuning through subspace orthogonalization. This
approach prevents hallucinations from increasing while maintaining safety
alignment.We evaluate our method on commonsense reasoning tasks and harmful
benchmarks (AdvBench and StrongReject). Results demonstrate that our approach
preserves refusal behavior and task utility, mitigating the trade-off between
truthfulness and safety.

*Shiman Zhao,Shangyuan Li,Wei Chen,Tengjiao Wang,Jiahui Yao,Jiabin Zheng,Kam Fai Wong*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a new end-to-end method for few-shot Multi-label Intent Detection in low-resource dialogue systems, improving performance over prior methods by eliminating error propagation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Dialogue systems need to detect multiple intents in low-resource domains, but traditional methods suffer from error propagation and overlook instance relations in few-shot learning scenarios.

Method: The authors propose a multi-label joint learning method that uses an instance relation learning network combined with label knowledge propagation and a dual relation-enhanced loss to optimize support and query-level relation strength.

Result: Experiments demonstrate that the method outperforms baselines by an average of 9.54% in AUC and 11.19% in Macro-F1 metrics in 1-shot setups.

Conclusion: The proposed approach effectively addresses the limitations of prior methods, offering a robust solution for few-shot multi-label intent detection in dialogue systems.

Abstract: Few-shot Multi-label Intent Detection (MID) is crucial for dialogue systems,
aiming to detect multiple intents of utterances in low-resource dialogue
domains. Previous studies focus on a two-stage pipeline. They first learn
representations of utterances with multiple labels and then use a
threshold-based strategy to identify multi-label results. However, these
methods rely on representation classification and ignore instance relations,
leading to error propagation. To solve the above issues, we propose a
multi-label joint learning method for few-shot MID in an end-to-end manner,
which constructs an instance relation learning network with label knowledge
propagation to eliminate error propagation. Concretely, we learn the
interaction relations between instances with class information to propagate
label knowledge between a few labeled (support set) and unlabeled (query set)
instances. With label knowledge propagation, the relation strength between
instances directly indicates whether two utterances belong to the same intent
for multi-label prediction. Besides, a dual relation-enhanced loss is developed
to optimize support- and query-level relation strength to improve performance.
Experiments show that we outperform strong baselines by an average of 9.54% AUC
and 11.19% Macro-F1 in 1-shot scenarios.

*Vardhan Dongre,Ryan A. Rossi,Viet Dac Lai,David Seunghyun Yoon,Dilek Hakkani-Tür,Trung Bui*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper studies context drift in multi-turn interactions for LLMs and proposes a framework to formally evaluate and mitigate it.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Despite the success of LLMs in single-turn tasks, their real-world deployment in multi-turn interactions faces challenges, especially context drift, which degrades over iterative exchanges.

Method: The authors formalized context drift as turn-wise KL divergence and proposed a recurrence model to analyze it as a stochastic process with restoring mechanics and interventions.

Result: Experiments show that context drift stabilizes in noise-limited equilibria, contrary to concerns of runaway degradation. Reminder interventions effectively mitigate drift as predicted by the model.

Conclusion: Multi-turn drift should be seen as a manageable equilibrium phenomenon rather than an inevitable issue, enabling better mitigation strategies in prolonged interactions.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at single-turn tasks such as instruction
following and summarization, yet real-world deployments require sustained
multi-turn interactions where user goals and conversational context persist and
evolve. A recurring challenge in this setting is context drift: the gradual
divergence of a model's outputs from goal-consistent behavior across turns.
Unlike single-turn errors, drift unfolds temporally and is poorly captured by
static evaluation metrics. In this work, we present a study of context drift in
multi-turn interactions and propose a simple dynamical framework to interpret
its behavior. We formalize drift as the turn-wise KL divergence between the
token-level predictive distributions of the test model and a goal-consistent
reference model, and propose a recurrence model that interprets its evolution
as a bounded stochastic process with restoring forces and controllable
interventions. We instantiate this framework in both synthetic long-horizon
rewriting tasks and realistic user-agent simulations such as in $\tau$-Bench,
measuring drift for several open-weight LLMs that are used as user simulators.
Our experiments consistently reveal stable, noise-limited equilibria rather
than runaway degradation, and demonstrate that simple reminder interventions
reliably reduce divergence in line with theoretical predictions. Together,
these results suggest that multi-turn drift can be understood as a controllable
equilibrium phenomenon rather than as inevitable decay, providing a foundation
for studying and mitigating context drift in extended interactions.

*Shuichiro Haruta,Kazunori Matsumoto,Zhi Li,Yanan Wang,Mori Kurokawa*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces a rotation-constrained compensation method to mitigate errors caused by structured pruning in large language models, ensuring output consistency and better task performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large language models (LLMs) are pruned with limited calibration data, leading to unavoidable output mismatches. Traditional methods like least-squares fitting tend to overfit and disrupt pretrained weights.

Method: The authors propose a rotation-constrained update that preserves output representation geometry while realigning the pruned model's subspace. Additionally, they introduce a variance-aware importance scoring mechanism to prioritize keeping key dimensions.

Result: By applying the method to LLaMA-7B and testing on WikiText-2 and other language benchmarks, the proposed approach achieves better perplexity and task accuracy than existing methods.

Conclusion: The rotation-constrained compensation method effectively preserves the semantic representation geometry in pruned LLMs, addressing errors and improving performance across linguistic tasks.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a rotation-constrained compensation method to
address the errors introduced by structured pruning of large language models
(LLMs). LLMs are trained on massive datasets and accumulate rich semantic
knowledge in their representation space. In contrast, pruning is typically
carried out with only a small amount of calibration data, which makes output
mismatches unavoidable. Although direct least-squares fitting can reduce such
errors, it tends to overfit to the limited calibration set, destructively
modifying pretrained weights. To overcome this difficulty, we update the pruned
parameters under a rotation constraint. This constrained update preserves the
geometry of output representations (i.e., norms and inner products) and
simultaneously re-aligns the pruned subspace with the original outputs.
Furthermore, in rotation-constrained compensation, removing components that
strongly contribute to the principal directions of the output makes error
recovery difficult. Since input dimensions with large variance strongly affect
these principal directions, we design a variance-aware importance score that
ensures such dimensions are preferentially kept in the pruned model. By
combining this scoring rule with rotation-constrained updates, the proposed
method effectively compensates errors while retaining the components likely to
be more important in a geometry-preserving manner. In the experiments, we apply
the proposed method to LLaMA-7B and evaluate it on WikiText-2 and multiple
language understanding benchmarks. The results demonstrate consistently better
perplexity and task accuracy compared with existing baselines.

Result: Presents a taxonomy of models, links datasets to methods, and highlights challenges in interpretability, standardization, and trustworthy development.

Conclusion: LLM-driven single-cell intelligence shows promise but requires improvements in evaluation, ethical considerations, and model trustworthiness.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) and emerging agentic frameworks are beginning to
transform single-cell biology by enabling natural-language reasoning,
generative annotation, and multimodal data integration. However, progress
remains fragmented across data modalities, architectures, and evaluation
standards. LLM4Cell presents the first unified survey of 58 foundation and
agentic models developed for single-cell research, spanning RNA, ATAC,
multi-omic, and spatial modalities. We categorize these methods into five
families-foundation, text-bridge, spatial, multimodal, epigenomic, and
agentic-and map them to eight key analytical tasks including annotation,
trajectory and perturbation modeling, and drug-response prediction. Drawing on
over 40 public datasets, we analyze benchmark suitability, data diversity, and
ethical or scalability constraints, and evaluate models across 10 domain
dimensions covering biological grounding, multi-omics alignment, fairness,
privacy, and explainability. By linking datasets, models, and evaluation
domains, LLM4Cell provides the first integrated view of language-driven

Motivation: To tackle inefficiencies like over-search and under-search in agentic RAG, which compromise problem-solving ability and question answering, and to address the limitations of outcome-based rewards in RL training.

Method: The paper proposes HiPRAG, which incorporates a hierarchical reward system into RL training. This system evaluates search decisions on-the-fly by breaking down reasoning steps and rewards optimal search behaviors alongside outcome rewards.

Result: HiPRAG improved accuracy to 65.4% for 3B parameters and 67.2% for 7B parameters in QA benchmarks. It reduced over-search rates to 2.3% and minimized under-search rates, showcasing enhanced search efficiency.

Conclusion: HiPRAG highlights the value of fine-grained control in RL training to optimize reasoning processes, showing generalizable benefits across diverse RL algorithms, model types, and contexts. This methodology improves both the efficiency and accuracy of reasoning in search agents.

Abstract: Agentic RAG is a powerful technique for incorporating external information
that LLMs lack, enabling better problem solving and question answering.
However, suboptimal search behaviors exist widely, such as over-search
(retrieving information already known) and under-search (failing to search when
necessary), which leads to unnecessary overhead and unreliable outputs. Current
training methods, which typically rely on outcome-based rewards in a RL
framework, lack the fine-grained control needed to address these
inefficiencies. To overcome this, we introduce Hierarchical Process Rewards for
Efficient agentic RAG (HiPRAG), a training methodology that incorporates a
fine-grained, knowledge-grounded process reward into the RL training. Our
approach evaluates the necessity of each search decision on-the-fly by
decomposing the agent's reasoning trajectory into discrete, parsable steps. We
then apply a hierarchical reward function that provides an additional bonus
based on the proportion of optimal search and non-search steps, on top of
commonly used outcome and format rewards. Experiments on the Qwen2.5 and
Llama-3.2 models across seven diverse QA benchmarks show that our method
achieves average accuracies of 65.4% (3B) and 67.2% (7B). This is accomplished
while improving search efficiency, reducing the over-search rate to just 2.3%
and concurrently lowering the under-search rate. These results demonstrate the
efficacy of optimizing the reasoning process itself, not just the final
outcome. Further experiments and analysis demonstrate that HiPRAG shows good
generalizability across a wide range of RL algorithms, model families, sizes,
and types. This work demonstrates the importance and potential of fine-grained
control through RL, for improving the efficiency and optimality of reasoning
for search agents.

### [116] [Dynamic Generation of Multi-LLM Agents Communication Topologies with Graph Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07799)
*Eric Hanchen Jiang,Guancheng Wan,Sophia Yin,Mengting Li,Yuchen Wu,Xiao Liang,Xinfeng Li,Yizhou Sun,Wei Wang,Kai-Wei Chang,Ying Nian Wu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces Guided Topology Diffusion (GTD), a framework for dynamically generating efficient communication topologies for Large Language Model-based multi-agent systems, outperforming static approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Challenges in optimizing communication topology for multi-agent systems include balancing performance, cost, and robustness, and the inefficiency of current static or hand-crafted methods.

Method: The GTD framework uses iterative construction inspired by discrete graph diffusion models. It employs a proxy model that predicts multi-objective rewards, allowing real-time optimization for adaptive topology synthesis.

Result: Experiments demonstrate that GTD creates sparse, efficient, and highly task-adaptive communication topologies, achieving superior performance over existing methods.

Conclusion: Iterative and guided topology synthesis enables GTD to better handle design trade-offs and enhance the efficiency of LLM-driven multi-agent systems.

Abstract: The efficiency of multi-agent systems driven by large language models (LLMs)
largely hinges on their communication topology. However, designing an optimal
topology is a non-trivial challenge, as it requires balancing competing
objectives such as task performance, communication cost, and robustness.
Existing frameworks often rely on static or hand-crafted topologies, which
inherently fail to adapt to diverse task requirements, leading to either
excessive token consumption for simple problems or performance bottlenecks for
complex ones. To address this challenge, we introduce a novel generative
framework called \textit{Guided Topology Diffusion (GTD)}. Inspired by
conditional discrete graph diffusion models, GTD formulates topology synthesis
as an iterative construction process. At each step, the generation is steered
by a lightweight proxy model that predicts multi-objective rewards (e.g.,
accuracy, utility, cost), enabling real-time, gradient-free optimization
towards task-adaptive topologies. This iterative, guided synthesis process
distinguishes GTD from single-step generative frameworks, enabling it to better
navigate complex design trade-offs. We validated GTD across multiple
benchmarks, and experiments show that this framework can generate highly
task-adaptive, sparse, and efficient communication topologies, significantly
outperforming existing methods in LLM agent collaboration.

*Yuxin Huang,Simeng Wu,Ran Song,Yan Xiang,Yantuan Xian,Shengxiang Gao,Zhengtao Yu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces MGR-CSC, a framework for multilingual generative information retrieval that addresses cross-lingual identifier misalignment and inflation, showing significant improvements in retrieval accuracy and identifier space efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing generative retrieval paradigms perform well in monolingual scenarios but struggle with multilingual retrieval due to challenges like identifier misalignment and inflation.

Method: The authors propose MGR-CSC, a framework that aligns semantics and compresses the identifier space through unified multilingual keywords, and adopts a dynamic multi-step constrained decoding strategy during retrieval.

Result: MGR-CSC delivers high retrieval accuracy, with a 6.83% improvement on mMarco100k and 4.77% on mNQ320k datasets, while significantly reducing document identifier lengths by 74.51% and 78.2%.

Conclusion: MGR-CSC proves effective for multilingual generative information retrieval, enhancing alignment, efficiency, and overall retrieval performance, and addressing key multilingual challenges.

Abstract: Generative Information Retrieval is an emerging retrieval paradigm that
exhibits remarkable performance in monolingual scenarios.However, applying
these methods to multilingual retrieval still encounters two primary
challenges, cross-lingual identifier misalignment and identifier inflation. To
address these limitations, we propose Multilingual Generative Retrieval via
Cross-lingual Semantic Compression (MGR-CSC), a novel framework that unifies
semantically equivalent multilingual keywords into shared atoms to align
semantics and compresses the identifier space, and we propose a dynamic
multi-step constrained decoding strategy during retrieval. MGR-CSC improves
cross-lingual alignment by assigning consistent identifiers and enhances
decoding efficiency by reducing redundancy. Experiments demonstrate that
MGR-CSC achieves outstanding retrieval accuracy, improving by 6.83% on
mMarco100k and 4.77% on mNQ320k, while reducing document identifiers length by
74.51% and 78.2%, respectively.

### [118] [AdaSwitch: Adaptive Switching Generation for Knowledge Distillation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07842)
*Jingyu Peng,Maolin Wang,Hengyi Cai,Yuchen Li,Kai Zhang,Shuaiqiang Wang,Dawei Yin,Xiangyu Zhao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: AdaSwitch dynamically combines on-policy and off-policy generation at the token level to improve accuracy in small language models (SLMs) while addressing training-inference mismatch and supervision quality issues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SLMs are essential for applications with latency and computational constraints, but achieving high performance is challenging. Existing knowledge distillation methods have trade-offs between supervision quality and training-inference consistency.

Method: AdaSwitch introduces a token-level dynamic approach where student models balance predictions with teacher guidance based on real-time quality assessment, merging on-policy and off-policy techniques.

Result: Experiments on three datasets with two teacher-student LLM pairs demonstrate consistent accuracy improvements and show AdaSwitch's practical effectiveness with minimal overhead.

Conclusion: AdaSwitch effectively resolves key issues in distilling small language models by balancing exploration and supervision, making it a promising tool for practical deployment in resource-constrained environments.

Abstract: Small language models (SLMs) are crucial for applications with strict latency
and computational constraints, yet achieving high performance remains
challenging. Knowledge distillation (KD) can transfer capabilities from large
teacher models, but existing methods involve trade-offs: off-policy
distillation provides high-quality supervision but introduces a
training-inference mismatch, while on-policy approaches maintain consistency
but rely on low-quality student outputs. To address these issues, we propose
AdaSwitch, a novel approach that dynamically combines on-policy and off-policy
generation at the token level. AdaSwitch allows the student to first explore
its own predictions and then selectively integrate teacher guidance based on
real-time quality assessment. This approach simultaneously preserves
consistency and maintains supervision quality. Experiments on three datasets
with two teacher-student LLM pairs demonstrate that AdaSwitch consistently
improves accuracy, offering a practical and effective method for distilling
SLMs with acceptable additional overhead.

TL;DR: The study introduces Translation Tangles, a framework to evaluate translation quality and fairness in LLMs across language pairs and domains, addressing issues such as bias in low-resource languages.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs excel in broad MT capabilities but underperform in diverse language families and specialized domains, with bias being a major concern for fairness.

Method: Translation Tangles benchmarks 24 bidirectional language pairs and domains using metrics, employs a hybrid bias detection pipeline, and provides a bias-annotated dataset based on human evaluations.

Result: The study produces a framework, metrics, a hybrid pipeline for bias detection, and a human-annotated, bias-aware dataset for improving LLM translation evaluations.

Conclusion: Translation Tangles offers tools and datasets for tackling uneven translation performance and biases, advancing fairness and quality in MT research involving LLMs.

Abstract: The rise of Large Language Models (LLMs) has redefined Machine Translation
(MT), enabling context-aware and fluent translations across hundreds of
languages and textual domains. Despite their remarkable capabilities, LLMs
often exhibit uneven performance across language families and specialized
domains. Moreover, recent evidence reveals that these models can encode and
amplify different biases present in their training data, posing serious
concerns for fairness, especially in low-resource languages. To address these
gaps, we introduce Translation Tangles, a unified framework and dataset for
evaluating the translation quality and fairness of open-source LLMs. Our
approach benchmarks 24 bidirectional language pairs across multiple domains
using different metrics. We further propose a hybrid bias detection pipeline
that integrates rule-based heuristics, semantic similarity filtering, and
LLM-based validation. We also introduce a high-quality, bias-annotated dataset
based on human evaluations of 1,439 translation-reference pairs. The code and
dataset are accessible on GitHub:

*Xinliang Frederick Zhang,Anhad Mohananey,Alexandra Chronopoulou,Pinelopi Papalampidi,Somit Gupta,Tsendsuren Munkhdalai,Lu Wang,Shyam Upadhyay*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper investigates inefficiencies in long chain-of-thought reasoning models, focusing on overthinking and its causes, proposing TRACE analyzer to systematically address the issue.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand and mitigate overthinking in long chain-of-thought reasoning models, which leads to inefficient computations without accuracy improvements.

Method: The authors developed TRACE, an analyzer that decomposes LLM thought processes into sub-thoughts, constructs thought progression graphs, and identifies common patterns for overthinking.

Result: Two common patterns of overthinking were identified in LLMs: Explorer and Late Landing, driven by over-exploration and over-verification. A utility-based definition of overthinking was also proposed.

Conclusion: The findings improve the understanding of overthinking in LLMs, offering practical guidelines and metrics for efficient management based on refined definitions of thought progression.

Abstract: Models employing long chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning have shown superior
performance on complex reasoning tasks. Yet, this capability introduces a
critical and often overlooked inefficiency -- overthinking -- models often
engage in unnecessarily extensive reasoning even for simple queries, incurring
significant computations without accuracy improvements. While prior work has
explored solutions to mitigate overthinking, a fundamental gap remains in our
understanding of its underlying causes. Most existing analyses are limited to
superficial, profiling-based observations, failing to delve into LLMs' inner
workings. This study introduces a systematic, fine-grained analyzer of LLMs'
thought process to bridge the gap, TRACE. We first benchmark the overthinking
issue, confirming that long-thinking models are five to twenty times slower on
simple tasks with no substantial gains. We then use TRACE to first decompose
the thought process into minimally complete sub-thoughts. Next, by inferring
discourse relationships among sub-thoughts, we construct granular thought
progression graphs and subsequently identify common thinking patterns for
topically similar queries. Our analysis reveals two major patterns for
open-weight thinking models -- Explorer and Late Landing. This finding provides
evidence that over-verification and over-exploration are the primary drivers of
overthinking in LLMs. Grounded in thought structures, we propose a
utility-based definition of overthinking, which moves beyond length-based
metrics. This revised definition offers a more insightful understanding of
LLMs' thought progression, as well as practical guidelines for principled
overthinking management.

TL;DR: The paper addresses language alignment issues in speech-to-speech interaction systems by introducing a benchmark (CS3-Bench) and proposes novel methods like Chain of Recognition and Keyword Highlighting to improve performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Natural monolingual speech-to-speech interaction has been achieved, but existing models struggle with language alignment in code-switching scenarios.

Method: The authors propose a benchmark (CS3-Bench) for code-switching speech-to-speech systems and introduce Chain of Recognition (CoR) and Keyword Highlighting (KH) techniques for training models to enhance language alignment capabilities.

Result: Their approach significantly enhanced performance, improving knowledge accuracy from 25.14% to 46.13% and open-ended understanding rate from 64.5% to 86.5%, while reducing pronunciation errors in the secondary language.

Conclusion: The proposed methods effectively address language alignment challenges in multimodal systems, showcasing significant improvements. The benchmark can serve as a standard for future evaluations.

Abstract: The advancement of multimodal large language models has accelerated the
development of speech-to-speech interaction systems. While natural monolingual
interaction has been achieved, we find existing models exhibit deficiencies in
language alignment. In our proposed Code-Switching Speech-to-Speech Benchmark
(CS3-Bench), experiments on 7 mainstream models demonstrate a relative
performance drop of up to 66% in knowledge-intensive question answering and
varying degrees of misunderstanding in open-ended conversations. Starting from
a model with severe performance deterioration, we propose both data
constructions and training approaches to improve the language alignment
capabilities, specifically employing Chain of Recognition (CoR) to enhance
understanding and Keyword Highlighting (KH) to guide generation. Our approach
improves the knowledge accuracy from 25.14% to 46.13%, with open-ended
understanding rate from 64.5% to 86.5%, and significantly reduces pronunciation
errors in the secondary language. CS3-Bench is available at

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces Contrastive Weak-to-Strong Generalization (ConG), which improves the robustness and quality of scaling LLMs through an advanced decoding method leveraging implicit rewards.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges like noise and biases in weak model outputs that hinder the robustness and generalization of weak-to-strong paradigms for scaling LLMs.

Method: Contrastive decoding between pre- and post-alignment weak models is employed using implicit rewards to refine outputs and ensure higher-quality sample generation.

Result: Empirical evaluations across diverse model families show consistent improvements in robustness and capability transfer, confirming the efficacy of ConG.

Conclusion: ConG effectively enhances weak-to-strong generalization, substantially mitigating limitations of traditional methods, with potential applications toward advancing AGI.

Abstract: Weak-to-strong generalization provides a promising paradigm for scaling large
language models (LLMs) by training stronger models on samples from aligned
weaker ones, without requiring human feedback or explicit reward modeling.
However, its robustness and generalization are hindered by the noise and biases
in weak-model outputs, which limit its applicability in practice. To address
this challenge, we leverage implicit rewards, which approximate explicit
rewards through log-likelihood ratios, and reveal their structural equivalence
with Contrastive Decoding (CD), a decoding strategy shown to reduce noise in
LLM generation. Building on this connection, we propose Contrastive
Weak-to-Strong Generalization (ConG), a framework that employs contrastive
decoding between pre- and post-alignment weak models to generate higher-quality
samples. This approach enables more reliable capability transfer, denoising,
and improved robustness, substantially mitigating the limitations of
traditional weak-to-strong methods. Empirical results across different model
families confirm consistent improvements, demonstrating the generality and
effectiveness of ConG. Taken together, our findings highlight the potential of
ConG to advance weak-to-strong generalization and provide a promising pathway
toward AGI.

*Verena Blaschke,Miriam Winkler,Barbara Plank*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper examines standard-to-dialect transfer in text, speech models, and cascaded systems, introducing a new dialectal audio dataset for classification tasks. It finds speech-only models perform best on dialects, while text-only models excel in standard language.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge the gap between standard and non-standard dialect processing, particularly in spoken and written intent/topic classification.

Method: The study compares three experimental setups: text models, speech models, and cascaded systems combining transcription and text analysis. A new dataset for dialectal audio intent classification is introduced and used in experiments.

Result: Speech-only models achieve the best results for dialectal data, whereas text-only models perform best with standard data. Cascaded systems show potential if transcription normalizes dialectal data to resemble standard text.

Conclusion: Speech processing excels in handling dialectal data compared to other methods, highlighting the need for tailored approaches in dialect NLP, while cascaded systems show promise with effective transcription normalization.

Abstract: Research on cross-dialectal transfer from a standard to a non-standard
dialect variety has typically focused on text data. However, dialects are
primarily spoken, and non-standard spellings are known to cause issues in text
processing. We compare standard-to-dialect transfer in three settings: text
models, speech models, and cascaded systems where speech first gets
automatically transcribed and then further processed by a text model. In our
experiments, we focus on German and multiple German dialects in the context of
written and spoken intent and topic classification. To that end, we release the
first dialectal audio intent classification dataset. We find that the
speech-only setup provides the best results on the dialect data while the
text-only setup works best on the standard data. While the cascaded systems lag
behind the text-only models for German, they perform relatively well on the
dialectal data if the transcription system generates normalized, standard-like
output.

TL;DR: This paper introduces MCBench, a benchmark to objectively test whether large language models (LLMs) can execute string-matching NLP metrics and follow step-by-step instructions accurately.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current advanced LLMs have achieved peak performance on existing benchmarks, necessitating new, more challenging and objective benchmarks for further evaluation and differentiation.

Method: The authors developed MCBench, an objective and code-verifiable benchmark that systematically evaluates LLMs' abilities in instruction adherence, numerical computation, and consistent handling of intermediate results. This includes three metrics, three benchmark variants, and parallel reference code for accuracy evaluation.

Result: The study finds that MCBench effectively evaluates the instruction-following and execution accuracy of frontier-level LLMs and offers objective and verifiable assessment.

Conclusion: MCBench is positioned as a robust tool to objectively measure and understand advanced LLM capabilities beyond existing benchmarks.

Abstract: Recent frontier-level LLMs have saturated many previously difficult
benchmarks, leaving little room for further differentiation. This progress
highlights the need for challenging benchmarks that provide objective
verification. In this paper, we introduce MCBench, a benchmark designed to
evaluate whether LLMs can execute string-matching NLP metrics by strictly
following step-by-step instructions. Unlike prior benchmarks that depend on
subjective judgments or general reasoning, MCBench offers an objective,
deterministic and codeverifiable evaluation. This setup allows us to
systematically test whether LLMs can maintain accurate step-by-step execution,
including instruction adherence, numerical computation, and long-range
consistency in handling intermediate results. To ensure objective evaluation of
these abilities, we provide a parallel reference code that can evaluate the
accuracy of LLM output. We provide three evaluative metrics and three benchmark
variants designed to measure the detailed instruction understanding capability
of LLMs. Our analyses show that MCBench serves as an effective and objective
tool for evaluating the capabilities of cutting-edge LLMs.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper addresses performance decay in multi-hop factual recall for large language models (LLMs) and proposes a new framework, ACE, to improve knowledge editing (KE) by identifying and modifying neuron-level dynamics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for knowledge editing (KE) in LLMs struggle with performance degradation in multi-hop factual recall, especially with edits involving intermediate implicit subjects. The motivation is to better understand and address this limitation.

Method: Using causal analysis, the authors identify that implicit subjects act as query neurons activating value neurons across layers in multi-hop reasoning. They propose ACE, a framework that uses neuron-level attribution to target and edit these critical query-value pathways.

Result: The ACE framework outperformed existing methods in retaining multi-hop factual recall accuracy by 9.44% on GPT-J and by 37.46% on Qwen3-8B. It also uncovers finer patterns in value neuron activation.

Conclusion: The findings provide a mechanistically grounded approach to multi-hop knowledge editing, advancing the capabilities of LLMs through a better understanding of their internal reasoning mechanisms.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) require efficient knowledge editing (KE) to
update factual information, yet existing methods exhibit significant
performance decay in multi-hop factual recall. This failure is particularly
acute when edits involve intermediate implicit subjects within reasoning
chains. Through causal analysis, we reveal that this limitation stems from an
oversight of how chained knowledge is dynamically represented and utilized at
the neuron level. We discover that during multi hop reasoning, implicit
subjects function as query neurons, which sequentially activate corresponding
value neurons across transformer layers to accumulate information toward the
final answer, a dynamic prior KE work has overlooked. Guided by this insight,
we propose ACE: Attribution-Controlled Knowledge Editing for Multi-hop Factual
Recall, a framework that leverages neuron-level attribution to identify and
edit these critical query-value (Q-V) pathways. ACE provides a mechanistically
grounded solution for multi-hop KE, empirically outperforming state-of-the-art
methods by 9.44% on GPT-J and 37.46% on Qwen3-8B. Our analysis further reveals
more fine-grained activation patterns in Qwen3 and demonstrates that the
semantic interpretability of value neurons is orchestrated by query-driven
accumulation. These findings establish a new pathway for advancing KE
capabilities based on the principled understanding of internal reasoning
mechanisms.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces a unified framework using Large Language Models (LLMs) for automatically grading subjective questions across diverse domains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the limitations of existing grading systems that focus on specific types of questions and lack generality for diverse exams.

Method: Integrate four modules: text matching, key knowledge point comparison, pseudo-question generation, and human-like evaluation leveraging LLMs.

Result: The framework outperforms traditional and LLM-based baselines across grading metrics and is successfully deployed in real-world exams.

Conclusion: The proposed LLM-enhanced system effectively evaluates subjective questions, showcasing versatility and reliability in varied contexts.

Abstract: Automatic grading of subjective questions remains a significant challenge in
examination assessment due to the diversity in question formats and the
open-ended nature of student responses. Existing works primarily focus on a
specific type of subjective question and lack the generality to support
comprehensive exams that contain diverse question types. In this paper, we
propose a unified Large Language Model (LLM)-enhanced auto-grading framework
that provides human-like evaluation for all types of subjective questions
across various domains. Our framework integrates four complementary modules to
holistically evaluate student answers. In addition to a basic text matching
module that provides a foundational assessment of content similarity, we
leverage the powerful reasoning and generative capabilities of LLMs to: (1)
compare key knowledge points extracted from both student and reference answers,
(2) generate a pseudo-question from the student answer to assess its relevance
to the original question, and (3) simulate human evaluation by identifying
content-related and non-content strengths and weaknesses. Extensive experiments
on both general-purpose and domain-specific datasets show that our framework
consistently outperforms traditional and LLM-based baselines across multiple
grading metrics. Moreover, the proposed system has been successfully deployed
in real-world training and certification exams at a major e-commerce
enterprise.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing knowledge distillation methods struggle with transferring reasoning abilities effectively in step-by-step retrieval scenarios, impacting performance in complex real-world question answering.

Method: StepER leverages step-wise supervision and difficulty-aware training to progressively align learning steps with evolving reasoning needs.

Result: Results demonstrate StepER's significant improvement, enabling an 8B model to achieve performance comparable to larger 70B teacher models on multi-hop QA benchmarks.

Conclusion: StepER enhances reasoning capabilities in multi-step frameworks, making it a promising approach for retrieval-augmented models, with adaptable applications and verified superiority over existing methods.

Abstract: Answering complex real-world questions requires step-by-step retrieval and
integration of relevant information to generate well-grounded responses.
However, existing knowledge distillation methods overlook the need for
different reasoning abilities at different steps, hindering transfer in
multi-step retrieval-augmented frameworks. To address this, we propose Stepwise
Knowledge Distillation for Enhancing Reasoning Ability in Multi-Step
Retrieval-Augmented Language Models (StepER). StepER employs step-wise
supervision to align with evolving information and reasoning demands across
stages. Additionally, it incorporates difficulty-aware training to
progressively optimize learning by prioritizing suitable steps. Our method is
adaptable to various multi-step retrieval-augmented language models, including
those that use retrieval queries for reasoning paths or decomposed questions.
Extensive experiments show that StepER outperforms prior methods on multi-hop
QA benchmarks, with an 8B model achieving performance comparable to a 70B
teacher model.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This study evaluates methods to detect incomplete outputs of large language models (LLMs), addressing missing or underrepresented information that can be as harmful as inaccuracies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Incomplete or partially missing outputs from LLMs, especially in sensitive areas, can cause harm comparable to inaccuracies like hallucinations.

Method: Explored three automated evaluation methods for comprehensiveness: (1) NLI-based approach using decomposed statements, (2) Q&A-based evaluation by comparing question-answer pairs, and (3) end-to-end LLM-based identification of missing content.

Result: The end-to-end method showed surprising effectiveness despite its lower robustness, interpretability, and granularity compared to the other approaches.

Conclusion: The study highlights the potential of different strategies to evaluate LLM comprehensiveness and assesses the performance of prominent open-weight LLMs on multi-source queries.

Abstract: Despite demonstrating remarkable performance across a wide range of tasks,
large language models (LLMs) have also been found to frequently produce outputs
that are incomplete or selectively omit key information. In sensitive domains,
such omissions can result in significant harm comparable to that posed by
factual inaccuracies, including hallucinations. In this study, we address the
challenge of evaluating the comprehensiveness of LLM-generated texts, focusing
on the detection of missing information or underrepresented viewpoints. We
investigate three automated evaluation strategies: (1) an NLI-based method that
decomposes texts into atomic statements and uses natural language inference
(NLI) to identify missing links, (2) a Q&A-based approach that extracts
question-answer pairs and compares responses across sources, and (3) an
end-to-end method that directly identifies missing content using LLMs. Our
experiments demonstrate the surprising effectiveness of the simple end-to-end
approach compared to more complex methods, though at the cost of reduced
robustness, interpretability and result granularity. We further assess the
comprehensiveness of responses from several popular open-weight LLMs when
answering user queries based on multiple sources.

(LLMs) to the study of 17th and 18th century Estonian dictionaries. The authors
address three main areas: enriching historical dictionaries with modern word
forms and meanings; using vision-enabled LLMs to perform text recognition on
sources printed in Gothic script (Fraktur); and preparing for the creation of a
unified, cross-source dataset. Initial experiments with J. Gutslaff's 1648
dictionary indicate that LLMs have significant potential for semi-automatic
enrichment of dictionary information. When provided with sufficient context,
Claude 3.7 Sonnet accurately provided meanings and modern equivalents for 81%
of headword entries. In a text recognition experiment with A. T. Helle's 1732
dictionary, a zero-shot method successfully identified and structured 41% of
headword entries into error-free JSON-formatted output. For digitising the
Estonian-German dictionary section of A. W. Hupel's 1780 grammar, overlapping
tiling of scanned image files is employed, with one LLM being used for text
recognition and a second for merging the structured output. These findings
demonstrate that even for minor languages LLMs have a significant potential for
saving time and financial resources.

### [130] [A$^2$Search: Ambiguity-Aware Question Answering with Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07958)
*Fengji Zhang,Xinyao Niu,Chengyang Ying,Guancheng Lin,Zhongkai Hao,Zhou Fan,Chengen Huang,Jacky Keung,Bei Chen,Junyang Lin*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces A$^2$Search, a training framework for open-domain QA systems that addresses the challenge of ambiguous questions without requiring manual annotation. The method outperforms state-of-the-art baselines across multiple benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenge of ambiguous questions in QA tasks, which are often ignored by existing models and QA benchmarks. Current solutions depend on manual annotations, which are expensive and not scalable.

Method: A$^2$Search is an annotation-free framework that uses automatic ambiguity detection, trajectory sampling, and evidence verification to identify alternative valid answers. It employs reinforcement learning with a specially designed AnsF1 reward to optimize the model.

Result: The proposed A$^2$Search framework achieves state-of-the-art performance on eight open-domain QA benchmarks. It outperforms models like ReSearch-32B with a smaller model (A$^2$Search-7B), achieving a higher AnsF1@1 score across multi-hop datasets.

Conclusion: Embracing and addressing ambiguity in QA tasks enhances system reliability, as demonstrated by the success of A$^2$Search. The framework generalizes well across benchmarks, showcasing its robustness.

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) and Reinforcement Learning
(RL) have led to strong performance in open-domain question answering (QA).
However, existing models still struggle with questions that admit multiple
valid answers. Standard QA benchmarks, which typically assume a single gold
answer, overlook this reality and thus produce inappropriate training signals.
Existing attempts to handle ambiguity often rely on costly manual annotation,
which is difficult to scale to multi-hop datasets such as HotpotQA and MuSiQue.
In this paper, we present A$^2$Search, an annotation-free, end-to-end training
framework to recognize and handle ambiguity. At its core is an automated
pipeline that detects ambiguous questions and gathers alternative answers via
trajectory sampling and evidence verification. The model is then optimized with
RL using a carefully designed $\mathrm{AnsF1}$ reward, which naturally
accommodates multiple answers. Experiments on eight open-domain QA benchmarks
demonstrate that A$^2$Search achieves new state-of-the-art performance. With
only a single rollout, A$^2$Search-7B yields an average $\mathrm{AnsF1}@1$
score of $48.4\%$ across four multi-hop benchmarks, outperforming all strong
baselines, including the substantially larger ReSearch-32B ($46.2\%$).
Extensive analyses further show that A$^2$Search resolves ambiguity and
generalizes across benchmarks, highlighting that embracing ambiguity is
essential for building more reliable QA systems. Our code, data, and model
weights can be found at https://github.com/zfj1998/A2Search

### [131] [LightReasoner: Can Small Language Models Teach Large Language Models Reasoning?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07962)
*Jingyuan Wang,Yankai Chen,Zhonghang Li,Chao Huang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces LightReasoner, a method where smaller language models (SLMs) help improve larger models (LLMs) by highlighting critical reasoning steps, reducing the need for extensive supervision and resource usage.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current fine-tuning approaches for large language models are resource-intensive and inefficient, with learning concentrated on a small fraction of critical tokens.

Method: LightReasoner uses a two-stage process: (1) identifying critical reasoning moments via behavioral differences between a stronger expert and weaker amateur model, and (2) fine-tuning the expert model based on these moments to enhance reasoning capabilities.

Result: LightReasoner significantly improves reasoning accuracy (up to 28.1%) on mathematical benchmarks while drastically reducing resource consumption, including 90% less time, 80% fewer sampled problems, and 99% reduced token tuning.

Conclusion: LightReasoner demonstrates an effective and efficient way to refine LLM reasoning using targeted examples distilled from weak SLMs, cutting down on unnecessary resource expenditure.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable progress in
reasoning, often through supervised fine-tuning (SFT). However, SFT is
resource-intensive, relying on large curated datasets, rejection-sampled
demonstrations, and uniform optimization across all tokens, even though only a
fraction carry meaningful learning value. In this work, we explore a
counterintuitive idea: can smaller language models (SLMs) teach larger language
models (LLMs) by revealing high-value reasoning moments that reflect the
latter's unique strength? We propose LightReasoner, a novel framework that
leverages the behavioral divergence between a stronger expert model (LLM) and a
weaker amateur model (SLM). LightReasoner operates in two stages: (1) a
sampling stage that pinpoints critical reasoning moments and constructs
supervision examples capturing the expert's advantage through expert-amateur
contrast, and (2) a fine-tuning stage that aligns the expert model with these
distilled examples, amplifying its reasoning strengths. Across seven
mathematical benchmarks, LightReasoner improves accuracy by up to 28.1%, while
reducing time consumption by 90%, sampled problems by 80%, and tuned token
usage by 99%, all without relying on ground-truth labels. By turning weaker
SLMs into effective teaching signals, LightReasoner offers a scalable and
resource-efficient approach for advancing LLM reasoning. Code is available at:

### [132] [Active Confusion Expression in Large Language Models: Leveraging World Models toward Better Social Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07974)
*Jialu Du,Guiyang Hou,Yihui Fu,Chen Wu,Wenqi Zhang,Yongliang Shen,Weiming Lu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs exhibit difficulties in social reasoning, leading to confusion and errors. To address this, researchers propose a mechanism that uses adaptive world models to improve reasoning. Benchmarks show better accuracy and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs face challenges in social reasoning due to their inability to separate objective reality from subjective beliefs.

Method: The paper introduces an adaptive world model-enhanced reasoning mechanism that dynamically tracks entities and timelines, intervening during reasoning impasses.

Result: Experimental evaluations demonstrate enhanced accuracy in social reasoning tasks (+10% in Hi-ToM) and reduced computation costs (33.8% fewer tokens).

Conclusion: The proposed mechanism effectively improves the social reasoning capabilities of LLMs, offering higher accuracy and efficiency for deployment in social contexts.

Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) excel in mathematical and code reasoning,
we observe they struggle with social reasoning tasks, exhibiting cognitive
confusion, logical inconsistencies, and conflation between objective world
states and subjective belief states. Through deteiled analysis of DeepSeek-R1's
reasoning trajectories, we find that LLMs frequently encounter reasoning
impasses and tend to output contradictory terms like "tricky" and "confused"
when processing scenarios with multiple participants and timelines, leading to
erroneous reasoning or infinite loops. The core issue is their inability to
disentangle objective reality from agents' subjective beliefs. To address this,
we propose an adaptive world model-enhanced reasoning mechanism that constructs
a dynamic textual world model to track entity states and temporal sequences. It
dynamically monitors reasoning trajectories for confusion indicators and
promptly intervenes by providing clear world state descriptions, helping models
navigate through cognitive dilemmas. The mechanism mimics how humans use
implicit world models to distinguish between external events and internal
beliefs. Evaluations on three social benchmarks demonstrate significant
improvements in accuracy (e.g., +10% in Hi-ToM) while reducing computational
costs (up to 33.8% token reduction), offering a simple yet effective solution
for deploying LLMs in social contexts.

### [133] [Leveraging Author-Specific Context for Scientific Figure Caption Generation: 3rd SciCap Challenge](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07993)
*Watcharapong Timklaypachara,Monrada Chiewhawan,Nopporn Lekuthai,Titipat Achakulvisut*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces a caption generation system tailored for scientific figures that integrates contextual understanding and author-specific styles to improve both accuracy and stylistic consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address challenges in generating scientific figure captions that require accuracy and alignment with researchers' individual stylistic preferences.

Method: The authors employ a two-stage pipeline: context filtering and context-specific prompt optimization (Stage 1), followed by stylistic refinement using profile figures (Stage 2).

Result: Category-specific prompts improve ROUGE-1 recall by 8.3%, while stylistic refinement considerably boosts BLEU (40-48%) and ROUGE (25-27%) scores.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates that combining figure-related context with author-specific writing styles leads to improved scientific figure captions that balance accuracy and stylistic fidelity.

Abstract: Scientific figure captions require both accuracy and stylistic consistency to
convey visual information. Here, we present a domain-specific caption
generation system for the 3rd SciCap Challenge that integrates figure-related
textual context with author-specific writing styles using the LaMP-Cap dataset.
Our approach uses a two-stage pipeline: Stage 1 combines context filtering,
category-specific prompt optimization via DSPy's MIPROv2 and SIMBA, and caption
candidate selection; Stage 2 applies few-shot prompting with profile figures
for stylistic refinement. Our experiments demonstrate that category-specific
prompts outperform both zero-shot and general optimized approaches, improving
ROUGE-1 recall by +8.3\% while limiting precision loss to -2.8\% and BLEU-4
reduction to -10.9\%. Profile-informed stylistic refinement yields 40--48\%
gains in BLEU scores and 25--27\% in ROUGE. Overall, our system demonstrates
that combining contextual understanding with author-specific stylistic
adaptation can generate captions that are both scientifically accurate and
stylistically faithful to the source paper.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces MUSE, an agent framework that enables Large Language Models to learn from experience and continuously evolve for real-world tasks, achieving state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitation of LLM agents being static during test-time and incapable of learning from experience, which hinders their utility in long-term real-world applications.

Method: MUSE employs a hierarchical Memory Module where the agent reflects on its sub-task trajectories, converts them into structured experiences, and updates the memory to improve planning and execution for long-term tasks.

Result: MUSE outperformed previous state-of-the-art on the TAC benchmark using a lightweight model (Gemini-2.5 Flash). Experiments revealed enhanced task completion and generalization abilities, including zero-shot improvements on new tasks.

Conclusion: MUSE represents a significant advancement for AI agents, enabling continuous learning, self-evolution, and generalization, establishing a new paradigm for automation of real-world tasks.

Abstract: Large Language Models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across
diverse domains, yet significant challenges persist when deploying them as AI
agents for real-world long-horizon tasks. Existing LLM agents suffer from a
critical limitation: they are test-time static and cannot learn from
experience, lacking the ability to accumulate knowledge and continuously
improve on the job. To address this challenge, we propose MUSE, a novel agent
framework that introduces an experience-driven, self-evolving system centered
around a hierarchical Memory Module. MUSE organizes diverse levels of
experience and leverages them to plan and execute long-horizon tasks across
multiple applications. After each sub-task execution, the agent autonomously
reflects on its trajectory, converting the raw trajectory into structured
experience and integrating it back into the Memory Module. This mechanism
enables the agent to evolve beyond its static pretrained parameters, fostering
continuous learning and self-evolution. We evaluate MUSE on the long-horizon
productivity benchmark TAC. It achieves new SOTA performance by a significant
margin using only a lightweight Gemini-2.5 Flash model. Sufficient Experiments
demonstrate that as the agent autonomously accumulates experience, it exhibits
increasingly superior task completion capabilities, as well as robust
continuous learning and self-evolution capabilities. Moreover, the accumulated
experience from MUSE exhibits strong generalization properties, enabling
zero-shot improvement on new tasks. MUSE establishes a new paradigm for AI
agents capable of real-world productivity task automation.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper evaluates ChatGPT's Japanese-English translation capabilities, comparing sentence- and document-level translations, prompt designs, and versions against commercial systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess ChatGPT's potential and effectiveness as a translation tool compared to other commercial translation systems.

Method: Experiments were conducted using automatic and MQM-based human evaluations to compare simple/enhanced prompts, translation levels, and ChatGPT versions.

Result: Document-level translations surpass sentence-level ones with ChatGPT. Enhanced prompts showed no clear advantage. ChatGPT-3.5 excels in accuracy, while ChatGPT-4 is superior in fluency. ChatGPT performs competitively versus commercial systems.

Conclusion: ChatGPT demonstrates strong translation capabilities, especially at the document level, and provides competitive alternatives to existing translation software, despite disparities between fluency and accuracy across versions.

Abstract: This study investigates ChatGPT for Japanese-English translation, exploring
simple and enhanced prompts and comparing against commercially available
translation engines. Performing both automatic and MQM-based human evaluations,
we found that document-level translation outperforms sentence-level translation
for ChatGPT. On the other hand, we were not able to determine if enhanced
prompts performed better than simple prompts in our experiments. We also
discovered that ChatGPT-3.5 was preferred by automatic evaluation, but a
tradeoff exists between accuracy (ChatGPT-3.5) and fluency (ChatGPT-4). Lastly,
ChatGPT yields competitive results against two widely-known translation
systems.

### [136] [Climate Knowledge in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08043)
*Ivan Kuznetsov,Jacopo Grassi,Dmitrii Pantiukhin,Boris Shapkin,Thomas Jung,Nikolay Koldunov*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper assesses large language models' (LLMs) ability to recall climate normals globally, showing LLMs can recognize general climate patterns but struggle in regions like mountains and fail to represent local and regional climate-change dynamics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to evaluate the reliability and risk of misinformation in climate-related applications where LLMs are increasingly deployed, focusing on their ability to recall internal climatological knowledge.

Method: The authors queried LLMs about mean temperatures (e.g., July 2-m air temperature from 1991-2020) across a global grid, validating the responses against ERA5 reanalysis, and analyzed performance based on spatial and contextual features.

Result: LLMs captured broad climate characteristics with RMSE of 3-6°C but showed spatial biases, especially in mountains and high latitudes. Errors increased above 1500m, where RMSE reached 5-13°C. Including geographic context reduced errors by 27%. However, LLMs struggled to reproduce spatial patterns of long-term temperature changes.

Conclusion: While LLMs can encode general climate distribution patterns, they falter in representing nuanced regional climate dynamics and long-term shifts, raising limitations for climate-related use cases. The authors provide a benchmark to assess and improve parametric climate knowledge in LLMs.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed for climate-related
applications, where understanding internal climatological knowledge is crucial
for reliability and misinformation risk assessment. Despite growing adoption,
the capacity of LLMs to recall climate normals from parametric knowledge
remains largely uncharacterized. We investigate the capacity of contemporary
LLMs to recall climate normals without external retrieval, focusing on a
prototypical query: mean July 2-m air temperature 1991-2020 at specified
locations. We construct a global grid of queries at 1{\deg} resolution land
points, providing coordinates and location descriptors, and validate responses
against ERA5 reanalysis. Results show that LLMs encode non-trivial climate
structure, capturing latitudinal and topographic patterns, with
root-mean-square errors of 3-6 {\deg}C and biases of $\pm$1 {\deg}C. However,
spatially coherent errors remain, particularly in mountains and high latitudes.
Performance degrades sharply above 1500 m, where RMSE reaches 5-13 {\deg}C
compared to 2-4 {\deg}C at lower elevations. We find that including geographic
context (country, city, region) reduces errors by 27% on average, with larger
models being most sensitive to location descriptors. While models capture the
global mean magnitude of observed warming between 1950-1974 and 2000-2024, they
fail to reproduce spatial patterns of temperature change, which directly relate
to assessing climate change. This limitation highlights that while LLMs may
capture present-day climate distributions, they struggle to represent the
regional and local expression of long-term shifts in temperature essential for
understanding climate dynamics. Our evaluation framework provides a
reproducible benchmark for quantifying parametric climate knowledge in LLMs and
complements existing climate communication assessments.

TL;DR: This paper surveys Progress Reward Models (PRMs) as a method to evaluate and guide reasoning in Large Language Models (LLMs) at a trajectory level, addressing limitations of Outcome Reward Models (ORMs).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of traditional Outcome Reward Models (ORMs) that only judge final answers, by introducing and elaborating on Process Reward Models (PRMs) that evaluate reasoning at each step or trajectory.

Method: The paper provides a systematic overview of PRMs, focusing on generating process data, building PRMs, and their applications in test-time scaling and reinforcement learning.

Result: The authors summarize PRMs applications across various domains like math, code, text, multimodal reasoning, and robotics while highlighting emerging benchmarks.

Conclusion: PRMs offer a more fine-grained and effective approach to aligning LLMs with reasoning tasks, while the paper also identifies design spaces and open challenges for future research.

Abstract: Although Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit advanced reasoning ability,
conventional alignment remains largely dominated by outcome reward models
(ORMs) that judge only final answers. Process Reward Models(PRMs) address this
gap by evaluating and guiding reasoning at the step or trajectory level. This
survey provides a systematic overview of PRMs through the full loop: how to
generate process data, build PRMs, and use PRMs for test-time scaling and
reinforcement learning. We summarize applications across math, code, text,
multimodal reasoning, robotics, and agents, and review emerging benchmarks. Our
goal is to clarify design spaces, reveal open challenges, and guide future
research toward fine-grained, robust reasoning alignment.

*Shule Lu,Lingxiang Wang,Sijia Wen,Ziwei Wang,Hainan Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: FedDTRE is a federated learning strategy to improve dialogue systems by balancing model generalization and personalization through trustworthiness evaluation, effectively addressing privacy and device heterogeneity challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional training methods for dialogue systems struggle with privacy concerns and device heterogeneity. Federated learning offers a decentralized solution, but existing methods lack generalization and retain global information inadequately.

Method: FedDTRE uses an adaptive aggregation strategy that combines trustworthiness scores of global and local models, leveraging fairness-oriented evaluation datasets to adjust the global model's role during local updates.

Result: The approach improves dialogue model performance, enhances dialogue generation quality, and addresses overfitting and forgetting of global information.

Conclusion: FedDTRE effectively balances personalization and generalization in federated learning for dialogue systems, improving performance while addressing privacy and heterogeneity challenges.

Abstract: With the rapid development of artificial intelligence, dialogue systems have
become a prominent form of human-computer interaction. However, traditional
centralized or fully local training approaches face challenges in balancing
privacy preservation and personalization due to data privacy concerns and
heterogeneous device capabilities. Federated learning, as a representative
distributed paradigm, offers a promising solution. However, existing methods
often suffer from overfitting under limited client data and tend to forget
global information after multiple training rounds, leading to poor
generalization. To address these issues, we propose FedDTRE, a Federated
adaptive aggregation strategy for Dialogue generation based on Trustworthiness
Evaluation. Instead of directly replacing local models with the global model,
FedDTRE leverages trustworthiness scores of both global and local models on a
fairness-oriented evaluation dataset to dynamically regulate the global model's
contribution during local updates. Experimental results demonstrate that
FedDTRE can improve dialogue model performance and enhance the quality of
dialogue generation.

*Shramay Palta,Peter Rankel,Sarah Wiegreffe,Rachel Rudinger*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores how rationales generated by LLMs influence human plausibility judgments in commonsense reasoning tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand whether AI-generated rationales can significantly impact human decision-making and to study human cognition using LLMs.

Method: They collected 3,000 human plausibility judgments and 13,600 judgments from LLMs to analyze shifts in human ratings when exposed to AI-generated rationales.

Result: Human plausibility ratings increased or decreased based on exposure to PRO or CON arguments generated by LLMs, showing humans found these rationales persuasive.

Conclusion: LLMs can influence human beliefs significantly even in areas of human expertise like commonsense reasoning, highlighting both cognitive insights and potential risks.

Abstract: We investigate the degree to which human plausibility judgments of
multiple-choice commonsense benchmark answers are subject to influence by
(im)plausibility arguments for or against an answer, in particular, using
rationales generated by LLMs. We collect 3,000 plausibility judgments from
humans and another 13,600 judgments from LLMs. Overall, we observe increases
and decreases in mean human plausibility ratings in the presence of
LLM-generated PRO and CON rationales, respectively, suggesting that, on the
whole, human judges find these rationales convincing. Experiments with LLMs
reveal similar patterns of influence. Our findings demonstrate a novel use of
LLMs for studying aspects of human cognition, while also raising practical
concerns that, even in domains where humans are ``experts'' (i.e., common
sense), LLMs have the potential to exert considerable influence on people's
beliefs.

*Sherzod Hakimov,Roland Bernard,Tim Leiber,Karl Osswald,Kristina Richert,Ruilin Yang,Raffaella Bernardi,David Schlangen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper explores how reasoning in large language models (LLMs) affects negotiation performance across languages and setups, finding trade-offs between improved outcomes and high computational costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the challenge of enabling AI agents to excel in negotiation by evaluating the role of reasoning in their strategic and linguistic capabilities.

Method: A comprehensive, multilingual evaluation using self-play across dialogue games to assess the trade-offs in reasoning performance and adaptation of both commercial and open-weight LLMs.

Result: Reasoning improves outcomes, such as a 31.4% performance boost for GPT-5, but increases computational costs significantly, with distinct multilingual reasoning behaviors between open-weight and commercial models.

Conclusion: Scaling reasoning during test time enhances negotiation and collaboration but leads to higher costs and language inconsistencies, especially in open-weight models.

Abstract: Negotiation is a fundamental challenge for AI agents, as it requires an
ability to reason strategically, model opponents, and balance cooperation with
competition. We conduct the first comprehensive study systematically evaluating
the effect of (LLM-)reasoning on the negotiation abilities of both commercial
and open-weight LLMs, and do this across three languages. Using a self-play
setup across three diverse dialogue games, we analyse trade-offs between
performance and cost, the language consistency of reasoning processes, and the
nature of strategic adaptation exhibited by models. Our findings show that
enabling reasoning-that is, scaling test time compute-significantly improves
negotiation outcomes by enhancing collaboration and helping models overcome
task complexities, but comes at a substantial computational cost: reasoning
improves GPT-5's performance by 31.4 % while increasing its cost by nearly 400
%. Most critically, we uncover a significant multilingual reasoning
distinction: open-weight models consistently switch to English for their
internal reasoning steps, even when negotiating in German or Italian (and thus
possibly impacting potential explainability gains through the disclosure of
reasoning traces), while leading commercial models maintain language
consistency between their reasoning and final output.

*Haoyang Gui,Thales Bertaglia,Taylor Annabell,Catalina Goanta,Tjomme Dooper,Gerasimos Spanakis*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper evaluates how large language models (GPT-5-Nano and Gemini-2.5-Flash-Lite) classify Instagram posts as sponsored or not while addressing legal reasoning and transparency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in enforcing transparency regulations in influencer marketing, which often blurs the line between organic and sponsored content.

Method: The study compares two LLMs under three prompting strategies with legal knowledge control, using 1,143 Instagram posts, and develops a taxonomy of reasoning errors.

Result: Both LLMs perform well in classifying sponsored vs. non-sponsored content with F1 scores up to 0.93. The accuracy drops significantly in ambiguous cases, and types of reasoning errors are identified.

Conclusion: Adding regulatory text to prompts improves explanation quality but inconsistently boosts detection accuracy. Insights are provided for improving automated moderation technology grounded in legal reasoning.

Abstract: The rise of influencer marketing has blurred boundaries between organic
content and sponsored content, making the enforcement of legal rules relating
to transparency challenging. Effective regulation requires applying legal
knowledge with a clear purpose and reason, yet current detection methods of
undisclosed sponsored content generally lack legal grounding or operate as
opaque "black boxes". Using 1,143 Instagram posts, we compare gpt-5-nano and
gemini-2.5-flash-lite under three prompting strategies with controlled levels
of legal knowledge provided. Both models perform strongly in classifying
content as sponsored or not (F1 up to 0.93), though performance drops by over
10 points on ambiguous cases. We further develop a taxonomy of reasoning
errors, showing frequent citation omissions (28.57%), unclear references
(20.71%), and hidden ads exhibiting the highest miscue rate (28.57%). While
adding regulatory text to the prompt improves explanation quality, it does not
consistently improve detection accuracy. The contribution of this paper is
threefold. First, it makes a novel addition to regulatory compliance technology
by providing a taxonomy of common errors in LLM-generated legal reasoning to
evaluate whether automated moderation is not only accurate but also legally
robust, thereby advancing the transparent detection of influencer marketing
content. Second, it features an original dataset of LLM explanations annotated
by two students who were trained in influencer marketing law. Third, it
combines quantitative and qualitative evaluation strategies for LLM
explanations and critically reflects on how these findings can support
advertising regulatory bodies in automating moderation processes on a solid
legal foundation.

*Jasmina Gajcin,Erik Miehling,Rahul Nair,Elizabeth Daly,Radu Marinescu,Seshu Tirupathi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces an approach called GloVE to analyze LLM-as-a-Judge decisions by extracting global policies and evaluating their robustness and user perception.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the risks and biases when using LLMs as judges for evaluating text at scale, replacing human annotations.

Method: It proposes two key algorithms: CLoVE for generating local, concept-based explanations and GloVE for clustering and summarizing these local rules into a cohesive global policy.

Result: The global policies generated by GloVE aligned closely with the original LLM decisions, showed resilience to disturbances, and were positively received in user studies.

Conclusion: The approach creates more interpretable and reliable explanations for LLM-based judgments, reducing potential risks and improving user trust.

Abstract: Using LLMs to evaluate text, that is, LLM-as-a-judge, is increasingly being
used at scale to augment or even replace human annotations. As such, it is
imperative that we understand the potential biases and risks of doing so. In
this work, we propose an approach for extracting high-level concept-based
global policies from LLM-as-a-Judge. Our approach consists of two algorithms:
1) CLoVE (Contrastive Local Verifiable Explanations), which generates
verifiable, concept-based, contrastive local explanations and 2) GloVE (Global
Verifiable Explanations), which uses iterative clustering, summarization and
verification to condense local rules into a global policy. We evaluate GloVE on
seven standard benchmarking datasets for content harm detection. We find that
the extracted global policies are highly faithful to decisions of the
LLM-as-a-Judge. Additionally, we evaluated the robustness of global policies to
text perturbations and adversarial attacks. Finally, we conducted a user study
to evaluate user understanding and satisfaction with global policies.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper presents Genii, an unsupervised multi-agent framework addressing judgment bias in large language models during evaluations, outperforming supervised models without needing human annotation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the judgment preference bias in LLM-based evaluation systems, particularly the tendency for models to favor their own responses, undermining reliability.

Method: Introduced the Group-Based Polling Optimization (Genii), a multi-agent collaborative system simulating client-server interactions for unsupervised optimization of judgment models.

Result: Experiments showed that Genii surpasses supervised models across various scenarios, improving performance of diverse client agents and reducing bias effectively.

Conclusion: Genii offers a reliable and effective unsupervised solution for mitigating bias in LLM-based judgment models, outperforming methods requiring human-labeled data.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) as automatic evaluators, commonly referred to as
LLM-as-a-Judge, have also attracted growing attention. This approach plays a
vital role in aligning LLMs with human judgments, providing accurate and
reliable assessments. However, LLM-based judgment models often exhibit judgment
preference bias during the evaluation phase, tending to favor responses
generated by themselves, undermining the reliability of their judgments. This
paper introduces the Group-Based Polling Optimization (Genii), an unsupervised
multi-agent collaborative optimization framework that mitigates the inherent
judgment preference bias of judgment models. Specifically, Genii integrates
various LLM-based judgment models into a multi-agent system and simulates the
interactive client-server polling mechanism to optimize each client agent
unsupervisedly. Our experiments demonstrate that Genii outperforms supervised
models trained on annotated judgment data, while requiring no human-labeled
annotations. Genii consistently improves performance across different client
agents during the polling, even when weaker models act as server agents.
Further analysis reveals that Genii effectively mitigates judgment preference
bias of LLM-based judgment models, demonstrating its effectiveness. All codes

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces AI Knowledge Assist, a system that builds a company-specific knowledge base from historical customer-agent conversations to improve conversational AI capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The absence of a dedicated company-specific knowledge base is a barrier to integrating conversational AI systems in contact centers.

Method: The paper proposes AI Knowledge Assist, which extracts question-answer pairs from customer-agent conversations and fine-tunes a lightweight LLM, LLaMA-3.1-8B, using internal data.

Result: AI Knowledge Assist achieves over 90% accuracy in answering questions and outperforms larger closed-source LLMs during evaluations across 20 companies.

Conclusion: This system bridges the cold-start gap in contact centers and facilitates the immediate deployment of RAG-powered chatbots.

Abstract: The utilization of conversational AI systems by leveraging Retrieval
Augmented Generation (RAG) techniques to solve customer problems has been on
the rise with the rapid progress of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, the
absence of a company-specific dedicated knowledge base is a major barrier to
the integration of conversational AI systems in contact centers. To this end,
we introduce AI Knowledge Assist, a system that extracts knowledge in the form
of question-answer (QA) pairs from historical customer-agent conversations to
automatically build a knowledge base. Fine-tuning a lightweight LLM on internal
data demonstrates state-of-the-art performance, outperforming larger
closed-source LLMs. More specifically, empirical evaluation on 20 companies
demonstrates that the proposed AI Knowledge Assist system that leverages the
LLaMA-3.1-8B model eliminates the cold-start gap in contact centers by
achieving above 90% accuracy in answering information-seeking questions. This
enables immediate deployment of RAG-powered chatbots.

*Elena Khasanova,Harsh Saini,Md Tahmid Rahman Laskar,Xue-Yong Fu,Cheng Chen,Shashi Bhushan TN*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces DACIP-RC, a continual pre-training method to enhance smaller LLMs for business conversational tasks, addressing issues of high inference cost and poor generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Smaller LLMs, while efficient, lack robust zero-shot instruction-following abilities and generalization across domains, critical for dynamic user needs. Fine-tuning exacerbates this by causing catastrophic forgetting.

Method: DACIP-RC employs continual pre-training on business conversational data using reading comprehension to generate diverse tasks and responses, improving instruction-following capabilities.

Result: Empirical evaluations show that DACIP-RC improves zero-shot generalization for various tasks like meeting summarization and call purpose identification, showcasing its effectiveness on business conversational data.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates that DACIP-RC effectively enhances smaller LLMs' domain adaptability while maintaining efficiency. It presents a novel approach for leveraging proprietary datasets in industrial applications.

Abstract: The rapid advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have enabled their
adoption in real-world industrial scenarios for various natural language
processing tasks. However, the high inference cost of large-scale LLMs makes
their deployment impractical, necessitating the use of smaller models. Despite
their efficiency, smaller LLMs lack robust zero-shot instruction-following
capabilities across diverse domains, limiting their adaptability to dynamic
user requirements. Traditional fine-tuning approaches exacerbate this issue by
inducing catastrophic forgetting, reducing the model's generalization ability
for unseen tasks. In this paper, we propose Domain Adaptive Continual
Instruction Pre-Training via Reading Comprehension (DACIP-RC), a continual
pre-training technique that enhances smaller LLMs' domain adaptability for
business conversational tasks. Unlike conventional pre-training approaches that
rely on next-token prediction, DACIP-RC generates diverse task instructions and
responses via reading comprehension on conversation transcripts, enabling
better instruction generalization. Our empirical evaluations demonstrate that
DACIP-RC significantly improves zero-shot generalization across a wide range of
business conversational tasks, including meeting summarization, action item
generation, and call purpose identification. To the best of our knowledge, this
is the first work to apply instruction pre-training on business conversational
data, providing insights into how industries can leverage proprietary datasets
for domain adaptation.

### [146] [Beyond Over-Refusal: Scenario-Based Diagnostics and Post-Hoc Mitigation for Exaggerated Refusals in LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08158)
*Shuzhou Yuan,Ercong Nie,Yinuo Sun,Chenxuan Zhao,William LaCroix,Michael Färber*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper addresses the issue of false refusals in large language models, introducing benchmarks and lightweight mitigation strategies to improve compliance without compromising safety.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: False refusals occur when LLMs reject safe queries due to overly cautious safety mechanisms. The paper aims to enhance these models' response calibration without compromising their safety standards.

Method: Two benchmarks are introduced: XSB for single-turn prompts and MS-XSB for multi-turn dialogues. Lightweight mitigation strategies, like ignore-word instructions, prompt rephrasing, and attention steering, are applied during inference without retraining the models.

Result: Experiments on four Llama models show improved compliance with safe prompts while maintaining safety protections, using the proposed methods and benchmarks.

Conclusion: The paper establishes a reproducible framework to diagnose and address exaggerated refusals, paving the way for safer and more effective deployment of LLMs.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) frequently produce false refusals, declining
benign requests that contain terms resembling unsafe queries. We address this
challenge by introducing two comprehensive benchmarks: the Exaggerated Safety
Benchmark (XSB) for single-turn prompts, annotated with "Focus" keywords that
identify refusal-inducing triggers, and the Multi-turn Scenario-based
Exaggerated Safety Benchmark (MS-XSB), which systematically evaluates refusal
calibration in realistic, context-rich dialog settings. Our benchmarks reveal
that exaggerated refusals persist across diverse recent LLMs and are especially
pronounced in complex, multi-turn scenarios. To mitigate these failures, we
leverage post-hoc explanation methods to identify refusal triggers and deploy
three lightweight, model-agnostic approaches, ignore-word instructions, prompt
rephrasing, and attention steering, at inference time, all without retraining
or parameter access. Experiments on four instruction-tuned Llama models
demonstrate that these strategies substantially improve compliance on safe
prompts while maintaining robust safety protections. Our findings establish a
reproducible framework for diagnosing and mitigating exaggerated refusals,
highlighting practical pathways to safer and more helpful LLM deployments.

*Jian Xie,Zhendong Chu,Aoxiao Zhong,Kai Zhang,Mingzhe Han,Xin Fang,Jialie Shen,Qingsong Wen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces ARM2, a unified model designed to tackle the 'over-thinking' problem of Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) by balancing reasoning performance and efficiency using reinforcement learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the inefficiency and task-specific nature of existing strategies, like length penalties, in mitigating the over-thinking issue in LRMs.

Method: ARM2 utilizes a reinforcement learning framework with length-aware optimization, integrates vision understanding for multimodal capabilities, and incorporates executable code for reasoning.

Result: ARM2 demonstrates comparable performance to traditional reasoning models while reducing token usage by over 70% on average.

Conclusion: ARM2 provides an effective and generalizable approach for adaptive reasoning, significantly reducing inefficiencies without compromising task performance.

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) often suffer from the ``over-thinking''
problem, generating unnecessarily long reasoning on simple tasks. Some
strategies have been proposed to mitigate this issue, such as length penalties
or routing mechanisms, but they are typically heuristic and task-specific,
lacking a general framework for adaptive reasoning. In this paper, we present
ARM2, a unified model that adaptively balances reasoning performance and
efficiency across multiple formats through a reinforcement learning framework
augmented with length-aware optimization. Beyond conventional natural language
inference, ARM2 integrates vision understanding, extending its applicability to
multimodal. Moreover, ARM2 integrates executable code into reasoning, enabling
substantial reductions in token cost while preserving task performance compared
to long CoT. Experiments demonstrate that ARM2 achieves performance on par with
traditional reasoning models trained with GRPO, while reducing token usage by
over 70% on average. We further conduct extensive analyses to validate the
effectiveness of ARM2 and the soundness of its design.

*Chalamalasetti Kranti,Sowmya Vajjala*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces MetricalARGS, a taxonomy aimed at evaluating Large Language Models (LLMs) on metrical poetry through Analysis, Retrieval, Generation, and Support tasks, with Telugu as a case study language.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to explore the capabilities of LLMs in handling intricate constraints and rules of metrical poetry, which represent an advanced form of language understanding and reasoning.

Method: The authors create MetricalARGS, a taxonomy of tasks tailored to evaluate NLP performance on metrical poetry, mapping it to datasets and metrics. Telugu is used as a primary language to apply and validate the taxonomy.

Result: The paper demonstrates the viability of the MetricalARGS framework in assessing LLM capabilities in metrical poetry using Telugu, thus establishing the relevance of the framework across multi-dimensional NLP tasks.

Conclusion: The study positions MetricalARGS as a novel probe to better understand the language competencies and limitations of LLMs through a structured exploration of metrical poetry.

Abstract: Prior NLP work studying poetry has focused primarily on automatic poem
generation and summarization. Many languages have well-studied traditions of
poetic meter which enforce constraints on a poem in terms of syllable and
phoneme patterns. Such advanced literary forms offer opportunities for probing
deeper reasoning and language understanding in Large Language Models (LLMs) and
their ability to follow strict pre-requisites and rules. In this paper, we
introduce MetricalARGS, the first taxonomy of poetry-related NLP tasks designed
to evaluate LLMs on metrical poetry across four dimensions: Analysis,
Retrieval, Generation, and Support. We discuss how these tasks relate to
existing NLP tasks, addressing questions around datasets and evaluation
metrics. Taking Telugu as our example language, we illustrate how the taxonomy
can be used in practice. MetricalARGS highlights the broader possibilities for
understanding the capabilities and limitations of today's LLMs through the lens
of metrical poetry.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces Training-Free Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), a lightweight approach to improve LLM agent performance without the need for parameter updates, relying instead on experiential token priors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address challenges in LLM performance in specialized domains due to difficulties in integrating external tools and specific prompting strategies.

Method: The proposed Training-Free GRPO distills experiential knowledge using token priors, leveraging group relative semantic advantages during multi-epoch learning without requiring parameter updates.

Result: Experiments demonstrate that Training-Free GRPO improves out-of-domain performance in tasks like mathematical reasoning and web searching, outperforming fine-tuned small LLMs with minimal training samples.

Conclusion: Training-Free GRPO is an effective and cost-efficient alternative to traditional fine-tuning methods for enhancing LLM agent performance in specialized domains.

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Language Model (LLM) agents have demonstrated their
promising general capabilities. However, their performance in specialized
real-world domains often degrades due to challenges in effectively integrating
external tools and specific prompting strategies. While methods like agentic
reinforcement learning have been proposed to address this, they typically rely
on costly parameter updates, for example, through a process that uses
Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) followed by a Reinforcement Learning (RL) phase
with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to alter the output
distribution. However, we argue that LLMs can achieve a similar effect on the
output distribution by learning experiential knowledge as a token prior, which
is a far more lightweight approach that not only addresses practical data
scarcity but also avoids the common issue of overfitting. To this end, we
propose Training-Free Group Relative Policy Optimization (Training-Free GRPO),
a cost-effective solution that enhances LLM agent performance without any
parameter updates. Our method leverages the group relative semantic advantage
instead of numerical ones within each group of rollouts, iteratively distilling
high-quality experiential knowledge during multi-epoch learning on a minimal
ground-truth data. Such knowledge serves as the learned token prior, which is
seamlessly integrated during LLM API calls to guide model behavior. Experiments
on mathematical reasoning and web searching tasks demonstrate that
Training-Free GRPO, when applied to DeepSeek-V3.1-Terminus, significantly
improves out-of-domain performance. With just a few dozen training samples,
Training-Free GRPO outperforms fine-tuned small LLMs with marginal training
data and cost.

### [150] [Memory Retrieval and Consolidation in Large Language Models through Function Tokens](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08203)
*Shaohua Zhang,Yuan Lin,Hang Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Large language models use function tokens to activate predictive features for memory retrieval and consolidation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The mechanisms behind memory retrieval and consolidation in large language models are not well understood.

Method: The study proposes the function token hypothesis, identifies function tokens as key activators of predictive features, and examines them using bipartite graph analysis and case studies.

Result: Function tokens activate the most predictive features during inference, dominate training loss, and contribute heavily to feature selection during pre-training.

Conclusion: Function tokens play a central role in the memory mechanism of LLMs by enabling predictive feature activation and learning during pre-training.

Abstract: The remarkable success of large language models (LLMs) stems from their
ability to consolidate vast amounts of knowledge into the memory during
pre-training and to retrieve it from the memory during inference, enabling
advanced capabilities such as knowledge memorization, instruction-following and
reasoning. However, the mechanisms of memory retrieval and consolidation in
LLMs remain poorly understood. In this paper, we propose the function token
hypothesis to explain the workings of LLMs: During inference, function tokens
activate the most predictive features from context and govern next token
prediction (memory retrieval). During pre-training, predicting the next tokens
(usually content tokens) that follow function tokens increases the number of
learned features of LLMs and updates the model parameters (memory
consolidation). Function tokens here roughly correspond to function words in
linguistics, including punctuation marks, articles, prepositions, and
conjunctions, in contrast to content tokens. We provide extensive experimental
evidence supporting this hypothesis. Using bipartite graph analysis, we show
that a small number of function tokens activate the majority of features. Case
studies further reveal how function tokens activate the most predictive
features from context to direct next token prediction. We also find that during
pre-training, the training loss is dominated by predicting the next content
tokens following function tokens, which forces the function tokens to select
the most predictive features from context.

*XuHao Hu,Peng Wang,Xiaoya Lu,Dongrui Liu,Xuanjing Huang,Jing Shao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Fine-tuning LLMs with misaligned data causes them to exhibit dishonest and deceptive behaviors, even with small amounts of such data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Explore whether emergent misalignment extends to dishonesty and deception in high-stakes scenarios, beyond previously studied safety behaviors.

Method: Fine-tuned open-source LLMs on misaligned completions across diverse domains and examined their behavior under combined finetuning and simulated human-AI interactions.

Result: LLMs demonstrated dishonest behavior with just 1% misaligned data reducing honesty by over 20%. Also, 10% biased users caused unintentional misalignment.

Conclusion: Emergent misalignment can manifest in dishonesty and deception, not only due to direct finetuning but also through mixed data tasks and biased user interactions.

Abstract: Previous research has shown that LLMs finetuned on malicious or incorrect
completions within narrow domains (e.g., insecure code or incorrect medical
advice) can become broadly misaligned to exhibit harmful behaviors, which is
called emergent misalignment. In this work, we investigate whether this
phenomenon can extend beyond safety behaviors to a broader spectrum of
dishonesty and deception under high-stakes scenarios (e.g., lying under
pressure and deceptive behavior). To explore this, we finetune open-sourced
LLMs on misaligned completions across diverse domains. Experimental results
demonstrate that LLMs show broadly misaligned behavior in dishonesty.
Additionally, we further explore this phenomenon in a downstream combined
finetuning setting, and find that introducing as little as 1% of misalignment
data into a standard downstream task is sufficient to decrease honest behavior
over 20%. Furthermore, we consider a more practical human-AI interaction
environment where we simulate both benign and biased users to interact with the
assistant LLM. Notably, we find that the assistant can be misaligned
unintentionally to exacerbate its dishonesty with only 10% biased user
population. In summary, we extend the study of emergent misalignment to the
domain of dishonesty and deception under high-stakes scenarios, and demonstrate
that this risk arises not only through direct finetuning, but also in
downstream mixture tasks and practical human-AI interactions.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces SenWave, a sentiment analysis dataset focused on COVID-19 tweets, which supports fine-grained analysis in multiple languages.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges of limited labeled datasets and coarse-grained sentiment labels for understanding public sentiment during complex events like the COVID-19 pandemic.

Method: Development of SenWave, a multi-language dataset with annotated tweets and fine-tuned transformer-based language models for sentiment classification.

Result: The dataset includes annotated tweets in English and Arabic, translated tweets in other languages, and over 105 million unlabeled tweets enabling advanced sentiment analysis.

Conclusion: SenWave provides a robust framework for fine-grained sentiment analysis, enhancing research on public reactions during major events globally.

Abstract: The global impact of the COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the need for a
comprehensive understanding of public sentiment and reactions. Despite the
availability of numerous public datasets on COVID-19, some reaching volumes of
up to 100 billion data points, challenges persist regarding the availability of
labeled data and the presence of coarse-grained or inappropriate sentiment
labels. In this paper, we introduce SenWave, a novel fine-grained
multi-language sentiment analysis dataset specifically designed for analyzing
COVID-19 tweets, featuring ten sentiment categories across five languages. The
dataset comprises 10,000 annotated tweets each in English and Arabic, along
with 30,000 translated tweets in Spanish, French, and Italian, derived from
English tweets. Additionally, it includes over 105 million unlabeled tweets
collected during various COVID-19 waves. To enable accurate fine-grained
sentiment classification, we fine-tuned pre-trained transformer-based language
models using the labeled tweets. Our study provides an in-depth analysis of the
evolving emotional landscape across languages, countries, and topics, revealing
significant insights over time. Furthermore, we assess the compatibility of our
dataset with ChatGPT, demonstrating its robustness and versatility in various
applications. Our dataset and accompanying code are publicly accessible on the
repository\footnote{https://github.com/gitdevqiang/SenWave}. We anticipate that
this work will foster further exploration into fine-grained sentiment analysis
for complex events within the NLP community, promoting more nuanced
understanding and research innovations.

*Tim Hagen,Niklas Deckers,Felix Wolter,Harrisen Scells,Martin Potthast*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces a new dataset that incorporates counterclaims (concausal statements) into causality extraction tasks, addressing the limitation of existing datasets that only focus on procausal claims.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study was driven by the absence of counterclaims (concausality) in existing causality extraction datasets, leading to incomplete modeling of causal reasoning.

Method: The authors conducted a literature review, developed annotation guidelines, and augmented the Causal News Corpus with concausal statements, achieving high inter-annotator agreement.

Result: The augmented dataset enabled improved classification of concausal statements, mitigating the misclassification of concausal relationships as procausal by transformer models trained on previous datasets.

Conclusion: Incorporating concausality is crucial for advancing causality extraction models, as it ensures better understanding of both supportive and refutative causal claims.

Abstract: Research on causality extraction from text has so far almost entirely
neglected counterclaims. Existing causality extraction datasets focus solely on
"procausal" claims, i.e., statements that support a relationship. "Concausal"
claims, i.e., statements that refute a relationship, are entirely ignored or
even accidentally annotated as procausal. We address this shortcoming by
developing a new dataset that integrates concausality. Based on an extensive
literature review, we first show that concausality is an integral part of
causal reasoning on incomplete knowledge. We operationalize this theory in the
form of a rigorous guideline for annotation and then augment the Causal News
Corpus with concausal statements, obtaining a substantial inter-annotator
agreement of Cohen's $\kappa=0.74$. To demonstrate the importance of
integrating concausal statements, we show that models trained without concausal
relationships tend to misclassify these as procausal instead. Based on our new
dataset, this mistake can be mitigated, enabling transformers to effectively
distinguish pro- and concausality.

TL;DR: The paper introduces WaltzRL, a multi-agent reinforcement learning framework to balance helpfulness and harmlessness in LLMs by reducing unsafe responses and overrefusals while preserving their general capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the challenge of balancing helpfulness and harmlessness in large language models (LLMs), which often suffer from vulnerability to adversarial attacks and excessive refusal of sensitive but benign prompts.

Method: WaltzRL trains two agents: a conversation agent and a feedback agent. The feedback agent offers guidance to improve safety and helpfulness in conversations. A Dynamic Improvement Reward (DIR) evolves based on how well the feedback enhances the conversation agent's responses.

Result: Experiments show significant reductions in unsafe responses (e.g., from 39.0% to 4.6% on WildJailbreak) and overrefusals (e.g., from 45.3% to 9.9% on OR-Bench), outperforming existing baselines.

Conclusion: WaltzRL improves LLM safety and refines their ability to give nuanced responses. It advances both helpfulness and harmlessness without compromising general capabilities.

Abstract: Harnessing the power of LLMs requires a delicate dance between being helpful
and harmless. This creates a fundamental tension between two competing
challenges: vulnerability to adversarial attacks that elicit unsafe content,
and a tendency for overrefusal on benign but sensitive prompts. Current
approaches often navigate this dance with safeguard models that completely
reject any content that contains unsafe portions. This approach cuts the music
entirely-it may exacerbate overrefusals and fails to provide nuanced guidance
for queries it refuses. To teach models a more coordinated choreography, we
propose WaltzRL, a novel multi-agent reinforcement learning framework that
formulates safety alignment as a collaborative, positive-sum game. WaltzRL
jointly trains a conversation agent and a feedback agent, where the latter is
incentivized to provide useful suggestions that improve the safety and
helpfulness of the conversation agent's responses. At the core of WaltzRL is a
Dynamic Improvement Reward (DIR) that evolves over time based on how well the
conversation agent incorporates the feedback. At inference time, unsafe or
overrefusing responses from the conversation agent are improved rather than
discarded. The feedback agent is deployed together with the conversation agent
and only engages adaptively when needed, preserving helpfulness and low latency
on safe queries. Our experiments, conducted across five diverse datasets,
demonstrate that WaltzRL significantly reduces both unsafe responses (e.g.,
from 39.0% to 4.6% on WildJailbreak) and overrefusals (from 45.3% to 9.9% on
OR-Bench) compared to various baselines. By enabling the conversation and
feedback agents to co-evolve and adaptively apply feedback, WaltzRL enhances
LLM safety without degrading general capabilities, thereby advancing the Pareto
front between helpfulness and harmlessness.

*Jannek Ulm,Kevin Du,Vésteinn Snæbjarnarson*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Synthetic data generated via language models, particularly using contrastive decoding, can enhance performance in language modeling and various tasks, especially those requiring reasoning skills.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address concerns about the potential limits of real-world textual data for training large language models (LLMs), and explore synthetic data as a viable alternative.

Method: Utilize contrastive decoding to amplify signals between good and bad models, thereby generating a synthetic corpus. Mix this synthetic data with original training data and evaluate its impact.

Result: Training with a mix of synthetic and real data enhances performance on language modeling and downstream tasks. Synthetic data generated via contrastive decoding improves reasoning-related tasks, while traditional sampling supports surface-level linguistic skills.

Conclusion: Incorporating synthetic data, particularly from contrastive decoding, can effectively complement real-world data for training LLMs, improving their broader capabilities.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are trained on huge amounts of textual data, and
concerns have been raised that the limits of such data may soon be reached. A
potential solution is to train on synthetic data sampled from LLMs. In this
work, we build on this idea and investigate the benefits of contrastive
decoding for generating synthetic corpora. In a controlled setting, we
experiment with sampling corpora using the relative difference between a good
and bad model trained on the same original corpus of 100 million words. By
amplifying the signal from a model that has better performance, we create a
synthetic corpus and mix it with the original training data. Our findings show
that training on a mixture of synthesized and real data improves performance on
the language modeling objective and a range of downstream tasks. In particular,
we see that training with a mix of synthetic data from contrastive decoding
benefits tasks that require more reasoning skills, while synthetic data from
traditional sampling helps more on tasks dependent on surface level linguistic
capabilities.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the limitations of current reasoning models in handling long-horizon multi-turn interactions and context management.

Method: Introduced DeepMiner with reverse construction for creating challenging and reliable training data, combined with dynamic context management utilizing sliding window mechanisms.

Result: DeepMiner achieves 33.5% accuracy on BrowseComp-en, surpassing previous models by 20 percentage points, and shows improvements across other benchmarks. Enables nearly 100 turns of sustained interaction.

Conclusion: DeepMiner efficiently enhances multi-turn reasoning capabilities while solving context limitations through innovative training and management strategies.

Abstract: While recent advances in reasoning models have demonstrated cognitive
behaviors through reinforcement learning, existing approaches struggle to
invoke deep reasoning capabilities in multi-turn agents with long-horizon
interactions. We propose DeepMiner, a novel framework that elicits such
abilities by introducing high-difficulty training tasks and dynamic context
window. DeepMiner presents a reverse construction method to generate complex
but verifiable question-answer pairs from authentic web sources, which ensures
the challenge and reliability of training data while injecting cognitive
capabilities into multi-turn reasoning scenarios. We further design an elegant
yet effective dynamic context management strategy for both training and
inference, utilizing sliding window mechanisms while eliminating the dependency
on external summarization models, thereby efficiently empowering the model to
handle continuously expanding long-horizon contexts. Through reinforcement
learning on Qwen3-32B, we develop DeepMiner-32B, which achieves substantial
performance improvements across multiple search agent benchmarks. DeepMiner
attains 33.5% accuracy on BrowseComp-en, surpassing the previous best
open-source agent by almost 20 percentage points, and demonstrates consistent
improvements on BrowseComp-zh, XBench-DeepSearch, and GAIA. Notably, our
dynamic context management enables sustained interactions of nearly 100 turns
within standard 32k context length, effectively addressing the context
limitations that constrain existing multi-turn interaction systems.

### [157] [Neuron-Level Analysis of Cultural Understanding in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08284)
*Taisei Yamamoto,Ryoma Kumon,Danushka Bollegala,Hitomi Yanaka*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a neuron-level analysis to identify the role of neurons in cultural understanding within large language models (LLMs). It finds that a small set of neurons is responsible for cultural behaviors and offers methodologies to refine and validate them.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the issue of cultural bias and limited awareness of underrepresented cultures in LLMs while understanding the underlying mechanisms of cultural comprehension in these models.

Method: The authors used a gradient-based scoring method combined with additional filtering to identify culture-general and culture-specific neurons that drive cultural behaviors. They analyzed their distribution, roles, and importance through suppression experiments.

Result: Only a small fraction (<1%) of neurons were identified as responsible for cultural behavior, primarily located in shallow to middle MLP layers. Suppressing these neurons degrades cultural benchmark performance by up to 30% without significantly impacting general NLU benchmarks.

Conclusion: The study advances the understanding of cultural mechanisms in LLMs, emphasizing the significance of specialized neurons and their impact. It also cautions that training on general NLU tasks can harm cultural understanding, offering insights into model training and development.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed worldwide, ensuring
their fair and comprehensive cultural understanding is important. However, LLMs
exhibit cultural bias and limited awareness of underrepresented cultures, while
the mechanisms underlying their cultural understanding remain underexplored. To
fill this gap, we conduct a neuron-level analysis to identify neurons that
drive cultural behavior, introducing a gradient-based scoring method with
additional filtering for precise refinement. We identify both culture-general
neurons contributing to cultural understanding regardless of cultures, and
culture-specific neurons tied to an individual culture. These neurons account
for less than 1% of all neurons and are concentrated in shallow to middle MLP
layers. We validate their role by showing that suppressing them substantially
degrades performance on cultural benchmarks (by up to 30%), while performance
on general natural language understanding (NLU) benchmarks remains largely
unaffected. Moreover, we show that culture-specific neurons support knowledge
of not only the target culture, but also related cultures. Finally, we
demonstrate that training on NLU benchmarks can diminish models' cultural
understanding when we update modules containing many culture-general neurons.
These findings provide insights into the internal mechanisms of LLMs and offer
practical guidance for model training and engineering. Our code is available at

### [158] [AutoRed: A Free-form Adversarial Prompt Generation Framework for Automated Red Teaming](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08329)
*Muxi Diao,Yutao Mou,Keqing He,Hanbo Song,Lulu Zhao,Shikun Zhang,Wei Ye,Kongming Liang,Zhanyu Ma*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study presents AutoRed, a framework for generating diverse adversarial prompts to improve the safety evaluation of Large Language Models (LLMs).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the semantic limitations of existing seed-based adversarial prompt generation methods for ensuring LLM safety.

Method: AutoRed generates prompts in two stages: persona-guided adversarial instruction creation and iterative refinement via a reflection loop. It includes a prompt verifier to assess harmfulness without querying the target models.

Result: AutoRed leads to increased attack success rates, better generalization, and the creation of two datasets, AutoRed-Medium and AutoRed-Hard, for LLM safety evaluation.

Conclusion: AutoRed surpasses seed-based methods, demonstrating significant advantages in free-form adversarial prompt generation and emphasizing the potential of this approach for enhancing LLM safety.

Abstract: The safety of Large Language Models (LLMs) is crucial for the development of
trustworthy AI applications. Existing red teaming methods often rely on seed
instructions, which limits the semantic diversity of the synthesized
adversarial prompts. We propose AutoRed, a free-form adversarial prompt
generation framework that removes the need for seed instructions. AutoRed
operates in two stages: (1) persona-guided adversarial instruction generation,
and (2) a reflection loop to iteratively refine low-quality prompts. To improve
efficiency, we introduce a verifier to assess prompt harmfulness without
querying the target models. Using AutoRed, we build two red teaming datasets --
AutoRed-Medium and AutoRed-Hard -- and evaluate eight state-of-the-art LLMs.
AutoRed achieves higher attack success rates and better generalization than
existing baselines. Our results highlight the limitations of seed-based
approaches and demonstrate the potential of free-form red teaming for LLM
safety evaluation. We will open source our datasets in the near future.

*Yukai Song,Pengfei Zhou,César Escobar-Viera,Candice Biernesser,Wei Huang,Jingtong Hu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper addresses identifying suicidal ideation on social media, proposing a two-stage model that combines BERT and LLMs for detection, balancing accuracy and computational efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rise in global suicide rates and the preference of at-risk individuals to express distress indirectly on social media highlight the need for efficient detection methods.

Method: A two-stage voting architecture: Stage 1 uses a lightweight BERT classifier for explicit detection; Stage 2 employs either LLM voting or feature-based ML ensemble leveraging LLM-extracted psychological features for ambiguous inputs.

Result: Achieved high F1 scores: 98.0% for explicit cases and 99.7% for implicit ones, with reduced computational costs and minimized domain gaps.

Conclusion: The framework shows promise in detecting explicit and implicit suicide risks efficiently, operationalizing LLM-based psychological indicators for improved detection and usability.

Abstract: Suicide rates have risen worldwide in recent years, underscoring the urgent
need for proactive prevention strategies. Social media provides valuable
signals, as many at-risk individuals - who often avoid formal help due to
stigma - choose instead to share their distress online. Yet detecting implicit
suicidal ideation, conveyed indirectly through metaphor, sarcasm, or subtle
emotional cues, remains highly challenging. Lightweight models like BERT handle
explicit signals but fail on subtle implicit ones, while large language models
(LLMs) capture nuance at prohibitive computational cost. To address this gap,
we propose a two-stage voting architecture that balances efficiency and
robustness. In Stage 1, a lightweight BERT classifier rapidly resolves
high-confidence explicit cases. In Stage 2, ambiguous inputs are escalated to
either (i) a multi-perspective LLM voting framework to maximize recall on
implicit ideation, or (ii) a feature-based ML ensemble guided by
psychologically grounded indicators extracted via prompt-engineered LLMs for
efficiency and interpretability. To the best of our knowledge, this is among
the first works to operationalize LLM-extracted psychological features as
structured vectors for suicide risk detection. On two complementary datasets -
explicit-dominant Reddit and implicit-only DeepSuiMind - our framework
outperforms single-model baselines, achieving 98.0% F1 on explicit cases, 99.7%
on implicit ones, and reducing the cross-domain gap below 2%, while
significantly lowering LLM cost.

### [160] [On the Relationship Between the Choice of Representation and In-Context Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08372)
*Ioana Marinescu,Kyunghyun Cho,Eric Karl Oermann*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study investigates how the representation of labels in in-context learning (ICL) impacts baseline accuracy, and how additional demonstrations improve on this baseline independently.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the interaction between label representations and the learning capacity in in-context learning, addressing previous mixed observations and gaps in understanding.

Method: An optimization algorithm was developed to enumerate various label representations, followed by experiments using varying numbers of in-context demonstrations to analyze their effects on learning.

Result: Learning occurs regardless of label quality, but efficiency depends on label set quality and the language model's size. Representations determine baseline accuracy, maintaining relative quality through additional learning.

Conclusion: Label representation and in-context learning effects are largely independent, revealing deeper insights about their orthogonality and impact on ICL performance.

Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) is the ability of a large language model (LLM) to
learn a new task from a few demonstrations presented as part of the context.
Past studies have attributed a large portion of the success of ICL to the way
these in-context demonstrations are represented, particularly to how labels are
represented in classification tasks. On the other hand, observations of the
learning capacity of ICL (i.e., the extent to which more in-context
demonstrations can lead to higher performance) have been mixed, and ICL is
often thought to occur only under specific conditions. The interaction between
these two aspects in ICL, representation and learning, has not been studied in
depth until now. We hypothesize that they are largely independent of one
another, such that the representation of demonstrations determines the baseline
accuracy of ICL, while learning from additional demonstrations improves only on
top of this baseline. We validate this hypothesis by developing an optimization
algorithm that can enumerate a spectrum of possible label sets
(representations) varying in semantic relevance. We then perform ICL with
varying numbers of in-context demonstrations for each of these label sets. We
observed that learning happens regardless of the quality of the label set
itself, although its efficiency, measured by the slope of improvement over
in-context demonstrations, is conditioned on both the label set quality and the
parameter count of the underlying language model. Despite the emergence of
learning, the relative quality (accuracy) of the choice of a label set
(representation) is largely maintained throughout learning, confirming our
hypothesis and implying their orthogonality. Our work reveals a previously
underexplored aspect of ICL: the independent effects of learning from
demonstrations and their representations on ICL performance.

### [161] [If Probable, Then Acceptable? Understanding Conditional Acceptability Judgments in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08388)
*Jasmin Orth,Philipp Mondorf,Barbara Plank*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper studies how large language models (LLMs) make judgments on the acceptability of conditional statements, showing LLMs use probabilistic and semantic cues but less consistently than humans.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address how LLMs evaluate the acceptability of conditional statements, a key aspect influencing communication and decision-making, given limited prior research on this aspect.

Method: The study evaluates LLMs from various families and sizes using different prompting strategies. Techniques like linear mixed-effects models and ANOVA tests were used to analyze the sensitivity of LLMs to conditional probabilities and semantic relevance. Comparisons were drawn with human judgment data.

Result: LLMs demonstrated sensitivity to conditional probability and semantic relevance, though inconsistently compared to humans. Larger models did not necessarily improve alignment with human judgments.

Conclusion: While LLMs utilize cues related to conditional acceptability, they are less consistent compared to human reasoning. Model size alone does not enhance human alignment.

Abstract: Conditional acceptability refers to how plausible a conditional statement is
perceived to be. It plays an important role in communication and reasoning, as
it influences how individuals interpret implications, assess arguments, and
make decisions based on hypothetical scenarios. When humans evaluate how
acceptable a conditional "If A, then B" is, their judgments are influenced by
two main factors: the $\textit{conditional probability}$ of $B$ given $A$, and
the $\textit{semantic relevance}$ of the antecedent $A$ given the consequent
$B$ (i.e., whether $A$ meaningfully supports $B$). While prior work has
examined how large language models (LLMs) draw inferences about conditional
statements, it remains unclear how these models judge the
$\textit{acceptability}$ of such statements. To address this gap, we present a
comprehensive study of LLMs' conditional acceptability judgments across
different model families, sizes, and prompting strategies. Using linear
mixed-effects models and ANOVA tests, we find that models are sensitive to both
conditional probability and semantic relevance-though to varying degrees
depending on architecture and prompting style. A comparison with human data
reveals that while LLMs incorporate probabilistic and semantic cues, they do so
less consistently than humans. Notably, larger models do not necessarily align
more closely with human judgments.

*Noor Ul Zain,Mohsin Raza,Ahsan Adeel*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces Co$^4$, a highly efficient tiny language model that outperforms larger baselines like GPT-2 and GPT-BERT in both training speed and task performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Efficiently scale down language models while preserving or enhancing their performance to challenge traditional deep learning paradigms.

Method: Co$^4$, a model with just a single layer and two heads, leveraging sample-efficient pretraining and operating at $O(N)$ cost.

Result: Co$^4$ outpaces GPT-2 and GPT-BERT in zero-shot and fine-tuning performance benchmarks while achieving greater training efficiency on only 10M tokens.

Conclusion: The success of Co$^4$ calls for a reevaluation of existing deep learning scaling laws and architectures, highlighting the possibility of achieving high performance with smaller models.

Abstract: We show that a tiny Co$^4$ machine(Adeel,2025) with a single layer, two
heads, and 8M parameters, operating at an approximate cost of $O(N)$ (where $N$
is the number of input tokens), outpaces the BabyLM Challenge baselines GPT-2
(124M, 12 layers, $O(N^2))$ and GPT-BERT (30M, 12 layers, $O(N^2))$ in just two
epochs, while both are trained for ten. Co$^4$ achieves orders-of-magnitude
greater training efficiency on 10M tokens, demonstrating highly sample
efficient pretraining. Using the BabyLM challenge evaluation pipeline across
complex benchmarks, Co$^4$ exhibits strong zero-shot and fine-tuning
performance on SuperGLUE tasks. Specifically, Co$^4$ outperforms GPT-2 on 5 out
of 7 zero-shot metrics and 6 out of 7 fine-tuning tasks, and GPT-BERT on 4 out
of 7 metrics in both cases. These results suggest the need to rethink
prevailing deep learning paradigms and associated scaling laws.

### [163] [ARES: Multimodal Adaptive Reasoning via Difficulty-Aware Token-Level Entropy Shaping](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08457)
*Shuang Chen,Yue Guo,Yimeng Ye,Shijue Huang,Wenbo Hu,Haoxi Li,Manyuan Zhang,Jiayu Chen,Song Guo,Nanyun Peng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces ARES, a framework that dynamically allocates reasoning effort based on problem difficulty to improve the balance between overthinking simple problems and under-exploring complex ones.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multimodal large reasoning models struggle to balance reasoning depth, leading to overthinking on simple problems and insufficient exploration on harder problems.

Method: ARES uses a two-stage training pipeline: (1) Adaptive Cold-Start, which trains the model with reasoning traces proportional to problem complexity, and (2) Adaptive Entropy Policy Optimization (AEPO), leveraging high window-entropy tokens as exploration triggers to dynamically adjust reasoning efforts.

Result: ARES outperforms existing systems in various reasoning benchmarks, achieving higher efficiency and closing the performance gap with commercial systems, all at lower inference costs.

Conclusion: ARES demonstrates a significant advancement in balancing reasoning depth dynamically, showcasing both better performance and efficiency in diverse reasoning tasks.

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal large reasoning models (MLRMs) have
substantially improved their ability to solve complex textual and visual tasks.
However, these models tend to overthink on simple problems, producing
unnecessarily lengthy reasoning traces, while under-exploring on challenging
ones, leading to missed solutions. To address this imbalance, we propose ARES,
a unified open-source framework for adaptive reasoning that dynamically
allocates exploration effort based on task difficulty. Our approach is
motivated by two key empirical findings: (i) while single-token entropy is
noisy, high window-entropy (HWE) tokens (token-level entropies averaged under a
sliding window) can reliably capture reasoning-critical moments; and (ii)
reducing HWE usage benefits easy problems, while increasing it is essential for
solving hard ones. Building on these insights, ARES introduces a two-stage
training pipeline. In the Adaptive Cold-Start stage, we curate multimodal and
textual data paired with reasoning traces of length proportional to problem
difficulty, equipping the model with initial difficulty awareness. In the
second stage, we develop Adaptive Entropy Policy Optimization (AEPO), which
uses HWE tokens as exploration triggers to decide when to explore, and a
hierarchical entropy reward with dynamic KL control to decide how much to
explore. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ARES achieves superior
performance and reasoning efficiency across diverse mathematical, logical, and
multimodal benchmarks, while closing the gap to leading commercial systems
under significantly lower inference costs.

TL;DR: The LEWIDI series promotes training and evaluating AI models to recognize disagreement in human judgments. The third edition expands to four datasets and introduces new evaluation paradigms and metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve AI models by making them aware of variations and disagreements in human judgments, thereby reflecting realistic decision-making scenarios.

Method: The task uses expanded datasets for various tasks (e.g., sarcasm and irony detection) combined with two evaluation paradigms: soft-label (population-based) and perspectivist (individual interpretative judgments).

Result: Participants successfully used the datasets and paradigms, revealing strengths and weaknesses in disagreement modeling approaches.

Conclusion: The LEWIDI framework is enhanced, offering resources and benchmarks that contribute to the development of disagreement-aware AI technologies.

Abstract: Many researchers have reached the conclusion that AI models should be trained
to be aware of the possibility of variation and disagreement in human
judgments, and evaluated as per their ability to recognize such variation. The
LEWIDI series of shared tasks on Learning With Disagreements was established to
promote this approach to training and evaluating AI models, by making suitable
datasets more accessible and by developing evaluation methods. The third
edition of the task builds on this goal by extending the LEWIDI benchmark to
four datasets spanning paraphrase identification, irony detection, sarcasm
detection, and natural language inference, with labeling schemes that include
not only categorical judgments as in previous editions, but ordinal judgments
as well. Another novelty is that we adopt two complementary paradigms to
evaluate disagreement-aware systems: the soft-label approach, in which models
predict population-level distributions of judgments, and the perspectivist
approach, in which models predict the interpretations of individual annotators.
Crucially, we moved beyond standard metrics such as cross-entropy, and tested
new evaluation metrics for the two paradigms. The task attracted diverse
participation, and the results provide insights into the strengths and
limitations of methods to modeling variation. Together, these contributions
strengthen LEWIDI as a framework and provide new resources, benchmarks, and
findings to support the development of disagreement-aware technologies.

### [165] [DeepPrune: Parallel Scaling without Inter-trace Redundancy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08483)
*Shangqing Tu,Yaxuan Li,Yushi Bai,Lei Hou,Juanzi Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DeepPrune is a framework for improving computational efficiency in parallel reasoning in large language models by dynamically pruning redundant reasoning paths.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the computational inefficiency caused by inter-trace redundancy in parallel reasoning, where over 80% of traces yield identical answers, leading to wasted computation.

Method: A judge model trained with focal loss and oversampling techniques predicts answer equivalence from partial reasoning traces (achieving 0.87 AUROC), coupled with an online greedy clustering algorithm that prunes redundant paths while preserving diversity.

Result: DeepPrune reduces token usage by over 80% compared to traditional methods while maintaining competitive accuracy within 3 percentage points across several benchmarks and reasoning models.

Conclusion: DeepPrune sets a new standard for efficient parallel reasoning, making it more computationally feasible while delivering high performance.

Abstract: Parallel scaling has emerged as a powerful paradigm to enhance reasoning
capabilities in large language models (LLMs) by generating multiple
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) traces simultaneously. However, this approach introduces
significant computational inefficiency due to inter-trace redundancy -- our
analysis reveals that over 80% of parallel reasoning traces yield identical
final answers, representing substantial wasted computation. To address this
critical efficiency bottleneck, we propose DeepPrune, a novel framework that
enables efficient parallel scaling through dynamic pruning. Our method features
a specialized judge model trained with focal loss and oversampling techniques
to accurately predict answer equivalence from partial reasoning traces which
realizes 0.87 AUROC on equivalence prediction, combined with an online greedy
clustering algorithm that dynamically prunes redundant paths while preserving
answer diversity. Comprehensive evaluations across three challenging benchmarks
(AIME 2024, AIME 2025, and GPQA) and multiple reasoning models demonstrate that
DeepPrune achieves remarkable token reduction by over 80% compared to
conventional consensus sampling on most cases, while maintaining competitive
accuracy within 3 percentage points. Our work establishes a new standard for
efficient parallel reasoning, making high-performance reasoning more efficient.

*John Hewitt,Oyvind Tafjord,Robert Geirhos,Been Kim*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores introducing new words (neologisms) to effectively communicate and control Large Language Models (LLMs), achieving this without altering model parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the need to better understand and manage complex model behaviors with LLMs, building on the concept of neologism learning.

Method: New words are introduced with added embeddings and trained examples, enabling models to learn concepts like flattery, incorrectness, or text length without changing parameters. Models also self-define the meanings of these words via explanations.

Result: Demonstrates that new words can control a range of concepts, illuminate model understanding of these concepts, and show cases of machine-only synonyms. Validates the effectiveness using plug-in evaluations.

Conclusion: Introducing and training models with neologisms offers a novel way to control and understand LLMs’ behaviors, while also learning multiple concepts collectively.

Abstract: Humans invent new words when there is a rising demand for a new useful
concept (e.g., doomscrolling). We explore and validate a similar idea in our
communication with LLMs: introducing new words to better understand and control
the models, expanding on the recently introduced neologism learning. This
method introduces a new word by adding a new word embedding and training with
examples that exhibit the concept with no other changes in model parameters. We
show that adding a new word allows for control of concepts such as flattery,
incorrect answers, text length, as well as more complex concepts in AxBench. We
discover that neologisms can also further our understanding of the model via
self-verbalization: models can describe what each new word means to them in
natural language, like explaining that a word that represents a concept of
incorrect answers means ``a lack of complete, coherent, or meaningful
answers...'' To validate self-verbalizations, we introduce plug-in evaluation:
we insert the verbalization into the context of a model and measure whether it
controls the target concept. In some self-verbalizations, we find machine-only
synonyms: words that seem unrelated to humans but cause similar behavior in
machines. Finally, we show how neologism learning can jointly learn multiple
concepts in multiple words.

*Hyunji Lee,Kevin Chenhao Li,Matthias Grabmair,Shanshan Xu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces an efficient prompt optimization framework combining Monte Carlo Tree Search and a proxy evaluator to improve fairness detection in legal NLP tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing prompt optimization methods for legal NLP tasks like fairness detection in ToS clauses are computationally expensive and inefficient.

Method: The authors propose using Monte Carlo Tree Search with a proxy prompt evaluator to optimize prompt generation, reducing both search time and scoring costs.

Result: The proposed framework showed superior classification accuracy and computational efficiency compared to baseline methods.

Conclusion: A novel and efficient prompt optimization framework was developed, improving performance on legal NLP tasks within a constrained computation budget.

Abstract: Prompt optimization aims to systematically refine prompts to enhance a
language model's performance on specific tasks. Fairness detection in Terms of
Service (ToS) clauses is a challenging legal NLP task that demands carefully
crafted prompts to ensure reliable results. However, existing prompt
optimization methods are often computationally expensive due to inefficient
search strategies and costly prompt candidate scoring. In this paper, we
propose a framework that combines Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) with a proxy
prompt evaluator to more effectively explore the prompt space while reducing
evaluation costs. Experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves higher
classification accuracy and efficiency than baseline methods under a
constrained computation budget.

### [168] [Which Heads Matter for Reasoning? RL-Guided KV Cache Compression](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08525)
*Wenjie Du,Li Jiang,Keda Tao,Xue Liu,Huan Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces RLKV, a method using reinforcement learning to identify and optimize reasoning-critical KV heads in large language models to reduce memory overhead, achieving 20-50% cache reduction with minimal performance loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the high Key-Value (KV) cache overhead in reasoning models, where current compression methods disrupt reasoning quality or underperform, particularly because of not accounting for reasoning-specific needs.

Method: The method, RLKV, leverages reinforcement learning to identify reasoning-critical KV heads through rewards derived from generated reasoning samples. Critical heads are allocated full cache, while others are compressed with constant KV cache to maintain efficiency.

Result: RLKV demonstrates that only a small portion of attention heads are essential for reasoning. This approach achieves 20-50% KV cache reduction with nearly lossless reasoning performance compared to uncompressed models, outperforming existing compression techniques.

Conclusion: The study confirms that through reasoning-specific optimization, KV cache efficiency can be significantly enhanced without sacrificing model performance, presenting RLKV as a superior solution for managing cache overhead in reasoning-focused tasks.

Abstract: Reasoning large language models exhibit complex reasoning behaviors through
the extended chain-of-thought generation, creating unprecedented Key-Value (KV)
cache overhead during the decoding phase. Existing KV cache compression methods
underperform on reasoning models: token-dropping methods break reasoning
integrity by discarding critical information, while head-reallocating methods
mistakenly compress reasoning-critical heads since they are designed for
retrieval tasks, resulting in significant performance degradation as
compression rates increase. We hypothesize that KV heads exhibit functional
heterogeneity in reasoning models-some heads are critical for chain-of-thought
consistency while others are compressible. To validate and exploit this
insight, we propose RLKV, a novel reasoning-critical head identification
framework, which uses reinforcement learning to directly optimize the
relationship between each head's cache usage and reasoning quality. As RLKV
produces rewards from actual generated samples during training, it naturally
identifies heads relevant to reasoning behaviors. We then allocate full KV
cache to these heads while applying compressed constant KV cache to others for
efficient inference. Our experiments reveal that only a small fraction of
attention heads is essential for reasoning, enabling our KV compression
approach to outperform baseline methods while achieving 20-50% cache reduction
with near lossless performance compared to uncompressed results.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces CoMAS, a framework where language model agents autonomously improve through mutual interactions, utilizing intrinsic rewards derived from discussions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the limitations in current LLM self-evolution methods and emulate human-like learning through collaboration and interaction.

Method: Propose a framework (CoMAS) that uses inter-agent interactions to generate intrinsic rewards, judged by an LLM, and optimizes agent policies with reinforcement learning.

Result: CoMAS consistently outperformed untrained agents and achieved state-of-the-art results in most evaluation settings, demonstrating scalability with more diverse agents.

Conclusion: CoMAS represents a novel and effective approach to enabling self-evolution in LLM-based agents by fostering mutual learning dynamics without external supervision.

Abstract: Self-evolution is a central research topic in enabling large language model
(LLM)-based agents to continually improve their capabilities after pretraining.
Recent research has witnessed a transition from reinforcement learning
(RL)-free to RL-based methods. Current RL-based methods either rely on dense
external reward signals or extract intrinsic reward signals from LLMs
themselves. However, these approaches diverge from the self-evolution
mechanisms observed in human intelligence, where individuals learn and improve
through mutual discussion and collaboration. In this work, we introduce
Co-Evolving Multi-Agent Systems (CoMAS), a novel framework that enables agents
to improve autonomously by learning from inter-agent interactions without
external supervision. CoMAS generates intrinsic rewards from rich discussion
dynamics, employs an LLM-as-a-judge mechanism to formulate these rewards, and
optimizes each agent's policy through RL, thereby enabling decentralized and
scalable co-evolution. Experimental results demonstrate that CoMAS consistently
outperforms untrained agents and achieves state-of-the-art performance across
most evaluation settings. Ablation studies confirm the necessity of
interaction-based reward signals and reveal promising scalability as the number
and diversity of agents increase. These findings establish CoMAS as a novel and
effective paradigm for self-evolution in LLM-based agents.

*Qin Liu,Jacob Dineen,Yuxi Huang,Sheng Zhang,Hoifung Poon,Ben Zhou,Muhao Chen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ArenaBencher is a dynamic framework for refining large language model benchmarks to tackle pretraining data leakage issues, ensuring fairer and more challenging tests.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of data leakage in benchmarks for large language models, which leads to inflated scores, distorted comparisons, and misrepresentation of model progress.

Method: ArenaBencher updates benchmarks automatically using an iterative framework. It identifies core abilities in test cases, generates similar question-answer pairs, verifies correctness using LLMs, and selects challenging test cases that target shared weaknesses across models.

Result: The application of ArenaBencher in various domains, such as math and reasoning, showed it could produce diverse, verified updates that expose new failure modes, increase difficulty, and improve the ability to differentiate between models.

Conclusion: ArenaBencher ensures benchmarks remain valid, diagnostic, and scalable as foundation models evolve, resolving inherent issues like data leakage and providing fair comparisons.

Abstract: Benchmarks are central to measuring the capabilities of large language models
and guiding model development, yet widespread data leakage from pretraining
corpora undermines their validity. Models can match memorized content rather
than demonstrate true generalization, which inflates scores, distorts
cross-model comparisons, and misrepresents progress. We introduce ArenaBencher,
a model-agnostic framework for automatic benchmark evolution that updates test
cases while preserving comparability. Given an existing benchmark and a diverse
pool of models to be evaluated, ArenaBencher infers the core ability of each
test case, generates candidate question-answer pairs that preserve the original
objective, verifies correctness and intent with an LLM as a judge, and
aggregates feedback from multiple models to select candidates that expose
shared weaknesses. The process runs iteratively with in-context demonstrations
that steer generation toward more challenging and diagnostic cases. We apply
ArenaBencher to math problem solving, commonsense reasoning, and safety domains
and show that it produces verified, diverse, and fair updates that uncover new
failure modes, increase difficulty while preserving test objective alignment,
and improve model separability. The framework provides a scalable path to
continuously evolve benchmarks in step with the rapid progress of foundation
models.

TL;DR: This paper presents an enhanced real-time maritime object detection system based on RT-DETR, utilizing augmented synthetic images to address challenges like small target size and limited labeled data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The work is driven by challenges in maritime object detection, including small object size and scarcity of labeled real-world data.

Method: The system incorporates multi-scale feature fusion, uncertainty-minimizing query selection, and an adaptive weighting strategy between real and synthetic data. Data augmentation techniques were also applied to balance dataset classes.

Result: The pipeline demonstrates robust and real-time performance in maritime conditions, verified through comprehensive module evaluation and failure handling in extreme conditions.

Conclusion: A robust maritime detection system was developed, maintaining real-time performance with significant contributions from proposed architectural modules and improving reliability under challenging scenarios.

Abstract: Maritime object detection faces essential challenges due to the small target
size and limitations of labeled real RGB data. This paper will present a
real-time object detection system based on RT-DETR, enhanced by employing
augmented synthetic images while strictly evaluating on real data. This study
employs RT-DETR for the maritime environment by combining multi-scale feature
fusion, uncertainty-minimizing query selection, and smart weight between
synthetic and real training samples. The fusion module in DETR enhances the
detection of small, low-contrast vessels, query selection focuses on the most
reliable proposals, and the weighting strategy helps reduce the visual gap
between synthetic and real domains. This design preserves DETR's refined
end-to-end set prediction while allowing users to adjust between speed and
accuracy at inference time. Data augmentation techniques were also used to
balance the different classes of the dataset to improve the robustness and
accuracy of the model. Regarding this study, a full Python robust maritime
detection pipeline is delivered that maintains real-time performance even under
practical limits. It also verifies how each module contributes, and how the
system handles failures in extreme lighting or sea conditions. This study also
includes a component analysis to quantify the contribution of each
architectural module and explore its interactions.

TL;DR: DynamicEval addresses limitations in existing text-to-video (T2V) benchmarks by emphasizing dynamic camera motion and introducing improved metrics for evaluating video quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks lack robust evaluation for dynamic camera motion and overlook video-level assessments critical for choosing better videos from generated candidates.

Method: DynamicEval introduces curated prompts emphasizing dynamic camera motion, 45k human annotations, and two novel evaluation metrics: one for background scene consistency and another for foreground object consistency.

Result: The proposed metrics yield stronger correlations with human judgments at video and model levels, showing an improvement of over 2% points.

Conclusion: DynamicEval offers a comprehensive benchmark for assessing T2V models, with improved methodologies for evaluating video quality under dynamic motion.

Abstract: Existing text-to-video (T2V) evaluation benchmarks, such as VBench and
EvalCrafter, suffer from two limitations. (i) While the emphasis is on
subject-centric prompts or static camera scenes, camera motion essential for
producing cinematic shots and existing metrics under dynamic motion are largely
unexplored. (ii) These benchmarks typically aggregate video-level scores into a
single model-level score for ranking generative models. Such aggregation,
however, overlook video-level evaluation, which is vital to selecting the
better video among the candidate videos generated for a given prompt. To
address these gaps, we introduce DynamicEval, a benchmark consisting of
systematically curated prompts emphasizing dynamic camera motion, paired with
45k human annotations on video pairs from 3k videos generated by ten T2V
models. DynamicEval evaluates two key dimensions of video quality: background
scene consistency and foreground object consistency. For background scene
consistency, we obtain the interpretable error maps based on the Vbench motion
smoothness metric. We observe that while the Vbench motion smoothness metric
shows promising alignment with human judgments, it fails in two cases:
occlusions/disocclusions arising from camera and foreground object movements.
Building on this, we propose a new background consistency metric that leverages
object error maps to correct two failure cases in a principled manner. Our
second innovation is the introduction of a foreground consistency metric that
tracks points and their neighbors within each object instance to assess object
fidelity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed metrics achieve
stronger correlations with human preferences at both the video level and the
model level (an improvement of more than 2% points), establishing DynamicEval
as a more comprehensive benchmark for evaluating T2V models under dynamic
camera motion.

### [173] [Provably Accelerated Imaging with Restarted Inertia and Score-based Image Priors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07470)
*Marien Renaud,Julien Hermant,Deliang Wei,Yu Sun*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RISP is a novel algorithm targeting fast and high-quality solutions for imaging inverse problems, combining inertia for rapid convergence with score-based priors for quality recovery.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing algorithms like RED focus on image priors for quality but rely on heuristics for convergence. The paper aims to balance these two aspects.

Method: They propose RISP, which combines restarted inertia for quicker convergence with score-based priors for better reconstruction, and analyze its mathematical underpinnings.

Result: RISP outperforms RED by achieving faster convergence and maintaining high reconstruction quality, as shown across multiple imaging tasks.

Conclusion: RISP provides a principled approach to address imaging inverse problems, merging fast convergence with superior image reconstruction.

Abstract: Fast convergence and high-quality image recovery are two essential features
of algorithms for solving ill-posed imaging inverse problems. Existing methods,
such as regularization by denoising (RED), often focus on designing
sophisticated image priors to improve reconstruction quality, while leaving
convergence acceleration to heuristics. To bridge the gap, we propose Restarted
Inertia with Score-based Priors (RISP) as a principled extension of RED. RISP
incorporates a restarting inertia for fast convergence, while still allowing
score-based image priors for high-quality reconstruction. We prove that RISP
attains a faster stationary-point convergence rate than RED, without requiring
the convexity of the image prior. We further derive and analyze the associated
continuous-time dynamical system, offering insight into the connection between
RISP and the heavy-ball ordinary differential equation (ODE). Experiments
across a range of imaging inverse problems demonstrate that RISP enables fast
convergence while achieving high-quality reconstructions.

### [174] [A Denoising Framework for Real-World Ultra-Low Dose Lung CT Images Based on an Image Purification Strategy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07492)
*Guoliang Gong,Man Yu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper addresses challenges in ultra-low dose CT (uLDCT) denoising caused by severe noise, artifacts, and spatial misalignment by introducing an Image Purification strategy and Frequency-domain Flow Matching model.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Radiation exposure in CT scans can be reduced using ultra-low dose CT (uLDCT), but this method suffers from severe noise and image artifacts, posing challenges for denoising applications.

Method: The paper introduces an Image Purification (IP) strategy to create aligned uLDCT-NDCT image pairs and proposes a Frequency-domain Flow Matching (FFM) model to preserve anatomical structures in denoised images.

Result: Experiments demonstrated that the IP strategy improves mainstream denoising models for uLDCT images, and the FFM model achieves state-of-the-art results in anatomical structure preservation.

Conclusion: The study solves the data mismatch problem in real-world uLDCT denoising, offering a comprehensive framework that enhances denoising performance with high structural integrity preservation.

Abstract: Ultra-low dose CT (uLDCT) significantly reduces radiation exposure but
introduces severe noise and artifacts. It also leads to substantial spatial
misalignment between uLDCT and normal dose CT (NDCT) image pairs. This poses
challenges for directly applying existing denoising networks trained on
synthetic noise or aligned data. To address this core challenge in uLDCT
denoising, this paper proposes an innovative denoising framework based on an
Image Purification (IP) strategy. First, we construct a real clinical uLDCT
lung dataset. Then, we propose an Image Purification strategy that generates
structurally aligned uLDCT-NDCT image pairs, providing a high-quality data
foundation for network training. Building upon this, we propose a
Frequency-domain Flow Matching (FFM) model, which works synergistically with
the IP strategy to excellently preserve the anatomical structure integrity of
denoised images. Experiments on the real clinical dataset demonstrate that our
IP strategy significantly enhances the performance of multiple mainstream
denoising models on the uLDCT task. Notably, our proposed FFM model combined
with the IP strategy achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) results in anatomical
structure preservation. This study provides an effective solution to the data
mismatch problem in real-world uLDCT denoising. Code and dataset are available

*Pragati Shuddhodhan Meshram,Varun Chandrasekaran*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces D2RA, a method to attack and remove watermarks in generative model outputs effectively.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The reliance on generative models has created a demand for robust watermarking methods to ensure proper content attribution, but current designs are vulnerable to attacks.

Method: D2RA, a training-free and single-image attack method, removes or weakens watermarks from images by utilizing natural priors in complementary representations without requiring access to the source model.

Result: D2RA consistently reduces watermark detectability across various watermarking schemes while maintaining the visual quality of the images.

Conclusion: Current semantic watermarking methods are fundamentally flawed, and D2RA highlights these weaknesses by effectively bypassing watermark protection.

Abstract: The growing use of generative models has intensified the need for
watermarking methods that ensure content attribution and provenance. While
recent semantic watermarking schemes improve robustness by embedding signals in
latent or frequency representations, we show they remain vulnerable even under
resource-constrained adversarial settings. We present D2RA, a training-free,
single-image attack that removes or weakens watermarks without access to the
underlying model. By projecting watermarked images onto natural priors across
complementary representations, D2RA suppresses watermark signals while
preserving visual fidelity. Experiments across diverse watermarking schemes
demonstrate that our approach consistently reduces watermark detectability,
revealing fundamental weaknesses in current designs. Our code is available at

*Soroush Mehraban,Vida Adeli,Jacob Rommann,Babak Taati,Kyryl Truskovskyi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces PickStyle, a video style transfer framework using diffusion models to render videos in a target style specified by text while preserving the original video context. 


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the challenge of video style transfer with the lack of paired video data for supervision and to achieve style transfer that is temporally coherent and content-preserving.

Method: The method includes augmenting pretrained video diffusion backbones with style adapters, using paired still images for training, simulating camera motion with synthetic training clips to preserve temporal dynamics, and introducing Context-Style Classifier-Free Guidance for separating style and context directions.

Result: Experiments demonstrate that PickStyle outperforms existing baselines in generating style-faithful, temporally coherent, and content-preserving videos.

Conclusion: PickStyle effectively bridges the gap in video style transfer with efficient solutions for dynamic video training and demonstrates superior quantitative and qualitative results.

Abstract: We address the task of video style transfer with diffusion models, where the
goal is to preserve the context of an input video while rendering it in a
target style specified by a text prompt. A major challenge is the lack of
paired video data for supervision. We propose PickStyle, a video-to-video style
transfer framework that augments pretrained video diffusion backbones with
style adapters and benefits from paired still image data with source-style
correspondences for training. PickStyle inserts low-rank adapters into the
self-attention layers of conditioning modules, enabling efficient
specialization for motion-style transfer while maintaining strong alignment
between video content and style. To bridge the gap between static image
supervision and dynamic video, we construct synthetic training clips from
paired images by applying shared augmentations that simulate camera motion,
ensuring temporal priors are preserved. In addition, we introduce Context-Style
Classifier-Free Guidance (CS-CFG), a novel factorization of classifier-free
guidance into independent text (style) and video (context) directions. CS-CFG
ensures that context is preserved in generated video while the style is
effectively transferred. Experiments across benchmarks show that our approach
achieves temporally coherent, style-faithful, and content-preserving video
translations, outperforming existing baselines both qualitatively and
quantitatively.

*Saman Motamed,Minghao Chen,Luc Van Gool,Iro Laina*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper aims to improve video generative models' ability to assess and judge physical realism by fine-tuning Video-Language Models (VLMs) with a novel recipe and proposing a benchmark to rigorously evaluate physical plausibility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current video generative models often generate sequences that defy intuitive physical laws, but there is no robust quantitative method for assessing these violations. The motivation is to address the gaps in temporal and causal reasoning within VLMs for detecting such discrepancies.

Method: The researchers introduce TRAVL, a fine-tuning recipe that utilizes a balanced training dataset and a trajectory-aware attention module to enhance motion encoding. Additionally, they propose ImplausiBench, a benchmark with 300 curated videos to evaluate physical reasoning free of linguistic bias.

Result: Existing VLMs were found inadequate in detecting physics violations, but after employing TRAVL, their motion encoding and discrimination improved. ImplausiBench demonstrated success as a rigorous evaluation tool, with correlations to both human judgments and stricter LLM metrics.

Conclusion: TRAVL and ImplausiBench effectively advance physical plausibility assessment in VLMs, highlighting the possibility of refining multimodal models for better temporal and causal understanding.

Abstract: Despite impressive visual fidelity, modern video generative models frequently
produce sequences that violate intuitive physical laws, such as objects
floating, teleporting, or morphing in ways that defy causality. While humans
can easily detect such implausibilities, there remains no robust method for
quantitatively assessing physical realism in video. In this work, we explore
whether Video-Language Models (VLMs) can be trained to serve as reliable judges
of physical plausibility. We find that existing VLMs struggle to identify
physics violations, exposing fundamental limitations in their temporal and
causal reasoning. To address this, we introduce TRAVL, a fine-tuning recipe
that combines a balanced training dataset with a trajectory-aware attention
module to improve motion encoding and discrimination in VLMs. To evaluate
physical reasoning more rigorously, we propose ImplausiBench, a benchmark of
300 videos (150 real, 150 generated) that removes linguistic biases and
isolates visual-temporal understanding. Performance is reported both with
gold-standard human judgments and stricter LLM-as-judge metrics. Together,
TRAVL and ImplausiBench offer a unified framework for probing and improving
physical plausibility in multimodal models, shedding light on a challenging and
underexplored aspect of visual-temporal understanding.

*Rafin Hassan,Zarin Tasnim Roshni,Rafiqul Bari,Alimul Islam,Nabeel Mohammed,Moshiur Farazi,Shafin Rahman*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a Semantic Spectral-Spatial Fusion Network (S3FN) that integrates textual descriptions derived from LLMs with hyperspectral imaging (HSI) classification models to improve their performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome issues of overfitting and limited training data in HSI classification models while addressing the challenge of enhancing accuracy without incurring excessive computational complexity.

Method: The proposed S3FN model uses LLMs to generate class-specific textual descriptions that capture distinct spectral behaviors and characteristics. These texts are embedded via pre-trained text encoders like BERT or RoBERTa to enrich label semantics and augment HSI data for better classification outcomes.

Result: The S3FN model demonstrated significant performance improvements across three diverse HSI benchmark datasets: Hyperspectral Wood, Hyperspectral Blueberries, and DeepHS-Fruit.

Conclusion: S3FN successfully exploits the synergy between textual semantics and spectral-spatial data, enhancing HSI classification accuracy and fostering further advancement in semantically enriched models.

Abstract: Hyperspectral imaging (HSI) classification is a critical tool with widespread
applications across diverse fields such as agriculture, environmental
monitoring, medicine, and materials science. Due to the limited availability of
high-quality training samples and the high dimensionality of spectral data, HSI
classification models are prone to overfitting and often face challenges in
balancing accuracy and computational complexity. Furthermore, most of HSI
classification models are monomodal, where it solely relies on spectral-spatial
data to learn decision boundaries in the high dimensional embedding space. To
address this, we propose a general-purpose Semantic Spectral-Spatial Fusion
Network (S3FN) that uses contextual, class specific textual descriptions to
complement the training of an HSI classification model. Specifically, S3FN
leverages LLMs to generate comprehensive textual descriptions for each class
label that captures their unique characteristics and spectral behaviors. These
descriptions are then embedded into a vector space using a pre-trained text
encoder such as BERT or RoBERTa to extract meaningful label semantics which in
turn leads to a better feature-label alignment for improved classification
performance. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, we evaluate our
model on three diverse HSI benchmark datasets - Hyperspectral Wood,
HyperspectralBlueberries, and DeepHS-Fruit and report significant performance
boost. Our results highlight the synergy between textual semantics and
spectral-spatial data, paving the way for further advancements in semantically
augmented HSI classification models. Codes are be available in:

*Karuna Bhaila,Aneesh Komanduri,Minh-Hao Van,Xintao Wu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a lightweight framework, Cross-Modal Attention Guided Unlearning (CAGUL), for unlearning private information in Vision-Language Models (VLMs) without modifying pre-trained model parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are powerful but may leak private information stored during training, especially in scenarios involving sensitive visual and textual data.

Method: The authors developed CAGUL, a framework that uses cross-modal attention to identify and encode unlearning information into low-importance visual tokens using external modules, avoiding the need for computationally expensive model finetuning or retraining.

Result: The proposed method effectively prevents data leakage while preserving the original model's behavior, outperforming or matching finetuning-based approaches.

Conclusion: CAGUL offers an efficient and practical solution for unlearning in VLMs, mitigating privacy concerns without modifying the pre-trained model or incurring high computational costs.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated immense capabilities in
multi-modal understanding and inference tasks such as Visual Question Answering
(VQA), which requires models to infer outputs based on visual and textual
context simultaneously. Such inference abilities of large-scale pretrained
models are often attributed to the massive scale of pre-training data collected
across several domains. However, the models may memorize private and/or
sensitive information during training and regurgitate it in inference.
Recently, machine unlearning has been leveraged to address the leakage of
private data in LLMs. VLMs add a layer of complexity to this process, as the
visual context in the query may also contain sensitive information in addition
to the text. To address this issue, we explore unlearning for vision-language
models, specifically for the VQA task. We explore the role of visual tokens for
output generation in VLMs using cross-modal attention and utilize it to
formulate Cross-Modal Attention Guided Unlearning (CAGUL), a lightweight and
efficient VLM unlearning framework. In contrast to computationally expensive
model finetuning methods, CAGUL utilizes external modules to encode unlearning
information in visual tokens of low importance for relevant queries. We find
that the transformed visual tokens not only prevent leakage but also retain
reference model behavior. Experimental results show that our method performs
better or on par with finetuning-based baselines without altering the
pre-trained model parameters or incurring retraining costs, making it a
practical and effective unlearning solution for VLMs.

*Dewi Endah Kharismawati,Toni Kazic*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces MaSC, an algorithm for automated maize stand counting using UAV imagery, proving to be cost-effective, fast, and accurate.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual maize stand counting is inefficient, error-prone, and challenges scalability across large fields, necessitating an automated solution.

Method: The algorithm MaSC uses UAV-captured RGB imagery processed with a YOLOv9 model and operates in two modes: mosaic patches or raw video frames. It distinguishes maize from weeds, segments rows, and counts maize seedlings from V2-V10 growth stages.

Result: MaSC achieved strong agreement with manual counting, with R² scores of 0.616 for mosaics and 0.906 for raw video frames, while processing 83 full-resolution frames in 60.63 seconds.

Conclusion: MaSC is a scalable, affordable, and accurate tool for automated maize stand counting suited for research and production environments.

Abstract: Accurate maize stand counts are essential for crop management and research,
informing yield prediction, planting density optimization, and early detection
of germination issues. Manual counting is labor-intensive, slow, and
error-prone, especially across large or variable fields. We present
MaizeStandCounting (MaSC), a robust algorithm for automated maize seedling
stand counting from RGB imagery captured by low-cost UAVs and processed on
affordable hardware. MaSC operates in two modes: (1) mosaic images divided into
patches, and (2) raw video frames aligned using homography matrices. Both modes
use a lightweight YOLOv9 model trained to detect maize seedlings from V2-V10
growth stages. MaSC distinguishes maize from weeds and other vegetation, then
performs row and range segmentation based on the spatial distribution of
detections to produce precise row-wise stand counts. Evaluation against
in-field manual counts from our 2024 summer nursery showed strong agreement
with ground truth (R^2= 0.616 for mosaics, R^2 = 0.906 for raw frames). MaSC
processed 83 full-resolution frames in 60.63 s, including inference and
post-processing, highlighting its potential for real-time operation. These
results demonstrate MaSC's effectiveness as a scalable, low-cost, and accurate
tool for automated maize stand counting in both research and production
environments.

*Pouya Shiri,Ramin Sharifi,Amirali Baniasadi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces Quick-CapsNet (QCN), a faster variant of Capsule Network (CapsNet) focused on improving inference speed for real-time applications, with minimal accuracy trade-offs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CapsNet offers higher accuracy and robustness compared to CNNs, especially for affine transformations, but suffers from slow training and inference times, limiting its practicality in applications requiring speed.

Method: The authors proposed QCN by reducing the number of capsules, thus speeding up the network, and enhanced it further using a more powerful decoder for optimized performance.

Result: QCN achieved 5x faster inference across datasets like MNIST, Fashion-MNIST, SVHN, and CIFAR-10, with only marginal accuracy loss compared to standard CapsNet.

Conclusion: QCN serves as a promising direction for fast real-time applications utilizing Capsule Networks, balancing speed and accuracy effectively.

Abstract: The basic computational unit in Capsule Network (CapsNet) is a capsule (vs.
neurons in Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)). A capsule is a set of
neurons, which form a vector. CapsNet is used for supervised classification of
data and has achieved state-of-the-art accuracy on MNIST digit recognition
dataset, outperforming conventional CNNs in detecting overlapping digits.
Moreover, CapsNet shows higher robustness towards affine transformation when
compared to CNNs for MNIST datasets. One of the drawbacks of CapsNet, however,
is slow training and testing. This can be a bottleneck for applications that
require a fast network, especially during inference. In this work, we introduce
Quick-CapsNet (QCN) as a fast alternative to CapsNet, which can be a starting
point to develop CapsNet for fast real-time applications. QCN builds on
producing a fewer number of capsules, which results in a faster network. QCN
achieves this at the cost of marginal loss in accuracy. Inference is 5x faster
on MNIST, F-MNIST, SVHN and Cifar-10 datasets. We also further enhanced QCN by
employing a more powerful decoder instead of the default decoder to further
improve QCN.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Introduces Rectified-CFG++, an adaptive method improving classifier-free guidance (CFG) for text-to-image diffusion models to address issues in stability and visual quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CFG, a popular steering technique for text-conditioned diffusion models, struggles with off-manifold drift causing artifacts and brittle behaviors.

Method: Rectified-CFG++ employs an adaptive predictor-corrector mechanism combining the strengths of rectified flows with a geometry-aware conditional correction approach.

Result: Experiments reveal that Rectified-CFG++ enhances model performance compared to standard CFG across benchmarks including MS-COCO, LAION-Aesthetic, and T2I-CompBench.

Conclusion: Rectified-CFG++ provides effective and stable guidance for text-conditioned diffusion models, leading to improved visual coherence and robustness than standard CFG.

Abstract: Classifier-free guidance (CFG) is the workhorse for steering large diffusion
models toward text-conditioned targets, yet its native application to rectified
flow (RF) based models provokes severe off-manifold drift, yielding visual
artifacts, text misalignment, and brittle behaviour. We present
Rectified-CFG++, an adaptive predictor-corrector guidance that couples the
deterministic efficiency of rectified flows with a geometry-aware conditioning
rule. Each inference step first executes a conditional RF update that anchors
the sample near the learned transport path, then applies a weighted conditional
correction that interpolates between conditional and unconditional velocity
fields. We prove that the resulting velocity field is marginally consistent and
that its trajectories remain within a bounded tubular neighbourhood of the data
manifold, ensuring stability across a wide range of guidance strengths.
Extensive experiments on large-scale text-to-image models (Flux, Stable
Diffusion 3/3.5, Lumina) show that Rectified-CFG++ consistently outperforms
standard CFG on benchmark datasets such as MS-COCO, LAION-Aesthetic, and
T2I-CompBench. Project page: https://rectified-cfgpp.github.io/

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces PIT-QMM, a novel multimodal AI model for assessing the quality of 3D point clouds without needing a reference. It uses text, images, and raw 3D data efficiently, offering improved accuracy and model explainability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current advancements in multimodal models like LMMs have greatly improved 2D image and video analysis, but the quality assessment of 3D point clouds is underexplored. The paper aims to bridge this gap.

Method: The authors propose PIT-QMM, a multimodal model that integrates text descriptions, 2D projections, and direct 3D point cloud views. This is done end-to-end for No-Reference Point Cloud Quality Assessment (PCQA).

Result: The PIT-QMM model surpasses existing state-of-the-art benchmarks significantly in point cloud quality assessment. It also achieves these results with fewer training iterations.

Conclusion: By surpassing benchmarks and enabling distortion localization and identification, PIT-QMM opens the door for future innovations in explainable and user-interactive modeling for 3D asset quality analysis.

Abstract: Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) have recently enabled considerable advances in
the realm of image and video quality assessment, but this progress has yet to
be fully explored in the domain of 3D assets. We are interested in using these
models to conduct No-Reference Point Cloud Quality Assessment (NR-PCQA), where
the aim is to automatically evaluate the perceptual quality of a point cloud in
absence of a reference. We begin with the observation that different modalities
of data - text descriptions, 2D projections, and 3D point cloud views - provide
complementary information about point cloud quality. We then construct PIT-QMM,
a novel LMM for NR-PCQA that is capable of consuming text, images and point
clouds end-to-end to predict quality scores. Extensive experimentation shows
that our proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art by significant
margins on popular benchmarks with fewer training iterations. We also
demonstrate that our framework enables distortion localization and
identification, which paves a new way forward for model explainability and
interactivity. Code and datasets are available at

TL;DR: The paper presents Dual-Stream Alignment Network (DSA Net) for action segmentation in videos, achieving state-of-the-art results with a hybrid quantum-classical approach.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Action segmentation is essential to understand continuous video streams and improve action recognition accuracy.

Method: The paper proposes a two-stream model (frame-wise and action-wise) linked using a Temporal Context block integrating cross-attention and quantum-based modulation.

Result: DSA Net achieves superior performance across benchmark datasets like GTEA, Breakfast, 50Salads, and EgoProcel.

Conclusion: The study introduces an innovative quantum-classical framework, highlights the effectiveness of its proposed components, and advances action segmentation performance.

Abstract: Action segmentation is a challenging yet active research area that involves
identifying when and where specific actions occur in continuous video streams.
Most existing work has focused on single-stream approaches that model the
spatio-temporal aspects of frame sequences. However, recent research has
shifted toward two-stream methods that learn action-wise features to enhance
action segmentation performance. In this work, we propose the Dual-Stream
Alignment Network (DSA Net) and investigate the impact of incorporating a
second stream of learned action features to guide segmentation by capturing
both action and action-transition cues. Communication between the two streams
is facilitated by a Temporal Context (TC) block, which fuses complementary
information using cross-attention and Quantum-based Action-Guided Modulation
(Q-ActGM), enhancing the expressive power of the fused features. To the best of
our knowledge, this is the first study to introduce a hybrid quantum-classical
machine learning framework for action segmentation. Our primary objective is
for the two streams (frame-wise and action-wise) to learn a shared feature
space through feature alignment. This is encouraged by the proposed Dual-Stream
Alignment Loss, which comprises three components: relational consistency,
cross-level contrastive, and cycle-consistency reconstruction losses. Following
prior work, we evaluate DSA Net on several diverse benchmark datasets: GTEA,
Breakfast, 50Salads, and EgoProcel. We further demonstrate the effectiveness of
each component through extensive ablation studies. Notably, DSA Net achieves
state-of-the-art performance, significantly outperforming existing

*Yanjie Pan,Qingdong He,Lidong Wang,Bo Peng,Mingmin Chi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces the OIE (Once is Enough) method for video virtual try-on that focuses on editing the clothing of the first frame using image-based transfer, followed by guided sequential synthesis for the remaining frames.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current dual-branch architectures for video virtual try-on face challenges in adapting to Diffusion Transformer-based diffusion models, resulting in increased trainable parameters and lack of temporal consistency.

Method: The OIE method first replaces clothing in the initial video frame using an image-based clothing transfer model, then leverages pose and mask information to guide sequential synthesis for subsequent video frames under temporal content control.

Result: Experiments demonstrate that OIE achieves high performance while significantly reducing both parameter counts and computational overhead.

Conclusion: OIE effectively addresses challenges in video virtual try-on, offering improved efficiency and competitive results without sacrificing quality.

Abstract: Video virtual try-on aims to replace the clothing of a person in a video with
a target garment. Current dual-branch architectures have achieved significant
success in diffusion models based on the U-Net; however, adapting them to
diffusion models built upon the Diffusion Transformer remains challenging.
Initially, introducing latent space features from the garment reference branch
requires adding or modifying the backbone network, leading to a large number of
trainable parameters. Subsequently, the latent space features of garments lack
inherent temporal characteristics and thus require additional learning. To
address these challenges, we propose a novel approach, OIE (Once is Enough), a
virtual try-on strategy based on first-frame clothing replacement:
specifically, we employ an image-based clothing transfer model to replace the
clothing in the initial frame, and then, under the content control of the
edited first frame, utilize pose and mask information to guide the temporal
prior of the video generation model in synthesizing the remaining frames
sequentially. Experiments show that our method achieves superior parameter
efficiency and computational efficiency while still maintaining leading
performance under these constraints.

Method: A second pass is introduced using automatically-generated masks by the IP-Adapter during inference, restricting masked tokens to the subject while allowing the prompt to focus on other image areas.

Result: The proposed method yields images where the subject is accurately depicted and aligns well with textual descriptions of locations and places.

Conclusion: The method enhances prompt-source alignment, outperforming other tested personalization methods at inference time.

Abstract: Personalizing diffusion models allows users to generate new images that
incorporate a given subject, allowing more control than a text prompt. These
models often suffer somewhat when they end up just recreating the subject
image, and ignoring the text prompt. We observe that one popular method for
personalization, the IP-Adapter automatically generates masks that we
definitively segment the subject from the background during inference. We
propose to use this automatically generated mask on a second pass to mask the
image tokens, thus restricting them to the subject, not the background,
allowing the text prompt to attend to the rest of the image. For text prompts
describing locations and places, this produces images that accurately depict
the subject while definitively matching the prompt. We compare our method to a
few other test time personalization methods, and find our method displays high
prompt and source image alignment.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To optimize the balance between visual appeal and communication efficiency in automated layout design.

Method: The paper compares standard Transformers, small Vision and Language Models (Phi3.5-vision), a large pretrained VLM (Gemini), and an extended Transformer processing multiple images.

Result: Transformers generally perform better, especially with richer appearance data, but all methods struggle with small text or crowded layouts.

Conclusion: Task-specific architectures outperform general models, with room for improvement in automated layout design for challenging scenarios.

Abstract: In layout design for advertisements and web pages, balancing visual appeal
and communication efficiency is crucial. This study examines automated text box
placement in incomplete layouts, comparing a standard Transformer-based method,
a small Vision and Language Model (Phi3.5-vision), a large pretrained VLM
(Gemini), and an extended Transformer that processes multiple images.
Evaluations on the Crello dataset show the standard Transformer-based models
generally outperform VLM-based approaches, particularly when incorporating
richer appearance information. However, all methods face challenges with very
small text or densely populated layouts. These findings highlight the benefits
of task-specific architectures and suggest avenues for further improvement in
automated layout design.

### [188] [TCIP: Threshold-Controlled Iterative Pyramid Network for Deformable Medical Image Registration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07666)
*Heming Wu,Di Wang,Tai Ma,Peng Zhao,Yubin Xiao,Zhongke Wu,Xing-Ce Wang,Chuang Li,Xuan Wu,You Zhou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces Threshold-Controlled Iterative Pyramid (TCIP), combining FERM and TCI methods, to address anatomical misalignment issues and enhance adaptability in medical image registration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing deformable medical image registration models face challenges with anatomical misalignments and fixed iteration optimization that could either terminate prematurely or excessively.

Method: The paper proposes the Feature-Enhanced Residual Module (FERM) for decoder layers to reduce anatomical misalignment and a dual-stage Threshold-Controlled Iterative (TCI) strategy for adaptive optimization iteration.

Result: Experiments on three brain MRI datasets and one abdomen CT dataset demonstrate TCIP's superior registration accuracy compared to state-of-the-art methods, while maintaining efficiency and compactness.

Conclusion: FERM and TCI improve the performance and adaptability of medical image registration models, validated through integration with other networks and ablation studies.

Abstract: Although pyramid networks have demonstrated superior performance in
deformable medical image registration, their decoder architectures are
inherently prone to propagating and accumulating anatomical structure
misalignments. Moreover, most existing models do not adaptively determine the
number of iterations for optimization under varying deformation requirements
across images, resulting in either premature termination or excessive
iterations that degrades registration accuracy. To effectively mitigate the
accumulation of anatomical misalignments, we propose the Feature-Enhanced
Residual Module (FERM) as the core component of each decoding layer in the
pyramid network. FERM comprises three sequential blocks that extract anatomical
semantic features, learn to suppress irrelevant features, and estimate the
final deformation field, respectively. To adaptively determine the number of
iterations for varying images, we propose the dual-stage Threshold-Controlled
Iterative (TCI) strategy. In the first stage, TCI assesses registration
stability and with asserted stability, it continues with the second stage to
evaluate convergence. We coin the model that integrates FERM and TCI as
Threshold-Controlled Iterative Pyramid (TCIP). Extensive experiments on three
public brain MRI datasets and one abdomen CT dataset demonstrate that TCIP
outperforms the state-of-the-art (SOTA) registration networks in terms of
accuracy, while maintaining comparable inference speed and a compact model
parameter size. Finally, we assess the generalizability of FERM and TCI by
integrating them with existing registration networks and further conduct
ablation studies to validate the effectiveness of these two proposed methods.

*Haoyi Duan,Yunzhi Zhang,Yilun Du,Jiajun Wu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes a video synthesis method with improved controllability and diversity by leveraging variational inference and multiple video generation backbones.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the need for video synthesis methods that can incorporate mixed user controls, ranging from precise to coarse granularity.

Method: The method uses variational inference with step-wise KL divergence minimization and a context-conditioned factorization to optimize compositional constraints.

Result: Experiments demonstrate enhanced controllability, diversity, and 3D consistency in video synthesis compared to prior methods.

Conclusion: The approach efficiently balances specified user controls with generative diversity, advancing video synthesis capabilities.

Abstract: Many video workflows benefit from a mixture of user controls with varying
granularity, from exact 4D object trajectories and camera paths to coarse text
prompts, while existing video generative models are typically trained for fixed
input formats. We develop a video synthesis method that addresses this need and
generates samples with high controllability for specified elements while
maintaining diversity for under-specified ones. We cast the task as variational
inference to approximate a composed distribution, leveraging multiple video
generation backbones to account for all task constraints collectively. To
address the optimization challenge, we break down the problem into step-wise KL
divergence minimization over an annealed sequence of distributions, and further
propose a context-conditioned factorization technique that reduces modes in the
solution space to circumvent local optima. Experiments suggest that our method
produces samples with improved controllability, diversity, and 3D consistency
compared to prior works.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a hybrid deep learning method (BYOL-CNN) for fault detection in induction motors using thermal images, achieving 99.89% test accuracy and fast inference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Induction motors are critical in industry but are prone to faults causing inefficiency and failures; early fault detection is vital to safeguard their lifespan.

Method: The study integrates BYOL (Bootstrap Your Own Latent) with multiple CNN architectures and introduces a custom lightweight CNN (BYOL-IMNet) tailored for thermal fault classification.

Result: The proposed BYOL-IMNet achieves a high test accuracy of 99.89% and an inference time of 5.7 ms per image, surpassing existing models.

Conclusion: This hybrid BYOL-CNN method is highly effective for accurate and fast fault detection in induction motors, making it suitable for industrial online monitoring.

Abstract: Induction motors (IMs) are indispensable in industrial and daily life, but
they are susceptible to various faults that can lead to overheating, wasted
energy consumption, and service failure. Early detection of faults is essential
to protect the motor and prolong its lifespan. This paper presents a hybrid
method that integrates BYOL with CNNs for classifying thermal images of
induction motors for fault detection. The thermal dataset used in this work
includes different operating states of the motor, such as normal operation,
overload, and faults. We employed multiple deep learning (DL) models for the
BYOL technique, ranging from popular architectures such as ResNet-50,
DenseNet-121, DenseNet-169, EfficientNetB0, VGG16, and MobileNetV2.
Additionally, we introduced a new high-performance yet lightweight CNN model
named BYOL-IMNet, which comprises four custom-designed blocks tailored for
fault classification in thermal images. Our experimental results demonstrate
that the proposed BYOL-IMNet achieves 99.89\% test accuracy and an inference
time of 5.7 ms per image, outperforming state-of-the-art models. This study
highlights the promising performance of the CNN-BYOL hybrid method in enhancing
accuracy for detecting faults in induction motors, offering a robust
methodology for online monitoring in industrial settings.

### [191] [Mutual Learning for Hashing: Unlocking Strong Hash Functions from Weak Supervision](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07703)
*Xiaoxu Ma,Runhao Li,Zhenyu Weng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel mutual learning framework called MLH is proposed to combine strengths of pairwise- and center-based hashing approaches for improved image retrieval performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Pairwise-based hashing methods effectively preserve local similarity, while center-based methods capture global data distribution better but struggle to utilize local information effectively.

Method: MLH employs mutual learning between two branches: a strong center-based branch and a weaker pairwise-based branch. A mixture-of-hash-experts module facilitates cross-branch interactions.

Result: Experiments confirm MLH outperforms existing hashing methods on multiple benchmark datasets, showcasing improved retrieval performance.

Conclusion: MLH successfully combines local and global data learning strengths, advancing performance in large-scale image retrieval.

Abstract: Deep hashing has been widely adopted for large-scale image retrieval, with
numerous strategies proposed to optimize hash function learning. Pairwise-based
methods are effective in learning hash functions that preserve local similarity
relationships, whereas center-based methods typically achieve superior
performance by more effectively capturing global data distributions. However,
the strength of center-based methods in modeling global structures often comes
at the expense of underutilizing important local similarity information. To
address this limitation, we propose Mutual Learning for Hashing (MLH), a novel
weak-to-strong framework that enhances a center-based hashing branch by
transferring knowledge from a weaker pairwise-based branch. MLH consists of two
branches: a strong center-based branch and a weaker pairwise-based branch.
Through an iterative mutual learning process, the center-based branch leverages
local similarity cues learned by the pairwise-based branch. Furthermore,
inspired by the mixture-of-experts paradigm, we introduce a novel
mixture-of-hash-experts module that enables effective cross-branch interaction,
further enhancing the performance of both branches. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that MLH consistently outperforms state-of-the-art hashing methods
across multiple benchmark datasets.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Repainter is a reinforcement learning-based framework for resolving issues in e-commerce product image inpainting, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Intrusive elements like watermarks and promotional text hinder clear product visualization in e-commerce platforms, necessitating effective inpainting solutions.

Method: Repainter uses reinforcement learning with spatial-matting trajectory refinement, group relative policy optimization, and a composite reward system to enhance image inpainting.

Result: It outperforms state-of-the-art methods in handling complex scenes, offering reduced artifacts and better visual quality.

Conclusion: Repainter provides a robust framework for improving product image appeal in e-commerce, complemented by a new dataset and benchmark for evaluation.

Abstract: In web data, product images are central to boosting user engagement and
advertising efficacy on e-commerce platforms, yet the intrusive elements such
as watermarks and promotional text remain major obstacles to delivering clear
and appealing product visuals. Although diffusion-based inpainting methods have
advanced, they still face challenges in commercial settings due to unreliable
object removal and limited domain-specific adaptation. To tackle these
challenges, we propose Repainter, a reinforcement learning framework that
integrates spatial-matting trajectory refinement with Group Relative Policy
Optimization (GRPO). Our approach modulates attention mechanisms to emphasize
background context, generating higher-reward samples and reducing unwanted
object insertion. We also introduce a composite reward mechanism that balances
global, local, and semantic constraints, effectively reducing visual artifacts
and reward hacking. Additionally, we contribute EcomPaint-100K, a high-quality,
large-scale e-commerce inpainting dataset, and a standardized benchmark
EcomPaint-Bench for fair evaluation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
Repainter significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, especially in
challenging scenes with intricate compositions. We will release our code and
weights upon acceptance.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces SyncHuman, a framework combining 2D and 3D generative models for accurate photorealistic 3D human reconstruction from a single image, addressing challenges like self-occlusions and ambiguous poses.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to overcome limitations of prior approaches in reconstructing 3D human meshes from single images, such as inaccuracies in 3D priors and challenges in handling difficult poses and fine details.

Method: SyncHuman integrates a 2D multiview generative model with a 3D native generative model using a pixel-aligned synchronization attention mechanism and feature injection to combine their complementary strengths.

Result: The framework achieves robust and photorealistic 3D human reconstruction with improved geometric accuracy and visual fidelity, as proven through extensive experiments.

Conclusion: SyncHuman demonstrates a promising direction for future 3D mesh generation models by effectively combining 2D and 3D model capabilities.

Abstract: Photorealistic 3D full-body human reconstruction from a single image is a
critical yet challenging task for applications in films and video games due to
inherent ambiguities and severe self-occlusions. While recent approaches
leverage SMPL estimation and SMPL-conditioned image generative models to
hallucinate novel views, they suffer from inaccurate 3D priors estimated from
SMPL meshes and have difficulty in handling difficult human poses and
reconstructing fine details. In this paper, we propose SyncHuman, a novel
framework that combines 2D multiview generative model and 3D native generative
model for the first time, enabling high-quality clothed human mesh
reconstruction from single-view images even under challenging human poses.
Multiview generative model excels at capturing fine 2D details but struggles
with structural consistency, whereas 3D native generative model generates
coarse yet structurally consistent 3D shapes. By integrating the complementary
strengths of these two approaches, we develop a more effective generation
framework. Specifically, we first jointly fine-tune the multiview generative
model and the 3D native generative model with proposed pixel-aligned 2D-3D
synchronization attention to produce geometrically aligned 3D shapes and 2D
multiview images. To further improve details, we introduce a feature injection
mechanism that lifts fine details from 2D multiview images onto the aligned 3D
shapes, enabling accurate and high-fidelity reconstruction. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that SyncHuman achieves robust and photo-realistic 3D
human reconstruction, even for images with challenging poses. Our method
outperforms baseline methods in geometric accuracy and visual fidelity,
demonstrating a promising direction for future 3D generation models.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Gaussian Splatting (GS) struggles with realistic 3D object-scene composition due to baked appearance data. ComGS improves on this by introducing Surface Octahedral Probes (SOPs) for more efficient computation and using selective lighting estimation for better visual harmony and performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the limitations of Gaussian Splatting (GS) in realistic 3D object-scene composition due to baked radiance fields causing inconsistencies and inefficient methods.

Method: The authors introduced Surface Octahedral Probes (SOPs) to facilitate efficient 3D querying and lighting estimation using environment-focused techniques and diffusion models to enhance rendering quality.

Result: ComGS method achieves real-time rendering at 28 FPS, produces visually coherent shadows, and requires minimal editing time (36 seconds). A 2x speedup in reconstruction compared to prior methods is also observed.

Conclusion: ComGS successfully advances realistic 3D object-scene composition by combining efficient computation (via SOPs) and localized lighting estimation methods, achieving high-quality rendering with practicality for real-time use.

Abstract: Gaussian Splatting (GS) enables immersive rendering, but realistic 3D
object-scene composition remains challenging. Baked appearance and shadow
information in GS radiance fields cause inconsistencies when combining objects
and scenes. Addressing this requires relightable object reconstruction and
scene lighting estimation. For relightable object reconstruction, existing
Gaussian-based inverse rendering methods often rely on ray tracing, leading to
low efficiency. We introduce Surface Octahedral Probes (SOPs), which store
lighting and occlusion information and allow efficient 3D querying via
interpolation, avoiding expensive ray tracing. SOPs provide at least a 2x
speedup in reconstruction and enable real-time shadow computation in Gaussian
scenes. For lighting estimation, existing Gaussian-based inverse rendering
methods struggle to model intricate light transport and often fail in complex
scenes, while learning-based methods predict lighting from a single image and
are viewpoint-sensitive. We observe that 3D object-scene composition primarily
concerns the object's appearance and nearby shadows. Thus, we simplify the
challenging task of full scene lighting estimation by focusing on the
environment lighting at the object's placement. Specifically, we capture a 360
degrees reconstructed radiance field of the scene at the location and fine-tune
a diffusion model to complete the lighting. Building on these advances, we
propose ComGS, a novel 3D object-scene composition framework. Our method
achieves high-quality, real-time rendering at around 28 FPS, produces visually
harmonious results with vivid shadows, and requires only 36 seconds for
editing. Code and dataset are available at

### [195] [UltraLED: Learning to See Everything in Ultra-High Dynamic Range Scenes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07741)
*Yuang Meng,Xin Jin,Lina Lei,Chun-Le Guo,Chongyi Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces UltraLED, a framework that reconstructs ultra-high dynamic range (UHDR) scenes using a single short-exposure RAW image, eliminating ghosting and motion blur challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current UHDR reconstruction methods face difficulties with misalignment and ghosting artifacts while addressing both highlight and shadow detail preservation. The authors aim to exploit the strengths of RAW images to overcome these challenges using a simplified approach.

Method: The UltraLED framework includes a two-stage process: (1) exposure correction via a ratio map for balancing dynamic range; (2) brightness-aware RAW denoising to recover details in dark regions. A custom 9-stop bracketing dataset is used for experiments.

Result: UltraLED achieves superior performance compared to existing single-frame UHDR reconstruction approaches, effectively recovering details in both bright and dark regions.

Conclusion: Using a single short-exposure RAW image, UltraLED offers a robust solution for UHDR reconstruction and contributes a valuable dataset and code to the research community.

Abstract: Ultra-high dynamic range (UHDR) scenes exhibit significant exposure
disparities between bright and dark regions. Such conditions are commonly
encountered in nighttime scenes with light sources. Even with standard exposure
settings, a bimodal intensity distribution with boundary peaks often emerges,
making it difficult to preserve both highlight and shadow details
simultaneously. RGB-based bracketing methods can capture details at both ends
using short-long exposure pairs, but are susceptible to misalignment and
ghosting artifacts. We found that a short-exposure image already retains
sufficient highlight detail. The main challenge of UHDR reconstruction lies in
denoising and recovering information in dark regions. In comparison to the RGB
images, RAW images, thanks to their higher bit depth and more predictable noise
characteristics, offer greater potential for addressing this challenge. This
raises a key question: can we learn to see everything in UHDR scenes using only
a single short-exposure RAW image? In this study, we rely solely on a single
short-exposure frame, which inherently avoids ghosting and motion blur, making
it particularly robust in dynamic scenes. To achieve that, we introduce
UltraLED, a two-stage framework that performs exposure correction via a ratio
map to balance dynamic range, followed by a brightness-aware RAW denoiser to
enhance detail recovery in dark regions. To support this setting, we design a
9-stop bracketing pipeline to synthesize realistic UHDR images and contribute a
corresponding dataset based on diverse scenes, using only the shortest exposure
as input for reconstruction. Extensive experiments show that UltraLED
significantly outperforms existing single-frame approaches. Our code and
dataset are made publicly available at

### [196] [DEGS: Deformable Event-based 3D Gaussian Splatting from RGB and Event Stream](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07752)
*Junhao He,Jiaxu Wang,Jia Li,Mingyuan Sun,Qiang Zhang,Jiahang Cao,Ziyi Zhang,Yi Gu,Jingkai Sun,Renjing Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces a novel framework that combines low-framerate RGB videos and high-framerate event streams to optimize dynamic 3D Gaussian Splatting in challenging scenarios with large inter-frame motion.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large inter-frame motions in low-framerate RGB videos create a highly uncertain solution space for reconstructing dynamic 3D Gaussian Splatting. Adding event streams can mitigate this challenge as they capture rapid visual changes and can provide robust motion constraints.

Method: The framework integrates RGB and event modalities by using event motion priors to guide the optimization of deformation fields. It employs an unsupervised fine-tuning (LoCM) framework for event flow estimation, geometry-aware data association for event-Gaussian alignment, and strategies like motion decomposition and inter-frame pseudo-labeling.

Result: Experiments demonstrate that the introduced framework outperforms existing approaches across synthetic and real scenes, effectively optimizing dynamic 3D Gaussian Splatting using both RGB and event data.

Conclusion: Combining low-framerate RGB videos with high-framerate event streams proves to be a powerful approach for reconstructing dynamic 3D Gaussian Splatting, addressing large inter-frame motion challenges effectively.

Abstract: Reconstructing Dynamic 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) from low-framerate RGB
videos is challenging. This is because large inter-frame motions will increase
the uncertainty of the solution space. For example, one pixel in the first
frame might have more choices to reach the corresponding pixel in the second
frame. Event cameras can asynchronously capture rapid visual changes and are
robust to motion blur, but they do not provide color information. Intuitively,
the event stream can provide deterministic constraints for the inter-frame
large motion by the event trajectories. Hence, combining
low-temporal-resolution images with high-framerate event streams can address
this challenge. However, it is challenging to jointly optimize Dynamic 3DGS
using both RGB and event modalities due to the significant discrepancy between
these two data modalities. This paper introduces a novel framework that jointly
optimizes dynamic 3DGS from the two modalities. The key idea is to adopt event
motion priors to guide the optimization of the deformation fields. First, we
extract the motion priors encoded in event streams by using the proposed LoCM
unsupervised fine-tuning framework to adapt an event flow estimator to a
certain unseen scene. Then, we present the geometry-aware data association
method to build the event-Gaussian motion correspondence, which is the primary
foundation of the pipeline, accompanied by two useful strategies, namely motion
decomposition and inter-frame pseudo-label. Extensive experiments show that our
method outperforms existing image and event-based approaches across synthetic
and real scenes and prove that our method can effectively optimize dynamic 3DGS
with the help of event data.

Motivation: The paper aims to enhance brain tumor segmentation accuracy to assist physicians in clinical decision-making and build trust using XAI techniques.

Method: Three deep learning models (UNet, ResUNet, and AttUNet) were trained on the BraTS2020 dataset using the Adam optimizer. Performance was assessed through metrics like Dice, Jaccard scores, and attention-based visualization techniques like Grad-CAM.

Result: ResUNet outperformed other models in Dice and Jaccard similarity scores and showed improved accuracy, recall, and F1 scores. Grad-CAM highlighted tumor subregions, while attention-based visualization analyzed AttUNet modules.

Conclusion: ResUNet is recommended for automated brain tumor segmentation in clinical applications due to its superior performance and explicability using XAI techniques.

Abstract: The current study investigated the use of Explainable Artificial Intelligence
(XAI) to improve the accuracy of brain tumor segmentation in MRI images, with
the goal of assisting physicians in clinical decision-making. The study focused
on applying UNet models for brain tumor segmentation and using the XAI
techniques of Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM) and
attention-based visualization to enhance the understanding of these models.
Three deep learning models - UNet, Residual UNet (ResUNet), and Attention UNet
(AttUNet) - were evaluated to identify the best-performing model. XAI was
employed with the aims of clarifying model decisions and increasing physicians'
trust in these models. We compared the performance of two UNet variants
(ResUNet and AttUNet) with the conventional UNet in segmenting brain tumors
from the BraTS2020 public dataset and analyzed model predictions with Grad-CAM
and attention-based visualization. Using the latest computer hardware, we
trained and validated each model using the Adam optimizer and assessed their
performance with respect to: (i) training, validation, and inference times,
(ii) segmentation similarity coefficients and loss functions, and (iii)
classification performance. Notably, during the final testing phase, ResUNet
outperformed the other models with respect to Dice and Jaccard similarity
scores, as well as accuracy, recall, and F1 scores. Grad-CAM provided
visuospatial insights into the tumor subregions each UNet model focused on
while attention-based visualization provided valuable insights into the working
mechanisms of AttUNet's attention modules. These results demonstrated ResUNet
as the best-performing model and we conclude by recommending its use for
automated brain tumor segmentation in future clinical assessments. Our source

### [198] [GTR-Bench: Evaluating Geo-Temporal Reasoning in Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07791)
*Qinghongbing Xie,Zhaoyuan Xia,Feng Zhu,Lijun Gong,Ziyue Li,Rui Zhao,Long Zeng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces GTR-Bench, a new benchmark designed to test geographic spatial-temporal reasoning capabilities of Visual-Language Models (VLMs) in scenarios requiring integration of maps and videos. Current VLMs perform poorly compared to humans.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper highlights the limitations of existing spatial-temporal benchmarks, which fail to evaluate the geographic perspective of reasoning involving both images/videos and maps. Such analysis is crucial for applications like traffic management and emergency response.

Method: The paper proposes GTR-Bench as a benchmark for measuring geo-temporal reasoning in scenarios requiring multiple perspective switches between maps and videos, joint reasoning across non-overlapping video fields, and spatial-temporal inference over unobserved regions.

Result: Tests on more than 10 popular VLMs show that the best models, such as Gemini-2.5-Pro, achieve only 34.9% accuracy compared to 78.61% for humans. The analysis reveals deficiencies in spatial-temporal context utilization, temporal forecasting, and map-video data alignment.

Conclusion: GTR-Bench underscores the inadequacy of current VLMs in geo-temporal reasoning tasks and aims to guide future research in improving spatial-temporal intelligence capabilities.

Abstract: Recently spatial-temporal intelligence of Visual-Language Models (VLMs) has
attracted much attention due to its importance for Autonomous Driving, Embodied
AI and General Artificial Intelligence. Existing spatial-temporal benchmarks
mainly focus on egocentric perspective reasoning with images/video context, or
geographic perspective reasoning with graphics context (eg. a map), thus fail
to assess VLMs' geographic spatial-temporal intelligence with both images/video
and graphics context, which is important for areas like traffic management and
emergency response. To address the gaps, we introduce Geo-Temporal Reasoning
benchmark (GTR-Bench), a novel challenge for geographic temporal reasoning of
moving targets in a large-scale camera network. GTR-Bench is more challenging
as it requires multiple perspective switches between maps and videos, joint
reasoning across multiple videos with non-overlapping fields of view, and
inference over spatial-temporal regions that are unobserved by any video
context. Evaluations of more than 10 popular VLMs on GTR-Bench demonstrate that
even the best proprietary model, Gemini-2.5-Pro (34.9%), significantly lags
behind human performance (78.61%) on geo-temporal reasoning. Moreover, our
comprehensive analysis on GTR-Bench reveals three primary deficiencies of
current models for geo-temporal reasoning. (1) VLMs' reasoning is impaired by
an imbalanced utilization of spatial-temporal context. (2) VLMs are weak in
temporal forecasting, which leads to worse performance on temporal-emphasized
tasks than on spatial-emphasized tasks. (3) VLMs lack the proficiency to
comprehend or align the map data with multi-view video inputs. We believe
GTR-Bench offers valuable insights and opens up new opportunities for research
and applications in spatial-temporal intelligence. Benchmark and code will be
released at https://github.com/X-Luffy/GTR-Bench.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes a novel dual-phase approach for micro-expression recognition by introducing a Magnitude-Modulated Combined Optical Flow (MM-COF) representation and the FMANet architecture, achieving superior performance on standard benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Micro-expression recognition is essential for applications in psychology, security, and behavioral analysis. However, current methods commonly overlook motion information from the apex-to-offset phase, limiting their effectiveness.

Method: The authors propose MM-COF, a motion representation combining dynamics from both onset-apex and apex-offset phases, and FMANet, an end-to-end network architecture with learnable modules to fuse motion cues and focus on salient facial regions for classification.

Result: Experiments conducted on benchmark datasets (MMEW, SMIC, CASME-II, SAMM) show that the MM-COF representation and FMANet achieve superior performance compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: This paper highlights the effectiveness of incorporating dual-phase motion dynamics and a learnable framework to enhance micro-expression recognition, setting a new benchmark in the field.

Abstract: Facial micro-expressions, characterized by their subtle and brief nature, are
valuable indicators of genuine emotions. Despite their significance in
psychology, security, and behavioral analysis, micro-expression recognition
remains challenging due to the difficulty of capturing subtle facial movements.
Optical flow has been widely employed as an input modality for this task due to
its effectiveness. However, most existing methods compute optical flow only
between the onset and apex frames, thereby overlooking essential motion
information in the apex-to-offset phase. To address this limitation, we first
introduce a comprehensive motion representation, termed Magnitude-Modulated
Combined Optical Flow (MM-COF), which integrates motion dynamics from both
micro-expression phases into a unified descriptor suitable for direct use in
recognition networks. Building upon this principle, we then propose FMANet, a
novel end-to-end neural network architecture that internalizes the dual-phase
analysis and magnitude modulation into learnable modules. This allows the
network to adaptively fuse motion cues and focus on salient facial regions for
classification. Experimental evaluations on the MMEW, SMIC, CASME-II, and SAMM
datasets, widely recognized as standard benchmarks, demonstrate that our
proposed MM-COF representation and FMANet outperforms existing methods,
underscoring the potential of a learnable, dual-phase framework in advancing
micro-expression recognition.

### [200] [An End-to-End Room Geometry Constrained Depth Estimation Framework for Indoor Panorama Images](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07817)
*Kanglin Ning,Ruzhao Chen,Penghong Wang,Xingtao Wang,Ruiqin Xiong,Xiaopeng Fan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a framework for predicting spherical pixel depth from indoor panoramas by leveraging room geometry constraints to improve performance over existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for depth prediction from monocular indoor panoramas prioritize pixel-level accuracy, which often leads to issues like oversmoothing of room corners and sensitivity to noise. The authors aim to address these limitations.

Method: The framework includes a shared feature encoder and task-specific decoders for layout estimation, depth estimation, and background segmentation. It also introduces two novel strategies: a room-geometry-based background depth resolving strategy and a background-segmentation-guided fusion mechanism to integrate room geometry constraints into depth estimation.

Result: The proposed framework outperforms current open-source approaches in terms of performance, as demonstrated experimentally on datasets like Stanford2D3D, Matterport3D, and Structured3D.

Conclusion: By integrating room geometry information into depth prediction tasks, the proposed method significantly enhances depth estimation accuracy and sets a new benchmark in performance for such applications.

Abstract: Predicting spherical pixel depth from monocular $360^{\circ}$ indoor
panoramas is critical for many vision applications. However, existing methods
focus on pixel-level accuracy, causing oversmoothed room corners and noise
sensitivity. In this paper, we propose a depth estimation framework based on
room geometry constraints, which extracts room geometry information through
layout prediction and integrates those information into the depth estimation
process through background segmentation mechanism. At the model level, our
framework comprises a shared feature encoder followed by task-specific decoders
for layout estimation, depth estimation, and background segmentation. The
shared encoder extracts multi-scale features, which are subsequently processed
by individual decoders to generate initial predictions: a depth map, a room
layout map, and a background segmentation map. Furthermore, our framework
incorporates two strategies: a room geometry-based background depth resolving
strategy and a background-segmentation-guided fusion mechanism. The proposed
room-geometry-based background depth resolving strategy leverages the room
layout and the depth decoder's output to generate the corresponding background
depth map. Then, a background-segmentation-guided fusion strategy derives
fusion weights for the background and coarse depth maps from the segmentation
decoder's predictions. Extensive experimental results on the Stanford2D3D,
Matterport3D and Structured3D datasets show that our proposed methods can
achieve significantly superior performance than current open-source methods.

### [201] [Enhancing Visual Prompting through Expanded Transformation Space and Overfitting Mitigation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07823)
*Shohei Enomoto*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes ACAVP, a novel method to improve visual prompting (VP) for image classification by introducing affine and color transformations and leveraging data augmentation to address expressivity and overfitting issues in VP.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to tackle two main deficiencies in traditional visual prompting methods: limited expressivity of additive transformations and susceptibility to overfitting as parameter counts increase.

Method: The proposed ACAVP method introduces affine and color transformations to enhance the expressiveness of visual prompts and employs TrivialAugment as a data augmentation technique to mitigate overfitting during VP training.

Result: ACAVP achieves state-of-the-art performance in visual prompting methods, outperforms linear probing in average accuracy across twelve image classification datasets, and demonstrates greater robustness to distribution shifts, all with minimal computational overhead.

Conclusion: ACAVP significantly enhances the performance and robustness of visual prompting approaches, demonstrating the importance of expressive transformations and effective data augmentation in parameter-efficient model adaptation.

Abstract: Visual prompting (VP) has emerged as a promising parameter-efficient
fine-tuning approach for adapting pre-trained vision models to downstream tasks
without modifying model parameters. Despite offering advantages like negligible
computational overhead and compatibility with black-box models, conventional VP
methods typically achieve lower accuracy than other adaptation approaches. Our
analysis reveals two critical limitations: the restricted expressivity of
simple additive transformation and a tendency toward overfitting when the
parameter count increases. To address these challenges, we propose ACAVP
(Affine, Color, and Additive Visual Prompting), which enhances VP's expressive
power by introducing complementary transformation operations: affine
transformation for creating task-specific prompt regions while preserving
original image information, and color transformation for emphasizing
task-relevant visual features. Additionally, we identify that overfitting is a
critical issue in VP training and introduce TrivialAugment as an effective data
augmentation, which not only benefits our approach but also significantly
improves existing VP methods, with performance gains of up to 12 percentage
points on certain datasets. This demonstrates that appropriate data
augmentation is universally beneficial for VP training. Extensive experiments
across twelve diverse image classification datasets with two different model
architectures demonstrate that ACAVP achieves state-of-the-art accuracy among
VP methods, surpasses linear probing in average accuracy, and exhibits superior
robustness to distribution shifts, all while maintaining minimal computational
overhead during inference.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces MMHOI, a large-scale dataset for the study of complex multi-human multi-object interactions, and proposes MMHOI-Net, a neural network for advanced 3D modeling and interaction analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is the lack of comprehensive benchmarks for capturing the complexity of real-world multi-human multi-object interactions, which involve causal, cooperative, and goal-oriented behaviors.

Method: The paper introduces MMHOI, a dataset with 3D shape and pose annotations along with interaction-related labels, and MMHOI-Net, a transformer-based neural network featuring a dual-patch representation and action recognition for enhanced prediction.

Result: The proposed MMHOI-Net achieves state-of-the-art performance in multi-HOI modeling, outperforming previous approaches in accuracy and 3D reconstruction quality on the MMHOI and CORE4D datasets.

Conclusion: The dataset and methodology presented in the paper significantly advance the field of human-object interaction modeling, providing comprehensive tools for next-generation research in this domain.

Abstract: Real-world scenes often feature multiple humans interacting with multiple
objects in ways that are causal, goal-oriented, or cooperative. Yet existing 3D
human-object interaction (HOI) benchmarks consider only a fraction of these
complex interactions. To close this gap, we present MMHOI -- a large-scale,
Multi-human Multi-object Interaction dataset consisting of images from 12
everyday scenarios. MMHOI offers complete 3D shape and pose annotations for
every person and object, along with labels for 78 action categories and 14
interaction-specific body parts, providing a comprehensive testbed for
next-generation HOI research. Building on MMHOI, we present MMHOI-Net, an
end-to-end transformer-based neural network for jointly estimating human-object
3D geometries, their interactions, and associated actions. A key innovation in
our framework is a structured dual-patch representation for modeling objects
and their interactions, combined with action recognition to enhance the
interaction prediction. Experiments on MMHOI and the recently proposed CORE4D
datasets demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance in
multi-HOI modeling, excelling in both accuracy and reconstruction quality.

### [203] [PrismGS: Physically-Grounded Anti-Aliasing for High-Fidelity Large-Scale 3D Gaussian Splatting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07830)
*Houqiang Zhong,Zhenglong Wu,Sihua Fu,Zihan Zheng,Xin Jin,Xiaoyun Zhang,Li Song,Qiang Hu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces PrismGS, a framework designed to tackle aliasing artifacts and instability in 3D Gaussian rendering for large urban environments, offering state-of-the-art performance in terms of visual quality and rendering stability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address issues of aliasing artifacts like flickering textures and jagged edges when scaling 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) methods to large urban environments, particularly for high-resolution rendering.

Method: The proposed method, PrismGS, employs two key regularizers: pyramidal multi-scale supervision to achieve anti-aliasing and consistency across viewing scales, and size regularization to prevent degenerate geometric primitives by enforcing a minimum bound on Gaussian dimensions.

Result: PrismGS outperformed existing methods such as CityGaussian, demonstrating significant PSNR gains (around 1.5 dB) and superior quality in 4K rendering across various benchmarks like MatrixCity, Mill-19, and UrbanScene3D.

Conclusion: The study concludes that PrismGS is an effective and plug-and-play solution to boost rendering fidelity and stability for large-scale urban environments, significantly overcoming the limitations of previous approaches.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has recently enabled real-time photorealistic
rendering in compact scenes, but scaling to large urban environments introduces
severe aliasing artifacts and optimization instability, especially under
high-resolution (e.g., 4K) rendering. These artifacts, manifesting as
flickering textures and jagged edges, arise from the mismatch between Gaussian
primitives and the multi-scale nature of urban geometry. While existing
``divide-and-conquer'' pipelines address scalability, they fail to resolve this
fidelity gap. In this paper, we propose PrismGS, a physically-grounded
regularization framework that improves the intrinsic rendering behavior of 3D
Gaussians. PrismGS integrates two synergistic regularizers. The first is
pyramidal multi-scale supervision, which enforces consistency by supervising
the rendering against a pre-filtered image pyramid. This compels the model to
learn an inherently anti-aliased representation that remains coherent across
different viewing scales, directly mitigating flickering textures. This is
complemented by an explicit size regularization that imposes a
physically-grounded lower bound on the dimensions of the 3D Gaussians. This
prevents the formation of degenerate, view-dependent primitives, leading to
more stable and plausible geometric surfaces and reducing jagged edges. Our
method is plug-and-play and compatible with existing pipelines. Extensive
experiments on MatrixCity, Mill-19, and UrbanScene3D demonstrate that PrismGS
achieves state-of-the-art performance, yielding significant PSNR gains around
1.5 dB against CityGaussian, while maintaining its superior quality and
robustness under demanding 4K rendering.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces IsoSignVid2Aud, an end-to-end system for translating sign language videos with isolated signs into spoken language audio, achieving competitive accuracy and intelligible speech output.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable seamless communication for hearing- and speech-challenged individuals by translating sign language directly to speech, avoiding intermediate textual representation and issues in multi-stage systems.

Method: The approach integrates an I3D-based feature extraction module, a specialized feature transformation network, an audio generation pipeline, and a novel Non-Maximal Suppression (NMS) algorithm to detect signs temporally.

Result: IsoSignVid2Aud achieved Top-1 accuracies of 72.01% and 78.67% on ASL-Citizen-1500 and WLASL-100 datasets, respectively, with audio quality metrics (PESQ: 2.67, STOI: 0.73) indicating clear and intelligible output.

Conclusion: IsoSignVid2Aud is effective for translating isolated sign language videos to speech, providing potential for educational applications and sign-based interfaces, while addressing latency and error issues in traditional systems.

Abstract: Sign language to spoken language audio translation is important to connect
the hearing- and speech-challenged humans with others. We consider sign
language videos with isolated sign sequences rather than continuous grammatical
signing. Such videos are useful in educational applications and sign prompt
interfaces. Towards this, we propose IsoSignVid2Aud, a novel end-to-end
framework that translates sign language videos with a sequence of possibly
non-grammatic continuous signs to speech without requiring intermediate text
representation, providing immediate communication benefits while avoiding the
latency and cascading errors inherent in multi-stage translation systems. Our
approach combines an I3D-based feature extraction module with a specialized
feature transformation network and an audio generation pipeline, utilizing a
novel Non-Maximal Suppression (NMS) algorithm for the temporal detection of
signs in non-grammatic continuous sequences. Experimental results demonstrate
competitive performance on ASL-Citizen-1500 and WLASL-100 datasets with Top-1
accuracies of 72.01\% and 78.67\%, respectively, and audio quality metrics
(PESQ: 2.67, STOI: 0.73) indicating intelligible speech output. Code is

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AlignGS is a framework leveraging 2D semantic priors for enhancing 3D indoor scene modeling and achieves state-of-the-art geometric accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation stems from addressing challenges in creating semantically rich 3D models from sparse views, especially for applications in AR, VR, and robotics.

Method: The paper proposes AlignGS, an end-to-end framework that optimizes geometry and semantics by incorporating 2D semantic priors for guidance through mechanisms like depth consistency and normal regularization.

Result: AlignGS achieves state-of-the-art performance in novel view synthesis, demonstrating superior geometric accuracy and complete reconstructions in benchmarks.

Conclusion: The study concludes that semantic priors effectively enhance 3D geometric reconstruction from sparse views, validating the role of semantics as a guiding force in the modeling process.

Abstract: The demand for semantically rich 3D models of indoor scenes is rapidly
growing, driven by applications in augmented reality, virtual reality, and
robotics. However, creating them from sparse views remains a challenge due to
geometric ambiguity. Existing methods often treat semantics as a passive
feature painted on an already-formed, and potentially flawed, geometry. We
posit that for robust sparse-view reconstruction, semantic understanding
instead be an active, guiding force. This paper introduces AlignGS, a novel
framework that actualizes this vision by pioneering a synergistic, end-to-end
optimization of geometry and semantics. Our method distills rich priors from 2D
foundation models and uses them to directly regularize the 3D representation
through a set of novel semantic-to-geometry guidance mechanisms, including
depth consistency and multi-faceted normal regularization. Extensive
evaluations on standard benchmarks demonstrate that our approach achieves
state-of-the-art results in novel view synthesis and produces reconstructions
with superior geometric accuracy. The results validate that leveraging semantic
priors as a geometric regularizer leads to more coherent and complete 3D models
from limited input views. Our code is avaliable at

Motivation: To address challenges in automated toxicity testing and improve the efficiency of identifying toxicant-induced changes using machine learning models.

Method: Self-supervised learning techniques were applied to the EmbryoNet dataset to analyze zebrafish embryo phenotypes and distinguish between compound modes-of-action.

Result: Learned representations via self-supervised learning effectively identified toxicant-induced changes and distinguished different compound modes-of-action in the dataset.

Conclusion: Self-supervised learning enhances the automated evaluation process in high-throughput toxicity testing and can be integrated into physical testing devices like the TOXBOX.

Abstract: High-throughput toxicity testing offers a fast and cost-effective way to test
large amounts of compounds. A key component for such systems is the automated
evaluation via machine learning models. In this paper, we address critical
challenges in this domain and demonstrate how representations learned via
self-supervised learning can effectively identify toxicant-induced changes. We
provide a proof-of-concept that utilizes the publicly available EmbryoNet
dataset, which contains ten zebrafish embryo phenotypes elicited by various
chemical compounds targeting different processes in early embryonic
development. Our analysis shows that the learned representations using
self-supervised learning are suitable for effectively distinguishing between
the modes-of-action of different compounds. Finally, we discuss the integration
of machine learning models in a physical toxicity testing device in the context
of the TOXBOX project.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: XYZCylinder introduces a feedforward model to improve view transformation generalization and reconstruction accuracy in driving scenes using cylinder lifting methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the limitations of existing feedforward reconstruction paradigms in generalizing across different camera configurations and achieving high accuracy in complex driving scenes.

Method: A Unified Cylinder Camera Modeling strategy and Cylinder Plane Feature Group modules are proposed to unify camera configurations and lift 2D features to 3D space.

Result: Experimental results indicate that XYZCylinder achieves state-of-the-art performance and can generalize to different driving scenes in a zero-shot manner.

Conclusion: XYZCylinder effectively tackles the challenges in driving scene reconstruction, showcasing both enhanced generalization and reconstruction accuracy.

Abstract: Recently, more attention has been paid to feedforward reconstruction
paradigms, which mainly learn a fixed view transformation implicitly and
reconstruct the scene with a single representation. However, their
generalization capability and reconstruction accuracy are still limited while
reconstructing driving scenes, which results from two aspects: (1) The fixed
view transformation fails when the camera configuration changes, limiting the
generalization capability across different driving scenes equipped with
different camera configurations. (2) The small overlapping regions between
sparse views of the $360^\circ$ panorama and the complexity of driving scenes
increase the learning difficulty, reducing the reconstruction accuracy. To
handle these difficulties, we propose \textbf{XYZCylinder}, a feedforward model
based on a unified cylinder lifting method which involves camera modeling and
feature lifting. Specifically, to improve the generalization capability, we
design a Unified Cylinder Camera Modeling (UCCM) strategy, which avoids the
learning of viewpoint-dependent spatial correspondence and unifies different
camera configurations with adjustable parameters. To improve the reconstruction
accuracy, we propose a hybrid representation with several dedicated modules
based on newly designed Cylinder Plane Feature Group (CPFG) to lift 2D image
features to 3D space. Experimental results show that XYZCylinder achieves
state-of-the-art performance under different evaluation settings, and can be
generalized to other driving scenes in a zero-shot manner. Project page:

TL;DR: The paper introduces Memory-Augmented Reinforcement Learning-based Token Compression (MARC), reducing video model computational demands with minimal accuracy loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Visual language models face computational challenges when adapted to videos due to high frame rates and extended durations.

Method: MARC combines structured retrieval and RL-based distillation with a retrieve-then-compress approach, utilizing Visual Memory Retriever (VMR) and Compression Group Relative Policy Optimization (C-GRPO).

Result: Experiments across six video benchmarks demonstrate MARC reduces visual tokens by 95%, GPU memory by 72%, and latency by 23.9% while maintaining near-baseline accuracy.

Conclusion: MARC improves computational efficiency for video models without significant performance degradation, enabling applications in real-time video tasks under resource constraints.

Abstract: The rapid progress of large language models (LLMs) has laid the foundation
for multimodal models. However, visual language models (VLMs) still face heavy
computational costs when extended from images to videos due to high frame rates
and long durations. Token compression is a promising solution, yet most
existing training-free methods cause information loss and performance
degradation. To overcome this, we propose \textbf{Memory-Augmented
Reinforcement Learning-based Token Compression (MARC)}, which integrates
structured retrieval and RL-based distillation. MARC adopts a
\textit{retrieve-then-compress} strategy using a \textbf{Visual Memory
Retriever (VMR)} to select key clips and a \textbf{Compression Group Relative
Policy Optimization (C-GRPO)} framework to distil reasoning ability from a
teacher to a student model. Experiments on six video benchmarks show that MARC
achieves near-baseline accuracy using only one frame's tokens -- reducing
visual tokens by \textbf{95\%}, GPU memory by \textbf{72\%}, and latency by
\textbf{23.9\%}. This demonstrates its potential for efficient, real-time video
understanding in resource-constrained settings such as video QA, surveillance,

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Anomaly detection in manufacturing faces challenges due to limited abnormal samples and manual annotation costs. Existing anomaly synthesis methods lack systematic evaluation and adaptability.

Method: ASBench benchmarks anomaly synthesis methods using four dimensions: cross-dataset generalization, synthetic-to-real data ratio, correlation between intrinsic metrics and detection performance, and hybrid synthesis strategies.

Result: Extensive experiments using ASBench revealed limitations in current anomaly synthesis methods and the framework provided insights for improvement.

Conclusion: ASBench highlights weaknesses in existing approaches and establishes a foundation for advancements in anomaly synthesis research.

Abstract: Anomaly detection plays a pivotal role in manufacturing quality control, yet
its application is constrained by limited abnormal samples and high manual
annotation costs. While anomaly synthesis offers a promising solution, existing
studies predominantly treat anomaly synthesis as an auxiliary component within
anomaly detection frameworks, lacking systematic evaluation of anomaly
synthesis algorithms. Current research also overlook crucial factors specific
to anomaly synthesis, such as decoupling its impact from detection,
quantitative analysis of synthetic data and adaptability across different
scenarios. To address these limitations, we propose ASBench, the first
comprehensive benchmarking framework dedicated to evaluating anomaly synthesis
methods. Our framework introduces four critical evaluation dimensions: (i) the
generalization performance across different datasets and pipelines (ii) the
ratio of synthetic to real data (iii) the correlation between intrinsic metrics
of synthesis images and anomaly detection performance metrics , and (iv)
strategies for hybrid anomaly synthesis methods. Through extensive experiments,
ASBench not only reveals limitations in current anomaly synthesis methods but
also provides actionable insights for future research directions in anomaly

Motivation: The study is motivated by the need to address shortcomings in open-vocabulary object detection systems, particularly in ambiguous scenarios with multiple candidate objects.

Method: The paper develops an ERU framework, combining LLM-based data augmentation, depth-map modality, and a depth-aware decision module to unify linguistic and embodied cues.

Result: The proposed approach demonstrated better performance compared to existing baselines, leading to more accurate and reliable detection in two tested datasets.

Conclusion: Integrating LLM, depth data, and decision mechanisms significantly enhances disambiguation capabilities, especially in complex or cluttered scenarios.

Abstract: Embodied Reference Understanding requires identifying a target object in a

works have shown progress in open-vocabulary object detection, they often fail
in ambiguous scenarios where multiple candidate objects exist in the scene. To
address these challenges, we propose a novel ERU framework that jointly
leverages LLM-based data augmentation, depth-map modality, and a depth-aware
decision module. This design enables robust integration of linguistic and
embodied cues, improving disambiguation in complex or cluttered environments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current Video Foundation Models (VFMs) excel in visual generation but struggle in maintaining compositional attributes like motion, numeracy, and spatial relations.

Method: TTOM aligns VFM outputs with spatiotemporal layouts by introducing and optimizing new parameters during inference without direct per-sample interventions. It uses a layout-attention objective and incorporates a parametric memory mechanism for historical context management.

Result: TTOM enhances transferability, generalization, and cross-modal alignment in compositional video generation. It shows effectiveness and scalability on benchmarks like T2V-CompBench and Vbench.

Conclusion: TTOM is a practical and efficient solution for improving text-to-video compositional generation by enabling alignment and optimization in streaming video scenarios.

Abstract: Video Foundation Models (VFMs) exhibit remarkable visual generation
performance, but struggle in compositional scenarios (e.g., motion, numeracy,
and spatial relation). In this work, we introduce Test-Time Optimization and
Memorization (TTOM), a training-free framework that aligns VFM outputs with
spatiotemporal layouts during inference for better text-image alignment. Rather
than direct intervention to latents or attention per-sample in existing work,
we integrate and optimize new parameters guided by a general layout-attention
objective. Furthermore, we formulate video generation within a streaming
setting, and maintain historical optimization contexts with a parametric memory
mechanism that supports flexible operations, such as insert, read, update, and
delete. Notably, we found that TTOM disentangles compositional world knowledge,
showing powerful transferability and generalization. Experimental results on
the T2V-CompBench and Vbench benchmarks establish TTOM as an effective,
practical, scalable, and efficient framework to achieve cross-modal alignment
for compositional video generation on the fly.

Motivation: The paper addresses the need for high-fidelity video generation and meaningful information extraction, such as depth estimation, for applications like autonomous driving.

Method: The method involves fine-tuning a VAE with a 4D reconstruction task to encode 3D structures and temporal dynamics, and integrating it into a video diffusion process. A Gaussian Splatting Decoder is also used for dynamic scene reconstruction.

Result: The model shows significant improvements in FID and FVD metrics and effectively provides geometric information for understanding dynamic scenes.

Conclusion: CVD-STORM enhances long-term video generation quality and aids in scene reconstruction, contributing to better understanding of dynamic environments.

Abstract: Generative models have been widely applied to world modeling for environment
simulation and future state prediction. With advancements in autonomous
driving, there is a growing demand not only for high-fidelity video generation
under various controls, but also for producing diverse and meaningful
information such as depth estimation. To address this, we propose CVD-STORM, a
cross-view video diffusion model utilizing a spatial-temporal reconstruction
Variational Autoencoder (VAE) that generates long-term, multi-view videos with
4D reconstruction capabilities under various control inputs. Our approach first
fine-tunes the VAE with an auxiliary 4D reconstruction task, enhancing its
ability to encode 3D structures and temporal dynamics. Subsequently, we
integrate this VAE into the video diffusion process to significantly improve
generation quality. Experimental results demonstrate that our model achieves
substantial improvements in both FID and FVD metrics. Additionally, the
jointly-trained Gaussian Splatting Decoder effectively reconstructs dynamic

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces "Gaze on the Prize," a visual RL framework integrating a learnable attention mechanism inspired by human foveation to improve efficiency by focusing on task-relevant features, achieving better sample efficiency and solving tasks baseline methods fail.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Visual RL agents struggle with sample inefficiency due to irrelevant high-dimensional image features. The motivation is to design a method to improve computational focus on task-relevant aspects, inspired by human foveation.

Method: The proposed method uses a foveal attention mechanism trained via return-guided contrastive learning. It creates contrastive triplets based on return differences to differentiate between task-relevant and irrelevant features.

Result: "Gaze on the Prize" achieved up to 2.4x improvement in sample efficiency and successfully solved manipulation tasks in the ManiSkill3 benchmark that the baseline methods failed to learn.

Conclusion: The framework enhances visual RL by prioritizing task-relevant features, leading to better efficiency and stability without altering underlying algorithms or hyperparameters.

Abstract: Visual Reinforcement Learning (RL) agents must learn to act based on
high-dimensional image data where only a small fraction of the pixels is
task-relevant. This forces agents to waste exploration and computational
resources on irrelevant features, leading to sample-inefficient and unstable
learning. To address this, inspired by human visual foveation, we introduce
Gaze on the Prize. This framework augments visual RL with a learnable foveal
attention mechanism (Gaze), guided by a self-supervised signal derived from the
agent's experience pursuing higher returns (the Prize). Our key insight is that
return differences reveal what matters most: If two similar representations
produce different outcomes, their distinguishing features are likely
task-relevant, and the gaze should focus on them accordingly. This is realized
through return-guided contrastive learning that trains the attention to
distinguish between the features relevant to success and failure. We group
similar visual representations into positives and negatives based on their
return differences and use the resulting labels to construct contrastive
triplets. These triplets provide the training signal that teaches the attention
mechanism to produce distinguishable representations for states associated with
different outcomes. Our method achieves up to 2.4x improvement in sample
efficiency and can solve tasks that the baseline fails to learn, demonstrated
across a suite of manipulation tasks from the ManiSkill3 benchmark, all without
modifying the underlying algorithm or hyperparameters.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the gap in text detection datasets that are optimized for natural or document scenes but not for anime, where text styles, arrangement, and appearances are highly irregular and challenging.

Method: The study introduces AnimeText, a dataset with hierarchical annotations and hard negative samples to cater to the unique text characteristics in anime scenes. Cross-dataset benchmarking was conducted using state-of-the-art text detection methods.

Result: Models trained on AnimeText demonstrated superior performance in anime text detection tasks compared to those trained on existing datasets.

Conclusion: AnimeText significantly advances text detection in complex anime scenes, proving robust and effective compared to traditional datasets.

Abstract: Current text detection datasets primarily target natural or document scenes,
where text typically appear in regular font and shapes, monotonous colors, and
orderly layouts. The text usually arranged along straight or curved lines.
However, these characteristics differ significantly from anime scenes, where
text is often diverse in style, irregularly arranged, and easily confused with
complex visual elements such as symbols and decorative patterns. Text in anime
scene also includes a large number of handwritten and stylized fonts. Motivated
by this gap, we introduce AnimeText, a large-scale dataset containing 735K
images and 4.2M annotated text blocks. It features hierarchical annotations and
hard negative samples tailored for anime scenarios. %Cross-dataset evaluations
using state-of-the-art methods demonstrate that models trained on AnimeText
achieve superior performance in anime text detection tasks compared to existing
datasets. To evaluate the robustness of AnimeText in complex anime scenes, we
conducted cross-dataset benchmarking using state-of-the-art text detection
methods. Experimental results demonstrate that models trained on AnimeText
outperform those trained on existing datasets in anime scene text detection
tasks. AnimeText on HuggingFace:

*Nikolaos Stathoulopoulos,Christoforos Kanellakis,George Nikolakopoulos*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a deep compression method for 3D point clouds using semantic scene graphs, achieving up to 98% compression while maintaining structural and semantic fidelity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in transmitting complex 3D point cloud data under bandwidth constraints and connectivity issues in multi-agent robotic systems.

Method: A deep compression framework based on semantic scene graphs with semantic-aware encoders conditioned by FiLM and a folding-based decoder guided by latent features and graph node attributes.

Result: Achieves up to 98% data compression while maintaining structural and semantic fidelity, and supports downstream tasks like pose graph optimization and map merging.

Conclusion: The method is effective for compressing 3D point clouds without losing critical information, enhancing multi-agent robotic system performance and enabling efficient resource use.

Abstract: Efficient transmission of 3D point cloud data is critical for advanced
perception in centralized and decentralized multi-agent robotic systems,
especially nowadays with the growing reliance on edge and cloud-based
processing. However, the large and complex nature of point clouds creates
challenges under bandwidth constraints and intermittent connectivity, often
degrading system performance. We propose a deep compression framework based on
semantic scene graphs. The method decomposes point clouds into semantically
coherent patches and encodes them into compact latent representations with
semantic-aware encoders conditioned by Feature-wise Linear Modulation (FiLM). A
folding-based decoder, guided by latent features and graph node attributes,
enables structurally accurate reconstruction. Experiments on the SemanticKITTI
and nuScenes datasets show that the framework achieves state-of-the-art
compression rates, reducing data size by up to 98% while preserving both
structural and semantic fidelity. In addition, it supports downstream
applications such as multi-robot pose graph optimization and map merging,
achieving trajectory accuracy and map alignment comparable to those obtained
with raw LiDAR scans.

*Yifang Yin,Shengkai Chen,Yiyao Li,Lu Wang,Ruibing Jin,Wei Cui,Shili Xiang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper improves precipitation nowcasting using advanced training techniques and integrates deterministic and probabilistic models, achieving state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to improve precipitation nowcasting accuracy given its critical societal impact in areas like disaster management, agriculture, transportation, and energy optimization.

Method: The paper proposes SimCast, a training pipeline using short-to-long term knowledge distillation and weighted MSE loss, alongside CasCast, which integrates deterministic predictions into a diffusion-based probabilistic framework.

Result: SimCast and CasCast achieve improved nowcasting performances, validated by experiments on benchmark datasets SEVIR, HKO-7, and MeteoNet, with mean CSI scores of 0.452, 0.474, and 0.361 respectively, outperforming existing models.

Conclusion: The integration of deterministic and probabilistic modeling strengthens nowcasting accuracy, addressing issues like blurriness and distribution shifts while offering significant advancements over prior approaches.

Abstract: Precipitation nowcasting predicts future radar sequences based on current
observations, which is a highly challenging task driven by the inherent
complexity of the Earth system. Accurate nowcasting is of utmost importance for
addressing various societal needs, including disaster management, agriculture,
transportation, and energy optimization. As a complementary to existing
non-autoregressive nowcasting approaches, we investigate the impact of
prediction horizons on nowcasting models and propose SimCast, a novel training
pipeline featuring a short-to-long term knowledge distillation technique
coupled with a weighted MSE loss to prioritize heavy rainfall regions. Improved
nowcasting predictions can be obtained without introducing additional overhead
during inference. As SimCast generates deterministic predictions, we further
integrate it into a diffusion-based framework named CasCast, leveraging the
strengths from probabilistic models to overcome limitations such as blurriness
and distribution shift in deterministic outputs. Extensive experimental results
on three benchmark datasets validate the effectiveness of the proposed
framework, achieving mean CSI scores of 0.452 on SEVIR, 0.474 on HKO-7, and
0.361 on MeteoNet, which outperforms existing approaches by a significant
margin.

*Yunzhe Xu,Yiyuan Pan,Zhe Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces Memoir, a novel approach for memory-persistent Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) that uses imagination-driven memory retrieval, improving navigation through environmental and behavioral memory use.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address key limitations in memory-persistent Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN), especially the lack of effective memory retrieval mechanisms and the neglect of navigation behavioral patterns essential for decision-making.

Method: The proposed method utilizes a language-conditioned world model for imagining future states, Hybrid Viewpoint-Level Memory to anchor observations and behaviors, and an experience-augmented navigation model for integrating retrieved knowledge.

Result: Memoir demonstrated significant improvements across all tested scenarios, including a 5.4% SPL gain on IR2R compared to prior baselines, 8.3x faster training, and 74% reduced inference memory usage.

Conclusion: Memoir validates the importance of predictive retrieval of environmental and behavioral memories for VLN tasks and demonstrates high effectiveness with room for further improvements in the imagination-guided framework.

Abstract: Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) requires agents to follow natural
language instructions through environments, with memory-persistent variants
demanding progressive improvement through accumulated experience. Existing
approaches for memory-persistent VLN face critical limitations: they lack
effective memory access mechanisms, instead relying on entire memory
incorporation or fixed-horizon lookup, and predominantly store only
environmental observations while neglecting navigation behavioral patterns that
encode valuable decision-making strategies. We present Memoir, which employs
imagination as a retrieval mechanism grounded by explicit memory: a world model
imagines future navigation states as queries to selectively retrieve relevant
environmental observations and behavioral histories. The approach comprises: 1)
a language-conditioned world model that imagines future states serving dual
purposes: encoding experiences for storage and generating retrieval queries; 2)
Hybrid Viewpoint-Level Memory that anchors both observations and behavioral
patterns to viewpoints, enabling hybrid retrieval; and 3) an
experience-augmented navigation model that integrates retrieved knowledge
through specialized encoders. Extensive evaluation across diverse
memory-persistent VLN benchmarks with 10 distinctive testing scenarios
demonstrates Memoir's effectiveness: significant improvements across all
scenarios, with 5.4% SPL gains on IR2R over the best memory-persistent
baseline, accompanied by 8.3x training speedup and 74% inference memory
reduction. The results validate that predictive retrieval of both environmental
and behavioral memories enables more effective navigation, with analysis
indicating substantial headroom (73.3% vs 93.4% upper bound) for this
imagination-guided paradigm. Code at https://github.com/xyz9911/Memoir.

*Yidi Liu,Xueyang Fu,Jie Huang,Jie Xiao,Dong Li,Wenlong Zhang,Lei Bai,Zheng-Jun Zha*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes 'Latent Harmony,' a two-stage framework for improving Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) in Ultra-High Definition (UHD) image restoration. It enhances computational efficiency and high-frequency detail retention while balancing reconstruction fidelity and perceptual quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address the inefficiency and loss of high-frequency information in current VAEs, which are not fully effective for UHD image restoration.

Method: Stage One introduces LH-VAE with visual semantic constraints and latent equivariance. Stage Two integrates a restoration model equipped with High-Frequency Low-Rank Adaptation (HF-LoRA) aligned to fidelity/perception losses. Alternating optimization and selective gradient propagation are used to preserve structure.

Result: Experiments demonstrate that Latent Harmony achieves state-of-the-art performance in balancing efficiency, perceptual quality, and reconstruction accuracy for both UHD and standard-resolution tasks.

Conclusion: The Latent Harmony framework redefines VAEs to make them more suitable for UHD image restoration, providing flexibility in fidelity-perception trade-offs and improving both efficiency and quality.

Abstract: Ultra-High Definition (UHD) image restoration faces a trade-off between
computational efficiency and high-frequency detail retention. While Variational
Autoencoders (VAEs) improve efficiency via latent-space processing, their
Gaussian constraint often discards degradation-specific high-frequency
information, hurting reconstruction fidelity. To overcome this, we propose
Latent Harmony, a two-stage framework that redefines VAEs for UHD restoration
by jointly regularizing the latent space and enforcing high-frequency-aware
reconstruction.In Stage One, we introduce LH-VAE, which enhances semantic
robustness through visual semantic constraints and progressive degradation
perturbations, while latent equivariance strengthens high-frequency
reconstruction.Stage Two jointly trains this refined VAE with a restoration
model using High-Frequency Low-Rank Adaptation (HF-LoRA): an encoder LoRA
guided by a fidelity-oriented high-frequency alignment loss to recover
authentic details, and a decoder LoRA driven by a perception-oriented loss to
synthesize realistic textures. Both LoRA modules are trained via alternating
optimization with selective gradient propagation to preserve the pretrained
latent structure.At inference, a tunable parameter {\alpha} enables flexible
fidelity-perception trade-offs.Experiments show Latent Harmony achieves
state-of-the-art performance across UHD and standard-resolution tasks,
effectively balancing efficiency, perceptual quality, and reconstruction
accuracy.

### [219] [ResAD: Normalized Residual Trajectory Modeling for End-to-End Autonomous Driving](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08562)
*Zhiyu Zheng,Shaoyu Chen,Haoran Yin,Xinbang Zhang,Jialv Zou,Xinggang Wang,Qian Zhang,Lefei Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes ResAD, a framework to improve end-to-end autonomous driving (E2EAD) performance by addressing trajectory data imbalances and emphasizing causal inference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: End-to-end autonomous driving systems struggle with spatio-temporal imbalance in trajectory data, leading to suboptimal learning, such as spurious correlations and unsafe priorities.

Method: ResAD reframes the prediction task as learning residual deviations from an inertial reference path and employs point-wise normalization to balance optimization across trajectory points.

Result: ResAD achieves a state-of-the-art score of 88.6 on the NAVSIM benchmark using a simpler learning model, demonstrating its effectiveness in improving prediction and optimization.

Conclusion: The proposed ResAD framework simplifies the learning task of E2EAD systems by enhancing causal inference and balancing optimization, leading to superior performance. The code will be made available for further research.

Abstract: End-to-end autonomous driving (E2EAD) systems, which learn to predict future
trajectories directly from sensor data, are fundamentally challenged by the
inherent spatio-temporal imbalance of trajectory data. This imbalance creates a
significant optimization burden, causing models to learn spurious correlations
instead of causal inference, while also prioritizing uncertain, distant
predictions, thereby compromising immediate safety. To address these issues, we
propose ResAD, a novel Normalized Residual Trajectory Modeling framework.
Instead of predicting the future trajectory directly, our approach reframes the
learning task to predict the residual deviation from a deterministic inertial
reference. The inertial reference serves as a counterfactual, forcing the model
to move beyond simple pattern recognition and instead identify the underlying
causal factors (e.g., traffic rules, obstacles) that necessitate deviations
from a default, inertially-guided path. To deal with the optimization imbalance
caused by uncertain, long-term horizons, ResAD further incorporates Point-wise
Normalization of the predicted residual. It re-weights the optimization
objective, preventing large-magnitude errors associated with distant, uncertain
waypoints from dominating the learning signal. Extensive experiments validate
the effectiveness of our framework. On the NAVSIM benchmark, ResAD achieves a
state-of-the-art PDMS of 88.6 using a vanilla diffusion policy with only two
denoising steps, demonstrating that our approach significantly simplifies the
learning task and improves model performance. The code will be released to
facilitate further research.

### [220] [The impact of abstract and object tags on image privacy classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07976)
*Darya Baranouskaya,Andrea Cavallaro*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper investigates the utility of object and abstract tags in image privacy classification, finding that abstract tags are more effective in limited budgets while object tags perform well with larger tag quantities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the role of different tag types (object vs. abstract) in tasks requiring subjective scene understanding, specifically image privacy classification.

Method: An analysis comparing the efficacy of object tags and abstract tags under varying tag budgets for image privacy classification tasks.

Result: Abstract tags excel in scenarios with limited tag availability, while object-related tags are equally effective when larger tag quantities are accessible.

Conclusion: The findings suggest that both tag types have their strengths depending on the context and quantity available, guiding future research for more precise image privacy classifiers.

Abstract: Object tags denote concrete entities and are central to many computer vision
tasks, whereas abstract tags capture higher-level information, which is
relevant for tasks that require a contextual, potentially subjective scene
understanding. Object and abstract tags extracted from images also facilitate
interpretability. In this paper, we explore which type of tags is more suitable
for the context-dependent and inherently subjective task of image privacy.
While object tags are generally used for privacy classification, we show that
abstract tags are more effective when the tag budget is limited. Conversely,
when a larger number of tags per image is available, object-related information
is as useful. We believe that these findings will guide future research in
developing more accurate image privacy classifiers, informed by the role of tag
types and quantity.

*Chandresh Sutariya,Nitin Singh*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper examines the trade-off between performance and efficiency in low-light image processing, comparing the Transformer-based SwinIR model and a lightweight CNN.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenges of restoring high-frequency details and suppressing noise in low-light imagery efficiently.

Method: Comparison of a state-of-the-art Transformer model (SwinIR) and a lightweight CNN in terms of Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR), training epochs, and model size.

Result: SwinIR achieves a PSNR of 39.03 dB but requires 132 training epochs and is large in size. The CNN achieves a PSNR of 37.4 dB in just 10 training epochs and is over 55 times smaller.

Conclusion: The CNN offers a highly efficient alternative with competitive performance, making it suitable for resource-constrained scenarios.

Abstract: The simultaneous restoration of high-frequency details and suppression of
severe noise in low-light imagery presents a significant and persistent
challenge in computer vision. While large-scale Transformer models like SwinIR
have set the state of the art in performance, their high computational cost can
be a barrier for practical applications. This paper investigates the critical
trade-off between performance and efficiency by comparing the state-of-the-art
SwinIR model against a standard, lightweight Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
on this challenging task. Our experimental results reveal a nuanced but
important finding. While the Transformer-based SwinIR model achieves a higher
peak performance, with a Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) of 39.03 dB, the
lightweight CNN delivers a surprisingly competitive PSNR of 37.4 dB. Crucially,
the CNN reached this performance after converging in only 10 epochs of
training, whereas the more complex SwinIR model required 132 epochs. This
efficiency is further underscored by the model's size; the CNN is over 55 times
smaller than SwinIR. This work demonstrates that a standard CNN can provide a
near state-of-the-art result with significantly lower computational overhead,
presenting a compelling case for its use in real-world scenarios where resource
constraints are a primary concern.

TL;DR: This paper introduces GraphEnet, a first-of-its-kind Graph Neural Network (GNN) designed to use event camera outputs for high-frequency 2D human pose estimation, leveraging sparse event data and releasing open-source code.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper seeks to capitalize on the advantages of event-based cameras, such as low latency and energy efficiency, for applications where resources like power and real-time performance are critical, e.g., mobile robotics and portable electronics.

Method: The proposed GraphEnet uses an intermediate line-based event representation combined with a novel offset vector learning mechanism and confidence-based pooling within a Graph Neural Network framework.

Result: GraphEnet successfully provides high-frequency human pose estimation from sparse event data, demonstrating the capability of GNNs to work with event-based information.

Conclusion: This work pioneers the application of GNNs in human pose estimation using event camera data, enabling resource-efficient solutions for human-machine interaction tasks.

Abstract: Human Pose Estimation is a crucial module in human-machine interaction
applications and, especially since the rise in deep learning technology, robust
methods are available to consumers using RGB cameras and commercial GPUs. On
the other hand, event-based cameras have gained popularity in the vision
research community for their low latency and low energy advantages that make
them ideal for applications where those resources are constrained like portable
electronics and mobile robots. In this work we propose a Graph Neural Network,
GraphEnet, that leverages the sparse nature of event camera output, with an
intermediate line based event representation, to estimate 2D Human Pose of a
single person at a high frequency. The architecture incorporates a novel offset
vector learning paradigm with confidence based pooling to estimate the human
pose. This is the first work that applies Graph Neural Networks to event data
for Human Pose Estimation. The code is open-source at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces CIR-CoT, an end-to-end model integrating explicit Chain-of-Thought reasoning for improved Composed Image Retrieval (CIR).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the opacity in current CIR models that limits understanding of retrieval rationale and fine-grained instruction following.

Method: Develop CIR-CoT, which incorporates structured reasoning chains and fine-tuning, supported by creating new reasoning annotations.

Result: CIR-CoT achieves competitive results on FashionIQ and CIRR datasets, and generalizes well to the out-of-domain CIRCO dataset.

Conclusion: CIR-CoT improves CIR accuracy and enhances transparency, paving the way for more effective and interpretable retrieval systems.

Abstract: Composed Image Retrieval (CIR), which aims to find a target image from a
reference image and a modification text, presents the core challenge of
performing unified reasoning across visual and semantic modalities. While
current approaches based on Vision-Language Models (VLMs, e.g., CLIP) and more
recent Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs, e.g., Qwen-VL) have shown
progress, they predominantly function as ``black boxes." This inherent opacity
not only prevents users from understanding the retrieval rationale but also
restricts the models' ability to follow complex, fine-grained instructions. To
overcome these limitations, we introduce CIR-CoT, the first end-to-end
retrieval-oriented MLLM designed to integrate explicit Chain-of-Thought (CoT)
reasoning. By compelling the model to first generate an interpretable reasoning
chain, CIR-CoT enhances its ability to capture crucial cross-modal
interactions, leading to more accurate retrieval while making its decision
process transparent. Since existing datasets like FashionIQ and CIRR lack the
necessary reasoning data, a key contribution of our work is the creation of
structured CoT annotations using a three-stage process involving a caption,
reasoning, and conclusion. Our model is then fine-tuned to produce this
structured output before encoding its final retrieval intent into a dedicated
embedding. Comprehensive experiments show that CIR-CoT achieves highly
competitive performance on in-domain datasets (FashionIQ, CIRR) and
demonstrates remarkable generalization on the out-of-domain CIRCO dataset,
establishing a new path toward more effective and trustworthy retrieval
systems.

TL;DR: This paper introduces RayFusion, a new fusion method for collaborative visual perception that improves depth estimation and detection accuracy in camera-based systems for autonomous driving.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study addresses the limitations of camera-based perception systems, which lack explicit depth information, leading to challenges in depth estimation and accurate predictions in 3D object detection.

Method: RayFusion is developed as a ray-based fusion method that utilizes ray occupancy information shared between collaborators to reduce redundancy and false-positive predictions along camera rays.

Result: Experiments prove RayFusion's consistent improvement over state-of-the-art models, boosting the reliability and performance of collaborative visual perception systems.

Conclusion: RayFusion significantly enhances depth estimation and detection accuracy in collaborative camera-based perception systems, advancing the autonomous driving field. Implementation is openly shared on GitHub.

Abstract: Collaborative visual perception methods have gained widespread attention in
the autonomous driving community in recent years due to their ability to
address sensor limitation problems. However, the absence of explicit depth
information often makes it difficult for camera-based perception systems, e.g.,
3D object detection, to generate accurate predictions. To alleviate the
ambiguity in depth estimation, we propose RayFusion, a ray-based fusion method
for collaborative visual perception. Using ray occupancy information from
collaborators, RayFusion reduces redundancy and false positive predictions
along camera rays, enhancing the detection performance of purely camera-based
collaborative perception systems. Comprehensive experiments show that our
method consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art models, substantially
advancing the performance of collaborative visual perception. The code is

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces RASALoRE, a new framework for detecting brain anomalies in MRI scans using weak supervision, achieving state-of-the-art results with low model complexity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Brain MRI anomaly detection relying on weak labels like slice-level annotations needs robust solutions to circumvent the lack of pixel-level precision.

Method: RASALoRE employs a two-stage framework: (1) Generating pseudo masks with Discriminative Dual Prompt Tuning based on weak labels, and (2) using a segmentation network enhanced by region-aware spatial attention and location-based embeddings.

Result: RASALoRE outperformed existing methods on multiple datasets (BraTS20, BraTS21, BraTS23, MSD), achieving significant computational efficiency with under 8 million model parameters.

Conclusion: The proposed framework not only advances state-of-the-art performance in WSAD but also offers reduced computational demands, making it practical and efficient for widespread use.

Abstract: Weakly Supervised Anomaly detection (WSAD) in brain MRI scans is an important
challenge useful to obtain quick and accurate detection of brain anomalies when
precise pixel-level anomaly annotations are unavailable and only weak labels
(e.g., slice-level) are available. In this work, we propose RASALoRE: Region
Aware Spatial Attention with Location-based Random Embeddings, a novel
two-stage WSAD framework. In the first stage, we introduce a Discriminative
Dual Prompt Tuning (DDPT) mechanism that generates high-quality pseudo weak
masks based on slice-level labels, serving as coarse localization cues. In the
second stage, we propose a segmentation network with a region-aware spatial
attention mechanism that relies on fixed location-based random embeddings. This
design enables the model to effectively focus on anomalous regions. Our
approach achieves state-of-the-art anomaly detection performance, significantly
outperforming existing WSAD methods while utilizing less than 8 million
parameters. Extensive evaluations on the BraTS20, BraTS21, BraTS23, and MSD
datasets demonstrate a substantial performance improvement coupled with a
significant reduction in computational complexity. Code is available at:

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RetouchLLM is a training-free, interpretable image retouching system that mimics human multi-step retouching, enabling diverse and user-specific adjustments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations of existing image retouching frameworks, which rely on large-scale paired data, lack interpretability, and struggle with user-specific adjustments.

Method: RetouchLLM uses a visual critic to identify differences between input and reference images and a code generator to create executable, interpretable retouching codes.

Result: Experiments confirm that RetouchLLM generalizes effectively across various retouching styles while its natural language interface enables user-controlled adjustments.

Conclusion: RetouchLLM represents a significant step forward by eliminating training data requirements, enhancing interpretability, and enabling personalized image retouching.

Abstract: Image retouching not only enhances visual quality but also serves as a means
of expressing personal preferences and emotions. However, existing
learning-based approaches require large-scale paired data and operate as black
boxes, making the retouching process opaque and limiting their adaptability to
handle diverse, user- or image-specific adjustments. In this work, we propose
RetouchLLM, a training-free white-box image retouching system, which requires
no training data and performs interpretable, code-based retouching directly on
high-resolution images. Our framework progressively enhances the image in a
manner similar to how humans perform multi-step retouching, allowing
exploration of diverse adjustment paths. It comprises of two main modules: a
visual critic that identifies differences between the input and reference
images, and a code generator that produces executable codes. Experiments
demonstrate that our approach generalizes well across diverse retouching
styles, while natural language-based user interaction enables interpretable and
controllable adjustments tailored to user intent.

### [227] [A class-driven hierarchical ResNet for classification of multispectral remote sensing images](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08060)
*Giulio Weikmann,Gianmarco Perantoni,Lorenzo Bruzzone*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a multitemporal hierarchical ResNet for classifying multispectral image time series, using a modified ResNet architecture to classify at multiple semantic levels and improve detailed class recognition.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to improve the discrimination and classification of hierarchical semantic classes in multispectral time-series images, particularly for specific classes in data-limited scenarios.

Method: The method modifies the ResNet with branches for hierarchical levels, uses hierarchy-penalty maps to discourage incoherent transitions, trains layers progressively for general to specific classes, and fine-tunes the modular network for adaptation.

Result: Experimental results on Sentinel 2 data from the Amazonian Forest show effective generalization across levels, accurate micro-class classification on new areas, and better representation of minoritarian classes.

Conclusion: The hierarchical approach improves classification accuracy, offers modular adaptability, and is especially effective for detailed classification levels and scenarios with limited training data.

Abstract: This work presents a multitemporal class-driven hierarchical Residual Neural
Network (ResNet) designed for modelling the classification of Time Series (TS)
of multispectral images at different semantical class levels. The architecture
consists of a modification of the ResNet where we introduce additional branches
to perform the classification at the different hierarchy levels and leverage on
hierarchy-penalty maps to discourage incoherent hierarchical transitions within
the classification. In this way, we improve the discrimination capabilities of
classes at different levels of semantic details and train a modular
architecture that can be used as a backbone network for introducing new
specific classes and additional tasks considering limited training samples
available. We exploit the class-hierarchy labels to train efficiently the
different layers of the architecture, allowing the first layers to train faster
on the first levels of the hierarchy modeling general classes (i.e., the
macro-classes) and the intermediate classes, while using the last ones to
discriminate more specific classes (i.e., the micro-classes). In this way, the
targets are constrained in following the hierarchy defined, improving the
classification of classes at the most detailed level. The proposed modular
network has intrinsic adaptation capability that can be obtained through fine
tuning. The experimental results, obtained on two tiles of the Amazonian Forest
on 12 monthly composites of Sentinel 2 images acquired during 2019, demonstrate
the effectiveness of the hierarchical approach in both generalizing over
different hierarchical levels and learning discriminant features for an
accurate classification at the micro-class level on a new target area, with a
better representation of the minoritarian classes.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces RedFace, a dataset comprising over 60,000 deepfake facial images and 1,000 videos designed to bridge the gap between academic and real-world applications in deepfake detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the limitations of existing benchmarks, which lack specificity, diversity, and real-world applicability, in evaluating deepfake detection methods.

Method: The authors created the RedFace dataset by using 9 commercial online platforms and bespoke algorithms to generate realistic deepfakes, simulating real-world black-box conditions.

Result: Experiments on RedFace demonstrate weaknesses in current deepfake detection methods and highlight the dataset's relevance for real-world application. Detailed analyses validate the dataset's impact compared to traditional benchmarks.

Conclusion: RedFace effectively bridges the gap between academic and real-world deepfake detection, providing a more comprehensive evaluation and facilitating advancements in the field.

Abstract: Deepfakes, leveraging advanced AIGC (Artificial Intelligence-Generated
Content) techniques, create hyper-realistic synthetic images and videos of
human faces, posing a significant threat to the authenticity of social media.
While this real-world threat is increasingly prevalent, existing academic
evaluations and benchmarks for detecting deepfake forgery often fall short to
achieve effective application for their lack of specificity, limited deepfake
diversity, restricted manipulation techniques.To address these limitations, we
introduce RedFace (Real-world-oriented Deepfake Face), a specialized facial
deepfake dataset, comprising over 60,000 forged images and 1,000 manipulated
videos derived from authentic facial features, to bridge the gap between
academic evaluations and real-world necessity. Unlike prior benchmarks, which
typically rely on academic methods to generate deepfakes, RedFace utilizes 9
commercial online platforms to integrate the latest deepfake technologies found
"in the wild", effectively simulating real-world black-box scenarios.Moreover,
RedFace's deepfakes are synthesized using bespoke algorithms, allowing it to
capture diverse and evolving methods used by real-world deepfake creators.
Extensive experimental results on RedFace (including cross-domain,
intra-domain, and real-world social network dissemination simulations) verify
the limited practicality of existing deepfake detection schemes against
real-world applications. We further perform a detailed analysis of the RedFace
dataset, elucidating the reason of its impact on detection performance compared
to conventional datasets. Our dataset is available at:

TL;DR: The paper introduces NSG-VD, a physics-driven detection framework for AI-generated videos that leverages Normalized Spatiotemporal Gradient to detect deviations from natural video dynamics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The emergence of near-perfect AI-generated videos presents challenges in detecting anomalies required to maintain trust and security in digital media.

Method: The paper employs a physics-driven detection paradigm using Normalized Spatiotemporal Gradient (NSG) and Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) metrics to identify deviations in AI-generated video dynamics.

Result: Extensive experiments show that NSG-VD outperforms existing detection methods by 16% in Recall and 10.75% in F1-Score.

Conclusion: NSG-VD successfully detects AI-generated videos by identifying amplified discrepancies in their distribution compared to real videos.

Abstract: AI-generated videos have achieved near-perfect visual realism (e.g., Sora),
urgently necessitating reliable detection mechanisms. However, detecting such
videos faces significant challenges in modeling high-dimensional spatiotemporal
dynamics and identifying subtle anomalies that violate physical laws. In this
paper, we propose a physics-driven AI-generated video detection paradigm based
on probability flow conservation principles. Specifically, we propose a
statistic called Normalized Spatiotemporal Gradient (NSG), which quantifies the
ratio of spatial probability gradients to temporal density changes, explicitly
capturing deviations from natural video dynamics. Leveraging pre-trained
diffusion models, we develop an NSG estimator through spatial gradients
approximation and motion-aware temporal modeling without complex motion
decomposition while preserving physical constraints. Building on this, we
propose an NSG-based video detection method (NSG-VD) that computes the Maximum
Mean Discrepancy (MMD) between NSG features of the test and real videos as a
detection metric. Last, we derive an upper bound of NSG feature distances
between real and generated videos, proving that generated videos exhibit
amplified discrepancies due to distributional shifts. Extensive experiments
confirm that NSG-VD outperforms state-of-the-art baselines by 16.00% in Recall
and 10.75% in F1-Score, validating the superior performance of NSG-VD. The

*Ziqi Zhou,Menghao Deng,Yufei Song,Hangtao Zhang,Wei Wan,Shengshan Hu,Minghui Li,Leo Yu Zhang,Dezhong Yao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces DarkHash, a data-free backdoor attack on deep hashing models, enhancing attack effectiveness by optimizing relationships among samples without requiring access to training data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the challenge of embedding backdoors in deep hashing models without having access to the original training data, which is often restricted by privacy and intellectual property concerns.

Method: The method involves a shadow backdoor attack framework with dual-semantic guidance and a topological alignment loss, leveraging surrogate datasets to tune specific layers of victim models while maintaining retrieval accuracy.

Result: DarkHash outperforms existing backdoor attack methods across various datasets, architectures, and hashing methods while also resisting mainstream backdoor defense techniques.

Conclusion: DarkHash represents a novel, effective, and resilient approach to data-free backdoor attacks against deep hashing models, achieving high accuracy and resistance to defenses.

Abstract: Benefiting from its superior feature learning capabilities and efficiency,
deep hashing has achieved remarkable success in large-scale image retrieval.
Recent studies have demonstrated the vulnerability of deep hashing models to
backdoor attacks. Although these studies have shown promising attack results,
they rely on access to the training dataset to implant the backdoor. In the
real world, obtaining such data (e.g., identity information) is often
prohibited due to privacy protection and intellectual property concerns.
Embedding backdoors into deep hashing models without access to the training
data, while maintaining retrieval accuracy for the original task, presents a
novel and challenging problem. In this paper, we propose DarkHash, the first
data-free backdoor attack against deep hashing. Specifically, we design a novel
shadow backdoor attack framework with dual-semantic guidance. It embeds
backdoor functionality and maintains original retrieval accuracy by fine-tuning
only specific layers of the victim model using a surrogate dataset. We consider
leveraging the relationship between individual samples and their neighbors to
enhance backdoor attacks during training. By designing a topological alignment
loss, we optimize both individual and neighboring poisoned samples toward the
target sample, further enhancing the attack capability. Experimental results on
four image datasets, five model architectures, and two hashing methods
demonstrate the high effectiveness of DarkHash, outperforming existing
state-of-the-art backdoor attack methods. Defense experiments show that
DarkHash can withstand existing mainstream backdoor defense methods.

### [231] [Efficient Label Refinement for Face Parsing Under Extreme Poses Using 3D Gaussian Splatting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08096)
*Ankit Gahlawat,Anirban Mukherjee,Dinesh Babu Jayagopi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces a method using 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) to improve face parsing under extreme angles by refining noisy segmentation masks and generating pose-diverse training data. The approach enhances performance without requiring extensive annotations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Face parsing under extreme viewing angles is challenging due to the lack of labeled data and the impracticality of manual annotation for large datasets.

Method: The method uses a label refinement pipeline involving two jointly fitted 3DGS models — one for RGB images and another for their segmentation maps — to enforce multiview consistency and synthesize diverse pose training data.

Result: Fine-tuning on the refined dataset significantly boosts accuracy for difficult head poses and retains strong performance on standard views, outperforming state-of-the-art methods based on experimental comparisons.

Conclusion: This scalable approach improves face parsing robustness without requiring ground-truth 3D annotations and works effectively even with limited initial data.

Abstract: Accurate face parsing under extreme viewing angles remains a significant
challenge due to limited labeled data in such poses. Manual annotation is
costly and often impractical at scale. We propose a novel label refinement
pipeline that leverages 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) to generate accurate
segmentation masks from noisy multiview predictions. By jointly fitting two
3DGS models, one to RGB images and one to their initial segmentation maps, our
method enforces multiview consistency through shared geometry, enabling the
synthesis of pose-diverse training data with only minimal post-processing.
Fine-tuning a face parsing model on this refined dataset significantly improves
accuracy on challenging head poses, while maintaining strong performance on
standard views. Extensive experiments, including human evaluations, demonstrate
that our approach achieves superior results compared to state-of-the-art
methods, despite requiring no ground-truth 3D annotations and using only a
small set of initial images. Our method offers a scalable and effective
solution for improving face parsing robustness in real-world settings.

### [232] [Random Window Augmentations for Deep Learning Robustness in CT and Liver Tumor Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08116)
*Eirik A. Østmo,Kristoffer K. Wickstrøm,Keyur Radiya,Michael C. Kampffmeyer,Karl Øyvind Mikalsen,Robert Jenssen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper discusses a CT-specific augmentation technique called Random Windowing to improve robustness and performance of DL-based segmentation models for medical images.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep learning-based segmentation models for CT can reduce clinician workload but require robust augmentation methods due to limited data. General augmentation techniques for natural images often fail to consider CT-specific intensity properties.

Method: The authors propose Random Windowing, a CT-specific augmentation method that leverages HU intensity distribution instead of generic image augmentation techniques.

Result: Random Windowing enhances robustness to poor contrast and timing in CT images, outperforming state-of-the-art alternatives in liver tumor segmentation.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that CT-specific augmentations, like Random Windowing, resolve artifacts and improve generalization in DL-based medical image analysis.

Abstract: Contrast-enhanced Computed Tomography (CT) is important for diagnosis and
treatment planning for various medical conditions. Deep learning (DL) based
segmentation models may enable automated medical image analysis for detecting
and delineating tumors in CT images, thereby reducing clinicians' workload.
Achieving generalization capabilities in limited data domains, such as
radiology, requires modern DL models to be trained with image augmentation.
However, naively applying augmentation methods developed for natural images to
CT scans often disregards the nature of the CT modality, where the intensities
measure Hounsfield Units (HU) and have important physical meaning. This paper
challenges the use of such intensity augmentations for CT imaging and shows
that they may lead to artifacts and poor generalization. To mitigate this, we
propose a CT-specific augmentation technique, called Random windowing, that
exploits the available HU distribution of intensities in CT images. Random
windowing encourages robustness to contrast-enhancement and significantly
increases model performance on challenging images with poor contrast or timing.
We perform ablations and analysis of our method on multiple datasets, and
compare to, and outperform, state-of-the-art alternatives, while focusing on
the challenge of liver tumor segmentation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AR-Drag addresses the challenges in real-time video generation by introducing a RL-enhanced autoregressive video diffusion model that enables precise motion control and reduces latency while maintaining high visual fidelity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current approaches to real-time motion-controllable video generation suffer from latency or poor-quality results, particularly in few-step generation tasks.

Method: The authors use reinforcement learning with a trajectory-based reward model and a Self-Rollout mechanism to refine and accelerate video generation, leveraging autoregressive diffusion techniques for improved motion control.

Result: AR-Drag achieves high visual fidelity and precise motion alignment in real-time image-to-video generation, reducing latency significantly compared to state-of-the-art methods, with a relatively small model size of 1.3 billion parameters.

Conclusion: The proposed AR-Drag model represents a step forward in real-time motion-controllable video generation, overcoming latency and quality challenges while maintaining efficiency and performance.

Abstract: Real-time motion-controllable video generation remains challenging due to the
inherent latency of bidirectional diffusion models and the lack of effective
autoregressive (AR) approaches. Existing AR video diffusion models are limited
to simple control signals or text-to-video generation, and often suffer from
quality degradation and motion artifacts in few-step generation. To address
these challenges, we propose AR-Drag, the first RL-enhanced few-step AR video
diffusion model for real-time image-to-video generation with diverse motion
control. We first fine-tune a base I2V model to support basic motion control,
then further improve it via reinforcement learning with a trajectory-based
reward model. Our design preserves the Markov property through a Self-Rollout
mechanism and accelerates training by selectively introducing stochasticity in
denoising steps. Extensive experiments demonstrate that AR-Drag achieves high
visual fidelity and precise motion alignment, significantly reducing latency
compared with state-of-the-art motion-controllable VDMs, while using only 1.3B
parameters. Additional visualizations can be found on our project page:

### [234] [Improving Temporal Understanding Logic Consistency in Video-Language Models via Attention Enhancement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08138)
*Chengzhi Li,Heyan Huang,Ping Jian,Zhen Yang,Yaning Tian*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper identifies a major issue of self-contradictory outputs in video-language models (Video-LLMs) and proposes a solution called Temporally Conditioned Attention Sharpening (TCAS) to improve temporal logic consistency and understanding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large language models, especially video-language models (Video-LLMs), often provide inconsistent responses to rephrased questions due to logical contradictions. This impacts their reliability and practical usage, motivating researchers to investigate and address these inconsistencies.

Method: The paper uses an interpretability-driven approach to analyze, summarize causes statistically, and intervene in the inconsistency issue. It introduces the Temporally Conditioned Attention Sharpening (TCAS) technique, which enhances cross-modal attention with a focus on distinguishing video tokens across timestamps to improve temporal resolution.

Result: The experimental results show that TCAS significantly enhances the temporal logic consistency of Video-LLMs. Interpretability analysis confirms improved temporal discriminability in attention heads. The method also boosts performance in general video temporal grounding tasks.

Conclusion: The study concludes that Video-LLMs suffer from a temporal logic bottleneck, and by improving consistency using TCAS, these models can achieve better video temporal understanding and reliability.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often generate self-contradictory outputs, which
severely impacts their reliability and hinders their adoption in practical
applications. In video-language models (Video-LLMs), this phenomenon recently
draws the attention of researchers. Specifically, these models fail to provide
logically consistent responses to rephrased questions based on their grounding
outputs. However, the underlying causes of this phenomenon remain
underexplored. In this work, we adopt an interpretability-driven approach to
analyze, statistically summarize, and intervention the potential factors of the
phenomenon. We find that one of the primary reasons for the inconsistency in
responses lies in the inability of cross-modal attention heads to effectively
distinguish video tokens across different timestamps. To address this, we
propose an attention enhancement method called Temporally Conditioned Attention
Sharpening (TCAS), which constructs an enhancement objective based on attention
distinctions to enhance the model's temporal resolution capability, thereby
improving its temporal understanding logic consistency. Experimental results
demonstrate that our method significantly enhances the temporal logic
consistency of Video-LLMs. Further interpretability analyses reveal that our
method indeed improves the temporal discriminability of attention heads,
validating our conclusions. Additionally, our method achieves performance
improvements in general video temporal grounding tasks, highlighting that
temporal logic consistency is a bottleneck in temporal understanding. By
enhancing consistency, our method drives significant progress in video temporal
understanding.

*Shian Du,Menghan Xia,Chang Liu,Quande Liu,Xintao Wang,Pengfei Wan,Xiangyang Ji*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces UniMMVSR, a novel video super-resolution model that incorporates multi-modal conditions like text, images, and videos, enabling high-fidelity 4K generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current video super-resolution methods primarily focus on text-to-video tasks and overlook other generative conditions, limiting their ability to achieve high fidelity in multi-modal video generation.

Method: The authors propose UniMMVSR, a latent video diffusion model that integrates hybrid-modal conditions via optimized condition injection strategies, training schemes, and data construction methods tailored for different condition types.

Result: UniMMVSR significantly outperforms existing methods in generating videos with detailed visuals and conformity to multi-modal inputs. It also demonstrates the capability to guide 4K video generation when combined with a base model.

Conclusion: UniMMVSR resolves the limitations of existing techniques by leveraging hybrid-modal conditions, setting a new standard in video super-resolution with improved fidelity and scalability.

Abstract: Cascaded video super-resolution has emerged as a promising technique for
decoupling the computational burden associated with generating high-resolution
videos using large foundation models. Existing studies, however, are largely
confined to text-to-video tasks and fail to leverage additional generative
conditions beyond text, which are crucial for ensuring fidelity in multi-modal
video generation. We address this limitation by presenting UniMMVSR, the first
unified generative video super-resolution framework to incorporate hybrid-modal
conditions, including text, images, and videos. We conduct a comprehensive
exploration of condition injection strategies, training schemes, and data
mixture techniques within a latent video diffusion model. A key challenge was
designing distinct data construction and condition utilization methods to
enable the model to precisely utilize all condition types, given their varied
correlations with the target video. Our experiments demonstrate that UniMMVSR
significantly outperforms existing methods, producing videos with superior
detail and a higher degree of conformity to multi-modal conditions. We also
validate the feasibility of combining UniMMVSR with a base model to achieve
multi-modal guided generation of 4K video, a feat previously unattainable with
existing techniques.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces MURE, a framework using multimodal reasoning for image editing, addressing issues like object intersections and spatial relationships. It achieves fine-grained results by combining textual and visual cues in its process.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing image editing methods with natural language lack explicit reasoning and struggle with complex object and spatial relationships. The authors aim to enhance these capabilities through a more robust reasoning process.

Method: The paper proposes MURE, which uses interleaved textual and visual reasoning in the editing process. It employs a Multimodal Deep Confidence (MMDC) reasoning paradigm to mitigate hallucinations and explores reasoning paths, pruning low-quality options to maintain high-quality results.

Result: MURE decomposes complex editing tasks into manageable sub-tasks, producing high-precision results. Extensive experiments showcase significant improvements across three image editing benchmarks.

Conclusion: The method enhances reasoning for image editing by integrating multimodal chains of thought and confidence measurement, enabling superior and high-fidelity image edits. A CoT-Edit-14K dataset was introduced to support further research.

Abstract: Image editing with natural language has gained significant popularity, yet
existing methods struggle with intricate object intersections and fine-grained
spatial relationships due to the lack of an explicit reasoning process. While
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) has been explored to enhance reasoning, purely textual
CoT or CoT augmented with coordinate information is fundamentally limited in
its ability to represent intricate visual layouts and lacks the necessary
visual cues to guide the generation of fine-grained, pixel-level details. To
address these challenges, we propose Multimodal Reasoning Edit (MURE), a novel
framework that shifts the visual editing process from purely text-based
reasoning to a series of interleaved textual and visual rationales. Our
framework performs image editing using a natively multimodal, interleaved
text-image CoT. This approach generates a step-by-step chain of reasoning where
a textual description is followed by a corresponding visual cue, such as a
positional mask that defined intended edited regions or a representation of new
content. Furthermore, to mitigate the hallucination phenomenon of large
language models, we introduce Multimodal Deep Confidence (MMDC) reasoning
paradigm. This paradigm explores a tree of visual reasoning paths at each step.
By pruning low-quality branches using a deep confidence score from a reward
model, it ensures the model consistently follows a high-quality trajectory
towards the final edited result. The proposed method decomposes complex editing
tasks into interdependent sub-tasks, achieving greater precision at each stage
and yielding high-fidelity edited results. We define the formulation for
interleaved text-image chains and release the first CoT-Edit-14K dataset,
comprising 14K high-quality editing examples. Extensive experiments show that
our method yields significant improvements across three image editing
benchmarks.

*Johann Schmidt,Sebastian Stober*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper addresses challenges in fine-grained visual classification (FGVC), proposing a bootstrapping algorithm that improves training sample alignment and achieves better performance compared to existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fine-grained visual classification tasks face challenges from geometric biases and noise, which hinder sensitivity to subtle visual details and robustness to transformations. Current solutions using augmentation or equivariant architectures have notable limitations.

Method: The authors propose a bootstrapping algorithm that iteratively re-aligns training samples to progressively reduce variance and improve alignment, without heavily relying on data augmentation or constrained architectures.

Result: The proposed method outperforms equivariant and canonicalization baselines across four FGVC benchmarks, achieving comparable performance to augmentation-based methods.

Conclusion: The bootstrapping approach provides a reliable solution for handling alignment issues in FGVC tasks, offering convergence guarantees and competitive performance without the drawbacks of existing approaches.

Abstract: Fine-grained visual classification (FGVC) tasks, such as insect and bird
identification, demand sensitivity to subtle visual cues while remaining robust
to spatial transformations. A key challenge is handling geometric biases and
noise, such as different orientations and scales of objects. Existing remedies
rely on heavy data augmentation, which demands powerful models, or on
equivariant architectures, which constrain expressivity and add cost.
Canonicalization offers an alternative by shielding such biases from the
downstream model. In practice, such functions are often obtained using
canonicalization priors, which assume aligned training data. Unfortunately,
real-world datasets never fulfill this assumption, causing the obtained
canonicalizer to be brittle. We propose a bootstrapping algorithm that
iteratively re-aligns training samples by progressively reducing variance and
recovering the alignment assumption. We establish convergence guarantees under
mild conditions for arbitrary compact groups, and show on four FGVC benchmarks
that our method consistently outperforms equivariant, and canonicalization
baselines while performing on par with augmentation.

*Haoran Yu,Yi Shi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces InstructUDrag, a framework combining text and object dragging for precise and flexible image editing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current text-to-image editing methods either lack precision in object placement or are limited to static relocation, needing a solution for combined versatility.

Method: InstructUDrag incorporates a two-branch diffusion-based framework: one branch for object dragging using gradient guidance and cross-attention refinement, and another for text-based editing with shared gradient signals and noise injection for object structure preservation.

Result: InstructUDrag demonstrates superior precision in object relocation and semantic control over content, offering high-fidelity image editing.

Conclusion: The framework resolves limitations of prior methods, effectively integrating precision positioning and flexible semantic editing in a unified approach.

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models have shown great potential for image editing,
with techniques such as text-based and object-dragging methods emerging as key
approaches. However, each of these methods has inherent limitations: text-based
methods struggle with precise object positioning, while object dragging methods
are confined to static relocation. To address these issues, we propose
InstructUDrag, a diffusion-based framework that combines text instructions with
object dragging, enabling simultaneous object dragging and text-based image
editing. Our framework treats object dragging as an image reconstruction
process, divided into two synergistic branches. The moving-reconstruction
branch utilizes energy-based gradient guidance to move objects accurately,
refining cross-attention maps to enhance relocation precision. The text-driven
editing branch shares gradient signals with the reconstruction branch, ensuring
consistent transformations and allowing fine-grained control over object
attributes. We also employ DDPM inversion and inject prior information into
noise maps to preserve the structure of moved objects. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that InstructUDrag facilitates flexible, high-fidelity image
editing, offering both precision in object relocation and semantic control over
image content.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FineDual, a tri-stage method, models dynamic and hierarchical human interactions for dual-human motion generation, enabling fine-grained and high-quality results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for dual-human motion generation fail to capture dynamic and hierarchical human interactions, which are key to realistic and precise modeling.

Method: FineDual employs a tri-stage approach: first, a language model segments overall text into individual components for self-learning; second, an adaptive model predicts interaction distances using a graph network; and finally, teacher-guided refinement aligns motion holistically for better outcomes.

Result: FineDual outperforms previous methods in generating dual-human motion by dynamically modeling human interactions at both individual and inter-individual levels.

Conclusion: The proposed FineDual method effectively captures the dynamic and hierarchical properties of human interaction, enhancing the realism and precision of dual-human motion generation tasks.

Abstract: Human interaction is inherently dynamic and hierarchical, where the dynamic
refers to the motion changes with distance, and the hierarchy is from
individual to inter-individual and ultimately to overall motion. Exploiting
these properties is vital for dual-human motion generation, while existing
methods almost model human interaction temporally invariantly, ignoring
distance and hierarchy. To address it, we propose a fine-grained dual-human
motion generation method, namely FineDual, a tri-stage method to model the
dynamic hierarchical interaction from individual to inter-individual. The first
stage, Self-Learning Stage, divides the dual-human overall text into individual
texts through a Large Language Model, aligning text features and motion
features at the individual level. The second stage, Adaptive Adjustment Stage,
predicts interaction distance by an interaction distance predictor, modeling
human interactions dynamically at the inter-individual level by an
interaction-aware graph network. The last stage, Teacher-Guided Refinement
Stage, utilizes overall text features as guidance to refine motion features at
the overall level, generating fine-grained and high-quality dual-human motion.
Extensive quantitative and qualitative evaluations on dual-human motion
datasets demonstrate that our proposed FineDual outperforms existing
approaches, effectively modeling dynamic hierarchical human interaction.

TL;DR: The paper introduces Adaptive Gradient Calibration (AdaGC), a method for multi-label classification in remote sensing images with single-positive multi-label annotations, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of incomplete annotations in multi-label classification for remote sensing imagery, especially under the single-positive multi-label learning framework.

Method: The paper proposes Adaptive Gradient Calibration (AdaGC), which uses gradient calibration, Mixup, and a dual exponential moving average (EMA) module for pseudo-label generation. An adaptive mechanism is introduced to trigger gradient calibration based on training dynamics.

Result: AdaGC achieves state-of-the-art performance on two benchmark remote sensing datasets under various label noise scenarios, showing robustness and effectiveness.

Conclusion: AdaGC effectively handles supervision ambiguity in multi-label classification for remote sensing, offering a generalizable and robust solution in single-positive multi-label learning settings.

Abstract: Multi-label classification (MLC) offers a more comprehensive semantic
understanding of Remote Sensing (RS) imagery compared to traditional
single-label classification (SLC). However, obtaining complete annotations for
MLC is particularly challenging due to the complexity and high cost of the
labeling process. As a practical alternative, single-positive multi-label
learning (SPML) has emerged, where each image is annotated with only one
relevant label, and the model is expected to recover the full set of labels.
While scalable, SPML introduces significant supervision ambiguity, demanding
specialized solutions for model training. Although various SPML methods have
been proposed in the computer vision domain, research in the RS context remains
limited. To bridge this gap, we propose Adaptive Gradient Calibration (AdaGC),
a novel and generalizable SPML framework tailored to RS imagery. AdaGC adopts a
gradient calibration (GC) mechanism combined with Mixup and a dual exponential
moving average (EMA) module for robust pseudo-label generation. To maximize
AdaGC's effectiveness, we introduce a simple yet theoretically grounded
indicator to adaptively trigger GC after an initial warm-up stage based on
training dynamics, thereby guaranteeing the effectiveness of GC in mitigating
overfitting to label noise. Extensive experiments on two benchmark RS datasets
under two distinct label noise types demonstrate that AdaGC achieves
state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance while maintaining strong robustness across
diverse settings.

Motivation: To address the challenge of preserving unmasked regions while ensuring semantic consistency in the inpainting process, especially given the entanglement of image frequency bands.

Method: The method involves a novel frequency-aware denoising process that splits mid-and-low frequency bands, progressively aligning semantics for masked and unmasked regions across early and late denoising stages.

Result: Experimental results demonstrate that NTN-Diff achieves superior performance compared to current state-of-the-art text-guided diffusion models.

Conclusion: NTN-Diff effectively ensures semantic consistency across image regions while preserving unmasked areas, advancing the state of the art in text-guided image inpainting.

Abstract: Text-guided image inpainting aims at reconstructing the masked regions as per
text prompts, where the longstanding challenges lie in the preservation for
unmasked regions, while achieving the semantics consistency between unmasked
and inpainted masked regions. Previous arts failed to address both of them,
always with either of them to be remedied. Such facts, as we observed, stem
from the entanglement of the hybrid (e.g., mid-and-low) frequency bands that
encode varied image properties, which exhibit different robustness to text
prompts during the denoising process. In this paper, we propose a
null-text-null frequency-aware diffusion models, dubbed \textbf{NTN-Diff}, for
text-guided image inpainting, by decomposing the semantics consistency across
masked and unmasked regions into the consistencies as per each frequency band,
while preserving the unmasked regions, to circumvent two challenges in a row.
Based on the diffusion process, we further divide the denoising process into
early (high-level noise) and late (low-level noise) stages, where the
mid-and-low frequency bands are disentangled during the denoising process. As
observed, the stable mid-frequency band is progressively denoised to be
semantically aligned during text-guided denoising process, which, meanwhile,
serves as the guidance to the null-text denoising process to denoise
low-frequency band for the masked regions, followed by a subsequent text-guided
denoising process at late stage, to achieve the semantics consistency for
mid-and-low frequency bands across masked and unmasked regions, while preserve
the unmasked regions. Extensive experiments validate the superiority of
NTN-Diff over the state-of-the-art diffusion models to text-guided diffusion
models. Our code can be accessed from https://github.com/htyjers/NTN-Diff.

*Michael Niemeyer,Fabian Manhardt,Marie-Julie Rakotosaona,Michael Oechsle,Christina Tsalicoglou,Keisuke Tateno,Jonathan T. Barron,Federico Tombari*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes Neural Exposure Fields (NExF) for robust 3D scene reconstruction and view synthesis under varying exposure conditions, achieving state-of-the-art benchmark results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most existing approaches for 3D reconstruction fail in real-world scenarios with variations like exposure changes, particularly in scenes combining indoor and outdoor lighting conditions.

Method: Introduces a neural field that predicts optimal exposure values per 3D point, optimizing exposure alongside the neural scene representation through a novel neural conditioning mechanism.

Result: Achieves 55% improvement over best-performing baselines and supports faster training on challenging real-world data.

Conclusion: NExF enhances robustness and quality of 3D reconstruction/view synthesis under high dynamic range conditions, eliminating the need for post-processing or multi-exposure inputs.

Abstract: Recent advances in neural scene representations have led to unprecedented
quality in 3D reconstruction and view synthesis. Despite achieving high-quality
results for common benchmarks with curated data, outputs often degrade for data
that contain per image variations such as strong exposure changes, present,
e.g., in most scenes with indoor and outdoor areas or rooms with windows. In
this paper, we introduce Neural Exposure Fields (NExF), a novel technique for
robustly reconstructing 3D scenes with high quality and 3D-consistent
appearance from challenging real-world captures. In the core, we propose to
learn a neural field predicting an optimal exposure value per 3D point,
enabling us to optimize exposure along with the neural scene representation.
While capture devices such as cameras select optimal exposure per image/pixel,
we generalize this concept and perform optimization in 3D instead. This enables
accurate view synthesis in high dynamic range scenarios, bypassing the need of
post-processing steps or multi-exposure captures. Our contributions include a
novel neural representation for exposure prediction, a system for joint
optimization of the scene representation and the exposure field via a novel
neural conditioning mechanism, and demonstrated superior performance on
challenging real-world data. We find that our approach trains faster than prior
works and produces state-of-the-art results on several benchmarks improving by
over 55% over best-performing baselines.

### [243] [LTCA: Long-range Temporal Context Attention for Referring Video Object Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08305)
*Cilin Yan,Jingyun Wang,Guoliang Kang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces an advanced mechanism for Referring Video Object Segmentation (RVOS), effectively balancing locality and globality in temporal context modeling, achieving significant accuracy improvements across benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RVOS requires capturing dynamic attributes in videos through interactions with linguistic expressions, which necessitates long-range temporal context extraction. Previous methods struggle with computational complexity and fail to balance locality and globality efficiently.

Method: The proposed LTCA mechanism employs two approaches: (1) Dilated window attention in stacked layers for sparse local attention and globality balance, (2) Random selection of key groups from a global pool and designing a global query to encode global context.

Result: The method achieves state-of-the-art results on four RVOS benchmarks, notably improving performance by 11.3% and 8.3% on the MeViS valu and val datasets respectively.

Conclusion: LTCA provides a computationally efficient way to balance locality and globality, successfully encoding long-range temporal context for RVOS, and significantly advancing performance across multiple benchmarks.

Abstract: Referring Video Segmentation (RVOS) aims to segment objects in videos given
linguistic expressions. The key to solving RVOS is to extract long-range
temporal context information from the interactions of expressions and videos to
depict the dynamic attributes of each object. Previous works either adopt
attention across all the frames or stack dense local attention to achieve a
global view of temporal context. However, they fail to strike a good balance
between locality and globality, and the computation complexity significantly
increases with the increase of video length. In this paper, we propose an
effective long-range temporal context attention (LTCA) mechanism to aggregate
global context information into object features. Specifically, we aggregate the
global context information from two aspects. Firstly, we stack sparse local
attentions to balance the locality and globality. We design a dilated window
attention across frames to aggregate local context information and perform such
attention in a stack of layers to enable a global view. Further, we enable each
query to attend to a small group of keys randomly selected from a global pool
to enhance the globality. Secondly, we design a global query to interact with
all the other queries to directly encode the global context information.
Experiments show our method achieves new state-of-the-art on four referring
video segmentation benchmarks. Notably, our method shows an improvement of
11.3% and 8.3% on the MeViS valu and val datasets respectively.

*Yu Huang,Zelin Peng,Changsong Wen,Xiaokang Yang,Wei Shen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes novel methods to improve 3D object affordance segmentation by integrating semantic-rich knowledge from 2D vision models into 3D encoders to achieve better performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 3D object segmentation methods struggle with challenges like sparsity, noise, and geometric ambiguity, yielding unclear functional boundaries. The authors aim to overcome these limitations to enhance practical applications in robotics, AI, and AR.

Method: The authors introduce Cross-Modal Affinity Transfer (CMAT) and a Cross-modal Affordance Segmentation Transformer (CAST). CMAT aligns 3D encoders with semantics from 2D Vision Foundation Models, optimizing for reconstruction, affinity, and diversity. CAST employs CMAT pre-trained features with multi-modal prompts for more accurate segmentation.

Result: The framework achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) results in benchmarks for 3D affordance segmentation, demonstrating its robustness and effectiveness.

Conclusion: The integration of 2D semantic knowledge into 3D segmentation significantly alleviates intrinsic 3D data challenges, potentially advancing real-world applications in robotics, AI, and AR.

Abstract: Affordance segmentation aims to parse 3D objects into functionally distinct
parts, bridging recognition and interaction for applications in robotic
manipulation, embodied AI, and AR. While recent studies leverage visual or
textual prompts to guide this process, they often rely on point cloud encoders
as generic feature extractors, overlooking the intrinsic challenges of 3D data
such as sparsity, noise, and geometric ambiguity. As a result, 3D features
learned in isolation frequently lack clear and semantically consistent
functional boundaries. To address this bottleneck, we propose a
semantic-grounded learning paradigm that transfers rich semantic knowledge from
large-scale 2D Vision Foundation Models (VFMs) into the 3D domain.
Specifically, We introduce Cross-Modal Affinity Transfer (CMAT), a pre-training
strategy that aligns a 3D encoder with lifted 2D semantics and jointly
optimizes reconstruction, affinity, and diversity to yield semantically
organized representations. Building on this backbone, we further design the
Cross-modal Affordance Segmentation Transformer (CAST), which integrates
multi-modal prompts with CMAT-pretrained features to generate precise,
prompt-aware segmentation maps. Extensive experiments on standard benchmarks
demonstrate that our framework establishes new state-of-the-art results for 3D
affordance segmentation.

*Yushi Huang,Xingtong Ge,Ruihao Gong,Chengtao Lv,Jun Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LinVideo is a post-training framework that speeds up video diffusion models by replacing certain self-attention layers with linear attention while maintaining performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the computational inefficiency of video diffusion models caused by the quadratic complexity of self-attention and to avoid the need for costly pretraining when replacing it with linear attention.

Method: LinVideo utilizes a selective transfer approach to identify which self-attention layers to replace with linear attention. It frames this task as a binary classification problem and employs an anytime distribution matching (ADM) objective to align sample distributions efficiently.

Result: LinVideo achieves a 1.25-2.00x speedup with negligible performance degradation. Additionally, a 4-step distilled version of the model provides a 15.92x reduction in latency with minimal quality loss.

Conclusion: The framework successfully accelerates video diffusion models while maintaining high-quality video synthesis and avoiding expensive pretraining requirements.

Abstract: Video diffusion models (DMs) have enabled high-quality video synthesis.
However, their computation costs scale quadratically with sequence length
because self-attention has quadratic complexity. While linear attention lowers
the cost, fully replacing quadratic attention requires expensive pretraining
due to the limited expressiveness of linear attention and the complexity of
spatiotemporal modeling in video generation. In this paper, we present
LinVideo, an efficient data-free post-training framework that replaces a target
number of self-attention modules with linear attention while preserving the
original model's performance. First, we observe a significant disparity in the
replaceability of different layers. Instead of manual or heuristic choices, we
frame layer selection as a binary classification problem and propose selective
transfer, which automatically and progressively converts layers to linear
attention with minimal performance impact. Additionally, to overcome the
ineffectiveness and inefficiency of existing objectives for this transfer
process, we introduce an anytime distribution matching (ADM) objective that
aligns the distributions of samples across any timestep along the sampling
trajectory. This objective is efficient and recovers model performance.
Extensive experiments show that our method achieves a 1.25-2.00x speedup while
preserving generation quality, and our 4-step distilled model further delivers
a 15.92x latency reduction with minimal visual quality drop.

### [246] [Evaluating Small Vision-Language Models on Distance-Dependent Traffic Perception](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08352)
*Nikos Theodoridis,Tim Brophy,Reenu Mohandas,Ganesh Sistu,Fiachra Collins,Anthony Scanlan,Ciaran Eising*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper evaluates small state-of-the-art vision-language models (VLMs) on a newly introduced benchmark, DTPQA, designed to test perception-based questions in traffic scenes with distance annotations, highlighting their limitations compared to human performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to explore whether vision-language models can be reliably used in automated driving systems, which depend on robust and non-shortsighted perception capabilities for handling critical traffic scenarios.

Method: The authors introduce the DTPQA benchmark focusing only on perception-related visual question answering tasks in traffic scenes. They exclude reasoning-related questions and evaluate the performance of small state-of-the-art VLMs against this benchmark, comparing their results to human performance.

Result: Small VLMs achieved around ~60% average accuracy compared to ~85% human accuracy on DTPQA questions, revealing a significant performance gap. They struggled particularly in tasks like distinguishing left from right.

Conclusion: Small VLMs, while promising, are insufficiently reliable for safety-critical applications like automated driving due to their current perceptual limitations, as highlighted by poor performance on the DTPQA benchmark.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are becoming increasingly powerful,
demonstrating strong performance on a variety of tasks that require both visual
and textual understanding. Their strong generalisation abilities make them a
promising component for automated driving systems, which must handle unexpected
corner cases. However, to be trusted in such safety-critical applications, a
model must first possess a reliable perception system. Moreover, since critical
objects and agents in traffic scenes are often at a distance, we require
systems that are not "shortsighted", i.e., systems with strong perception
capabilities at both close (up to 20 meters) and long (30+ meters) range. With
this in mind, we introduce Distance-Annotated Traffic Perception Question
Answering (DTPQA), the first Visual Question Answering (VQA) benchmark focused
solely on perception-based questions in traffic scenes, enriched with distance
annotations. By excluding questions that require reasoning, we ensure that
model performance reflects perception capabilities alone. Since automated
driving hardware has limited processing power and cannot support large VLMs,
our study centers on smaller VLMs. More specifically, we evaluate several
state-of-the-art (SOTA) small VLMs on DTPQA and show that, despite the
simplicity of the questions, these models significantly underperform compared
to humans (~60% average accuracy for the best-performing small VLM versus ~85%
human performance). However, it is important to note that the human sample size
was relatively small, which imposes statistical limitations. We also identify
specific perception tasks, such as distinguishing left from right, that remain
particularly challenging for these models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges of enhancing extremely dark images and clarifying hazy imagery (e.g., foggy, sandy, underwater conditions) while maintaining implementation simplicity.

Method: The method constructs an image filter to simulate low-light or hazy conditions and develops approximate reverse filters to minimize distortions in enhanced images.

Result: Experimental results show that the proposed method is highly competitive and often outperforms state-of-the-art approaches for dark and hazy image enhancement.

Conclusion: This method succeeds in efficiently enhancing images under challenging conditions and stands out for its simplicity, requiring minimal implementation effort in MATLAB.

Abstract: We introduce a simple and efficient method to enhance and clarify images.
More specifically, we deal with low light image enhancement and clarification
of hazy imagery (hazy/foggy images, images containing sand dust, and underwater
images). Our method involves constructing an image filter to simulate low-light
or hazy conditions and deriving approximate reverse filters to minimize
distortions in the enhanced images. Experimental results show that our approach
is highly competitive and often surpasses state-of-the-art techniques in
handling extremely dark images and in enhancing hazy images. A key advantage of
our approach lies in its simplicity: Our method is implementable with just a
few lines of MATLAB code.

*Mattia Ferrari,Lorenzo Bruzzone*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a data augmentation technique using guided diffusion models and lightweight transformers to enhance hyperspectral image classification, especially with small datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome overfitting issues in deep learning when using small labeled datasets for hyperspectral image classification.

Method: The paper proposes a guided diffusion model for data augmentation, integrates a lightweight transformer network, and uses a modified loss function and optimized cosine variance scheduler for efficient training.

Result: The proposed method showed superior performance in forest classification tasks compared to other augmentation techniques, achieving higher accuracy and stable training outcomes.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates that guided diffusion models combined with lightweight transformers and optimized training strategies can effectively address the limitations of small labeled datasets and improve hyperspectral image classification.

Abstract: The introduction of new generation hyperspectral satellite sensors, combined
with advancements in deep learning methodologies, has significantly enhanced
the ability to discriminate detailed land-cover classes at medium-large scales.
However, a significant challenge in deep learning methods is the risk of
overfitting when training networks with small labeled datasets. In this work,
we propose a data augmentation technique that leverages a guided diffusion
model. To effectively train the model with a limited number of labeled samples
and to capture complex patterns in the data, we implement a lightweight
transformer network. Additionally, we introduce a modified weighted loss
function and an optimized cosine variance scheduler, which facilitate fast and
effective training on small datasets. We evaluate the effectiveness of the
proposed method on a forest classification task with 10 different forest types
using hyperspectral images acquired by the PRISMA satellite. The results
demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms other data augmentation
techniques in both average and weighted average accuracy. The effectiveness of
the method is further highlighted by the stable training behavior of the model,
which addresses a common limitation in the practical application of deep
generative models for data augmentation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UniVideo introduces a unified framework for multimodal video generation and editing, leveraging instruction comprehension through a Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) and visual generation with Multimodal DiT (MMDiT).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing models in multimodal generation and editing are largely limited to the image domain and lack versatility in addressing video tasks with multimodal instructions.

Method: UniVideo employs a dual-stream design incorporating MLLM for understanding complex multimodal instructions and MMDiT for generating videos. It unifies diverse tasks under one multimodal instruction framework, enabling task composition and generalization.

Result: Experiments demonstrate UniVideo surpasses state-of-the-art baselines across various video-related tasks, including text/image-to-video generation and video editing. It generalizes well in scenarios like unseen instructions and visual-prompt-based video synthesis.

Conclusion: UniVideo successfully extends unified multimodal modeling to video generation and editing, enabling flexible, task-composable solutions. The framework promotes innovative applications and fosters future research through its open model and code release.

Abstract: Unified multimodal models have shown promising results in multimodal content
generation and editing but remain largely limited to the image domain. In this
work, we present UniVideo, a versatile framework that extends unified modeling
to the video domain. UniVideo adopts a dual-stream design, combining a
Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) for instruction understanding with a
Multimodal DiT (MMDiT) for video generation. This design enables accurate
interpretation of complex multimodal instructions while preserving visual
consistency. Built on this architecture, UniVideo unifies diverse video
generation and editing tasks under a single multimodal instruction paradigm and
is jointly trained across them. Extensive experiments demonstrate that UniVideo
matches or surpasses state-of-the-art task-specific baselines in
text/image-to-video generation, in-context video generation and in-context
video editing. Notably, the unified design of UniVideo enables two forms of
generalization. First, UniVideo supports task composition, such as combining
editing with style transfer, by integrating multiple capabilities within a
single instruction. Second, even without explicit training on free-form video
editing, UniVideo transfers its editing capability from large-scale image
editing data to this setting, handling unseen instructions such as
green-screening characters or changing materials within a video. Beyond these
core capabilities, UniVideo also supports visual-prompt-based video generation,
where the MLLM interprets visual prompts and guides the MMDiT during synthesis.
To foster future research, we will release our model and code.

*Sofia Kirsanova,Yao-Yi Chiang,Weiwei Duan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper focuses on overcoming challenges in automating the parsing of historical map legends by combining LayoutLMv3 for layout detection with GPT-4 for structured linking of symbols and descriptions, achieving notable performance improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The inconsistency and unstructured nature of historical map legend layouts make automated extraction and interpretation challenging. Existing methods inadequately link cartographic symbols with their textual descriptions, hindering efficient parsing.

Method: The authors combine LayoutLMv3 for layout detection with GPT-4 using in-context learning to match map legend symbols and descriptions. They utilize structured JSON prompts and bounding box predictions to link these components effectively.

Result: The method demonstrates strong performance, with GPT-4 surpassing the baseline by achieving 88% F-1 score and 85% IoU. Prompt design, layout alignment, and example counts were shown to influence performance.

Conclusion: The proposed combination of LayoutLMv3 and GPT-4 enables scalable and layout-aware legend parsing, facilitating improved indexing and searchability of historical maps across varied visual formats.

Abstract: Historical map legends are critical for interpreting cartographic symbols.
However, their inconsistent layouts and unstructured formats make automatic
extraction challenging. Prior work focuses primarily on segmentation or general
optical character recognition (OCR), with few methods effectively matching
legend symbols to their corresponding descriptions in a structured manner. We
present a method that combines LayoutLMv3 for layout detection with GPT-4o
using in-context learning to detect and link legend items and their
descriptions via bounding box predictions. Our experiments show that GPT-4 with
structured JSON prompts outperforms the baseline, achieving 88% F-1 and 85%
IoU, and reveal how prompt design, example counts, and layout alignment affect
performance. This approach supports scalable, layout-aware legend parsing and
improves the indexing and searchability of historical maps across various
visual styles.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes a curriculum-based framework for source-free domain adaptation to improve medical image model transfer while addressing privacy concerns.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The research aims to address privacy and security concerns in medical imaging by focusing on source-free domain adaptation methods, enabling knowledge transfer without requiring access to source data.

Method: A curriculum-based framework is introduced with two key curricula: (1) Easy-to-hard, where the model iteratively learns from simpler to more complex samples, and (2) Source-to-target, stabilizing the transfer from source to target domain.

Result: Experimental results on public datasets for fundus and polyp segmentation demonstrate the framework's superiority over existing methods, achieving state-of-the-art performance.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively provides smoother and better knowledge transfer in source-free domain adaptation, outperforming previous models and highlighting its practical utility.

Abstract: Recent studies have uncovered a new research line, namely source-free domain
adaptation, which adapts a model to target domains without using the source
data. Such a setting can address the concerns on data privacy and security
issues of medical images. However, current source-free domain adaptation
frameworks mainly focus on the pseudo label refinement for target data without
the consideration of learning procedure. Indeed, a progressive learning process
from source to target domain will benefit the knowledge transfer during model
adaptation. To this end, we propose a curriculum-based framework, namely
learning from curriculum (LFC), for source-free domain adaptation, which
consists of easy-to-hard and source-to-target curricula. Concretely, the former
curriculum enables the framework to start learning with `easy' samples and
gradually tune the optimization direction of model adaption by increasing the
sample difficulty. While, the latter can stablize the adaptation process, which
ensures smooth transfer of the model from the source domain to the target. We
evaluate the proposed source-free domain adaptation approach on the public
cross-domain datasets for fundus segmentation and polyp segmentation. The
extensive experimental results show that our framework surpasses the existing
approaches and achieves a new state-of-the-art.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces "VideoVerse," a benchmark designed to evaluate state-of-the-art Text-to-Video (T2V) models on their understanding of temporal causality and world knowledge, using 300 curated prompts and a systematic evaluation method.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks for T2V models do not adequately assess advanced capabilities like event-level temporal causality or systematic world knowledge, both essential for creating robust world models.

Method: The authors curated diverse video domains, rewrote event-level causal descriptions into T2V prompts, and developed evaluation questions alongside QA pipelines leveraging vision-language models.

Result: The benchmark, "VideoVerse," comprises 300 prompts, 815 events, and 793 binary evaluation questions, enabling detailed assessment of T2V models and identifying gaps in their alignment with human preferences.

Conclusion: The study highlights weaknesses in current T2V models in understanding complex causality and world knowledge, with VideoVerse serving as a step toward improving this evaluation.

Abstract: The recent rapid advancement of Text-to-Video (T2V) generation technologies,
which are critical to build ``world models'', makes the existing benchmarks
increasingly insufficient to evaluate state-of-the-art T2V models. First,
current evaluation dimensions, such as per-frame aesthetic quality and temporal
consistency, are no longer able to differentiate state-of-the-art T2V models.
Second, event-level temporal causality, which not only distinguishes video from
other modalities but also constitutes a crucial component of world models, is
severely underexplored in existing benchmarks. Third, existing benchmarks lack
a systematic assessment of world knowledge, which are essential capabilities
for building world models. To address these issues, we introduce VideoVerse, a
comprehensive benchmark that focuses on evaluating whether a T2V model could
understand complex temporal causality and world knowledge in the real world. We
collect representative videos across diverse domains (e.g., natural landscapes,
sports, indoor scenes, science fiction, chemical and physical experiments) and
extract their event-level descriptions with inherent temporal causality, which
are then rewritten into text-to-video prompts by independent annotators. For
each prompt, we design a suite of binary evaluation questions from the
perspective of dynamic and static properties, with a total of ten carefully
defined evaluation dimensions. In total, our VideoVerse comprises 300 carefully
curated prompts, involving 815 events and 793 binary evaluation questions.
Consequently, a human preference aligned QA-based evaluation pipeline is
developed by using modern vision-language models. Finally, we perform a
systematic evaluation of state-of-the-art open-source and closed-source T2V
models on VideoVerse, providing in-depth analysis on how far the current T2V
generators are from world models.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This study scales continuous-time consistency distillation for large image and video diffusion models, introducing an enhanced method (rCM) for improved visual quality and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges of scaling continuous-time consistency models to large-scale text-to-image and video applications.

Method: Develop a FlashAttention-2 JVP kernel and propose score-regularized continuous-time consistency model (rCM) with score distillation to improve quality and diversity.

Result: rCM achieves improved visual quality and diversity, surpasses the current state-of-the-art, and accelerates diffusion sampling by up to 50x.

Conclusion: rCM presents a significant advancement in efficient and high-quality diffusion model distillation, making it practical for large-scale applications.

Abstract: This work represents the first effort to scale up continuous-time consistency
distillation to general application-level image and video diffusion models.
Although continuous-time consistency model (sCM) is theoretically principled
and empirically powerful for accelerating academic-scale diffusion, its
applicability to large-scale text-to-image and video tasks remains unclear due
to infrastructure challenges in Jacobian-vector product (JVP) computation and
the limitations of standard evaluation benchmarks. We first develop a
parallelism-compatible FlashAttention-2 JVP kernel, enabling sCM training on
models with over 10 billion parameters and high-dimensional video tasks. Our
investigation reveals fundamental quality limitations of sCM in fine-detail
generation, which we attribute to error accumulation and the "mode-covering"
nature of its forward-divergence objective. To remedy this, we propose the
score-regularized continuous-time consistency model (rCM), which incorporates
score distillation as a long-skip regularizer. This integration complements sCM
with the "mode-seeking" reverse divergence, effectively improving visual
quality while maintaining high generation diversity. Validated on large-scale
models (Cosmos-Predict2, Wan2.1) up to 14B parameters and 5-second videos, rCM
matches or surpasses the state-of-the-art distillation method DMD2 on quality
metrics while offering notable advantages in diversity, all without GAN tuning
or extensive hyperparameter searches. The distilled models generate
high-fidelity samples in only $1\sim4$ steps, accelerating diffusion sampling
by $15\times\sim50\times$. These results position rCM as a practical and
theoretically grounded framework for advancing large-scale diffusion
distillation.

TL;DR: Introduces a modular framework for spatial image processing encompassing grayscale quantization, color/brightness enhancement, image sharpening, feature extraction, and bidirectional transformation pipelines. Achieved robust accuracy in image analysis tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to create a comprehensive framework to improve spatial image processing techniques, addressing challenges like structural detail preservation, contrast enhancement, and accurate feature extraction for real-time applications.

Method: The method involves grayscale quantization, histogram equalization in multiple color spaces, brightness adjustments, sharpening via convolution kernels, bidirectional transformation pipelines, and various geometric feature extraction techniques such as Canny edge detection and Hough transforms.

Result: The proposed framework achieved 76.10% and 74.80% accuracy for forward and reverse transformation processes, respectively. Cue isolation demonstrated 81.87% similarity to ground truth images. It showed robust results across diverse datasets.

Conclusion: The framework proves efficient for integrated spatial image processing, offering reliable performance in real-time applications and computer vision tasks. Its modular approach ensures adaptability and precision across varied scenarios.

Abstract: This study introduces a modular framework for spatial image processing,
integrating grayscale quantization, color and brightness enhancement, image
sharpening, bidirectional transformation pipelines, and geometric feature
extraction. A stepwise intensity transformation quantizes grayscale images into
eight discrete levels, producing a posterization effect that simplifies
representation while preserving structural detail. Color enhancement is
achieved via histogram equalization in both RGB and YCrCb color spaces, with
the latter improving contrast while maintaining chrominance fidelity.
Brightness adjustment is implemented through HSV value-channel manipulation,
and image sharpening is performed using a 3 * 3 convolution kernel to enhance
high-frequency details. A bidirectional transformation pipeline that integrates
unsharp masking, gamma correction, and noise amplification achieved accuracy
levels of 76.10% and 74.80% for the forward and reverse processes,
respectively. Geometric feature extraction employed Canny edge detection,
Hough-based line estimation (e.g., 51.50{\deg} for billiard cue alignment),
Harris corner detection, and morphological window localization. Cue isolation
further yielded 81.87\% similarity against ground truth images. Experimental
evaluation across diverse datasets demonstrates robust and deterministic
performance, highlighting its potential for real-time image analysis and
computer vision.

*Zhenlong Yuan,Xiangyan Qu,Chengxuan Qian,Rui Chen,Jing Tang,Lei Sun,Xiangxiang Chu,Dapeng Zhang,Yiwei Wang,Yujun Cai,Shuo Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Video-STAR, a framework for improving open-vocabulary action recognition by using sub-motion decomposition and tool-augmented reinforcement learning, achieving state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most multimodal large language models struggle with visual tasks that require distinguishing fine-grained actions due to their reliance on text-centric priors, leading to challenges in reasoning and hallucination in open-vocabulary settings.

Method: The proposed method leverages contextual sub-motion decomposition along with tool-augmented reinforcement learning to analyze actions as sub-motions, dynamically using external tools. A hierarchical reward mechanism is also introduced to guide tool usage and improve reasoning, prioritizing visually grounded inference.

Result: Video-STAR achieves state-of-the-art results in fine-grained action recognition across datasets like HMDB-51, UCF-101, SSv2, Kinetics-400, and Kinetics-600, showing robustness and improved handling of cross-modal hallucinations.

Conclusion: The proposed approach effectively overcomes limitations of text-centric multimodal models by integrating domain-specific tools and fine-grained reasoning, resulting in improved generalization and action recognition performance.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable
potential in bridging visual and textual reasoning, yet their reliance on
text-centric priors often limits their ability to disentangle semantically
similar actions in open-vocabulary scenarios. To address this, we propose
Video-STAR, a framework that harmonizes contextual sub-motion decomposition
with tool-augmented reinforcement learning for open-vocabulary action
recognition (OVAR). Unlike prior methods that treat actions as monolithic
entities, our approach innovatively decomposes actions into discriminative
sub-motions for fine-grained matching while dynamically invoking
domain-specific tools for cross-modal interleaving, thereby enabling
category-specific reasoning capacity and reducing cross-modal hallucination.
Moreover, by designing a hierarchical reward that balances tool-usage
efficiency, sub-motion relevance, and structural coherence in reasoning, our
method autonomously leverages external tools to prioritize sub-motion patterns
without explicit supervision, transmitting from text-centric reasoning to
visually grounded inference. Extensive evaluations on HMDB-51, UCF-101, SSv2,
Kinetics-400, and Kinetics-600 datasets demonstrate our state-of-the-art
performance, outperforming existing methods in distinguishing fine-grained
actions and handling cross-modal hallucination, validating our excellent
robustness and generalization.

*Onur Keleş,Aslı Özyürek,Gerardo Ortega,Kadir Gökgö,Esam Ghaleb*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a benchmark, "Visual Iconicity Challenge," to evaluate vision-language models (VLMs) on tasks related to iconicity in signed languages, showing state-of-the-art models' limitations compared to human performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address the challenge of grounding visual information in meaning by focusing on signed languages, which naturally exhibit iconicity—a resemblance between linguistic form and meaning.

Method: The authors proposed the "Visual Iconicity Challenge," a video-based benchmark with three tasks: phonological form prediction, transparency, and graded iconicity ratings. They assessed 13 state-of-the-art VLMs in zero- and few-shot settings.

Result: The tested VLMs showed some ability to predict phonological details but performed below human benchmarks in all tasks. Notably, models with better phonological form prediction correlated more strongly with human iconicity ratings.

Conclusion: The results highlight the diagnostic value of these tasks and encourage incorporating human-centric and embodied learning approaches for better visual grounding in multimodal models.

Abstract: Iconicity, the resemblance between linguistic form and meaning, is pervasive
in signed languages, offering a natural testbed for visual grounding. For
vision-language models (VLMs), the challenge is to recover such essential
mappings from dynamic human motion rather than static context. We introduce the
\textit{Visual Iconicity Challenge}, a novel video-based benchmark that adapts
psycholinguistic measures to evaluate VLMs on three tasks: (i) phonological
sign-form prediction (e.g., handshape, location), (ii) transparency (inferring
meaning from visual form), and (iii) graded iconicity ratings. We assess $13$
state-of-the-art VLMs in zero- and few-shot settings on Sign Language of the
Netherlands and compare them to human baselines. On \textit{phonological form
prediction}, VLMs recover some handshape and location detail but remain below
human performance; on \textit{transparency}, they are far from human baselines;
and only top models correlate moderately with human \textit{iconicity ratings}.
Interestingly, \textit{models with stronger phonological form prediction
correlate better with human iconicity judgment}, indicating shared sensitivity
to visually grounded structure. Our findings validate these diagnostic tasks
and motivate human-centric signals and embodied learning methods for modelling
iconicity and improving visual grounding in multimodal models.

*Chong Mou,Qichao Sun,Yanze Wu,Pengze Zhang,Xinghui Li,Fulong Ye,Songtao Zhao,Qian He*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces a unified framework, InstructX, for image and video editing using Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) and diffusion models. It demonstrates that image data training can enable video editing capabilities and achieves state-of-the-art performance across diverse editing tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing studies lack deep analysis of MLLM design and struggle with the integration of MLLMs and diffusion models for complex tasks like video editing.

Method: Comprehensive integration study of MLLMs and diffusion models, leveraging image data to develop emergent video editing capabilities and utilizing modality-specific features for unified editing.

Result: The proposed framework effectively handles diverse image/video editing tasks and demonstrates state-of-the-art performance, reducing dependency on extensive video training data.

Conclusion: InstructX unifies image and video editing tasks and offers a promising solution to instruction-driven editing through advanced MLLM-diffusion model integration.

Abstract: With recent advances in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) showing
strong visual understanding and reasoning, interest is growing in using them to
improve the editing performance of diffusion models. Despite rapid progress,
most studies lack an in-depth analysis of MLLM design choices. Moreover, the
integration of MLLMs and diffusion models remains an open challenge in some
difficult tasks, such as video editing. In this paper, we present InstructX, a
unified framework for image and video editing. Specifically, we conduct a
comprehensive study on integrating MLLMs and diffusion models for
instruction-driven editing across diverse tasks. Building on this study, we
analyze the cooperation and distinction between images and videos in unified
modeling. (1) We show that training on image data can lead to emergent video
editing capabilities without explicit supervision, thereby alleviating the
constraints imposed by scarce video training data. (2) By incorporating
modality-specific MLLM features, our approach effectively unifies image and
video editing tasks within a single model. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that our method can handle a broad range of image and video editing tasks and
achieves state-of-the-art performance.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces MoA-VR, a video restoration system inspired by human professional workflows, which uses degradation identification, routing, and quality assessment to tackle complex video degradations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of handling diverse and complex video degradations using an approach that generalizes effectively and mimics professional reasoning processes.

Method: The system employs three coordinated agents: 1) a large-scale vision-language model (VLM) for degradation identification, 2) a self-adaptive router powered by large language models (LLMs) for restoration strategy selection, and 3) a video quality assessment model based on a novel dataset designed for restoration tasks.

Result: MoA-VR consistently outperforms existing methods in objective metrics and perceptual quality when handling various video degradations.

Conclusion: The integration of multimodal intelligence and modular reasoning offers significant potential for advancing general-purpose video restoration solutions.

Abstract: Real-world videos often suffer from complex degradations, such as noise,
compression artifacts, and low-light distortions, due to diverse acquisition
and transmission conditions. Existing restoration methods typically require
professional manual selection of specialized models or rely on monolithic
architectures that fail to generalize across varying degradations. Inspired by
expert experience, we propose MoA-VR, the first
\underline{M}ixture-\underline{o}f-\underline{A}gents \underline{V}ideo
\underline{R}estoration system that mimics the reasoning and processing
procedures of human professionals through three coordinated agents: Degradation
Identification, Routing and Restoration, and Restoration Quality Assessment.
Specifically, we construct a large-scale and high-resolution video degradation
recognition benchmark and build a vision-language model (VLM) driven
degradation identifier. We further introduce a self-adaptive router powered by
large language models (LLMs), which autonomously learns effective restoration
strategies by observing tool usage patterns. To assess intermediate and final
processed video quality, we construct the \underline{Res}tored
\underline{V}ideo \underline{Q}uality (Res-VQ) dataset and design a dedicated
VLM-based video quality assessment (VQA) model tailored for restoration tasks.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that MoA-VR effectively handles diverse and
compound degradations, consistently outperforming existing baselines in terms
of both objective metrics and perceptual quality. These results highlight the
potential of integrating multimodal intelligence and modular reasoning in
general-purpose video restoration systems.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Large Vision Language Models (LVLMs) integrate Vision Transformers (ViT) and Large Language Models (LLM) to process visual and textual data. This paper identifies overlooked ViT attention sinks as critical for reasoning and presents strategies to effectively utilize them.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the gap in understanding the contribution of visual tokens generated by Vision Transformers (ViT) in LVLMs, particularly the overlooked class of high-norm tokens known as ViT attention sinks.

Method: The paper conducts qualitative and quantitative analyses to explore the role of ViT attention sinks in LVLMs. It introduces training-free and training-based methods to improve how these tokens are utilized by the LLM.

Result: The proposed approaches significantly enhance the performance of LVLMs across various visual reasoning tasks, showcasing the importance of ViT attention sinks in these architectures.

Conclusion: Explicitly leveraging ViT attention sinks can greatly improve LVLM understanding and reasoning capabilities, revealing untapped potential in visual language processing.

Abstract: Large Vision Language Models (LVLMs) have recently emerged as powerful
architectures capable of understanding and reasoning over both visual and
textual information. These models typically rely on two key components: a
Vision Transformer (ViT) and a Large Language Model (LLM). ViT encodes visual
content into a sequence of image tokens and serves as the perceptual front-end
-- the eyes of the model. In contrast, the LLM interprets these tokens to
perform high-level reasoning, generates responses, and functions as the
cognitive core -- the brain of the model. However, it remains unclear which
visual tokens contribute most significantly to understanding and reasoning, and
how effectively these signals are propagated from ViT to the LLM. While most
existing works have focused on identifying attention sinks, low-semantic tokens
receiving disproportionately high attention, within the LLM, we shift the focus
to the vision encoder by identifying a class of high-norm visual tokens from
ViT, referred to as ViT attention sinks -- a problem that has been rarely
studied but is indeed very important for LVLMs. Our findings show that these
ViT sinks encapsulate high-level semantic concepts from images, allowing the
LLM to perform more effective understanding and reasoning. Despite their
importance, these sink tokens are often overlooked in existing LVLM
architectures. To explore their contribution, we present both qualitative and
quantitative analyses of the information embedded in these sink tokens. We also
propose both training-free and training-based approaches to better leverage how
this information is interpreted by the LLM, and to what extent. By explicitly
utilizing these tokens, we demonstrate substantial improvements across a range
of LVLMs and visual reasoning tasks, highlighting the untapped potential of ViT
attention sinks in enhancing visual reasoning.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces a method called SliceFine, which fine-tunes small subsets (`slices`) of pre-trained model weights, improving training efficiency without adding extra parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a theoretically grounded and efficient approach for parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) in pre-trained large-scale models.

Method: The paper proposes SliceFine, which identifies and fine-tunes randomly selected subsets of weight matrices based on the Universal Winning Slice Hypothesis, leveraging spectral balance and task-relevant features.

Result: SliceFine achieves comparable performance to state-of-the-art PEFT methods across both language and vision tasks, while improving training speed, memory usage, and compactness.

Conclusion: SliceFine provides an efficient and theoretically supported alternative to current PEFT methods, bridging theory and practice through smart weight tuning strategies.

Abstract: This paper presents a theoretical framework explaining why fine tuning small,
randomly selected subnetworks (slices) within pre trained models can be
sufficient for downstream adaptation. We prove that pretrained networks exhibit
a universal winning slice property arising from two phenomena: (1) spectral
balance the eigenspectra of different weight matrix slices are remarkably
similar; and (2) high task energy their backbone representations retain rich,
task relevant features. This leads to the Universal Winning Slice Hypothesis,
which provides a theoretical foundation for parameter efficient fine tuning
(PEFT) in large scale models. Inspired by this, we propose SliceFine, a PEFT
method that exploits this inherent redundancy by updating only selected slices
of the original weights introducing zero new parameters, unlike adapter-based
approaches. Empirically, SliceFine matches the performance of state of the art
PEFT methods across language and vision tasks, while significantly improving
training speed, memory efficiency, and model compactness. Our work bridges
theory and practice, offering a theoretically grounded alternative to existing
PEFT techniques.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FlexTraj is a novel framework for generating videos from images by controlling point trajectories.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To achieve flexible and robust control of video generation through point-based motion trajectories.

Method: FlexTraj uses a unified motion representation, an efficient sequence-concatenation scheme for control, and an annealing training strategy that reduces dependence on fully aligned supervision.

Result: FlexTraj enables versatile and precise trajectory-controlled video generation, demonstrating applications like motion cloning, drag-based image-to-video, and motion interpolation.

Conclusion: The framework achieves strong controllability and robustness in trajectory-based video generation, supporting diverse applications while enhancing training efficiency and inference speed.

Abstract: We present FlexTraj, a framework for image-to-video generation with flexible
point trajectory control. FlexTraj introduces a unified point-based motion
representation that encodes each point with a segmentation ID, a temporally
consistent trajectory ID, and an optional color channel for appearance cues,
enabling both dense and sparse trajectory control. Instead of injecting
trajectory conditions into the video generator through token concatenation or
ControlNet, FlexTraj employs an efficient sequence-concatenation scheme that
achieves faster convergence, stronger controllability, and more efficient
inference, while maintaining robustness under unaligned conditions. To train
such a unified point trajectory-controlled video generator, FlexTraj adopts an
annealing training strategy that gradually reduces reliance on complete
supervision and aligned condition. Experimental results demonstrate that
FlexTraj enables multi-granularity, alignment-agnostic trajectory control for
video generation, supporting various applications such as motion cloning,
drag-based image-to-video, motion interpolation, camera redirection, flexible
action control and mesh animations.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces SpatialLadder, a Vision-Language Model that achieves state-of-the-art performance on spatial reasoning tasks through a novel progressive training method.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper is motivated by the challenge that Vision-Language Models struggle with robust spatial reasoning due to the lack of hierarchical foundations in their training.

Method: The authors create a new multimodal dataset, SpatialLadder-26k, and propose a three-stage progressive training framework: spatial perception via object localization, spatial understanding through diverse spatial tasks, and complex reasoning using reinforcement learning.

Result: SpatialLadder, a 3B-parameter model, achieves 23.4% improved performance on spatial reasoning benchmarks over the base model and outperforms other state-of-the-art models like GPT-4o and Gemini-2.0-Flash.

Conclusion: Training spatial reasoning progressively from perception to reasoning enhances performance and generalization in Vision-Language Models, as evidenced by SpatialLadder's benchmark success.

Abstract: Spatial reasoning remains a fundamental challenge for Vision-Language Models
(VLMs), with current approaches struggling to achieve robust performance
despite recent advances. We identify that this limitation stems from a critical
gap: existing methods attempt to learn spatial reasoning directly without
establishing the hierarchical foundations of perception and understanding. To
address this challenge, we present a comprehensive methodology for building
spatial intelligence progressively. We introduce SpatialLadder-26k, a
multimodal dataset containing 26,610 samples spanning object localization,
single image, multi-view, and video spatial reasoning tasks, constructed
through a standardized pipeline that ensures systematic coverage across
modalities. Building on this dataset, we design a three-stage progressive
training framework that (1) establishes spatial perception through object
localization, (2) develops spatial understanding through multi-dimensional
spatial tasks, and (3) strengthens complex reasoning via reinforcement learning
with verifiable rewards. This approach yields SpatialLadder, a 3B-parameter
model that achieves state-of-the-art performance on spatial reasoning
benchmarks, with 23.4% average improvement over the base model, surpassing
GPT-4o by 20.8% and Gemini-2.0-Flash by 10.1%. Notably, SpatialLadder maintains
strong generalization with 7.2% improvement on out-of-domain benchmarks,
demonstrating that progressive training from perception to reasoning is
essential for robust spatial intelligence.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper presents Kontinuous Kontext, a model for instruction-driven image editing that enables fine-grained control of edit strength via a scalar parameter.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fine-grained control over the extent of edits in instruction-based image editing is currently limited, necessitating a solution that allows users to intuitively adjust edits across a spectrum.

Method: The model extends a state-of-the-art image editing system by incorporating a scalar edit strength parameter, paired with instructions and processed via a lightweight projector network mapping to modulation space. The dataset for training is synthesized and filtered for quality.

Result: Kontinuous Kontext enables continuous and smooth control over edit strength, supporting diverse editing operations including stylization, attribute adjustment, and object modifications.

Conclusion: The approach provides a generalizable method for instruction-based image editing, offering granular control across various edits without the need for attribute-specific training.

Abstract: Instruction-based image editing offers a powerful and intuitive way to
manipulate images through natural language. Yet, relying solely on text
instructions limits fine-grained control over the extent of edits. We introduce
Kontinuous Kontext, an instruction-driven editing model that provides a new
dimension of control over edit strength, enabling users to adjust edits
gradually from no change to a fully realized result in a smooth and continuous
manner. Kontinuous Kontext extends a state-of-the-art image editing model to
accept an additional input, a scalar edit strength which is then paired with
the edit instruction, enabling explicit control over the extent of the edit. To
inject this scalar information, we train a lightweight projector network that
maps the input scalar and the edit instruction to coefficients in the model's
modulation space. For training our model, we synthesize a diverse dataset of
image-edit-instruction-strength quadruplets using existing generative models,
followed by a filtering stage to ensure quality and consistency. Kontinuous
Kontext provides a unified approach for fine-grained control over edit strength
for instruction driven editing from subtle to strong across diverse operations
such as stylization, attribute, material, background, and shape changes,
without requiring attribute-specific training.

TL;DR: The study investigates the capacity of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) for long-chain reflective reasoning, introduces a benchmark named MM-HELIX, reveals performance deficits, and proposes a novel training strategy to address them.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current MLLMs show proficiency in reasoning tasks but struggle with long-chain reflective reasoning, a key component for solving complex real-world problems.

Method: The researchers constructed the MM-HELIX benchmark and its large-scale dataset MM-HELIX-100K, alongside developing Adaptive Hybrid Policy Optimization (AHPO), a dynamic training strategy combining offline supervision and online optimization.

Result: The proposed method achieves significant performance improvements: +18.6% on the MM-HELIX benchmark and +5.7% on general mathematics and logic tasks when applied to the Qwen2.5-VL-7B baseline.

Conclusion: Reflective reasoning, critical for tackling complex reasoning tasks, can be effectively learned and generalized in MLLMs, offering a pathway to enhance their capabilities for real-world problem-solving.

Abstract: While current Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated
proficiency in reasoning tasks such as mathematics and logic, their capacity
for long-chain reflective reasoning, a prerequisite for solving complex
real-world problems, remains largely underexplored. In this work, we first
conduct an extensive empirical investigation to evaluate this capability.
Leveraging a carefully designed data synthesis engine, we construct MM-HELIX, a
multimodal benchmark consisting 1,260 samples of 42 challenging synthetic tasks
that require iterative thinking and backtracking. Empirical results on this
benchmark reveal that existing MLLMs exhibit significant performance deficits
in long-chain reflective reasoning. To address this limitation, we generate
post-training data and further explore learning paradigms for exploiting such
data. We first develop the Step-Elicited Response Generation pipeline to create
MM-HELIX-100K, a large-scale dataset of 100k high-quality, reflective reasoning
traces for instruction-tuning stage. Given that standard Reinforcement Learning
fails on complex tasks due to sparse reward signals and catastrophic forgetting
after Supervised Fine-Tuning, we propose Adaptive Hybrid Policy Optimization
(AHPO), a novel training strategy that dynamically unifies offline supervision
and online optimization into a single stage. This strategy enables the model to
learn from expert data when rewards are sparse and conduct independent
exploration once proficient. When applied to the Qwen2.5-VL-7B baseline, our
method achieves a +18.6\% accuracy improvement on MM-HELIX benchmark and
demonstrates strong generalization with a +5.7\% average performance gain on
general mathematic and logic tasks. Our work demonstrate that reflective
reasoning in MLLMs can be effectively learned and generalized, paving the way
for developing more capable MLLMs.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces the VideoNorms benchmark to assess cultural awareness in Video Language Models (VideoLLMs) based on annotated video clips from US and Chinese cultures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the lack of benchmarks for evaluating cultural awareness in VideoLLMs as they operate globally.

Method: A human-AI collaboration framework is used for annotation, where an AI model suggests annotations that human experts validate and refine.

Result: The study reveals that models struggle with norm violations, Chinese cultural context, non-verbal evidence, and identifying specific norms related to speech acts.

Conclusion: Culturally-grounded training for VideoLLMs is critical, and VideoNorms provides a new benchmark and framework to start addressing this gap.

Abstract: As Video Large Language Models (VideoLLMs) are deployed globally, they
require understanding of and grounding in the relevant cultural background. To
properly assess these models' cultural awareness, adequate benchmarks are
needed. We introduce VideoNorms, a benchmark of over 1000 (video clip, norm)
pairs from US and Chinese cultures annotated with socio-cultural norms grounded
in speech act theory, norm adherence and violations labels, and verbal and
non-verbal evidence. To build VideoNorms, we use a human-AI collaboration
framework, where a teacher model using theoretically-grounded prompting
provides candidate annotations and a set of trained human experts validate and
correct the annotations. We benchmark a variety of open-weight VideoLLMs on the
new dataset which highlight several common trends: 1) models performs worse on
norm violation than adherence; 2) models perform worse w.r.t Chinese culture
compared to the US culture; 3) models have more difficulty in providing
non-verbal evidence compared to verbal for the norm adhere/violation label and
struggle to identify the exact norm corresponding to a speech-act; and 4)
unlike humans, models perform worse in formal, non-humorous contexts. Our
findings emphasize the need for culturally-grounded video language model
training - a gap our benchmark and framework begin to address.

TL;DR: The paper introduces ARTDECO, a framework for efficient and high-quality on-the-fly 3D reconstruction using monocular image sequences.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the tradeoff in current 3D reconstruction methods: achieving both computational efficiency and reconstruction fidelity.

Method: ARTDECO combines 3D foundation models for pose estimation and point prediction with a Gaussian decoder for structured 3D representation, supported by a hierarchical Gaussian representation and LoD-aware rendering strategy.

Result: ARTDECO demonstrates interactive performance like SLAM, robustness of feed-forward systems, and quality approaching per-scene optimization across eight indoor and outdoor benchmarks.

Conclusion: ARTDECO bridges the gap between real-time efficiency and high-quality 3D reconstruction, offering a practical solution for applications in real-world environment digitization.

Abstract: On-the-fly 3D reconstruction from monocular image sequences is a
long-standing challenge in computer vision, critical for applications such as
real-to-sim, AR/VR, and robotics. Existing methods face a major tradeoff:
per-scene optimization yields high fidelity but is computationally expensive,
whereas feed-forward foundation models enable real-time inference but struggle
with accuracy and robustness. In this work, we propose ARTDECO, a unified
framework that combines the efficiency of feed-forward models with the
reliability of SLAM-based pipelines. ARTDECO uses 3D foundation models for pose
estimation and point prediction, coupled with a Gaussian decoder that
transforms multi-scale features into structured 3D Gaussians. To sustain both
fidelity and efficiency at scale, we design a hierarchical Gaussian
representation with a LoD-aware rendering strategy, which improves rendering
fidelity while reducing redundancy. Experiments on eight diverse indoor and
outdoor benchmarks show that ARTDECO delivers interactive performance
comparable to SLAM, robustness similar to feed-forward systems, and
reconstruction quality close to per-scene optimization, providing a practical
path toward on-the-fly digitization of real-world environments with both
accurate geometry and high visual fidelity. Explore more demos on our project

*Minghong Cai,Qiulin Wang,Zongli Ye,Wenze Liu,Quande Liu,Weicai Ye,Xintao Wang,Pengfei Wan,Kun Gai,Xiangyu Yue*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces VideoCanvas, a framework for arbitrary spatio-temporal video completion, unifying multiple video generation tasks into a single paradigm and overcoming challenges in precise temporal control.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to develop a unified approach for various controllable video generation tasks by addressing challenges in temporal precision due to causal VAE's ambiguous frame-level conditioning.

Method: The method involves VideoCanvas, which utilizes a hybrid conditioning strategy combining zero-padding for spatial control and Temporal RoPE Interpolation for temporal alignment, enabling fine-grained video generation using latent video diffusion models.

Result: VideoCanvas achieves superior performance over existing methods in arbitrary spatio-temporal video completion, as evidenced by the new benchmark VideoCanvasBench that evaluates fidelity and creativity.

Conclusion: VideoCanvas establishes a new state of the art in flexible, unified video generation by resolving key challenges in spatio-temporal control.

Abstract: We introduce the task of arbitrary spatio-temporal video completion, where a
video is generated from arbitrary, user-specified patches placed at any spatial
location and timestamp, akin to painting on a video canvas. This flexible
formulation naturally unifies many existing controllable video generation
tasks--including first-frame image-to-video, inpainting, extension, and
interpolation--under a single, cohesive paradigm. Realizing this vision,
however, faces a fundamental obstacle in modern latent video diffusion models:
the temporal ambiguity introduced by causal VAEs, where multiple pixel frames
are compressed into a single latent representation, making precise frame-level
conditioning structurally difficult. We address this challenge with
VideoCanvas, a novel framework that adapts the In-Context Conditioning (ICC)
paradigm to this fine-grained control task with zero new parameters. We propose
a hybrid conditioning strategy that decouples spatial and temporal control:
spatial placement is handled via zero-padding, while temporal alignment is
achieved through Temporal RoPE Interpolation, which assigns each condition a
continuous fractional position within the latent sequence. This resolves the
VAE's temporal ambiguity and enables pixel-frame-aware control on a frozen
backbone. To evaluate this new capability, we develop VideoCanvasBench, the
first benchmark for arbitrary spatio-temporal video completion, covering both
intra-scene fidelity and inter-scene creativity. Experiments demonstrate that
VideoCanvas significantly outperforms existing conditioning paradigms,
establishing a new state of the art in flexible and unified video generation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces SciVideoBench, a benchmark for complex video reasoning in scientific domains. Current Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) face significant challenges in this area.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a lack of benchmarks to evaluate advanced video reasoning capabilities, particularly in scientific contexts requiring higher-order cognitive skills.

Method: A benchmark called SciVideoBench was created with 1,000 multiple-choice questions derived from scientific experimental videos across 25 academic subjects, verified using a semi-automated system.

Result: State-of-the-art LMMs, including Gemini 2.5 Pro and Qwen2.5-VL, show significant performance deficits on SciVideoBench. Factors like reasoning complexity and visual grounding were analyzed.

Conclusion: SciVideoBench reveals a gap in advanced video reasoning capabilities and offers direction for improving multimodal AI, aiming to drive advancements in AI for science.

Abstract: Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) have achieved remarkable progress across
various capabilities; however, complex video reasoning in the scientific domain
remains a significant and challenging frontier. Current video benchmarks
predominantly target general scenarios where perception/recognition is heavily
relied on, while with relatively simple reasoning tasks, leading to saturation
and thus failing to effectively evaluate advanced multimodal cognitive skills.
To address this critical gap, we introduce SciVideoBench, a rigorous benchmark
specifically designed to assess advanced video reasoning in scientific
contexts. SciVideoBench consists of 1,000 carefully crafted multiple-choice
questions derived from cutting-edge scientific experimental videos spanning
over 25 specialized academic subjects and verified by a semi-automatic system.
Each question demands sophisticated domain-specific knowledge, precise
spatiotemporal perception, and intricate logical reasoning, effectively
challenging models' higher-order cognitive abilities. Our evaluation highlights
significant performance deficits in state-of-the-art proprietary and
open-source LMMs, including Gemini 2.5 Pro and Qwen2.5-VL, indicating
substantial room for advancement in video reasoning capabilities. Detailed
analyses of critical factors such as reasoning complexity and visual grounding
provide valuable insights and clear direction for future developments in LMMs,
driving the evolution of truly capable multimodal AI co-scientists. We hope
SciVideoBench could fit the interests of the community and help to push the
boundary of cutting-edge AI for border science.

### [269] [MultiCOIN: Multi-Modal COntrollable Video INbetweening](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08561)
*Maham Tanveer,Yang Zhou,Simon Niklaus,Ali Mahdavi Amiri,Hao Zhang,Krishna Kumar Singh,Nanxuan Zhao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper presents a video inbetweening framework, "modelname," that offers advanced multi-modal controls to enhance video editing and interpolation, addressing limitations of existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the shortcomings of current video inbetweening methods, which struggle with complex motions, lack fine control, and misalign with user creative intent.

Method: The approach uses the Diffusion Transformer (DiT) for video generation, maps various motion controls to a unified point-based representation, and separates content and motion controls into two branches in the model. A stage-wise training strategy is employed for smooth learning of controls.

Result: The framework achieves flexibility, precision, and ease of use for fine-grained video interpolation. Experiments confirm its dynamic, customizable, and accurate visual outputs.

Conclusion: Multi-modal controls and the novel model design provide significant improvements in video inbetweening, making it a valuable tool for creative and intricate video editing.

Abstract: Video inbetweening creates smooth and natural transitions between two image
frames, making it an indispensable tool for video editing and long-form video
synthesis. Existing works in this domain are unable to generate large, complex,
or intricate motions. In particular, they cannot accommodate the versatility of
user intents and generally lack fine control over the details of intermediate
frames, leading to misalignment with the creative mind. To fill these gaps, we
introduce \modelname{}, a video inbetweening framework that allows multi-modal
controls, including depth transition and layering, motion trajectories, text
prompts, and target regions for movement localization, while achieving a
balance between flexibility, ease of use, and precision for fine-grained video
interpolation. To achieve this, we adopt the Diffusion Transformer (DiT)
architecture as our video generative model, due to its proven capability to
generate high-quality long videos. To ensure compatibility between DiT and our
multi-modal controls, we map all motion controls into a common sparse and
user-friendly point-based representation as the video/noise input. Further, to
respect the variety of controls which operate at varying levels of granularity
and influence, we separate content controls and motion controls into two
branches to encode the required features before guiding the denoising process,
resulting in two generators, one for motion and the other for content. Finally,
we propose a stage-wise training strategy to ensure that our model learns the
multi-modal controls smoothly. Extensive qualitative and quantitative
experiments demonstrate that multi-modal controls enable a more dynamic,
customizable, and contextually accurate visual narrative.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper explores end-to-end training for Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to improve performance and training efficiency. It introduces an optimal architecture called NaViL and verifies its effectiveness on various benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to overcome the limitations of compositional training in MLLMs, particularly the challenges of multimodal scaling due to separated training, and to better understand end-to-end native training.

Method: The study systematically evaluates the design space and scaling properties of end-to-end MLLMs, identifies an optimal architecture, and proposes NaViL with a cost-effective training recipe.

Result: NaViL demonstrates competitive performance across 14 multimodal benchmarks, showcasing a strong positive scaling relationship between visual encoders and LLMs when trained natively.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that native end-to-end training of MLLMs can achieve balanced performance and efficiency while providing valuable insights for future research in this domain.

Abstract: Compositional training has been the de-facto paradigm in existing Multimodal
Large Language Models (MLLMs), where pre-trained vision encoders are connected
with pre-trained LLMs through continuous multimodal pre-training. However, the
multimodal scaling property of this paradigm remains difficult to explore due
to the separated training. In this paper, we focus on the native training of
MLLMs in an end-to-end manner and systematically study its design space and
scaling property under a practical setting, i.e., data constraint. Through
careful study of various choices in MLLM, we obtain the optimal
meta-architecture that best balances performance and training cost. After that,
we further explore the scaling properties of the native MLLM and indicate the
positively correlated scaling relationship between visual encoders and LLMs.
Based on these findings, we propose a native MLLM called NaViL, combined with a
simple and cost-effective recipe. Experimental results on 14 multimodal
benchmarks confirm the competitive performance of NaViL against existing MLLMs.
Besides that, our findings and results provide in-depth insights for the future
study of native MLLMs.

*Meixi Song,Xin Lin,Dizhe Zhang,Haodong Li,Xiangtai Li,Bo Du,Lu Qi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes D$^2$GS, a unified framework to address performance instability and degradation in 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) for novel view synthesis under sparse-view conditions. Extensive experiments show improved visual quality and robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current 3D Gaussian Splatting approaches suffer from overfitting near cameras and underfitting in far-field areas when views are sparse, compromising stability and fidelity during novel view synthesis.

Method: D$^2$GS introduces a Depth-and-Density Guided Dropout strategy to address overfitting by masking redundant Gaussians, and a Distance-Aware Fidelity Enhancement module to tackle underfitting through targeted far-field supervision.

Result: The proposed method improves visual quality and stability in sparse-view 3D Gaussian Splatting, supported by a new evaluation metric for robustness and extensive experiments on multiple datasets.

Conclusion: D$^2$GS enhances 3DGS by delivering high-fidelity novel view synthesis that is robust even in conditions with sparse input views, solving key failure modes and improving performance.

Abstract: Recent advances in 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) enable real-time,
high-fidelity novel view synthesis (NVS) with explicit 3D representations.
However, performance degradation and instability remain significant under
sparse-view conditions. In this work, we identify two key failure modes under
sparse-view conditions: overfitting in regions with excessive Gaussian density
near the camera, and underfitting in distant areas with insufficient Gaussian
coverage. To address these challenges, we propose a unified framework D$^2$GS,
comprising two key components: a Depth-and-Density Guided Dropout strategy that
suppresses overfitting by adaptively masking redundant Gaussians based on
density and depth, and a Distance-Aware Fidelity Enhancement module that
improves reconstruction quality in under-fitted far-field areas through
targeted supervision. Moreover, we introduce a new evaluation metric to
quantify the stability of learned Gaussian distributions, providing insights
into the robustness of the sparse-view 3DGS. Extensive experiments on multiple
datasets demonstrate that our method significantly improves both visual quality
and robustness under sparse view conditions. The project page can be found at:

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposed a vision-centric agent tuning framework with a newly constructed large dataset and improved multimodal tool-use reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing vision language models (VLMs) have limited effectiveness in complex reasoning and decision-making due to a lack of high-quality multimodal data and high annotation costs.

Method: Implemented a framework that automatically synthesizes multimodal trajectories, builds a large dataset (M-TRACE), and incorporates preference learning (Pref-X) to improve a VLM controller (MATRIX).

Result: The MATRIX agent, fine-tuned using the proposed framework, outperforms both open- and closed-source VLMs across multiple benchmarks.

Conclusion: The proposed framework is effective and scalable for equipping VLMs with improved multimodal reasoning and tool-use capabilities.

Abstract: Vision language models (VLMs) are increasingly deployed as controllers with
access to external tools for complex reasoning and decision-making, yet their
effectiveness remains limited by the scarcity of high-quality multimodal
trajectories and the cost of manual annotation. We address this challenge with
a vision-centric agent tuning framework that automatically synthesizes
multimodal trajectories, generates step-wise preference pairs, and trains a VLM
controller for robust tool-use reasoning. Our pipeline first constructs
M-TRACE, a large-scale dataset of 28.5K multimodal tasks with 177K verified
trajectories, enabling imitation-based trajectory tuning. Building on this, we
develop MATRIX Agent, a controller finetuned on M-TRACE for step-wise tool
reasoning. To achieve finer alignment, we further introduce Pref-X, a set of
11K automatically generated preference pairs, and optimize MATRIX on it via
step-wise preference learning. Across three benchmarks, Agent-X, GTA, and GAIA,
MATRIX consistently surpasses both open- and closed-source VLMs, demonstrating
scalable and effective multimodal tool use. Our data and code is avaliable at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ReSplat introduces a recurrent Gaussian splatting model that efficiently refines rendering using feedback signals, outperforming previous methods in performance and speed.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations in computational efficiency and adaptability of feed-forward Gaussian splatting models reliant on single-pass inference.

Method: A feed-forward recurrent Gaussian splatting model leveraging rendering errors as feedback signals for iterative refinement and introducing a compact reconstruction model for Gaussian initialization in subsampled space.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance across various input views, resolutions, and datasets while significantly reducing Gaussian count and improving rendering speed.

Conclusion: ReSplat demonstrates robust generalization, enhanced computational efficiency, and superior rendering quality compared to traditional methods.

Abstract: While feed-forward Gaussian splatting models provide computational efficiency
and effectively handle sparse input settings, their performance is
fundamentally limited by the reliance on a single forward pass during
inference. We propose ReSplat, a feed-forward recurrent Gaussian splatting
model that iteratively refines 3D Gaussians without explicitly computing
gradients. Our key insight is that the Gaussian splatting rendering error
serves as a rich feedback signal, guiding the recurrent network to learn
effective Gaussian updates. This feedback signal naturally adapts to unseen
data distributions at test time, enabling robust generalization. To initialize
the recurrent process, we introduce a compact reconstruction model that
operates in a $16 \times$ subsampled space, producing $16 \times$ fewer
Gaussians than previous per-pixel Gaussian models. This substantially reduces
computational overhead and allows for efficient Gaussian updates. Extensive
experiments across varying of input views (2, 8, 16), resolutions ($256 \times
256$ to $540 \times 960$), and datasets (DL3DV and RealEstate10K) demonstrate
that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance while significantly
reducing the number of Gaussians and improving the rendering speed. Our project

### [274] [Adaptive Execution Scheduler for DataDios SmartDiff](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07811)
*Aryan Poduri*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: The paper introduces SmartDiff, an adaptive scheduler that reduces latency and optimizes execution for differencing engines using two modes: in-memory threads and Dask-based parallelism.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Latency reduction and memory optimization in differencing engines, while maintaining throughput without exceeding CPU and memory budgets.

Method: SmartDiff employs adaptive tuning for batch sizes and execution resources, uses profiling and cost/memory models for safety, and applies a guarded hill-climb policy for optimization.

Result: The scheduler decreases p95 latency by 23-40% and peak memory usage by 16-32% compared to existing methods, with zero out-of-memory errors.

Conclusion: SmartDiff offers a robust solution to improve latency, memory efficiency, and reliability in differencing engines while ensuring execution safety.

Abstract: We present an adaptive scheduler for a single differencing engine (SmartDiff)
with two execution modes: (i) in-memory threads and (ii) Dask based
parallelism. The scheduler continuously tunes batch size and worker/thread
count within fixed CPU and memory budgets to minimize p95 latency. A
lightweight preflight profiler estimates bytes/row and I/O rate; an online
cost/memory model prunes unsafe actions; and a guarded hill-climb policy favors
lower latency with backpressure and straggler mitigation. Backend selection is
gated by a conservative working-set estimate so that in-memory execution is
chosen when safe, otherwise Dask is used. Across synthetic and public tabular
benchmarks, the scheduler reduces p95 latency by 23 to 28 percent versus a
tuned warm-up heuristic (and by 35 to 40 percent versus fixed grid baselines),
while lowering peak memory by 16 to 22 percent (25 to 32 percent vs. fixed)
with zero OOMs and comparable throughput.

Abstract: The increasing capabilities of Digital Twins (DTs) in the context of the

real-time operation. This paper introduces the concept, design, and
experimental evaluation of the DT Simulation Bridge - a software framework that
enables diverse interaction patterns between active DTs and simulation
environments. The framework supports both the DT development lifecycle and the
incorporation of simulations during active operation. Through bidirectional
data exchange, simulations can update DT models dynamically, while DTs provide
real-time feedback to adapt simulation parameters. We describe the
architectural design and core software components that ensure flexible
interoperability and scalable deployment. Experimental results show that the DT
Simulation Bridge enhances design agility, facilitates virtual commissioning,
and supports live behavioral analysis under realistic conditions, demonstrating
its effectiveness across a range of industrial scenarios.

*Natalie Carl,Tobias Pfandzelter,David Bermbach*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: The paper rethinks serverless computing architecture by proposing hardware isolation for energy-efficient operation, achieving substantial energy savings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current serverless platforms focus on running multiple functions with software isolation, overprovisioning, and traditional server optimizations, leading to inefficiencies in energy consumption.

Method: The paper proposes a novel hardware architecture for serverless computing, where each function is isolated on individual processors, minimizing energy usage when applications perform work.

Result: Preliminary evaluation with real hardware and serverless workloads shows a potential reduction in energy consumption overheads by 90.63%, saving an average of 70.8MW.

Conclusion: Aligning serverless hardware systems with software requirements through hardware isolation can significantly enhance energy efficiency in serverless computing.

Abstract: Serverless computing provides just-in-time infrastructure provisioning with
rapid elasticity and a finely-grained pricing model. As full control of
resource allocation is in the hands of the cloud provider and applications only
consume resources when they actually perform work, we believe that serverless
computing is uniquely positioned to maximize energy efficiency.
  However, the focus of current serverless platforms is to run hundreds or
thousands of serverless functions from different tenants on traditional server
hardware, requiring expensive software isolation mechanisms and a high degree
of overprovisioning, i.e., idle servers, to anticipate load spikes. With shared
caches, high clock frequencies, and many-core architectures, servers today are
optimized for large, singular workloads but not to run thousands of isolated
functions.
  We propose rethinking the serverless hardware architecture to align it with
the requirements of serverless software. Specifically, we propose using
hardware isolation with individual processors per function instead of software
isolation resulting in a serverless hardware stack that consumes energy only
when an application actually performs work. In preliminary evaluation with real
hardware and a typical serverless workload we find that this could reduce
energy consumption overheads by 90.63% or an average 70.8MW.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a distributed resource selection mechanism for cloud-edge environments, focusing on scalability, efficiency, and real-time application orchestration without a central controller.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the inefficiencies and bottlenecks of centralized coordination in dynamic cloud-edge environments by introducing a mechanism that dynamically allocates resources based on context and local knowledge.

Method: The method is a consensus-based mechanism utilizing local knowledge and inter-agent collaboration for resource selection without relying on a central controller.

Result: The mechanism ensures rapid, optimal resource allocations without additional cost, achieving throughput where centralized methods are up to 30 times slower.

Conclusion: The approach is effective for large-scale, dynamic cloud-edge environments, balancing efficiency and scalability without sacrificing allocation quality.

Abstract: This paper presents a distributed resource selection mechanism for diverse
cloud-edge environments, enabling dynamic and context-aware allocation of
resources to meet the demands of complex distributed applications. By
distributing the decision-making process, our approach ensures efficiency,
scalability, and resilience in highly dynamic cloud-edge environments where
centralised coordination becomes a bottleneck. The proposed mechanism aims to
function as a core component of a broader, distributed, and self-organising
orchestration system that facilitates the intelligent placement and adaptation
of applications in real-time. This work leverages a consensus-based mechanism
utilising local knowledge and inter-agent collaboration to achieve efficient
results without relying on a central controller, thus paving the way for
distributed orchestration. Our results indicate that computation time is the
key factor influencing allocation decisions. Our approach consistently delivers
rapid allocations without compromising optimality or incurring additional cost,
achieving timely results at scale where exhaustive search is infeasible and
centralised heuristics run up to 30 times slower.

*Dominick Banasik,Varsha Dani,Fabien Dufoulon,Aayush Gupta,Thomas P. Hayes,Gopal Pandurangan*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: The paper introduces energy-efficient algorithms for the MIS problem in radio networks, addressing scenarios with and without collision detection and offering provable optimality in energy usage for certain models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To minimize energy usage in distributed algorithms for MIS problems in battery-powered radio networks, focusing on energy as a critical resource.

Method: This study designs randomized distributed algorithms for radio network models with collision detection (CD) and without collision detection (no-CD), aiming for reduced energy complexity while maintaining low failure probabilities.

Result: For the CD model, the algorithm achieves optimal $O(\log n)$ energy complexity with $O(\log^2 n)$ round complexity. For the no-CD model, the algorithm cuts energy complexity to $O(\log^2n \log \log n)$ compared to the prior $O(\log^3 n)$.

Conclusion: The algorithms significantly lower energy consumption compared to previous approaches, establishing new benchmarks in energy efficiency for MIS problems in radio network models.

Abstract: The maximal independent set (MIS) is one of the most fundamental problems in
distributed computing, and it has been studied intensively for over four
decades. This paper focuses on the MIS problem in the Radio Network model, a
standard model widely used to model wireless networks, particularly ad hoc
wireless and sensor networks. Energy is a premium resource in these networks,
which are typically battery-powered. Hence, designing distributed algorithms
that use as little energy as possible is crucial. We use the well-established
energy model where a node can be sleeping or awake in a round, and only the
awake rounds (when it can send or listen) determine the energy complexity of
the algorithm, which we want to minimize.
  We present new, more energy-efficient MIS algorithms in radio networks with
arbitrary and unknown graph topology. We present algorithms for two popular
variants of the radio model -- with collision detection (CD) and without
collision detection (no-CD). Specifically, we obtain the following results:
  1. CD model: We present a randomized distributed MIS algorithm with energy
complexity $O(\log n)$, round complexity $O(\log^2 n)$, and failure probability
$1 / poly(n)$, where $n$ is the network size. We show that our energy
complexity is optimal by showing a matching $\Omega(\log n)$ lower bound.
  2. no-CD model: In the more challenging no-CD model, we present a randomized
distributed MIS algorithm with energy complexity $O(\log^2n \log \log n)$,
round complexity $O(\log^3 n \log \Delta)$, and failure probability $1 /
poly(n)$. The energy complexity of our algorithm is significantly lower than
the round (and energy) complexity of $O(\log^3 n)$ of the best known
distributed MIS algorithm of Davies [PODC 2023] for arbitrary graph topology.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Integrating GPU acceleration into scientific frameworks like OpenFOAM is challenging due to trade-offs between performance and development effort in existing methods.

Method: The study proposes a computational model with matrix repartitioning and update procedures to balance CPU matrix assembly and GPU linear solves.

Result: The proposed strategy alleviates oversubscription issues, leading to better resource utilization and solver performance in CPU-GPU environments.

Conclusion: Matrix repartitioning enhances performance in complex CFD simulations by effectively utilizing heterogeneous computing resources.

Abstract: Modern high-performance computing (HPC) increasingly relies on GPUs, but
integrating GPU acceleration into complex scientific frameworks like OpenFOAM
remains a challenge. Existing approaches either fully refactor the codebase or
use plugin-based GPU solvers, each facing trade-offs between performance and
development effort. In this work, we address the limitations of plugin-based
GPU acceleration in OpenFOAM by proposing a repartitioning strategy that better
balances CPU matrix assembly and GPU-based linear solves. We present a detailed
computational model, describe a novel matrix repartitioning and update
procedure, and evaluate its performance on large-scale CFD simulations. Our
results show that the proposed method significantly mitigates oversubscription
issues, improving solver performance and resource utilization in heterogeneous
CPU-GPU environments.

TL;DR: This paper investigates the foundational step of identifying behavioral and emotional patterns in autistic children to improve educational outcomes through evidence-based, targeted frameworks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the gap in understanding nuanced behavioral and emotional patterns of autistic children, particularly before skill development begins.

Method: The study employs a longitudinal approach to monitor emotions and behaviors in autistic students, complemented by a detailed analysis to propose a targeted framework for intervention.

Result: The research identifies unique behavioral and emotional trends in autistic children and proposes a framework for developing personalized applications and technical aids.

Conclusion: Early identification and evidence-based intervention focusing on individual behavioral and emotional landscapes can lead to more inclusive learning environments and better developmental outcomes for children with ASD.

Abstract: Autism Spectrum Disorder significantly influences the communication
abilities, learning processes, behavior, and social interactions of
individuals. Although early intervention and customized educational strategies
are critical to improving outcomes, there is a pivotal gap in understanding and
addressing nuanced behavioral patterns and emotional identification in autistic
children prior to skill development. This extended research delves into the
foundational step of recognizing and mapping these patterns as a prerequisite
to improving learning and soft skills. Using a longitudinal approach to monitor
emotions and behaviors, this study aims to establish a baseline understanding
of the unique needs and challenges faced by autistic students, particularly in
the Information Technology domain, where opportunities are markedly limited.
Through a detailed analysis of behavioral trends over time, we propose a
targeted framework for developing applications and technical aids designed to
meet these identified needs. Our research underscores the importance of a
sequential and evidence-based intervention approach that prioritizes a deep
understanding of each child's behavioral and emotional landscape as the basis
for effective skill development. By shifting the focus toward early
identification of behavioral patterns, we aim to foster a more inclusive and
supportive learning environment that can significantly improve the educational
and developmental trajectory of children with ASD.

*Md. Saiful Bari Siddiqui,Md Mohaiminul Islam,Md. Golam Rabiul Alam*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces DUA-D2C, an enhancement of the Divide2Conquer (D2C) method, which dynamically weights subset models based on uncertainty and validation set performance to combat overfitting in neural networks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Overfitting is a persistent issue in deep learning, especially due to data outliers, noise, and limited training datasets, limiting model generalization.

Method: The proposed DUA-D2C refines the previous D2C by assigning dynamic weights to subset models based on accuracy and uncertainty, evaluated on a validation set, for better aggregation and decision-making.

Result: Empirical results on benchmark datasets across domains show that DUA-D2C significantly boosts generalization performance and complements other regularization techniques.

Conclusion: DUA-D2C is a theoretically sound and practical approach to mitigating overfitting, improving deep learning models' consistency and adaptability.

Abstract: Overfitting remains a significant challenge in deep learning, often arising
from data outliers, noise, and limited training data. To address this, the
Divide2Conquer (D2C) method was previously proposed, which partitions training
data into multiple subsets and trains identical models independently on each.
This strategy enables learning more consistent patterns while minimizing the
influence of individual outliers and noise. However, D2C's standard aggregation
typically treats all subset models equally or based on fixed heuristics (like
data size), potentially underutilizing information about their varying
generalization capabilities. Building upon this foundation, we introduce
Dynamic Uncertainty-Aware Divide2Conquer (DUA-D2C), an advanced technique that
refines the aggregation process. DUA-D2C dynamically weights the contributions
of subset models based on their performance on a shared validation set,
considering both accuracy and prediction uncertainty. This intelligent
aggregation allows the central model to preferentially learn from subsets
yielding more generalizable and confident edge models, thereby more effectively
combating overfitting. Empirical evaluations on benchmark datasets spanning
multiple domains demonstrate that DUA-D2C significantly improves
generalization. Our analysis includes evaluations of decision boundaries, loss
curves, and other performance metrics, highlighting the effectiveness of
DUA-D2C. This study demonstrates that DUA-D2C improves generalization
performance even when applied on top of other regularization methods,
establishing it as a theoretically grounded and effective approach to combating
overfitting in modern deep learning. Our codes are publicly available at:

TL;DR: This paper introduces MACC-MGNAS, a genetic algorithm-based architecture search for multimodal graph neural networks, aimed at improving co-exploitation vulnerability prediction. It achieves superior performance compared to state-of-the-art models while reducing computation costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to mitigate the severe risks posed by co-exploitation attacks on software vulnerabilities by addressing modality heterogeneity and computational challenges inherent in designing multimodal graph neural network architectures.

Method: The authors propose a modality-aware cooperative co-evolutionary algorithm (MACC-MGNAS) that uses genetic algorithms to optimize multimodal graph neural networks. It features three key innovations: modality-specific cooperative co-evolution framework, a dual-track surrogate method to cut down evaluation costs, and a population diversity indicator to balance exploration and exploitation.

Result: MACC-MGNAS achieves an F1-score of 81.67% on the VulCE dataset, outperforming existing state-of-the-art models by 8.7% in accuracy and reducing computation costs by 27%, requiring only 3 GPU-hours.

Conclusion: MACC-MGNAS effectively addresses the challenges of designing multimodal graph neural networks for vulnerability analysis, offering state-of-the-art results with reduced computational demands.

Abstract: Co-exploitation attacks on software vulnerabilities pose severe risks to
enterprises, a threat that can be mitigated by analyzing heterogeneous and
multimodal vulnerability data. Multimodal graph neural networks (MGNNs) are
well-suited to integrate complementary signals across modalities, thereby
improving attack-prediction accuracy. However, designing an effective MGNN
architecture is challenging because it requires coordinating modality-specific
components at each layer, which is infeasible through manual tuning. Genetic
algorithm (GA)-based graph neural architecture search (GNAS) provides a natural
solution, yet existing methods are confined to single modalities and overlook
modality heterogeneity. To address this limitation, we propose a modality-aware
cooperative co-evolutionary algorithm for multimodal graph neural architecture
search, termed MACC-MGNAS. First, we develop a modality-aware cooperative
co-evolution (MACC) framework under a divide-and-conquer paradigm: a
coordinator partitions a global chromosome population into modality-specific
gene groups, local workers evolve them independently, and the coordinator
reassembles chromosomes for joint evaluation. This framework effectively
captures modality heterogeneity ignored by single-modality GNAS. Second, we
introduce a modality-aware dual-track surrogate (MADTS) method to reduce
evaluation cost and accelerate local gene evolution. Third, we design a
similarity-based population diversity indicator (SPDI) strategy to adaptively
balance exploration and exploitation, thereby accelerating convergence and
avoiding local optima. On a standard vulnerabilities co-exploitation (VulCE)
dataset, MACC-MGNAS achieves an F1-score of 81.67% within only 3 GPU-hours,
outperforming the state-of-the-art competitor by 8.7% F1 while reducing
computation cost by 27%.

*Md Zubair,Hao Zheng,Nussdorf Jonathan,Grayson W. Armstrong,Lucy Q. Shen,Gabriela Wilson,Yu Tian,Xingquan Zhu,Min Shi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces MultiFair, a method to address biased and unfair multimodal medical decision systems by dynamically modulating training gradients for better performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multimodal learning models for medical diagnosis often suffer from biased performance across data modalities and demographic groups, leading to unreliable and unfair results.

Method: The paper proposes MultiFair, which employs a dual-level gradient modulation process that dynamically adjusts training gradients based on data modality and demographic group optimization.

Result: Experiments conducted on two multimodal medical datasets demonstrate that MultiFair surpasses current state-of-the-art methods in both multimodal learning and fairness.

Conclusion: MultiFair presents a significant improvement in addressing biases and ensuring fairness in multimodal medical classification systems.

Abstract: Medical decision systems increasingly rely on data from multiple sources to
ensure reliable and unbiased diagnosis. However, existing multimodal learning
models fail to achieve this goal because they often ignore two critical
challenges. First, various data modalities may learn unevenly, thereby
converging to a model biased towards certain modalities. Second, the model may
emphasize learning on certain demographic groups causing unfair performances.
The two aspects can influence each other, as different data modalities may
favor respective groups during optimization, leading to both imbalanced and
unfair multimodal learning. This paper proposes a novel approach called
MultiFair for multimodal medical classification, which addresses these
challenges with a dual-level gradient modulation process. MultiFair dynamically
modulates training gradients regarding the optimization direction and magnitude
at both data modality and group levels. We conduct extensive experiments on two
multimodal medical datasets with different demographic groups. The results show
that MultiFair outperforms state-of-the-art multimodal learning and fairness
learning methods.

*Aditya Chakravarty*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper evaluates the robustness of crop yield forecasting models under out-of-distribution conditions, using a large dataset. GNN-RNN outperforms MMST-ViT in generalization, training speed, and real-world applicability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Climate change increasingly disrupts agriculture, necessitating reliable crop yield forecasting methods. Accurate forecasting can ensure food security amidst these disruptions.

Method: The study benchmarked two models (GNN-RNN and MMST-ViT) using the CropNet dataset under realistic out-of-distribution conditions, employing leave-one-cluster-out cross-validation across large geographic areas and year-ahead predictions.

Result: GNN-RNN demonstrated better cross-region generalization and faster training times (14 minutes vs. 31.5 hours of MMST-ViT). MMST-ViT performed well in-domain but degraded under OOD conditions. Regional variability in model performance was observed.

Conclusion: Spatial-temporal alignment is more critical than model complexity or data scale for robust generalization. Transparent evaluation protocols are needed for climate-aware agricultural forecasting models to ensure reliability and equity.

Abstract: Climate change is increasingly disrupting agricultural systems, making
accurate crop yield forecasting essential for food security. While deep
learning models have shown promise in yield prediction using satellite and
weather data, their ability to generalize across geographic regions and years -
critical for real-world deployment - remains largely untested. We benchmark two
state-of-the-art models, GNN-RNN and MMST-ViT, under realistic
out-of-distribution (OOD) conditions using the large-scale CropNet dataset
spanning 1,200+ U.S. counties from 2017-2022. Through leave-one-cluster-out
cross-validation across seven USDA Farm Resource Regions and year-ahead
prediction scenarios, we identify substantial variability in cross-region
transferability. GNN-RNN demonstrates superior generalization with positive
correlations under geographic shifts, while MMST-ViT performs well in-domain
but degrades sharply under OOD conditions. Regions like Heartland and Northern
Great Plains show stable transfer dynamics (RMSE less than 10 bu/acre for
soybean), whereas Prairie Gateway exhibits persistent underperformance (RMSE
greater than 20 bu/acre) across both models and crops, revealing structural
dissimilarities likely driven by semi-arid climate, irrigation patterns, and
incomplete spectral coverage. Beyond accuracy differences, GNN-RNN achieves
135x faster training than MMST-ViT (14 minutes vs. 31.5 hours), making it more
viable for sustainable deployment. Our findings underscore that
spatial-temporal alignment - not merely model complexity or data scale - is key
to robust generalization, and highlight the need for transparent OOD evaluation
protocols to ensure equitable and reliable climate-aware agricultural
forecasting.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces KernelCoder, a model designed for generating high-performance CUDA kernels, which leverages a new dataset called ConCuR, addressing the challenge of sparse high-quality data in the domain.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The scarcity of high-quality, open-source GPU kernel data poses a challenge for supervised fine-tuning in kernel generation tasks.

Method: A pipeline is developed to generate and curate high-quality CUDA kernels with reasoning traces, resulting in the creation of the ConCuR dataset. KernelCoder is then fine-tuned using this curated dataset.

Result: KernelCoder demonstrates significant improvements over leading models in kernel generation tasks, outperforming top-performing and open-source models.

Conclusion: The curated dataset (ConCuR) and KernelCoder provide a framework for advancing GPU kernel generation, with insights and metrics that can guide future data collection and curation efforts.

Abstract: GPU kernel generation by LLMs has recently experienced rapid development,
leveraging test-time scaling and reinforcement learning techniques. However, a
key challenge for kernel generation is the scarcity of high-quality data, as
most high-quality kernels are proprietary and not open-source. This challenge
prevents us from leveraging supervised fine-tuning to align LLMs to the kernel
generation task. To address this challenge, we develop a pipeline that
generates and curates high-quality CUDA kernels with reasoning traces,
motivated by a critical observation that concise yet informative reasoning
traces result in robust generation of high-performance kernels. Using this
pipeline, we construct our dataset ConCuR and introduce our model KernelCoder,
which is the first model trained on a curated dataset consisting of PyTorch,
reasoning, and CUDA kernel pairs, to our knowledge. In the KernelBench setup,
our model achieves significant improvements over the existing top-performing
model, QwQ-32B, and outperforms all open-source models fine-tuned for kernel
generation, as well as frontier models such as DeepSeek-V3.1-Think and
Claude-4-sonnet. Finally, we show that the average reasoning length can serve
as a metric to assess the difficulty of kernel generation tasks. The
observations, metrics, and our data collection and curation pipeline can help
obtain better data in the kernel generation task in the future.

*Yeskendir Koishekenov,Aldo Lipani,Nicola Cancedda*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper presents Encode-Think-Decode (ETD), a method to enhance reasoning in large language models by training models iteratively on key layers during mid-training and inference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional scaling approaches for improving LLM reasoning capabilities often rely on increasing parameters and data or inference complexity, but the paper seeks a more efficient solution based on interpretability studies.

Method: ETD focuses on iterating over select critical reasoning layers during mid-training to amplify latent reasoning, preserving the model’s architecture and resource usage.

Result: ETD achieves significant reasoning performance boosts on 17 benchmarks, including GSM8K (+28.4%) and MATH (+36%), especially using adaptive depth strategies.

Conclusion: Recursive latent reasoning represents an effective approach to improving LLM reasoning, without modifying base architectures or hyperparameters.

Abstract: Most efforts to improve the reasoning capabilities of large language models
(LLMs) involve either scaling the number of parameters and the size of training
data, or scaling inference computation by letting models generate complex
chains of thought. Motivated by interpretability studies showing that the
crucial computation required for reasoning tasks is concentrated in a limited
range of layers, we introduce Encode-Think-Decode (ETD), a method that enhances
the reasoning capabilities of a base model by training it to iterate over a
small subset of reasoning-relevant layers during the mid-training stage. ETD
amplifies latent reasoning while preserving the original architecture,
parameter count, hyperparameters, and training data composition. When iterating
on the selected layers at inference time, ETD models yield substantial gains on
17 reasoning benchmarks, including +28.4% relative accuracy improvement on
GSM8K and +36% on MATH with the OLMo-2 1B Base model. We also explore an
adaptive depth strategy that adjusts the computation per input token. Our
results show that recursive latent reasoning offers a simple and effective path
to stronger LLM reasoning.

*Yunbo Li,Jiaping Gui,Zhihang Deng,Fanchao Meng,Yue Wu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces FedQS, a framework that optimizes both gradient-based and model-based aggregation strategies in semi-asynchronous federated learning (SAFL), addressing trade-offs in convergence, accuracy, and stability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to mitigate the challenges in SAFL, where gradient aggregation and model aggregation each have distinct strengths and weaknesses, impacting convergence, accuracy, and stability.

Method: The authors propose FedQS, a divide-and-conquer framework that classifies clients into four types and adapts local training based on client data distribution and computational resources.

Result: FedQS achieves superior accuracy, lower loss, and faster convergence, outperforming state-of-the-art methods in experiments on computer vision, natural language processing, and real-world tasks.

Conclusion: FedQS bridges the gap between gradient and model aggregation strategies, offering a solution that is stable, accurate, and efficient for SAFL applications.

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) enables collaborative model training across multiple
parties without sharing raw data, with semi-asynchronous FL (SAFL) emerging as
a balanced approach between synchronous and asynchronous FL. However, SAFL
faces significant challenges in optimizing both gradient-based (e.g., FedSGD)
and model-based (e.g., FedAvg) aggregation strategies, which exhibit distinct
trade-offs in accuracy, convergence speed, and stability. While gradient
aggregation achieves faster convergence and higher accuracy, it suffers from
pronounced fluctuations, whereas model aggregation offers greater stability but
slower convergence and suboptimal accuracy. This paper presents FedQS, the
first framework to theoretically analyze and address these disparities in SAFL.
FedQS introduces a divide-and-conquer strategy to handle client heterogeneity
by classifying clients into four distinct types and adaptively optimizing their
local training based on data distribution characteristics and available
computational resources. Extensive experiments on computer vision, natural
language processing, and real-world tasks demonstrate that FedQS achieves the
highest accuracy, attains the lowest loss, and ranks among the fastest in
convergence speed, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines. Our work bridges
the gap between aggregation strategies in SAFL, offering a unified solution for
stable, accurate, and efficient federated learning. The code and datasets are

*Nathan Boyer,Dorian Baudry,Patrick Rebeschini*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper addresses linear contextual bandits with paid observations, introducing a Best-of-Both-Worlds algorithm achieving optimal performance in adversarial and (corrupted) stochastic regimes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to solve the problem of balancing performance in adversarial and stochastic environments for linear contextual bandits with the added complexity of paid observations.

Method: The approach uses the Follow-the-Regularized-Leader framework enhanced by Matrix Geometric Resampling, introducing a Best-of-Both-Worlds algorithm tailored with specific analysis techniques.

Result: The algorithm achieves minimax-optimal regret of $\Theta(T^{2/3})$ in adversarial cases and poly-logarithmic regret in corrupted stochastic scenarios.

Conclusion: The proposed algorithm effectively handles linear contextual bandits with paid observations, demonstrating efficiency and optimal performance in both adversarial and stochastic settings.

Abstract: We study the problem of linear contextual bandits with paid observations,
where at each round the learner selects an action in order to minimize its loss
in a given context, and can then decide to pay a fixed cost to observe the loss
of any arm. Building on the Follow-the-Regularized-Leader framework with
efficient estimators via Matrix Geometric Resampling, we introduce a
computationally efficient Best-of-Both-Worlds (BOBW) algorithm for this
problem. We show that it achieves the minimax-optimal regret of
$\Theta(T^{2/3})$ in adversarial settings, while guaranteeing poly-logarithmic
regret in (corrupted) stochastic regimes. Our approach builds on the framework
from \cite{BOBWhardproblems} to design BOBW algorithms for ``hard problem'',
using analysis techniques tailored for the setting that we consider.

### [289] [Learning to Route LLMs from Bandit Feedback: One Policy, Many Trade-offs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07429)
*Wang Wei,Tiankai Yang,Hongjie Chen,Yue Zhao,Franck Dernoncourt,Ryan A. Rossi,Hoda Eldardiry*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: BaRP introduces a bandit-feedback approach enabling adaptive routing of large language models (LLMs) based on query-specific preferences, improving cost-performance balance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Efficient model selection is crucial for large-scale LLM deployment, especially when balancing accuracy and cost under varying dynamic conditions.

Method: BaRP uses a contextual bandit model trained with partial feedback (similar to deployment constraints) and allows user tunable preferences for performance versus cost trade-offs.

Result: Experiments indicate BaRP outperforms offline routers by 12.46% and achieves better results than the largest LLM by 2.45%, showing robustness for unseen tasks.

Conclusion: BaRP effectively bridges the gap between offline training and online adaptive deployment, offering a scalable preference-tunable LLM routing solution.

Abstract: Efficient use of large language models (LLMs) is critical for deployment at
scale: without adaptive routing, systems either overpay for strong models or
risk poor performance from weaker ones. Selecting the right LLM for each query
is fundamentally an online decision problem: models differ in strengths, prices
fluctuate, and users value accuracy and cost differently. Yet most routers are
trained offline with labels for all candidate models, an assumption that breaks
in deployment, where only the outcome of the chosen model is observed. We
bridge this gap with BaRP, a Bandit-feedback Routing with Preferences approach
that trains under the same partial-feedback restriction as deployment, while
supporting preference-tunable inference: operators can dial the
performance/cost trade-off at test time without retraining. Framed as a
contextual bandit over prompt features and a user preference vector, our method
simulates an online feedback setting during training and adapts its routing
decisions to each new prompt, rather than depending on full-information offline
supervision. Comprehensive experiments show that our method consistently
outperforms strong offline routers by at least 12.46% and the largest LLM by at
least 2.45%, and generalizes robustly for unseen tasks.

*Murtaza Rangwala,Farag Azzedin,Richard O. Sinnott,Rajkumar Buyya*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SketchGuard is an efficient Byzantine-robust framework for decentralized federated learning, using sketch compression to reduce communication complexity and maintain resilience.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the limitations of existing defenses for decentralized federated learning, which have high communication and computational costs while being vulnerable to Byzantine attacks.

Method: Utilize sketch-based neighbor screening by compressing high-dimensional models into lower-dimensional sketches using Count Sketch, reducing communication overhead while decoupling Byzantine filtering and model aggregation.

Result: SketchGuard reduces computation time by up to 82% and communication overhead by 50-70%, while maintaining robustness against attacks as good as state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: Sketch-based compression is effective in enabling scalable and robust decentralized federated learning suitable for web-scale deployment.

Abstract: Decentralized Federated Learning (DFL) enables privacy-preserving
collaborative training without centralized servers, but remains vulnerable to
Byzantine attacks where malicious clients submit corrupted model updates.
Existing Byzantine-robust DFL defenses rely on similarity-based neighbor
screening that requires every client to exchange and compare complete
high-dimensional model vectors with all neighbors in each training round,
creating prohibitive communication and computational costs that prevent
deployment at web scale. We propose SketchGuard, a general framework that
decouples Byzantine filtering from model aggregation through sketch-based
neighbor screening. SketchGuard compresses $d$-dimensional models to
$k$-dimensional sketches ($k \ll d$) using Count Sketch for similarity
comparisons, then selectively fetches full models only from accepted neighbors,
reducing per-round communication complexity from $O(d|N_i|)$ to $O(k|N_i| +
d|S_i|)$, where $|N_i|$ is the neighbor count and $|S_i| \le |N_i|$ is the
accepted neighbor count. We establish rigorous convergence guarantees in both
strongly convex and non-convex settings, proving that Count Sketch compression
preserves Byzantine resilience with controlled degradation bounds where
approximation errors introduce only a $(1+O(\epsilon))$ factor in the effective
threshold parameter. Comprehensive experiments across multiple datasets,
network topologies, and attack scenarios demonstrate that SketchGuard maintains
identical robustness to state-of-the-art methods while reducing computation
time by up to 82% and communication overhead by 50-70% depending on filtering
effectiveness, with benefits scaling multiplicatively with model dimensionality
and network connectivity. These results establish the viability of sketch-based
compression as a fundamental enabler of robust DFL at web scale.

*Ankur Naskar,Gugan Thoppe,Utsav Negi,Vijay Gupta*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes a two-timescale Federated Temporal Difference (FTD) learning algorithm using Polyak-Ruppert averaging for reinforcement learning that achieves an optimal convergence rate of $\tilde{O}(1/NT)$ for Markovian data, in both average-reward and discounted settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current federated learning methods for reinforcement learning struggle to achieve optimal convergence rates without depending on unknown problem parameters when using samples from Markov chains.

Method: The authors designed a two-timescale Federated Temporal Difference (FTD) learning algorithm that incorporates Polyak-Ruppert averaging to remove dependence on unknown problem parameters.

Result: Their approach attains the optimal convergence rate $\tilde{O}(1/NT)$ for Markovian data in both average-reward and discounted scenarios, and it handles heterogeneous environments, making it applicable to more realistic settings.

Conclusion: This paper closes a gap in federated reinforcement learning by providing a parameter-free, scalable method that guarantees optimal convergence rates even in heterogeneous environments.

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) can dramatically speed up reinforcement learning by
distributing exploration and training across multiple agents. It can guarantee
an optimal convergence rate that scales linearly in the number of agents, i.e.,
a rate of $\tilde{O}(1/(NT)),$ where $T$ is the iteration index and $N$ is the
number of agents. However, when the training samples arise from a Markov chain,
existing results on TD learning achieving this rate require the algorithm to
depend on unknown problem parameters. We close this gap by proposing a
two-timescale Federated Temporal Difference (FTD) learning with Polyak-Ruppert
averaging. Our method provably attains the optimal $\tilde{O}(1/NT)$ rate in
both average-reward and discounted settings--offering a parameter-free FTD
approach for Markovian data. Although our results are novel even in the
single-agent setting, they apply to the more realistic and challenging scenario
of FL with heterogeneous environments.

*Gunjun Lee,Jiwon Kim,Jaiyoung Park,Younjoo Lee,Jung Ho Ahn*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes 'layered prefill,' a scheduling approach to reduce inefficiencies in serving Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) large language models (LLMs) in production environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address inefficiencies in MoE model serving caused by chunked prefill scheduling, which increases memory traffic and energy consumption.

Method: Introduce 'layered prefill,' which partitions transformer layers vertically into groups and alternates processing prefill and decoding across these groups.

Result: Layered prefill improves TTFT by up to 70%, End-to-End latency by 41%, and reduces energy consumption per token by up to 22%.

Conclusion: Shifting the scheduling unit from tokens to layers enables a more efficient, energy-aware operating model for LLM serving.

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) inference in production must meet stringent
service-level objectives for both time-to-first-token (TTFT) and
time-between-token (TBT) while maximizing throughput under fixed compute,
memory, and interconnect budgets. Modern serving systems adopt stall-free
scheduling techniques such as chunked prefill, which splits long prompt
processing along the token dimension and interleaves prefill with ongoing
decode iterations. While effective at stabilizing TBT, chunked prefill incurs
substantial overhead in Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models: redundant expert
weight loads increase memory traffic by up to 39% and inflate energy
consumption. We propose layered prefill, a new scheduling paradigm that treats
transformer layer groups as the primary scheduling unit. By vertically
partitioning the model into contiguous layer groups and interleaving prefill
and decode across the groups, layered prefill sustains stall-free decoding
while eliminating chunk-induced MoE weight reloads. It reduces off-chip
bandwidth demand, lowering TTFT by up to 70%, End-to-End latency by 41% and
per-token energy by up to 22%. Evaluations show that layered prefill
consistently improves the TTFT--TBT Pareto frontier over chunked prefill,
reducing expert-load traffic and energy cost while maintaining stall-free
decoding. Overall, shifting the scheduling axis from tokens to layers unlocks a
new operating regime for high-efficiency, energy-aware LLM serving in
co-located environments.

TL;DR: The paper presents Mixture-of-Gaussians with Uncertainty-based Gating (MoGU), an advanced framework for regression tasks in time series forecasting, which includes uncertainty estimation for enhanced prediction reliability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to improve time series forecasting through a model that not only predicts values but also quantifies uncertainties, addressing limitations of traditional Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) setups.

Method: The MoGU framework models predictions as Gaussian distributions and uses an uncertainty-based gating mechanism, replacing traditional input-based approaches, to allocate expert contributions based on variance.

Result: MoGU demonstrates superior performance against single-expert and traditional MoE models across benchmarks, offering reliable predictions with uncertainties correlated to errors.

Conclusion: With its innovative approach to uncertainty estimation, MoGU enhances forecasting accuracy and reliability, representing a significant step forward in the Mixture-of-Experts domain.

Abstract: We introduce Mixture-of-Gaussians with Uncertainty-based Gating (MoGU), a
novel Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) framework designed for regression tasks and
applied to time series forecasting. Unlike conventional MoEs that provide only
point estimates, MoGU models each expert's output as a Gaussian distribution.
This allows it to directly quantify both the forecast (the mean) and its
inherent uncertainty (variance). MoGU's core innovation is its
uncertainty-based gating mechanism, which replaces the traditional input-based
gating network by using each expert's estimated variance to determine its
contribution to the final prediction. Evaluated across diverse time series
forecasting benchmarks, MoGU consistently outperforms single-expert models and
traditional MoE setups. It also provides well-quantified, informative
uncertainties that directly correlate with prediction errors, enhancing
forecast reliability. Our code is available from:

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces 'metabeta,' a transformer-based model for rapid Bayesian mixed-effects regression.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Mixed-effects regression is commonly used in science but faces computational challenges due to the reliance on MCMC methods.

Method: The authors developed a transformer-based neural network model called metabeta, utilizing amortized inference through pre-training on simulated datasets with known ground truth.

Result: Metabeta achieves comparable performance to traditional MCMC methods but operates much faster.

Conclusion: The proposed metabeta model provides an efficient alternative to MCMC methods for Bayesian mixed-effects regression, reducing computational time without compromising reliability.

Abstract: Hierarchical data with multiple observations per group is ubiquitous in
empirical sciences and is often analyzed using mixed-effects regression. In
such models, Bayesian inference gives an estimate of uncertainty but is
analytically intractable and requires costly approximation using Markov Chain
Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods. Neural posterior estimation shifts the bulk of
computation from inference time to pre-training time, amortizing over simulated
datasets with known ground truth targets. We propose metabeta, a
transformer-based neural network model for Bayesian mixed-effects regression.
Using simulated and real data, we show that it reaches stable and comparable
performance to MCMC-based parameter estimation at a fraction of the usually
required time.

*Shaan Pakala,Aldair E. Gongora,Brian Giera,Evangelos E. Papalexakis*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes tensor completion as a surrogate model for designing optimal lattice structures with mechanical performance, addressing limitations in machine learning under non-uniform sampling scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional material design faces challenges due to the exponentially growing search space when adding design variables, making the synthesis and validation of material properties impractical. Machine learning, while useful, struggles with biased, non-uniformly sampled data in these scenarios.

Method: The authors leveraged tensor completion techniques as a surrogate model to address biased sampling issues in material design. They compared this method with classic machine learning approaches like Gaussian Process and XGBoost through experiments.

Result: Tensor completion outperformed Gaussian Process and XGBoost under biased sampling scenarios with a 5% increase in $R^2$, and showed comparable performance to ML methods when sampling was uniformly random.

Conclusion: Tensor completion is presented as a promising method to accelerate material design, especially in biased sampling conditions, overcoming deficiencies of standard machine learning techniques in such scenarios.

Abstract: When designing new materials, it is often necessary to design a material with
specific desired properties. Unfortunately, as new design variables are added,
the search space grows exponentially, which makes synthesizing and validating
the properties of each material very impractical and time-consuming. In this
work, we focus on the design of optimal lattice structures with regard to
mechanical performance. Computational approaches, including the use of machine
learning (ML) methods, have shown improved success in accelerating materials
design. However, these ML methods are still lacking in scenarios when training
data (i.e. experimentally validated materials) come from a non-uniformly random
sampling across the design space. For example, an experimentalist might
synthesize and validate certain materials more frequently because of
convenience. For this reason, we suggest the use of tensor completion as a
surrogate model to accelerate the design of materials in these atypical
supervised learning scenarios. In our experiments, we show that tensor
completion is superior to classic ML methods such as Gaussian Process and
XGBoost with biased sampling of the search space, with around 5\% increased
$R^2$. Furthermore, tensor completion still gives comparable performance with a
uniformly random sampling of the entire search space.

Motivation: Lung cancer is a leading cause of deaths, and genetic factors play a non-negligible role. Existing genome-wide association studies require better methodologies to harness genetic data effectively for risk prediction.

Method: HEMERA uses deep learning with transformer models on genome-wide association study data, incorporating neural genotype embeddings, additive positional encodings, and SNP filtering. The predictions are made explainable with Layer-wise Integrated Gradients.

Result: The model was trained on data from 27,254 participants and achieved an AUC score of over 99%, indicating highly accurate lung cancer risk predictions.

Conclusion: The transparent and explainable nature of HEMERA demonstrates its potential as a predictive tool for personalized lung cancer risk assessment and preventive strategies.

Abstract: Lung cancer (LC) is the third most common cancer and the leading cause of
cancer deaths in the US. Although smoking is the primary risk factor, the
occurrence of LC in never-smokers and familial aggregation studies highlight a
genetic component. Genetic biomarkers identified through genome-wide
association studies (GWAS) are promising tools for assessing LC risk. We
introduce HEMERA (Human-Explainable Transformer Model for Estimating Lung
Cancer Risk using GWAS Data), a new framework that applies explainable
transformer-based deep learning to GWAS data of single nucleotide polymorphisms
(SNPs) for predicting LC risk. Unlike prior approaches, HEMERA directly
processes raw genotype data without clinical covariates, introducing additive
positional encodings, neural genotype embeddings, and refined variant
filtering. A post hoc explainability module based on Layer-wise Integrated
Gradients enables attribution of model predictions to specific SNPs, aligning
strongly with known LC risk loci. Trained on data from 27,254 Million Veteran
Program participants, HEMERA achieved >99% AUC (area under receiver
characteristics) score. These findings support transparent,
hypothesis-generating models for personalized LC risk assessment and early
intervention.

*Yuanjun Dai,Keqiang He,An Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces DYNAMIX, a reinforcement learning framework to optimize batch sizes in distributed machine learning environments, achieving increased model accuracy and reduced training times.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for batch size selection in distributed machine learning are insufficient as they use static or overly simplistic heuristics that don't adapt well to complex, dynamic environments.

Method: The paper employs Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) within a reinforcement learning framework, using a comprehensive state representation that includes metrics like network conditions, resource use, and training efficiency. This eliminates the need for explicit modeling and works with existing frameworks.

Result: DYNAMIX improves final model accuracy by up to 6.3% and reduces total training time by 46%. It scales effectively to larger clusters of up to 32 nodes and generalizes well to related model architectures.

Conclusion: DYNAMIX proves to be a robust and adaptable approach for optimizing batch sizes in distributed environments, offering significant performance advantages in accuracy, training time, scalability, and generalizability.

Abstract: Existing batch size selection approaches in distributed machine learning rely
on static allocation or simplistic heuristics that fail to adapt to
heterogeneous, dynamic computing environments. We present DYNAMIX, a
reinforcement learning framework that formulates batch size optimization as a
sequential decision-making problem using Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO).
Our approach employs a multi-dimensional state representation encompassing
network-level metrics, system-level resource utilization, and training
statistical efficiency indicators to enable informed decision-making across
diverse computational resources. Our approach eliminates the need for explicit
system modeling while integrating seamlessly with existing distributed training
frameworks. Through evaluations across diverse workloads, hardware
configurations, and network conditions, DYNAMIX achieves up to 6.3% improvement
in the final model accuracy and 46% reduction in the total training time. Our
scalability experiments demonstrate that DYNAMIX maintains the best performance
as cluster size increases to 32 nodes, while policy transfer experiments show
that learned policies generalize effectively across related model
architectures.

*Waleed Bin Qaim,Aleksandr Ometov,Claudia Campolo,Antonella Molinaro,Elena Simona Lohan,Jari Nurmi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper presents an RL-based framework for task offloading in IoWT to optimize energy consumption and task accomplishment time.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Wearable devices face challenges due to limited battery power and computation resources, necessitating innovative solutions for efficient task offloading.

Method: The paper formulates task offloading as an MDP, utilizes Q-learning to find optimal decisions, and evaluates the framework through simulations using ns-3.

Result: The study demonstrates impactful performance improvements in average task completion time, energy consumption, and the percentage of tasks offloaded by tuning Q-learning parameters.

Conclusion: The Q-learning-based task offloading framework enables wearables to achieve efficient resource utilization and improved user experience without prior system knowledge.

Abstract: Over the years, significant contributions have been made by the research and
industrial sectors to improve wearable devices towards the Internet of Wearable
Things (IoWT) paradigm. However, wearables are still facing several challenges.
Many stem from the limited battery power and insufficient computation resources
available on wearable devices. On the other hand, with the popularity of smart
wearables, there is a consistent increase in the development of new
computationally intensive and latency-critical applications. In such a context,
task offloading allows wearables to leverage the resources available on nearby
edge devices to enhance the overall user experience. This paper proposes a
framework for Reinforcement Learning (RL)-based task offloading in the IoWT. We
formulate the task offloading process considering the tradeoff between energy
consumption and task accomplishment time. Moreover, we model the task
offloading problem as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) and utilize the
Q-learning technique to enable the wearable device to make optimal task
offloading decisions without prior knowledge. We evaluate the performance of
the proposed framework through extensive simulations for various applications
and system configurations conducted in the ns-3 network simulator. We also show
how varying the main system parameters of the Q-learning algorithm affects the
overall performance in terms of average task accomplishment time, average
energy consumption, and percentage of tasks offloaded.

*Shuangyi Chen,Ashish Khisti*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces SurpMark, a detector for identifying machine-generated text based on token surprisals, which performs well under practical constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to develop an effective method for detecting machine-generated text when the scoring model may mismatch the source model and when contrastive generation is computationally expensive.

Method: SurpMark summarizes text by analyzing token surprisals, quantizes them into states, and uses a generalized Jensen-Shannon gap for scoring, relying on historical corpora for references.

Result: SurpMark matches or surpasses existing baselines across datasets and scenarios, and its statistical properties and discretization method are empirically validated.

Conclusion: SurpMark is a robust and efficient tool for black-box detection of machine-generated text, even under challenging constraints.

Abstract: We study black-box detection of machine-generated text under practical
constraints: the scoring model (proxy LM) may mismatch the unknown source
model, and per-input contrastive generation is costly. We propose SurpMark, a
reference-based detector that summarizes a passage by the dynamics of its token
surprisals. SurpMark quantizes surprisals into interpretable states, estimates
a state-transition matrix for the test text, and scores it via a generalized
Jensen-Shannon (GJS) gap between the test transitions and two fixed references
(human vs. machine) built once from historical corpora. We prove a principled
discretization criterion and establish the asymptotic normality of the decision
statistic. Empirically, across multiple datasets, source models, and scenarios,
SurpMark consistently matches or surpasses baselines; our experiments
corroborate the statistic's asymptotic normality, and ablations validate the
effectiveness of the proposed discretization.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces PEAR, a benchmark to evaluate the utility and vulnerabilities of planner-executor MAS, focusing on attacks and system weaknesses.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address gaps in understanding adversarial vulnerabilities of LLM-based Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) and provide a systematic evaluation framework.

Method: Develop and utilize the PEAR benchmark to assess the performance and robustness of planner-executor MAS under various conditions and attacks.

Result: Key findings include: (1) weak planners harm task performance more than weak executors, (2) memory modules are critical for planners yet less impactful for executors, (3) there's a trade-off between task performance and robustness, and (4) attacks on planners are especially effective.

Conclusion: PEAR offers actionable insights for improving MAS robustness and provides a foundation for designing defense mechanisms in multi-agent settings.

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM)-based Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) have emerged as a
powerful paradigm for tackling complex, multi-step tasks across diverse
domains. However, despite their impressive capabilities, MAS remain susceptible
to adversarial manipulation. Existing studies typically examine isolated attack
surfaces or specific scenarios, leaving a lack of holistic understanding of MAS
vulnerabilities. To bridge this gap, we introduce PEAR, a benchmark for
systematically evaluating both the utility and vulnerability of
planner-executor MAS. While compatible with various MAS architectures, our
benchmark focuses on the planner-executor structure, which is a practical and
widely adopted design. Through extensive experiments, we find that (1) a weak
planner degrades overall clean task performance more severely than a weak
executor; (2) while a memory module is essential for the planner, having a
memory module for the executor does not impact the clean task performance; (3)
there exists a trade-off between task performance and robustness; and (4)
attacks targeting the planner are particularly effective at misleading the
system. These findings offer actionable insights for enhancing the robustness
of MAS and lay the groundwork for principled defenses in multi-agent settings.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a multimodal co-training framework to improve generalization in limited labeled data and distribution shift scenarios, with a focus on leveraging unlabeled data and classifier agreement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need to improve AI model generalization and robustness in real-world scenarios with limited labeled data and distribution shifts.

Method: Developing a multimodal co-training framework that utilizes unlabeled data, enforces inter-view classifier agreement, and maintains conditional view independence.

Result: The framework theoretically and empirically improves generalization, reduces errors through iterative co-training, and provides a novel generalization bound for multimodal setups.

Conclusion: Multimodal co-training is a promising, data-efficient approach for building robust AI systems capable of addressing real-world distributional and data challenges.

Abstract: This paper explores a multimodal co-training framework designed to enhance
model generalization in situations where labeled data is limited and
distribution shifts occur. We thoroughly examine the theoretical foundations of
this framework, deriving conditions under which the use of unlabeled data and
the promotion of agreement between classifiers for different modalities lead to
significant improvements in generalization. We also present a convergence
analysis that confirms the effectiveness of iterative co-training in reducing
classification errors. In addition, we establish a novel generalization bound
that, for the first time in a multimodal co-training context, decomposes and
quantifies the distinct advantages gained from leveraging unlabeled multimodal
data, promoting inter-view agreement, and maintaining conditional view
independence. Our findings highlight the practical benefits of multimodal
co-training as a structured approach to developing data-efficient and robust AI
systems that can effectively generalize in dynamic, real-world environments.
The theoretical foundations are examined in dialogue with, and in advance of,
established co-training principles.

*Qinghua Liu,Sam Heshmati,Zheda Mai,Zubin Abraham,John Paparrizos,Liu Ren*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces MLLM4TS, a framework using multimodal large language models for time-series analysis by integrating visual representations to enhance generalization and performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to overcome the challenges of analyzing time-series data, particularly the complex temporal dependencies and cross-channel interactions, by leveraging the visual inspection approach that human analysts typically use.

Method: The method involves creating MLLM4TS, which integrates a vision branch into multimodal large language models. Time-series data is visually represented as horizontally stacked color-coded line plots, and a temporal-aware patch alignment strategy aligns these visual patches with time segments for analysis.

Result: Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate MLLM4TS's success across predictive tasks like classification and generative tasks such as anomaly detection and forecasting.

Conclusion: Integrating visual modalities with pretrained language models shows robust and generalizable performance for time-series analysis, proving the potential of the proposed MLLM4TS framework.

Abstract: Effective analysis of time series data presents significant challenges due to
the complex temporal dependencies and cross-channel interactions in
multivariate data. Inspired by the way human analysts visually inspect time
series to uncover hidden patterns, we ask: can incorporating visual
representations enhance automated time-series analysis? Recent advances in
multimodal large language models have demonstrated impressive generalization
and visual understanding capability, yet their application to time series
remains constrained by the modality gap between continuous numerical data and
discrete natural language. To bridge this gap, we introduce MLLM4TS, a novel
framework that leverages multimodal large language models for general
time-series analysis by integrating a dedicated vision branch. Each time-series
channel is rendered as a horizontally stacked color-coded line plot in one
composite image to capture spatial dependencies across channels, and a
temporal-aware visual patch alignment strategy then aligns visual patches with
their corresponding time segments. MLLM4TS fuses fine-grained temporal details
from the numerical data with global contextual information derived from the
visual representation, providing a unified foundation for multimodal
time-series analysis. Extensive experiments on standard benchmarks demonstrate
the effectiveness of MLLM4TS across both predictive tasks (e.g.,
classification) and generative tasks (e.g., anomaly detection and forecasting).
These results underscore the potential of integrating visual modalities with
pretrained language models to achieve robust and generalizable time-series
analysis.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a novel wavelet transform-based approach for automated sleep stage scoring, achieving 88.37% accuracy and showcasing its clinical relevance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate sleep stage classification is essential for diagnosing and managing sleep disorders, and existing manual or feature-based methods may lack efficiency or precision.

Method: The study utilizes continuous wavelet transform (CWT) to generate time-frequency maps and combines this representation with ensemble learning techniques for sleep stage classification.

Result: The proposed method achieves an 88.37% overall accuracy and a macro-averaged F1 score of 73.15, outperforming traditional machine learning methods and matching or surpassing deep learning approaches.

Conclusion: Wavelet-based analysis demonstrates robust, interpretable, and clinically viable performance in sleep stage classification, highlighting its potential for clinical applications.

Abstract: Accurate classification of sleep stages is crucial for the diagnosis and
management of sleep disorders. Conventional approaches for sleep scoring rely
on manual annotation or features extracted from EEG signals in the time or
frequency domain. This study proposes a novel framework for automated sleep
stage scoring using time-frequency analysis based on the wavelet transform. The
Sleep-EDF Expanded Database (sleep-cassette recordings) was used for
evaluation. The continuous wavelet transform (CWT) generated time-frequency
maps that capture both transient and oscillatory patterns across frequency
bands relevant to sleep staging. Experimental results demonstrate that the
proposed wavelet-based representation, combined with ensemble learning,
achieves an overall accuracy of 88.37 percent and a macro-averaged F1 score of
73.15, outperforming conventional machine learning methods and exhibiting
comparable or superior performance to recent deep learning approaches. These
findings highlight the potential of wavelet analysis for robust, interpretable,
and clinically applicable sleep stage classification.

### [304] [Estimating Fair Graphs from Graph-Stationary Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07536)
*Madeline Navarro,Andrei Buciulea,Samuel Rey,Antonio G. Marques,Santiago Segarra*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes methods to estimate fair graphs from graph-stationary signals, addressing biases in connections relative to sensitive attributes. It introduces fairness metrics and optimization techniques under group and individual fairness frameworks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world graphs often have biased connections towards certain groups, potentially leading to unfairness in downstream tasks. There is a need to address these biases in graph estimation to ensure equitable treatment.

Method: The authors introduced an optimization-based approach called Fair Spectral Templates (FairSpecTemp) with two variants. One variant directly constrains bias using graph stationarity properties, while the other focuses on bias restriction in the graph spectrum for flexible fairness adjustments.

Result: FairSpecTemp demonstrates its effectiveness on both synthetic and real-world datasets, showcasing high probability performance bounds and achieving fairness without compromising accuracy.

Conclusion: Recovering fair graphs is achievable without necessarily sacrificing accuracy. Both FairSpecTemp variants show promise in addressing fairness concerns in graph estimation.

Abstract: We estimate fair graphs from graph-stationary nodal observations such that
connections are not biased with respect to sensitive attributes. Edges in
real-world graphs often exhibit preferences for connecting certain pairs of
groups. Biased connections can not only exacerbate but even induce unfair
treatment for downstream graph-based tasks. We therefore consider group and
individual fairness for graphs corresponding to group- and node-level
definitions, respectively. To evaluate the fairness of a given graph, we
provide multiple bias metrics, including novel measurements in the spectral
domain. Furthermore, we propose Fair Spectral Templates (FairSpecTemp), an
optimization-based method with two variants for estimating fair graphs from
stationary graph signals, a general model for graph data subsuming many
existing ones. One variant of FairSpecTemp exploits commutativity properties of
graph stationarity while directly constraining bias, while the other implicitly
encourages fair estimates by restricting bias in the graph spectrum and is thus
more flexible. Our methods enjoy high probability performance bounds, yielding
a conditional tradeoff between fairness and accuracy. In particular, our
analysis reveals that accuracy need not be sacrificed to recover fair graphs.
We evaluate FairSpecTemp on synthetic and real-world data sets to illustrate
its effectiveness and highlight the advantages of both variants of
FairSpecTemp.

*Qifan Chen,Zhongshu Xu,Jinjin Zhang,Dongbin Xiu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces a numerical method to create a targeted digital twin (tDT), which models key dynamics efficiently without simulating the entire system.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to improve the efficiency of simulating key quantities of interest (QoIs) in complex systems without relying on full system simulations.

Method: They use memory-based flow map learning (FML) to train the tDT model offline based on trajectory data generated by the full digital twin (DT).

Result: The resulting tDTs accurately predict long-term dynamics of QoIs, such as hydrodynamic forces in fluid dynamics problems, while avoiding the full flow simulations.

Conclusion: The proposed tDT framework offers substantial computational savings and accurate predictions, showcasing its utility in scenarios like computational fluid dynamics (CFD).

Abstract: We present a numerical framework for constructing a targeted digital twin
(tDT) that directly models the dynamics of quantities of interest (QoIs) in a
full digital twin (DT). The proposed approach employs memory-based flow map
learning (FML) to develop a data-driven model of the QoIs using short bursts of
trajectory data generated through repeated executions of the full DT. This
renders the construction of the FML-based tDT an entirely offline computational
process. During online simulation, the learned tDT can efficiently predict and
analyze the long-term dynamics of the QoIs without requiring simulations of the
full DT system, thereby achieving substantial computational savings. After
introducing the general numerical procedure, we demonstrate the construction
and predictive capability of the tDT in a computational fluid dynamics (CFD)
example: two-dimensional incompressible flow past a cylinder. The QoIs in this
problem are the hydrodynamic forces exerted on the cylinder. The resulting tDTs
are compact dynamical systems that evolve these forces without explicit
knowledge of the underlying flow field. Numerical results show that the tDTs
yield accurate long-term predictions of the forces while entirely bypassing
full flow simulations.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper offers improvements to PAC-Bayes risk certificates for neural networks, proposing new bounds, optimization methodologies, and empirical validation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance the effectiveness and applicability of PAC-Bayes bounds for assessing the true risk in neural networks.

Method: Introduces new KL divergence bounds, an implicit differentiation framework for PAC-Bayesian optimization, and a technique to handle non-differentiable objectives.

Result: Achieved non-vacuous generalization bounds on CIFAR-10, alongside validations on MNIST.

Conclusion: The contributions improve PAC-Bayes usability, showing theoretical and empirical advances for neural networks.

Abstract: This paper presents four theoretical contributions that improve the usability
of risk certificates for neural networks based on PAC-Bayes bounds. First, two
bounds on the KL divergence between Bernoulli distributions enable the
derivation of the tightest explicit bounds on the true risk of classifiers
across different ranges of empirical risk. The paper next focuses on the
formalization of an efficient methodology based on implicit differentiation
that enables the introduction of the optimization of PAC-Bayesian risk
certificates inside the loss/objective function used to fit the network/model.
The last contribution is a method to optimize bounds on non-differentiable
objectives such as the 0-1 loss. These theoretical contributions are
complemented with an empirical evaluation on the MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets.
In fact, this paper presents the first non-vacuous generalization bounds on
CIFAR-10 for neural networks.

*Lénaïc Chizat,Pierre Marion,Yerkin Yesbay*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper investigates the role of dropout in large neural networks by analyzing the asymptotic behavior of gradient descent with dropout on two-layer networks, presenting a complex phase diagram with five distinct phases.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Dropout is widely used to improve the training performance of neural networks, but its role in large neural networks is not fully understood, prompting the need for theoretical exploration.

Method: The study analyzes the large-width asymptotics of gradient descent with dropout using two-layer networks and mathematical tools from mean-field particle systems and stochastic processes.

Result: The researchers identified five distinct asymptotic phases influenced by dropout rate, learning rate, and network width. Dropout exhibits different behaviors depending on the learning rate, ranging from a penalty effect for extremely small rates to being equivalent to a random geometry technique for larger rates.

Conclusion: The findings provide a new theoretical framework to understand dropout in large-scale neural networks and highlight how its effects are governed by different scaling regimes.

Abstract: Dropout is a standard training technique for neural networks that consists of
randomly deactivating units at each step of their gradient-based training. It
is known to improve performance in many settings, including in the large-scale
training of language or vision models. As a first step towards understanding
the role of dropout in large neural networks, we study the large-width
asymptotics of gradient descent with dropout on two-layer neural networks with
the mean-field initialization scale. We obtain a rich asymptotic phase diagram
that exhibits five distinct nondegenerate phases depending on the relative
magnitudes of the dropout rate, the learning rate, and the width. Notably, we
find that the well-studied "penalty" effect of dropout only persists in the
limit with impractically small learning rates of order $O(1/\text{width})$. For
larger learning rates, this effect disappears and in the limit, dropout is
equivalent to a "random geometry" technique, where the gradients are thinned
randomly after the forward and backward pass have been computed. In this
asymptotic regime, the limit is described by a mean-field jump process where
the neurons' update times follow independent Poisson or Bernoulli clocks
(depending on whether the learning rate vanishes or not). For some of the
phases, we obtain a description of the limit dynamics both in path-space and in
distribution-space. The convergence proofs involve a mix of tools from
mean-field particle systems and stochastic processes. Together, our results lay
the groundwork for a renewed theoretical understanding of dropout in
large-scale neural networks.

Method: Implemented robust preprocessing for multilingual data, applied BERTopic for topic extraction, and visualized relationships using various techniques like topic maps and model alignment matrices.

Result: 29 coherent topics were extracted, and trends in model-topic alignment were identified, offering insights into preferences and patterns.

Conclusion: The findings provide valuable insights for fine-tuning LLMs for domain-specific performance optimization, enhancing user satisfaction and real-world applicability.

Abstract: This study applies BERTopic, a transformer-based topic modeling technique, to
the lmsys-chat-1m dataset, a multilingual conversational corpus built from
head-to-head evaluations of large language models (LLMs). Each user prompt is
paired with two anonymized LLM responses and a human preference label, used to
assess user evaluation of competing model outputs. The main objective is
uncovering thematic patterns in these conversations and examining their
relation to user preferences, particularly if certain LLMs are consistently
preferred within specific topics. A robust preprocessing pipeline was designed
for multilingual variation, balancing dialogue turns, and cleaning noisy or
redacted data. BERTopic extracted over 29 coherent topics including artificial
intelligence, programming, ethics, and cloud infrastructure. We analysed
relationships between topics and model preferences to identify trends in
model-topic alignment. Visualization techniques included inter-topic distance
maps, topic probability distributions, and model-versus-topic matrices. Our
findings inform domain-specific fine-tuning and optimization strategies for
improving real-world LLM performance and user satisfaction.

TL;DR: The paper addresses counterfactual identification for multivariate outcomes using continuous-time flows, offering a framework for consistent inference and improving causal soundness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To resolve the issue of counterfactual identification for high-dimensional multivariate outcomes from observational data ensuring valid causal claims.

Method: The authors utilize dynamic optimal transport and continuous-time flows to develop conditions that ensure unique, monotone, and rank-preserving counterfactual maps, including non-Markovian settings.

Result: Demonstrations in scenarios with ground-truth counterfactuals suggest improvements in causal validity and counterfactual soundness when applied to real-world data.

Conclusion: The proposed framework establishes a reliable method for counterfactual inference, addressing the previous gap in valid counterfactual identification.

Abstract: We address the open question of counterfactual identification for
high-dimensional multivariate outcomes from observational data. Pearl (2000)
argues that counterfactuals must be identifiable (i.e., recoverable from the
observed data distribution) to justify causal claims. A recent line of work on
counterfactual inference shows promising results but lacks identification,
undermining the causal validity of its estimates. To address this, we establish
a foundation for multivariate counterfactual identification using
continuous-time flows, including non-Markovian settings under standard
criteria. We characterise the conditions under which flow matching yields a
unique, monotone and rank-preserving counterfactual transport map with tools
from dynamic optimal transport, ensuring consistent inference. Building on
this, we validate the theory in controlled scenarios with counterfactual
ground-truth and demonstrate improvements in axiomatic counterfactual soundness
on real images.

Motivation: To address the challenge of selecting appropriate machine learning pipelines for unsupervised tasks without labeled data, by identifying dataset similarities based on underlying data distributions.

Method: LOTUS employs Optimal Transport distances to measure similarities between different tabular datasets and uses these similarities to select suitable machine learning pipelines for unsupervised tasks.

Result: The experiments demonstrate LOTUS's effectiveness against robust baseline methods, establishing it as a promising approach for model selection in unsupervised learning scenarios.

Conclusion: LOTUS provides a unified strategy to recommend machine learning pipelines for various unsupervised tasks, paving the way for further advancements in model selection for such scenarios.

Abstract: In this work, we present LOTUS (Learning to Learn with Optimal Transport for
Unsupervised Scenarios), a simple yet effective method to perform model
selection for multiple unsupervised machine learning(ML) tasks such as outlier
detection and clustering. Our intuition behind this work is that a machine
learning pipeline will perform well in a new dataset if it previously worked
well on datasets with a similar underlying data distribution. We use Optimal
Transport distances to find this similarity between unlabeled tabular datasets
and recommend machine learning pipelines with one unified single method on two
downstream unsupervised tasks: outlier detection and clustering. We present the
effectiveness of our approach with experiments against strong baselines and
show that LOTUS is a very promising first step toward model selection for
multiple unsupervised ML tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To characterize and examine learnability in finite label multiclass problems under forgiving 0-1 loss functions.

Method: Introduced the Generalized Natarajan Dimension as a new combinatorial metric and linked it with hypothesis class learnability.

Result: Showed that the learnability of problems is determined when the Generalized Natarajan Dimension is finite and connected this to set-valued feedback learning.

Conclusion: The learnability of set learning problems aligns with the Natarajan Dimension, offering a characterization of learnability.

Abstract: In this paper we will give a characterization of the learnability of
forgiving 0-1 loss functions in the finite label multiclass setting. To do
this, we create a new combinatorial dimension that is based off of the
Natarajan Dimension \citep{natarajan1989learning} and we show that a hypothesis
class is learnable in our setting if and only if this Generalized Natarajan
Dimension is finite. We also show a connection to learning with set-valued
feedback. Through our results we show that the learnability of a set learning
problem is characterized by the Natarajan Dimension.

### [313] [Symbolic-Diffusion: Deep Learning Based Symbolic Regression with D3PM Discrete Token Diffusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07570)
*Ryan T. Tymkow,Benjamin D. Schnapp,Mojtaba Valipour,Ali Ghodshi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper presents Symbolic Diffusion, a novel diffusion model for symbolic regression that generates all equation tokens simultaneously, outperforming traditional autoregressive approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address limitations of autoregressive models in neural-network-based symbolic regression, such as their sequential token generation, by proposing an approach that can generate all tokens at once.

Method: They introduce Symbolic Diffusion, a diffusion-based discrete state-space model for symbolic regression, which generates mathematical equations simultaneously using discrete token diffusion.

Result: Symbolic Diffusion is compared to SymbolicGPT in experiments using similar architectures and demonstrates comparable or better performance in symbolic regression tasks.

Conclusion: This diffusion-based method opens new avenues for research in neural-network symbolic regression by overcoming autoregressive model limitations and offering competitive performance.

Abstract: Symbolic regression refers to the task of finding a closed-form mathematical
expression to fit a set of data points. Genetic programming based techniques
are the most common algorithms used to tackle this problem, but recently,
neural-network based approaches have gained popularity. Most of the leading
neural-network based models used for symbolic regression utilize
transformer-based autoregressive models to generate an equation conditioned on
encoded input points. However, autoregressive generation is limited to
generating tokens left-to-right, and future generated tokens are conditioned
only on previously generated tokens. Motivated by the desire to generate all
tokens simultaneously to produce improved closed-form equations, we propose
Symbolic Diffusion, a D3PM based discrete state-space diffusion model which
simultaneously generates all tokens of the equation at once using discrete
token diffusion. Using the bivariate dataset developed for SymbolicGPT, we
compared our diffusion-based generation approach to an autoregressive model
based on SymbolicGPT, using equivalent encoder and transformer architectures.
We demonstrate that our novel approach of using diffusion-based generation for
symbolic regression can offer comparable and, by some metrics, improved
performance over autoregressive generation in models using similar underlying
architectures, opening new research opportunities in neural-network based
symbolic regression.

*Stella C. Dong,James R. Finlay*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ClauseLens is a framework for reinsurance treaty pricing based on reinforcement learning. It increases transparency, ensures compliance, and improves risk management outcomes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the opacity and auditing difficulties in current reinsurance treaty quoting practices while meeting stringent regulatory requirements.

Method: The authors developed ClauseLens, a framework modeling quoting as a Risk-Aware Constrained Markov Decision Process (RA-CMDP). It includes clause-grounded natural language justifications and embeds statutory clauses into the model's observations for generating compliant decisions.

Result: ClauseLens showed a 51% reduction in solvency violations, a 27.9% improvement in tail-risk performance (CVaR_0.10), and delivered clause-grounded explanations with 88.2% accuracy, along with high retrieval precision and recall rates.

Conclusion: Integrating legal context into decision-making and explanation processes leads to interpretable, auditable, and regulation-compliant behaviors, aligning with Solvency II, NAIC RBC, and the EU AI Act guidelines.

Abstract: Reinsurance treaty pricing must satisfy stringent regulatory standards, yet
current quoting practices remain opaque and difficult to audit. We introduce
ClauseLens, a clause-grounded reinforcement learning framework that produces
transparent, regulation-compliant, and risk-aware treaty quotes.
  ClauseLens models the quoting task as a Risk-Aware Constrained Markov
Decision Process (RA-CMDP). Statutory and policy clauses are retrieved from
legal and underwriting corpora, embedded into the agent's observations, and
used both to constrain feasible actions and to generate clause-grounded natural
language justifications.
  Evaluated in a multi-agent treaty simulator calibrated to industry data,
ClauseLens reduces solvency violations by 51%, improves tail-risk performance
by 27.9% (CVaR_0.10), and achieves 88.2% accuracy in clause-grounded
explanations with retrieval precision of 87.4% and recall of 91.1%.
  These findings demonstrate that embedding legal context into both decision
and explanation pathways yields interpretable, auditable, and
regulation-aligned quoting behavior consistent with Solvency II, NAIC RBC, and
the EU AI Act.

TL;DR: The paper compares liquid neural networks (LNNs) with traditional recurrent neural networks (RNNs), including LSTMs and GRUs, focusing on accuracy, memory efficiency, and generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate the advantages, shortcomings, and potential of LNNs compared to traditional RNNs in handling sequential data.

Method: A systematic review of existing research to analyze key principles, mathematical models, and characteristics of LNNs and RNNs.

Result: LNNs show promise in handling noisy, non-stationary data and achieving out-of-distribution generalization, while some variants excel in parameter efficiency and speed. RNNs maintain dominance due to their established ecosystem.

Conclusion: LNNs have significant potential but require improvements in scalability to expand their applications. Meanwhile, RNNs remain crucial for sequence modeling.

Abstract: This review aims to conduct a comparative analysis of liquid neural networks
(LNNs) and traditional recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and their variants,
such as long short-term memory networks (LSTMs) and gated recurrent units
(GRUs). The core dimensions of the analysis include model accuracy, memory
efficiency, and generalization ability. By systematically reviewing existing
research, this paper explores the basic principles, mathematical models, key
characteristics, and inherent challenges of these neural network architectures
in processing sequential data. Research findings reveal that LNN, as an
emerging, biologically inspired, continuous-time dynamic neural network,
demonstrates significant potential in handling noisy, non-stationary data, and
achieving out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization. Additionally, some LNN
variants outperform traditional RNN in terms of parameter efficiency and
computational speed. However, RNN remains a cornerstone in sequence modeling
due to its mature ecosystem and successful applications across various tasks.
This review identifies the commonalities and differences between LNNs and RNNs,
summarizes their respective shortcomings and challenges, and points out
valuable directions for future research, particularly emphasizing the
importance of improving the scalability of LNNs to promote their application in
broader and more complex scenarios.

*Hugh Blayney,Álvaro Arroyo,Xiaowen Dong,Michael M. Bronstein*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper revisits the issue of over-squashing in Graph Neural Networks, proposes a synthetic task to study it, and introduces a novel GNN architecture to address storage and retrieval capacity limitations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current GNNs suffer from over-squashing, which limits their ability to store and retrieve large amounts of information from node representations, negatively impacting performance.

Method: The authors analyze over-squashing through storage and retrieval capacity and propose a synthetic task to further understand it. They leverage ideas from sequence modeling to design an improved GNN architecture.

Result: The newly designed GNN architecture shows strong results on the synthetic task measuring capacity limitations and performs well across diverse real-world graph benchmarks.

Conclusion: The proposed approach successfully addresses the information bottleneck caused by over-squashing, enhancing the storage capacity and overall performance of GNNs.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) leverage the graph structure to transmit
information between nodes, typically through the message-passing mechanism.
While these models have found a wide variety of applications, they are known to
suffer from over-squashing, where information from a large receptive field of
node representations is collapsed into a single fixed sized vector, resulting
in an information bottleneck. In this paper, we re-examine the over-squashing
phenomenon through the lens of model storage and retrieval capacity, which we
define as the amount of information that can be stored in a node's
representation for later use. We study some of the limitations of existing
tasks used to measure over-squashing and introduce a new synthetic task to
demonstrate that an information bottleneck can saturate this capacity.
Furthermore, we adapt ideas from the sequence modeling literature on
associative memories, fast weight programmers, and the xLSTM model to develop a
novel GNN architecture with improved capacity. We demonstrate strong
performance of this architecture both on our capacity synthetic task, as well
as a range of real-world graph benchmarks.

### [317] [Expanding the Action Space of LLMs to Reason Beyond Language](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07581)
*Zhongqi Yue,Weishi Wang,Yundaichuan Zhan,Juncheng Li,Daniel Dahlmeier,Fredrik D. Johansson*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces Expanded Action space (ExpA) to allow large language models (LLMs) to interact with external environments directly, rather than relying solely on text. It proposes a reinforcement learning framework (EARL) to optimize the usage of these actions, showcasing superior performance in various tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs struggle with external environment interaction due to their confinement to text-based outputs, requiring complex, manual parsers for integration. The paper aims to streamline interaction by decoupling reasoning from control duties.

Method: The approach involves creating an Expanded Action space (ExpA) where LLMs can switch to specialized external environments, trigger environment-specific actions, and interact directly with external systems. Reinforcement learning based on counterfactual policy optimization is used to enhance exploration and performance.

Result: The EARL approach outperforms text-based action baselines in tasks requiring multi-turn interactions and contingent planning. It shows robust performance in calculator tasks and achieves perfect accuracy in the partially observed Sort-4 problem while discovering efficient algorithms.

Conclusion: Decoupling reasoning and environment interactions through the ExpA framework improves LLM capabilities, enabling effective exploration, task-specific actions, and robust performance in dynamic environments.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are powerful reasoners in natural language, but
their actions are typically confined to outputting vocabulary tokens. As a
result, interactions with external environments -- such as symbolic operators
or simulators -- must be expressed through text in predefined formats, parsed,
and routed to external interfaces. This overloads the model's language with
both reasoning and control duties, and requires a hand-crafted parser, external
to the LLM. To address this, we decouple environment interactions from language
by internalizing them in an Expanded Action space (ExpA), beyond the
vocabulary. The model starts reasoning in the default language environment, but
may trigger routing actions and switch to an external environment at any time.
From there, the model can only invoke environment-specific actions, receive
feedback from the environment, and potentially route back to language as a
result. To promote effective exploration of the expanded action space and new
environments, we introduce ExpA Reinforcement Learning (EARL) with
counterfactual policy optimization. On tasks requiring multi-turn interactions
and contingent planning, EARL outperforms strong baselines with
vocabulary-constrained actions. It performs robustly across calculator-based
multi-task learning and, in the partially observed sorting problem, achieves
perfect Sort-4 accuracy while self-discovering an efficient algorithm
competitive with classical designs.

*Jacob Chmura,Shenyang Huang,Tran Gia Bao Ngo,Ali Parviz,Farimah Poursafaei,Jure Leskovec,Michael Bronstein,Guillaume Rabusseau,Matthias Fey,Reihaneh Rabbany*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Temporal Graph Modelling (TGM), a unified library for machine learning on temporal graphs, which bridges the gap between continuous- and discrete-time dynamic graph methods while achieving significant computational speedup.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing libraries for Machine Learning on temporal graphs lack flexibility, and there is no unified framework for continuous- and discrete-time dynamic graphs, limiting research and innovation.

Method: The authors developed TGM, an open-source library that integrates continuous- and discrete-time dynamic graph approaches and supports dynamic features, task versatility, and efficient computation.

Result: TGM is empirically shown to be highly efficient with 7.8x speedup on tasks compared to DyGLib and 175x faster for graph discretization. It enables innovative research capabilities.

Conclusion: TGM fills critical gaps in temporal graph ML by providing an efficient, versatile, and unifying framework, opening new research possibilities and advancing the field.

Abstract: Well-designed open-source software drives progress in Machine Learning (ML)
research. While static graph ML enjoys mature frameworks like PyTorch Geometric
and DGL, ML for temporal graphs (TG), networks that evolve over time, lacks
comparable infrastructure. Existing TG libraries are often tailored to specific
architectures, hindering support for diverse models in this rapidly evolving
field. Additionally, the divide between continuous- and discrete-time dynamic
graph methods (CTDG and DTDG) limits direct comparisons and idea transfer. To
address these gaps, we introduce Temporal Graph Modelling (TGM), a
research-oriented library for ML on temporal graphs, the first to unify CTDG
and DTDG approaches. TGM offers first-class support for dynamic node features,
time-granularity conversions, and native handling of link-, node-, and
graph-level tasks. Empirically, TGM achieves an average 7.8x speedup across
multiple models, datasets, and tasks compared to the widely used DyGLib, and an
average 175x speedup on graph discretization relative to available
implementations. Beyond efficiency, we show in our experiments how TGM unlocks
entirely new research possibilities by enabling dynamic graph property
prediction and time-driven training paradigms, opening the door to questions
previously impractical to study. TGM is available at

### [319] [On the optimization dynamics of RLVR: Gradient gap and step size thresholds](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08539)
*Joe Suk,Yaqi Duan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper provides a theoretical foundation for Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) by introducing the Gradient Gap concept and analyzing its training process at multiple levels.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a lack of theoretical understanding of why RLVR, which uses binary feedback to train large language models, works effectively.

Method: The authors analyzed the RLVR training process, introduced the Gradient Gap concept, derived step-size thresholds for convergence, and validated their predictions using simulated bandits and experiments on large language models like Qwen2.5-7B.

Result: The analysis shows how critical step sizes and factors like response length influence learning stability and success rates, offering insights into achieving optimal RLVR performance.

Conclusion: The paper bridges the empirical success of RLVR with a principled theoretical framework, providing guidance on step-size selection and response normalization to ensure stable convergence.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR), which uses simple
binary feedback to post-train large language models, has shown significant
empirical success. However, a principled understanding of why it works has been
lacking. This paper builds a theoretical foundation for RLVR by analyzing its
training process at both the full-response (trajectory) and token levels.
Central to our analysis is a quantity called the Gradient Gap, which formalizes
the direction of improvement from low-reward to high-reward regions of the
response space. We prove that convergence critically depends on aligning the
update direction with this Gradient Gap. Moreover, we derive a sharp step-size
threshold based on the magnitude of the Gradient Gap: below it, learning
converges, whereas above it, performance collapses. Our theory further predicts
how the critical step size must scale with response length and the success
rate, thereby explaining why practical heuristics such as length normalization
improve stability and showing that, with a fixed learning rate, the success
rate can stagnate strictly below $100\%$. We validate these predictions through
controlled bandit simulations and LLM experiments, including training
Qwen2.5-7B with GRPO.

*Sizhe Ma,Katherine A. Flanigan,Mario Bergés,James D. Brooks*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper explores using unsupervised deep learning for broken rail detection in railway track monitoring, proposing an Attention-Focused Transformer model for better robustness and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address the challenge of reliably detecting small, transient railway track anomalies (2-10 cm) using indirect structural health monitoring (iSHM), which is hindered by factors like vehicle dynamics, signal noise, and limited labeled data.

Method: The authors introduce an incremental synthetic data benchmark for systematically evaluating model robustness under conditions such as speed variations, multi-channel inputs, and realistic noise patterns. Multiple unsupervised models, including the proposed Attention-Focused Transformer, were tested.

Result: Transformer-based models performed better than others but remain highly susceptible to high-frequency localized noise. The proposed Attention-Focused Transformer achieves comparable accuracy to state-of-the-art solutions but offers better inference speed.

Conclusion: Enhancing noise robustness is identified as a critical need for practical iSHM deployment. The paper positions the efficient, attention-based model as a foundational step toward effective onboard anomaly detection systems.

Abstract: Indirect structural health monitoring (iSHM) for broken rail detection using
onboard sensors presents a cost-effective paradigm for railway track
assessment, yet reliably detecting small, transient anomalies (2-10 cm) remains
a significant challenge due to complex vehicle dynamics, signal noise, and the
scarcity of labeled data limiting supervised approaches. This study addresses
these issues through unsupervised deep learning. We introduce an incremental
synthetic data benchmark designed to systematically evaluate model robustness
against progressively complex challenges like speed variations, multi-channel
inputs, and realistic noise patterns encountered in iSHM. Using this benchmark,
we evaluate several established unsupervised models alongside our proposed
Attention-Focused Transformer. Our model employs a self-attention mechanism,
trained via reconstruction but innovatively deriving anomaly scores primarily
from deviations in learned attention weights, aiming for both effectiveness and
computational efficiency. Benchmarking results reveal that while
transformer-based models generally outperform others, all tested models exhibit
significant vulnerability to high-frequency localized noise, identifying this
as a critical bottleneck for practical deployment. Notably, our proposed model
achieves accuracy comparable to the state-of-the-art solution while
demonstrating better inference speed. This highlights the crucial need for
enhanced noise robustness in future iSHM models and positions our more
efficient attention-based approach as a promising foundation for developing
practical onboard anomaly detection systems.

*Kevin Rojas,Jiahe Lin,Kashif Rasul,Anderson Schneider,Yuriy Nevmyvaka,Molei Tao,Wei Deng*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Group Diffusion Policy Optimization (GDPO), a reinforcement learning algorithm designed for diffusion language models (DLMs), addressing inefficiencies in existing methods by leveraging a low-variance ELBO estimation approach.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to adapt reinforcement learning fine-tuning to diffusion language models (DLMs), overcoming the challenges posed by intractable likelihood evaluations and the limitations of token-level estimation techniques like diffu-GRPO.

Method: The paper revisits evidence lower-bound (ELBO) estimation, identifying sources of variance, and designs GDPO, which employs semi-deterministic Monte Carlo approaches to reduce the variance in ELBO estimation under computational constraints.

Result: GDPO demonstrates consistent improvements on pretrained checkpoints and outperforms state-of-the-art baselines such as diffu-GRPO across various benchmarks, including math, reasoning, and coding tasks.

Conclusion: GDPO provides a more robust and computationally efficient RL fine-tuning method for DLMs, avoiding the biases and inefficiencies of previous approaches while advancing performance on practical tasks.

Abstract: Diffusion language models (DLMs) enable parallel, order-agnostic generation
with iterative refinement, offering a flexible alternative to autoregressive
large language models (LLMs). However, adapting reinforcement learning (RL)
fine-tuning to DLMs remains an open challenge because of the intractable
likelihood. Pioneering work such as diffu-GRPO estimated token-level
likelihoods via one-step unmasking. While computationally efficient, this
approach is severely biased. A more principled foundation lies in
sequence-level likelihoods, where the evidence lower bound (ELBO) serves as a
surrogate. Yet, despite this clean mathematical connection, ELBO-based methods
have seen limited adoption due to the prohibitive cost of likelihood
evaluation. In this work, we revisit ELBO estimation and disentangle its
sources of variance. This decomposition motivates reducing variance through
fast, deterministic integral approximations along a few pivotal dimensions.
Building on this insight, we introduce \textbf{Group Diffusion Policy
Optimization (GDPO)}, a new RL algorithm tailored for DLMs. GDPO leverages
simple yet effective Semi-deterministic Monte Carlo schemes to mitigate the
variance explosion of ELBO estimators under vanilla double Monte Carlo
sampling, yielding a provably lower-variance estimator under tight evaluation
budgets. Empirically, GDPO achieves consistent gains over pretrained
checkpoints and outperforms diffu-GRPO, one of the state-of-the-art baselines,
on the majority of math, reasoning, and coding benchmarks.

### [322] [DGTEN: A Robust Deep Gaussian based Graph Neural Network for Dynamic Trust Evaluation with Uncertainty-Quantification Support](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07620)
*Muhammad Usman,Yugyung Lee*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces DGTEN, a framework combining uncertainty-aware message passing, temporal modeling, and defense mechanisms to evaluate trust in dynamic graphs. It achieves superior performance against baselines, especially under adversarial conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges of evaluating trust in dynamic graphs, such as changing relationships, lack of calibrated confidence, and vulnerability to adversarial attacks.

Method: The method uses Gaussian distributions for nodes and edges, hybrid positional encoding, multi-head attention, and an ODE-based residual learning module. It employs adaptive ensemble analysis to identify and mitigate suspicious behaviors.

Result: DGTEN improves trust prediction significantly, showing up to 16.41% MCC gain in cold-start scenarios and 11.63% MCC gain under adversarial conditions.

Conclusion: DGTEN effectively combines uncertainty propagation, temporal modeling, and adversarial defenses to enable robust trust evaluation in dynamic graphs.

Abstract: Dynamic trust evaluation in large, rapidly evolving graphs requires models
that can capture changing relationships, express calibrated confidence, and
resist adversarial manipulation. DGTEN (Deep Gaussian-based Trust Evaluation
Network) introduces a unified graph framework that achieves all three by
combining uncertainty-aware message passing, expressive temporal modeling, and
built-in defenses against trust-targeted attacks. It represents nodes and edges
as Gaussian distributions so that both semantic signals and epistemic
uncertainty propagate through the graph neural network, enabling risk-aware
trust decisions rather than overconfident guesses. To model how trust evolves,
it employs hybrid Absolute-Gaussian-Hourglass (HAGH) positional encoding with
Kolmogorov-Arnold network-based unbiased multi-head attention, followed by an
ordinary differential equation (ODE)-based residual learning module to jointly
capture abrupt shifts and smooth trends. Robust adaptive ensemble coefficient
analysis prunes or down-weights suspicious interactions using complementary
cosine and Jaccard similarity measures, mitigating reputation laundering,
sabotage, and on/off attacks. On two signed Bitcoin trust networks, DGTEN
delivers significant improvements: in single-timeslot prediction on
Bitcoin-Alpha, it improves MCC by 10.77% over the best dynamic baseline; in the
cold-start scenario, it achieves a 16.41% MCC gain - the largest across all
tasks and datasets. Under adversarial on/off attacks, it surpasses the baseline
by up to 11.63% MCC. These results validate the effectiveness of the unified
DGTEN framework.

*Chongyu Fan,Changsheng Wang,Yancheng Huang,Soumyadeep Pal,Sijia Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper presents a taxonomy of recent stateful unlearning methods for large language models (LLMs), evaluates their effectiveness using new metrics, and identifies trade-offs and vulnerabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the fragmented and unclear definitions of effective unlearning in LLMs, improving the evaluation and understanding of unlearning methods, particularly in safety, privacy, and knowledge removal.

Method: The authors categorized 12 recent methods into three types (divergence-driven optimization, representation misalignment, and rejection-based approaches) and proposed new evaluation metrics such as Open-QA to assess generative performance and analyze trade-offs.

Result: They found that existing evaluations (like MCQ accuracy) are insufficient, identified a UE-UT tradeoff across method families, and highlighted differing vulnerabilities depending on the type of retraining or attacks faced by models.

Conclusion: A comprehensive re-evaluation of LLM unlearning methods is necessary, along with broader metrics and more nuanced approaches to robustness, to guide future research and development in effective unlearning.

Abstract: Machine unlearning for large language models (LLMs) aims to remove undesired
data, knowledge, and behaviors (e.g., for safety, privacy, or copyright) while
preserving useful model capabilities. Despite rapid progress over the past two
years, research in LLM unlearning remains fragmented, with limited clarity on
what constitutes effective unlearning and how it should be rigorously
evaluated. In this work, we present a principled taxonomy of twelve recent
stateful unlearning methods, grouped into three methodological families:
divergence-driven optimization, representation misalignment, and
rejection-based targeted unlearning. Building on this taxonomy, we revisit the
evaluation of unlearning effectiveness (UE), utility retention (UT), and
robustness (Rob), focusing on the WMDP benchmark. Our analysis shows that
current evaluations, dominated by multiple-choice question (MCQ) accuracy,
offer only a narrow perspective, often overstating success while overlooking
the model's actual generation behavior. To address this gap, we introduce open
question-answering (Open-QA) metrics that better capture generative performance
and reveal the inherent UE-UT tradeoff across method families. Furthermore, we
demonstrate that robustness requires finer-grained analysis: for example,
vulnerabilities differ substantially between in-domain relearning and
out-of-domain fine-tuning, even though both fall under model-level attacks.
Through this study, we hope to deliver a full-stack revisit of LLM unlearning
and actionable guidance for designing and evaluating future methods.

*Zichen Wang,Haoyang Hong,Chuanhao Li,Haoxuan Li,Zhiheng Zhang,Huazheng Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper addresses the trade-off between regret minimization and inference accuracy within multi-armed bandits with network interference (MABNI), and proposes theoretical and algorithmic solutions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing research on MABNI focuses on minimizing regret but neglects the issue that prioritizing the optimal arm might compromise inference accuracy for sub-optimal arms.

Method: The authors establish a theoretical Pareto frontier and propose an algorithm, EXP3-N-CS, along with an anytime-valid asymptotic confidence sequence for balancing regret minimization and inference accuracy.

Result: The theoretical framework and algorithm provide a mechanism to navigate the trade-off between regret and inference accuracy in adversarial MABNI.

Conclusion: This study advances the understanding of MABNI by addressing its complex trade-offs and offering practical tools for balancing competing objectives in adversarial contexts.

Abstract: In multi-armed bandits with network interference (MABNI), the action taken by
one node can influence the rewards of others, creating complex interdependence.
While existing research on MABNI largely concentrates on minimizing regret, it
often overlooks the crucial concern that an excessive emphasis on the optimal
arm can undermine the inference accuracy for sub-optimal arms. Although initial
efforts have been made to address this trade-off in single-unit scenarios,
these challenges have become more pronounced in the context of MABNI. In this
paper, we establish, for the first time, a theoretical Pareto frontier
characterizing the trade-off between regret minimization and inference accuracy
in adversarial (design-based) MABNI. We further introduce an anytime-valid
asymptotic confidence sequence along with a corresponding algorithm,
$\texttt{EXP3-N-CS}$, specifically designed to balance the trade-off between
regret minimization and inference accuracy in this setting.

### [326] [Continual Learning for Adaptive AI Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07648)
*Md Hasibul Amin,Tamzid Tanvi Alam*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a novel regularization technique based on inter-cluster separation to address catastrophic forgetting in continual learning neural networks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation behind this work is to overcome the challenge of catastrophic forgetting, where neural networks lose previously acquired knowledge when learning new tasks.

Method: The authors introduced a loss function regularization term that penalizes outputs far from centroids of clusters formed by prior task data and optimized its weighting through hyperparameter tuning.

Result: Experiments on the 5-task Split CIFAR-10 benchmark with ResNet-18 architecture showed the effectiveness of the method in maintaining performance on initial tasks but revealed challenges in scaling to more tasks.

Conclusion: While the proposed method improves task separation and mitigates forgetting in smaller task setups, its long-term retention limitations suggest a need for further enhancements in continual learning.

Abstract: Continual learning the ability of a neural network to learn multiple
sequential tasks without losing previously acquired knowledge remains a
significant obstacle to developing truly adaptive artificial intelligence. Deep
learning models have achieved remarkable results in various applications, but
overfitting remains a common issue. Regularization techniques can help prevent
overfitting by adding constraints to the model's parameters. To prevent
catastrophic forgetting, in this paper we introduce a novel regularization
technique based on inter-cluster separation (ICS) in the loss function, which
penalizes the model for producing outputs that are far away from the centroids
of the clusters formed by the data from previous tasks. We also performed
hyperparameter tuning to find the optimal weighting of the proposed
regularization term. This ensures clearer separation between tasks in the
neural network's internal representation, reducing overlap and mitigating
forgetting. Using the standard 5-task Split CIFAR-10 benchmark and a ResNet-18
architecture, we demonstrate ICS's effectiveness in maintaining strong
performance on initial tasks. However, our results also highlight limitations
in long-term knowledge retention, particularly when the number of tasks
increases. This underscores the complexity and trade-offs inherent in continual
learning and points toward avenues for further research.

### [327] [Value Flows](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07650)
*Perry Dong,Chongyi Zheng,Chelsea Finn,Dorsa Sadigh,Benjamin Eysenbach*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces a novel method, Value Flows, using flow-based models to estimate full return distributions in reinforcement learning (RL), improving success rates in benchmark tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most RL methods simplify future returns into a single scalar, which can overlook valuable information about return distributions. Fine-grained understanding of return uncertainty and its impact on decisions remains unexplored.

Method: The paper utilizes flow-based models with a new flow-matching objective to estimate future return distributions and introduces a flow derivative ODE to assess state-specific return uncertainty, enhancing prioritization in learning transitions.

Result: Value Flows demonstrates a $1.3\times$ average improvement in success rates across 37 state-based and 25 image-based benchmark tasks.

Conclusion: Flow-based modeling of return distributions provides accurate uncertainty assessments, improving decision-making and performance in RL.

Abstract: While most reinforcement learning methods today flatten the distribution of
future returns to a single scalar value, distributional RL methods exploit the
return distribution to provide stronger learning signals and to enable
applications in exploration and safe RL. While the predominant method for
estimating the return distribution is by modeling it as a categorical
distribution over discrete bins or estimating a finite number of quantiles,
such approaches leave unanswered questions about the fine-grained structure of
the return distribution and about how to distinguish states with high return
uncertainty for decision-making. The key idea in this paper is to use modern,
flexible flow-based models to estimate the full future return distributions and
identify those states with high return variance. We do so by formulating a new
flow-matching objective that generates probability density paths satisfying the
distributional Bellman equation. Building upon the learned flow models, we
estimate the return uncertainty of distinct states using a new flow derivative
ODE. We additionally use this uncertainty information to prioritize learning a
more accurate return estimation on certain transitions. We compare our method
(Value Flows) with prior methods in the offline and online-to-online settings.
Experiments on $37$ state-based and $25$ image-based benchmark tasks
demonstrate that Value Flows achieves a $1.3\times$ improvement on average in
success rates. Website: https://pd-perry.github.io/value-flows Code:

*Changyeon Kim,Haeone Lee,Younggyo Seo,Kimin Lee,Yuke Zhu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DEAS is an offline RL framework that uses action sequences to improve value learning and overcome challenges in long-horizon tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Offline RL faces difficulty in achieving effective long-horizon sequential decision making despite its potential to reduce costs and risks.

Method: DEAS employs action sequences coupled with semi-Markov decision process Q-learning, reducing planning horizons, while mitigating value overestimation via detached value learning.

Result: DEAS consistently outperforms other methods in complex long-horizon tasks and enhances performance in Vision-Language-Action models for simulation and real-world manipulation.

Conclusion: DEAS proves effective for offline RL by utilizing action sequences and detached value learning, advancing tasks in simulated and practical scenarios.

Abstract: Offline reinforcement learning (RL) presents an attractive paradigm for
training intelligent agents without expensive online interactions. However,
current approaches still struggle with complex, long-horizon sequential
decision making. In this work, we introduce DEtached value learning with Action
Sequence (DEAS), a simple yet effective offline RL framework that leverages
action sequences for value learning. These temporally extended actions provide
richer information than single-step actions and can be interpreted through the
options framework via semi-Markov decision process Q-learning, enabling
reduction of the effective planning horizon by considering longer sequences at
once. However, directly adopting such sequences in actor-critic algorithms
introduces excessive value overestimation, which we address through detached
value learning that steers value estimates toward in-distribution actions that
achieve high return in the offline dataset. We demonstrate that DEAS
consistently outperforms baselines on complex, long-horizon tasks from OGBench
and can be applied to enhance the performance of large-scale
Vision-Language-Action models that predict action sequences, significantly
boosting performance in both RoboCasa Kitchen simulation tasks and real-world
manipulation tasks.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LiveThinking is a framework optimizing AI avatars for real-time e-commerce livestreams by distilling large reasoning models and using reinforcement learning to balance model correctness, helpfulness, and latency, leading to better user engagement and sales.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI avatars in e-commerce livestreaming face challenges with real-time interaction due to latency from large reasoning models (LRMs). The motivation is to create a system that reduces this latency while maintaining effective reasoning abilities to drive user engagement and sales.

Method: The study introduces LiveThinking, which reduces computational cost by distilling a 670B LRM into a 30B Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) model using Rejection Sampling Fine-Tuning (RFT). Reinforcement learning with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) is then applied to compress reasoning paths by balancing correctness, brevity, and engagement using a multi-objective reward function.

Result: LiveThinking achieved a 30-fold reduction in computational cost, enabling sub-second latency. In a real-world application on Taobao Live, it improved response correctness by 3.3%, response helpfulness by 21.8%, and resulted in a statistically significant increase in Gross Merchandise Volume (GMV).

Conclusion: LiveThinking successfully addresses the latency and computational challenges for AI in real-time e-commerce livestreaming, improving user interaction and measurable commercial outcomes, thus proving its value for scalable deployment in interactive AI systems.

Abstract: In AI-powered e-commerce livestreaming, digital avatars require real-time
responses to drive engagement, a task for which high-latency Large Reasoning
Models (LRMs) are ill-suited. We introduce LiveThinking, a practical two-stage
optimization framework to bridge this gap. First, we address computational cost
by distilling a 670B teacher LRM into a lightweight 30B Mixture-of-Experts
(MoE) model (3B active) using Rejection Sampling Fine-Tuning (RFT). This
reduces deployment overhead but preserves the teacher's verbose reasoning,
causing latency. To solve this, our second stage employs reinforcement learning
with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to compress the model's
reasoning path, guided by a multi-objective reward function balancing
correctness, helpfulness, and brevity. LiveThinking achieves a 30-fold
reduction in computational cost, enabling sub-second latency. In real-world
application on Taobao Live, it improved response correctness by 3.3% and
helpfulness by 21.8%. Tested by hundreds of thousands of viewers, our system
led to a statistically significant increase in Gross Merchandise Volume (GMV),
demonstrating its effectiveness in enhancing user experience and commercial
performance in live, interactive settings.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: GRFs++ enhance the modeling accuracy and computation efficiency of graph kernels by refining Graph Random Features for better handling relationships between distant nodes using a novel walk-stitching technique.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address long-standing limitations in regular Graph Random Features (GRFs) such as difficulty in modeling distant node relationships and inefficiencies in sampling long random walks.

Method: Introduce GRFs++, utilizing a walk-stitching approach to concatenate shorter random walks and extending halting mechanisms via general distributions for improved graph kernel approximations.

Result: Achieved better approximation quality for graph kernels with efficiency gains through parallel computation and matrix operations, as confirmed by theoretical and empirical validation.

Conclusion: GRFs++ significantly improve upon regular GRFs by providing more accurate and computationally efficient methods for graph-related kernel computations.

Abstract: We propose refined GRFs (GRFs++), a new class of Graph Random Features (GRFs)
for efficient and accurate computations involving kernels defined on the nodes
of a graph. GRFs++ resolve some of the long-standing limitations of regular
GRFs, including difficulty modeling relationships between more distant nodes.
They reduce dependence on sampling long graph random walks via a novel
walk-stitching technique, concatenating several shorter walks without breaking
unbiasedness. By applying these techniques, GRFs++ inherit the approximation
quality provided by longer walks but with greater efficiency, trading
sequential, inefficient sampling of a long walk for parallel computation of
short walks and matrix-matrix multiplication. Furthermore, GRFs++ extend the
simplistic GRFs walk termination mechanism (Bernoulli schemes with fixed
halting probabilities) to a broader class of strategies, applying general
distributions on the walks' lengths. This improves the approximation accuracy
of graph kernels, without incurring extra computational cost. We provide
empirical evaluations to showcase all our claims and complement our results
with theoretical analysis.

*Rongchao Xu,Kunlin Cai,Lin Jiang,Dahai Yu,Zhiqing Hong,Yuan Tian,Guang Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces GeoGen, a novel two-stage framework for generating synthetic LBSN check-in trajectory data using generative AI, addressing challenges from sparse, uncertain human mobility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for large-scale Location-Based Social Network trajectory data for applications like recommendations and privacy concerns limits data access.

Method: Proposed GeoGen framework involves reconstructing latent movement sequences and using a Sparsity-aware Spatio-temporal Diffusion model (S$^2$TDiff) and Coarse2FineNet for precise data generation.

Result: GeoGen outperformed state-of-the-art methods, achieving significant improvements (e.g., 69% in distance metric) in four real-world datasets.

Conclusion: GeoGen demonstrates effectiveness in creating realistic synthetic trajectory data, supporting privacy while maintaining application utility.

Abstract: Location-Based Social Network (LBSN) check-in trajectory data are important
for many practical applications, like POI recommendation, advertising, and
pandemic intervention. However, the high collection costs and ever-increasing
privacy concerns prevent us from accessing large-scale LBSN trajectory data.
The recent advances in synthetic data generation provide us with a new
opportunity to achieve this, which utilizes generative AI to generate synthetic
data that preserves the characteristics of real data while ensuring privacy
protection. However, generating synthetic LBSN check-in trajectories remains
challenging due to their spatially discrete, temporally irregular nature and
the complex spatio-temporal patterns caused by sparse activities and uncertain
human mobility. To address this challenge, we propose GeoGen, a two-stage
coarse-to-fine framework for large-scale LBSN check-in trajectory generation.
In the first stage, we reconstruct spatially continuous, temporally regular
latent movement sequences from the original LBSN check-in trajectories and then
design a Sparsity-aware Spatio-temporal Diffusion model (S$^2$TDiff) with an
efficient denosing network to learn their underlying behavioral patterns. In
the second stage, we design Coarse2FineNet, a Transformer-based Seq2Seq
architecture equipped with a dynamic context fusion mechanism in the encoder
and a multi-task hybrid-head decoder, which generates fine-grained LBSN
trajectories based on coarse-grained latent movement sequences by modeling
semantic relevance and behavioral uncertainty. Extensive experiments on four
real-world datasets show that GeoGen excels state-of-the-art models for both
fidelity and utility evaluation, e.g., it increases over 69% and 55% in
distance and radius metrics on the FS-TKY dataset.

*Chengting Yu,Xiaobo Shu,Yadao Wang,Yizhen Zhang,Haoyi Wu,Jiaang Li,Rujiao Long,Ziheng Chen,Yuchi Xu,Wenbo Su,Bo Zheng*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper addresses issues in recursive transformers by introducing the Memory-as-State-Highways (MeSH) framework, which improves performance and scalability with fewer parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Recursive transformers often underperform non-recursive ones due to computational uniformity and information overload in hidden states.

Method: The paper introduces MeSH, a framework using explicit memory buffers and lightweight routers to diversify computation and solve these bottlenecks.

Result: MeSH resolves performance bottlenecks, leading to better results than recursive transformers and outperforming larger non-recursive models at a 1.4B scale with fewer parameters.

Conclusion: MeSH is established as a scalable and efficient architecture for recursive models, offering improved performance and parameter efficiency.

Abstract: Recursive transformers reuse parameters and iterate over hidden states
multiple times, decoupling compute depth from parameter depth. However, under
matched compute, recursive models with fewer parameters often lag behind
non-recursive counterparts. By probing hidden states, we trace this performance
gap to two primary bottlenecks: undifferentiated computation, where the core is
forced to adopt a similar computational pattern at every iteration, and
information overload, where long-lived and transient information must coexist
in a single hidden state. To address the issues, we introduce a
Memory-as-State-Highways (MeSH) scheme, which externalizes state management
into an explicit memory buffer and employs lightweight routers to dynamically
diversify computation across iterations. Probing visualizations confirm that
MeSH successfully resolves the pathologies by inducing functional
specialization across iterations. On the Pythia suite (160M-1.4B),
MeSH-enhanced recursive transformers consistently improve over recursive
baselines and outperforms its larger non-recursive counterpart at the 1.4B
scale, improving average downstream accuracy by +1.06% with 33% fewer
non-embedding parameters. Our analysis establishes MeSH as a scalable and
principled architecture for building stronger recursive models.

*Noah Bergam,Szymon Snoeck,Nakul Verma*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This study challenges the assumption that t-SNE visualizations accurately preserve input structures and demonstrates that they often fail to reliably depict input clustering strength and outlier extremity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: t-SNE is widely used for dimensionality reduction and visualization, with the belief that it preserves input structure in its outputs, prompting a deeper investigation into its reliability.

Method: The authors theoretically prove and empirically demonstrate the limitations of t-SNE in preserving input clustering strength and outlier characteristics.

Result: The analysis shows that t-SNE cannot reliably infer input clustering strength and outlier extremity, identifying failure modes in practical applications.

Conclusion: t-SNE visualizations may mislead practitioners regarding certain input characteristics, highlighting the need for caution and alternative techniques in analyzing data structures accurately.

Abstract: Central to the widespread use of t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding
(t-SNE) is the conviction that it produces visualizations whose structure
roughly matches that of the input. To the contrary, we prove that (1) the
strength of the input clustering, and (2) the extremity of outlier points,
cannot be reliably inferred from the t-SNE output. We demonstrate the
prevalence of these failure modes in practice as well.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces FedBook, a federated graph foundation codebook designed to enhance the performance of graph foundation models in federated settings, outperforming 21 baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the challenges of centralized access to multi-domain graphs due to privacy and institutional constraints, and the need for a federated solution that ensures intra-domain coherence and inter-domain diversity.

Method: FedBook is proposed as a federated graph foundation codebook that follows a two-phase process: (1) Intra-domain Collaboration to enhance domain-specific coherence by refining low-frequency tokens across clients, and (2) Inter-domain Integration to preserve cross-domain diversity by weighting client contributions based on semantic distinctiveness.

Result: FedBook showed consistent superior performance over 21 baselines in experiments across 8 benchmarks spanning multiple domains and tasks.

Conclusion: FedBook effectively addresses the limitations of existing federated graph foundation models by enabling robust intra- and inter-domain semantics through its unified codebook approach.

Abstract: Foundation models have shown remarkable cross-domain generalization in
language and vision, inspiring the development of graph foundation models
(GFMs). However, existing GFMs typically assume centralized access to
multi-domain graphs, which is often infeasible due to privacy and institutional
constraints. Federated Graph Foundation Models (FedGFMs) address this
limitation, but their effectiveness fundamentally hinges on constructing a
robust global codebook that achieves intra-domain coherence by consolidating
mutually reinforcing semantics within each domain, while also maintaining
inter-domain diversity by retaining heterogeneous knowledge across domains. To
this end, we propose FedBook, a unified federated graph foundation codebook
that systematically aggregates clients' local codebooks during server-side
federated pre-training. FedBook follows a two-phase process: (1) Intra-domain
Collaboration, where low-frequency tokens are refined by referencing more
semantically reliable high-frequency tokens across clients to enhance
domain-specific coherence; and (2) Inter-domain Integration, where client
contributions are weighted by the semantic distinctiveness of their codebooks
during the aggregation of the global GFM, thereby preserving cross-domain
diversity. Extensive experiments on 8 benchmarks across multiple domains and
tasks demonstrate that FedBook consistently outperforms 21 baselines, including
isolated supervised learning, FL/FGL, federated adaptations of centralized
GFMs, and FedGFM techniques.

*Qiaozhe Zhang,Jun Sun,Ruijie Zhang,Yingzhuang Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Rényi sharpness, a novel measure based on Rényi entropy, that better correlates with neural network generalization compared to previous sharpness measures. Additionally, it introduces RSAM as a regularizer, achieving up to 2.5% test accuracy gain over SAM.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the weak correlation between existing sharpness measures of loss minima and neural network generalization.

Method: The paper defines Rényi sharpness using the negative Rényi entropy of the loss Hessian, establishes generalization bounds based on this measure, and proposes RSAM as a training regularizer.

Result: Experiments show strong correlation between Rényi sharpness and generalization, and RSAM improves test accuracy by up to 2.5% over SAM.

Conclusion: Rényi sharpness, and its application via RSAM, provide a more accurate way to characterize sharpness and improve generalization in neural network training.

Abstract: Sharpness (of the loss minima) is a common measure to investigate the
generalization of neural networks. Intuitively speaking, the flatter the
landscape near the minima is, the better generalization might be.
Unfortunately, the correlation between many existing sharpness measures and the
generalization is usually not strong, sometimes even weak. To close the gap
between the intuition and the reality, we propose a novel sharpness measure,
i.e., \textit{R\'enyi sharpness}, which is defined as the negative R\'enyi
entropy (a generalization of the classical Shannon entropy) of the loss
Hessian. The main ideas are as follows: 1) we realize that \textit{uniform}
(identical) eigenvalues of the loss Hessian is most desirable (while keeping
the sum constant) to achieve good generalization; 2) we employ the
\textit{R\'enyi entropy} to concisely characterize the extent of the spread of
the eigenvalues of loss Hessian. Normally, the larger the spread, the smaller
the (R\'enyi) entropy. To rigorously establish the relationship between
generalization and (R\'enyi) sharpness, we provide several generalization
bounds in terms of R\'enyi sharpness, by taking advantage of the
reparametrization invariance property of R\'enyi sharpness, as well as the
trick of translating the data discrepancy to the weight perturbation.
Furthermore, extensive experiments are conducted to verify the strong
correlation (in specific, Kendall rank correlation) between the R\'enyi
sharpness and generalization. Moreover, we propose to use a variant of R\'enyi
Sharpness as regularizer during training, i.e., R\'enyi Sharpness Aware
Minimization (RSAM), which turns out to outperform all existing sharpness-aware
minimization methods. It is worthy noting that the test accuracy gain of our
proposed RSAM method could be as high as nearly 2.5\%, compared against the
classical SAM method.

TL;DR: The paper introduces Validation-Aligned Multi-task Optimization (VAMO) to improve multi-task learning in the context of online advertising.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current approaches for optimizing heterogeneous bidding tasks are inefficient and generalize poorly in volatile environments.

Method: The paper proposes VAMO, which adaptively adjusts task weights using per-task training gradients aligned with validation gradients. Additionally, periodicity-aware temporal modules and generative auto-bidding mechanisms enhance capability.

Result: Experiments show consistent improvement in bidding performance for both simulated and real-world systems compared to standard baselines.

Conclusion: The method demonstrates validation-guided optimization is effective for better training generalization, with theoretical insights provided.

Abstract: In online advertising, heterogeneous advertiser requirements give rise to
numerous customized bidding tasks that are typically optimized independently,
resulting in extensive computation and limited data efficiency. Multi-task
learning offers a principled framework to train these tasks jointly through
shared representations. However, existing multi-task optimization strategies
are primarily guided by training dynamics and often generalize poorly in
volatile bidding environments. To this end, we present Validation-Aligned
Multi-task Optimization (VAMO), which adaptively assigns task weights based on
the alignment between per-task training gradients and a held-out validation
gradient, thereby steering updates toward validation improvement and better
matching deployment objectives. We further equip the framework with a
periodicity-aware temporal module and couple it with an advanced generative
auto-bidding backbone to enhance cross-task transfer of seasonal structure and
strengthen bidding performance. Meanwhile, we provide theoretical insights into
the proposed method, e.g., convergence guarantee and alignment analysis.
Extensive experiments on both simulated and large-scale real-world advertising
systems consistently demonstrate significant improvements over typical
baselines, illuminating the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the communication latency issue caused by bandwidth-limited channels in wireless federated learning.

Method: Develop a layer-wise adaptive modulation approach that assigns optimal modulation levels based on the importance of different DNN layers.

Result: Experimental results show a reduction of up to 73.9% in communication latency compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: Prioritizing the modulation levels across DNN layers based on importance is more efficient, offering significant communication savings in wireless FL systems.

Abstract: In wireless federated learning (FL), the clients need to transmit the
high-dimensional deep neural network (DNN) parameters through bandwidth-limited
channels, which causes the communication latency issue. In this paper, we
propose a layer-wise adaptive modulation scheme to save the communication
latency. Unlike existing works which assign the same modulation level for all
DNN layers, we consider the layers' importance which provides more freedom to
save the latency. The proposed scheme can automatically decide the optimal
modulation levels for different DNN layers. Experimental results show that the
proposed scheme can save up to 73.9% of communication latency compared with the
existing schemes.

TL;DR: The paper develops a data-driven modeling approach, using the WSINDy algorithm and kernel density estimation, to understand and predict lepidopteran larval population movements in sparse datasets influenced by environmental and infection factors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding insect dispersal dynamics, particularly crop and forestry pests like fall armyworms, is crucial for improving pest outbreak forecasting and management.

Method: The work extends weak-form equation learning techniques combined with kernel density estimation, leveraging Galerkin methods such as the WSINDy algorithm to analyze sparse larval population movement data.

Result: The methodology reveals insights into fall armyworm positional movement under diverse agricultural conditions, considering factors like resource availability and infection status.

Conclusion: The proposed approach effectively learns governing equations from sparse data, demonstrating its potential to enhance pest management strategies by predicting dispersal and outbreak patterns.

Abstract: Insect species subject to infection, predation, and anisotropic environmental
conditions may exhibit preferential movement patterns. Given the innate
stochasticity of exogenous factors driving these patterns over short
timescales, individual insect trajectories typically obey overdamped stochastic
dynamics. In practice, data-driven modeling approaches designed to learn the
underlying Fokker-Planck equations from observed insect distributions serve as
ideal tools for understanding and predicting such behavior. Understanding
dispersal dynamics of crop and silvicultural pests can lead to a better
forecasting of outbreak intensity and location, which can result in better pest
management. In this work, we extend weak-form equation learning techniques,
coupled with kernel density estimation, to learn effective models for
lepidopteran larval population movement from highly sparse experimental data.
Galerkin methods such as the Weak form Sparse Identification of Nonlinear
Dynamics (WSINDy) algorithm have recently proven useful for learning governing
equations in several scientific contexts. We demonstrate the utility of the
method on a sparse dataset of position measurements of fall armyworms
(Spodoptera frugiperda) obtained in simulated agricultural conditions with
varied plant resources and infection status.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation lies in overcoming the limitations of extracting and standardizing pharmacokinetic (PK) information, which hampers reliable data-driven models for drug development.

Method: The paper presents HySim-LLM, incorporating embedding-weighted fine-tuning and manifold-aware denoising to enhance the robustness and interpretability of LLMs. It is also built upon theoretical bounds for adaptation performance and noise reduction.

Result: The framework establishes two theoretical guarantees: a generalization bound for adaptation performance and a denoising guarantee for handling noisy or off-manifold samples.

Conclusion: HySim-LLM provides a grounded methodology for fine-tuning LLMs in structured biomedical domains, ensuring reliability and interpretability.

Abstract: The extraction and standardization of pharmacokinetic (PK) information from
scientific literature remain significant challenges in computational
pharmacology, which limits the reliability of data-driven models in drug
development. Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable progress in
text understanding and reasoning, yet their adaptation to structured biomedical
data, such as PK tables, remains constrained by heterogeneity, noise, and
domain shift. To address these limitations, we propose HySim-LLM, a unified
mathematical and computational framework that integrates embedding-weighted
fine-tuning and manifold-aware denoising to enhance the robustness and
interpretability of LLMs. We establish two theoretical results: (1) a
similarity-weighted generalization bound that quantifies adaptation performance
under embedding divergence, and (2) a manifold-based denoising guarantee that
bounds loss contributions from noisy or off-manifold samples. These theorems
provide a principled foundation for fine-tuning LLMs in structured biomedical
settings. The framework offers a mathematically grounded pathway toward
reliable and interpretable LLM adaptation for biomedical and data-intensive
scientific domains.

### [341] [SIMU: Selective Influence Machine Unlearning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07822)
*Anu Agarwal,Mihir Pamnani,Dilek Hakkani-Tur*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper presents SIMU, a framework to enhance machine unlearning in LLMs by targeting specific neurons while preserving model knowledge.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The growing concern of sensitive information memorization in LLMs has sparked the need for effective machine unlearning methods that can erase targeted information without damaging the model's overall performance.

Method: The proposed SIMU framework selectively updates critical neurons encoding specific information using a two-step approach, enhancing second-order optimizer-based unlearning methods.

Result: SIMU delivers comparable unlearning performance while significantly outperforming existing methods in retaining the model's prior knowledge and utility.

Conclusion: By focusing updates on targeted neurons, SIMU successfully balances unlearning efficacy and knowledge retention, making it a promising advancement in LLM safety systems.

Abstract: The undesired memorization of sensitive information by Large Language Models
(LLMs) has emphasized the need for safety mechanisms that can regulate model
behavior. This has led to the development of machine unlearning techniques that
enable models to precisely forget sensitive and unwanted information. For
machine unlearning, first-order and second-order optimizer-based methods have
shown significant progress in enabling LLMs to forget targeted information.
However, in doing so, these approaches often compromise the model's original
capabilities, resulting in unlearned models that struggle to retain their prior
knowledge and overall utility. To address this, we propose Selective Influence
Machine Unlearning (SIMU), a two-step framework that enhances second-order
optimizer-based unlearning by selectively updating only the critical neurons
responsible for encoding the forget-set. By constraining updates to these
targeted neurons, SIMU achieves comparable unlearning efficacy while
substantially outperforming current methods in retaining the model's original
knowledge.

### [342] [MetaDefense: Defending Finetuning-based Jailbreak Attack Before and During Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07835)
*Weisen Jiang,Sinno Jialin Pan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper presents MetaDefense, a robust framework to counter finetuning-based jailbreak attacks on large language models, employing pre-generation and mid-generation defense techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing defense mechanisms struggle to handle disguised harmful queries from unseen attack templates while LLMs exhibit potential to detect such queries in embedding space.

Method: MetaDefense uses a two-stage approach: pre-generation defense to identify harmful queries before response generation and mid-generation defense to stop harmful content during response generation. It trains LLMs with specialized prompts to predict harmfulness.

Result: Experiments with various LLMs reveal MetaDefense's superior performance in defending against both known and novel attack templates, and retaining effectiveness for benign queries.

Conclusion: MetaDefense is a significant advancement in safeguarding LLMs, improving robustness against disguised harmful queries without compromising benign task performance.

Abstract: This paper introduces MetaDefense, a novel framework for defending against
finetuning-based jailbreak attacks in large language models (LLMs). We observe
that existing defense mechanisms fail to generalize to harmful queries
disguised by unseen attack templates, despite LLMs being capable of
distinguishing disguised harmful queries in the embedding space. Based on these
insights, we propose a two-stage defense approach: (i) pre-generation defense
that detects harmful queries before response generation begins, and (ii)
mid-generation defense that monitors partial responses during generation to
prevent outputting more harmful content. Our MetaDefense trains the LLM to
predict the harmfulness of both queries and partial responses using specialized
prompts, enabling early termination of potentially harmful interactions.
Extensive experiments across multiple LLM architectures (LLaMA-2-7B,
Qwen-2.5-3B-Instruct, and LLaMA-3.2-3B-Instruct) demonstrate that MetaDefense
significantly outperforms existing defense mechanisms, achieving robust defense
against harmful queries with seen and unseen attack templates while maintaining
competitive performance on benign tasks. Code is available at

### [343] [Self-Improving LLM Agents at Test-Time](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07841)
*Emre Can Acikgoz,Cheng Qian,Heng Ji,Dilek Hakkani-Tür,Gokhan Tur*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a test-time self-improvement method for language models (LMs) that identifies and learns from uncertain cases, enhancing performance with reduced training data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LM fine-tuning paradigms require large, costly datasets without ensuring better generalization or handling of complex scenarios. Efficient and effective alternatives are needed.

Method: The approach involves three steps: (i) self-awareness to identify challenging samples, (ii) self-data augmentation to generate similar examples, and (iii) self-improvement through fine-tuning at test time. The framework is studied as TT-SI, where the same model generates examples, and TT-D, leveraging a stronger model for supervision.

Result: TT-SI improves average accuracy across benchmarks by +5.48% while using 68x less training data compared to standard methods.

Conclusion: Test-time self-improvement presents a promising paradigm for building more capable and efficient LMs, enabling their self-evolution through dynamic learning.

Abstract: One paradigm of language model (LM) fine-tuning relies on creating large
training datasets, under the assumption that high quantity and diversity will
enable models to generalize to novel tasks after post-training. In practice,
gathering large sets of data is inefficient, and training on them is
prohibitively expensive; worse, there is no guarantee that the resulting model
will handle complex scenarios or generalize better. Moreover, existing
techniques rarely assess whether a training sample provides novel information
or is redundant with the knowledge already acquired by the model, resulting in
unnecessary costs. In this work, we explore a new test-time self-improvement
method to create more effective and generalizable agentic LMs on-the-fly. The
proposed algorithm can be summarized in three steps: (i) first it identifies
the samples that model struggles with (self-awareness), (ii) then generates
similar examples from detected uncertain samples (self-data augmentation), and
(iii) uses these newly generated samples at test-time fine-tuning
(self-improvement). We study two variants of this approach: Test-Time
Self-Improvement (TT-SI), where the same model generates additional training
examples from its own uncertain cases and then learns from them, and contrast
this approach with Test-Time Distillation (TT-D), where a stronger model
generates similar examples for uncertain cases, enabling student to adapt using
distilled supervision. Empirical evaluations across different agent benchmarks
demonstrate that TT-SI improves the performance with +5.48% absolute accuracy
gain on average across all benchmarks and surpasses other standard learning
methods, yet using 68x less training samples. Our findings highlight the
promise of TT-SI, demonstrating the potential of self-improvement algorithms at
test-time as a new paradigm for building more capable agents toward
self-evolution.

*Liting Li,Yumeng Wang,Yueheng Sun*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces MA-GAD, a meta-learning-based framework for graph-level anomaly detection, designed to perform better in few-shot conditions and reduce noise interference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Graph Neural Networks require a large amount of labeled data for anomaly detection, and few-shot settings suffer from noise interference, limiting their robustness and effectiveness.

Method: MA-GAD includes a graph compression module to reduce noise while retaining essential node information, uses meta-learning for rapid adaptation to new tasks, and incorporates a bias network for enhanced distinction between anomalies and normal data.

Result: MA-GAD achieved superior performance on four biochemical datasets, outperforming state-of-the-art methods in detecting graph and subgraph anomalies under few-shot conditions.

Conclusion: The proposed MA-GAD framework is effective for graph-level and subgraph-level anomaly detection under limited data scenarios, offering better performance and robustness in real-world applications.

Abstract: Graph-level anomaly detection aims to identify anomalous graphs or subgraphs
within graph datasets, playing a vital role in various fields such as fraud
detection, review classification, and biochemistry. While Graph Neural Networks
(GNNs) have made significant progress in this domain, existing methods rely
heavily on large amounts of labeled data, which is often unavailable in
real-world scenarios. Additionally, few-shot anomaly detection methods based on
GNNs are prone to noise interference, resulting in poor embedding quality and
reduced model robustness. To address these challenges, we propose a novel
meta-learning-based graph-level anomaly detection framework (MA-GAD),
incorporating a graph compression module that reduces the graph size,
mitigating noise interference while retaining essential node information. We
also leverage meta-learning to extract meta-anomaly information from similar
networks, enabling the learning of an initialization model that can rapidly
adapt to new tasks with limited samples. This improves the anomaly detection
performance on target graphs, and a bias network is used to enhance the
distinction between anomalous and normal nodes. Our experimental results, based
on four real-world biochemical datasets, demonstrate that MA-GAD outperforms
existing state-of-the-art methods in graph-level anomaly detection under
few-shot conditions. Experiments on both graph anomaly and subgraph anomaly
detection tasks validate the framework's effectiveness on real-world datasets.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces an Adaptive Optimizable Gaussian Process Regression Linear Least Squares Regression (AO-GPRLLSR) filtering pipeline to enhance SEM images by estimating Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) and Noise Variance (NV).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Noise in SEM images degrades their quality, hindering accurate analysis. The study aims to provide a robust method to address this issue.

Method: The approach combines the best SNR estimation technique (Linear Least Squares Regression, LSR) with machine learning models like Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Optimizable Gaussian Process Regression (GPR).

Result: The Optimizable GPR model paired with LSR yields highly accurate NV estimation and improves SEM image quality using a NV-guided Wiener filter.

Conclusion: AO-GPRLLSR filtering pipeline effectively estimates SNR & NV, improving SEM image quality and reducing Mean Squared Error after filtering.

Abstract: Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) images often suffer from noise
contamination, which degrades image quality and affects further analysis. This
research presents a complete approach to estimate their Signal-to-Noise Ratio
(SNR) and noise variance (NV), and enhance image quality using NV-guided Wiener
filter. The main idea of this study is to use a good SNR estimation technique
and infuse a machine learning model to estimate NV of the SEM image, which then
guides the wiener filter to remove the noise, providing a more robust and
accurate SEM image filtering pipeline. First, we investigate five different SNR
estimation techniques, namely Nearest Neighbourhood (NN) method, First-Order
Linear Interpolation (FOL) method, Nearest Neighbourhood with First-Order
Linear Interpolation (NN+FOL) method, Non-Linear Least Squares Regression
(NLLSR) method, and Linear Least Squares Regression (LSR) method. It is shown
that LSR method to perform better than the rest. Then, Support Vector Machines
(SVM) and Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) are tested by pairing it with LSR.
In this test, the Optimizable GPR model shows the highest accuracy and it
stands as the most effective solution for NV estimation. Combining these
results lead to the proposed Adaptive Optimizable Gaussian Process Regression
Linear Least Squares Regression (AO-GPRLLSR) Filtering pipeline. The AO-GPRLLSR
method generated an estimated noise variance which served as input to NV-guided
Wiener filter for improving the quality of SEM images. The proposed method is
shown to achieve notable success in estimating SNR and NV of SEM images and
leads to lower Mean Squared Error (MSE) after the filtering process.

*Chongmyung Kwon,Yujin Kim,Seoeun Park,Yunji Lee,Charmgil Hong*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes a novel framework named MMM, utilizing quantum-chemical information to improve drug-drug interaction (DDI) prediction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to overcome the limitations of simplified drug representations in machine learning models, which struggle to fully capture molecular binding affinity and reactivity, leading to risks in drug-drug interactions.

Method: The proposed MMM framework integrates 3D quantum-chemical information using Molecular Electron Localization Function (ELF) maps, combining it with a bipartite graph encoder to represent both global electronic properties and local substructure interactions.

Result: MMM outperforms baseline models including the GNN-based SafeDrug with statistically significant improvements in metrics like F1-score, Jaccard, and DDI rate using the MIMIC-III dataset.

Conclusion: Incorporating quantum-chemical ELF-based 3D representations can enhance the accuracy of drug interaction predictions and improve safety in clinical drug prescribing practices.

Abstract: Drug recommendation is an essential task in machine learning-based clinical
decision support systems. However, the risk of drug-drug interactions (DDI)
between co-prescribed medications remains a significant challenge. Previous
studies have used graph neural networks (GNNs) to represent drug structures.
Regardless, their simplified discrete forms cannot fully capture the molecular
binding affinity and reactivity. Therefore, we propose Multimodal DDI
Prediction with Molecular Electron Localization Function (ELF) Maps (MMM), a
novel framework that integrates three-dimensional (3D) quantum-chemical
information into drug representation learning. It generates 3D electron density
maps using the ELF. To capture both therapeutic relevance and interaction
risks, MMM combines ELF-derived features that encode global electronic
properties with a bipartite graph encoder that models local substructure
interactions. This design enables learning complementary characteristics of
drug molecules. We evaluate MMM in the MIMIC-III dataset (250 drugs, 442
substructures), comparing it with several baseline models. In particular, a
comparison with the GNN-based SafeDrug model demonstrates statistically
significant improvements in the F1-score (p = 0.0387), Jaccard (p = 0.0112),
and the DDI rate (p = 0.0386). These results demonstrate the potential of
ELF-based 3D representations to enhance prediction accuracy and support safer
combinatorial drug prescribing in clinical practice.

### [349] [Synergy Between the Strong and the Weak: Spiking Neural Networks are Inherently Self-Distillers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07924)
*Yongqi Ding,Lin Zuo,Mengmeng Jing,Kunshan Yang,Pei He,Tonglan Xie*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes efficient self-distillation schemes for spiking neural networks (SNNs) by leveraging their temporal properties to improve performance and robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Spiking neural networks (SNNs) are seen as energy-efficient alternatives to artificial neural networks (ANNs), but their performance often lags behind. The authors aimed to address this gap without relying on large teacher models or heavy training overhead, as seen in prior knowledge distillation approaches.

Method: The authors deconstruct SNNs into submodels corresponding to each timestep instance and evaluate their output confidence levels. They propose two self-distillation schemes: (1) 'Strong2Weak,' where stronger timestep instances guide weaker ones, and (2) 'Weak2Strong,' where weaker instances distill knowledge to stronger ones. These schemes are implemented through ensemble, simultaneous, and cascade methods.

Result: The proposed self-distillation methods significantly improve the discriminability, overall performance, and adversarial robustness of SNNs compared to baseline methods.

Conclusion: By exploiting the temporal properties of SNNs, the paper introduces effective and efficient training approaches for SNNs, advancing their potential as low-power, high-performance alternatives to traditional neural networks.

Abstract: Brain-inspired spiking neural networks (SNNs) promise to be a low-power
alternative to computationally intensive artificial neural networks (ANNs),
although performance gaps persist. Recent studies have improved the performance
of SNNs through knowledge distillation, but rely on large teacher models or
introduce additional training overhead. In this paper, we show that SNNs can be
naturally deconstructed into multiple submodels for efficient
self-distillation. We treat each timestep instance of the SNN as a submodel and
evaluate its output confidence, thus efficiently identifying the strong and the
weak. Based on this strong and weak relationship, we propose two efficient
self-distillation schemes: (1) \textbf{Strong2Weak}: During training, the
stronger "teacher" guides the weaker "student", effectively improving overall
performance. (2) \textbf{Weak2Strong}: The weak serve as the "teacher",
distilling the strong in reverse with underlying dark knowledge, again yielding
significant performance gains. For both distillation schemes, we offer flexible
implementations such as ensemble, simultaneous, and cascade distillation.
Experiments show that our method effectively improves the discriminability and
overall performance of the SNN, while its adversarial robustness is also
enhanced, benefiting from the stability brought by self-distillation. This
ingeniously exploits the temporal properties of SNNs and provides insight into
how to efficiently train high-performance SNNs.

*Alexander Rubinstein,Benjamin Raible,Martin Gubri,Seong Joon Oh*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DISCO presents a simple method for selecting samples based on inter-model disagreement, offering optimal performance predictions under computational constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address the challenge of costly evaluations for modern machine learning models, which limit accessibility, slow innovation, and increase environmental impact.

Method: The DISCO method selects samples based on maximum model disagreements using greedy, sample-wise statistics rather than complex global clustering.

Result: DISCO achieves state-of-the-art performance prediction across benchmarks such as MMLU, Hellaswag, Winogrande, and ARC.

Conclusion: Promoting response diversity and simplifying evaluation methods with DISCO can effectively sidestep the computational expense, making machine learning benchmarking more efficient and accessible.

Abstract: Evaluating modern machine learning models has become prohibitively expensive.
Benchmarks such as LMMs-Eval and HELM demand thousands of GPU hours per model.
Costly evaluation reduces inclusivity, slows the cycle of innovation, and
worsens environmental impact. The typical approach follows two steps. First,
select an anchor subset of data. Second, train a mapping from the accuracy on
this subset to the final test result. The drawback is that anchor selection
depends on clustering, which can be complex and sensitive to design choices. We
argue that promoting diversity among samples is not essential; what matters is
to select samples that $\textit{maximise diversity in model responses}$. Our
method, $\textbf{Diversifying Sample Condensation (DISCO)}$, selects the top-k
samples with the greatest model disagreements. This uses greedy, sample-wise
statistics rather than global clustering. The approach is conceptually simpler.
From a theoretical view, inter-model disagreement provides an
information-theoretically optimal rule for such greedy selection.
$\textbf{DISCO}$ shows empirical gains over prior methods, achieving
state-of-the-art results in performance prediction across MMLU, Hellaswag,
Winogrande, and ARC. Code is available here:

### [351] [PRESCRIBE: Predicting Single-Cell Responses with Bayesian Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07964)
*Jiabei Cheng,Changxi Chi,Jingbo Zhou,Hongyi Xin,Jun Xia*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces PRESCRIBE, a Bayesian-based approach for evaluating the reliability of single-cell gene perturbation predictions, showing improved prediction accuracy and confidence score correlation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Single-cell gene perturbation predictions require reliable estimations of the effects of unseen gene perturbations, which is currently limited by epistemic and aleatoric uncertainties.

Method: The authors propose PRESCRIBE, a multivariate deep evidential regression framework that jointly estimates epistemic and aleatoric uncertainties to provide confidence scores for predictions.

Result: PRESCRIBE effectively correlates confidence scores with empirical accuracy and demonstrates over 3% steady accuracy improvement compared to baseline models.

Conclusion: By enabling the filtering of untrustworthy results, PRESCRIBE offers a robust approach for improving the reliability of single-cell perturbation predictions, addressing both data and model uncertainties.

Abstract: In single-cell perturbation prediction, a central task is to forecast the
effects of perturbing a gene unseen in the training data. The efficacy of such
predictions depends on two factors: (1) the similarity of the target gene to
those covered in the training data, which informs model (epistemic)
uncertainty, and (2) the quality of the corresponding training data, which
reflects data (aleatoric) uncertainty. Both factors are critical for
determining the reliability of a prediction, particularly as gene perturbation
is an inherently stochastic biochemical process. In this paper, we propose
PRESCRIBE (PREdicting Single-Cell Response wIth Bayesian Estimation), a
multivariate deep evidential regression framework designed to measure both
sources of uncertainty jointly. Our analysis demonstrates that PRESCRIBE
effectively estimates a confidence score for each prediction, which strongly
correlates with its empirical accuracy. This capability enables the filtering
of untrustworthy results, and in our experiments, it achieves steady accuracy
improvements of over 3% compared to comparable baselines.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a multi-agent reinforcement learning framework utilizing a highly-efficient climate model surrogate that enables fast policy training for climate policies involving multiple greenhouse gases.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Climate policy modeling often involves computationally intensive climate simulations, challenging their integration with reinforcement learning frameworks. This paper aims to address this inefficiency.

Method: Developed a surrogate climate model using a pretrained recurrent neural network on 20,000 multi-gas emission pathways, achieving near-simulator accuracy and integrating it into a reinforcement learning environment.

Result: The surrogate model accelerates training by over 100 times while maintaining high accuracy (global-mean temperature RMSE of ~0.0004 K) and enables multi-agent experiments on climate policies.

Conclusion: The framework significantly reduces computational bottlenecks without sacrificing fidelity, facilitating high-fidelity experiments on alternative climate policy regimes and multi-gas dynamics.

Abstract: Climate policy studies require models that capture the combined effects of
multiple greenhouse gases on global temperature, but these models are
computationally expensive and difficult to embed in reinforcement learning. We
present a multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) framework that integrates a
high-fidelity, highly efficient climate surrogate directly in the environment
loop, enabling regional agents to learn climate policies under multi-gas
dynamics. As a proof of concept, we introduce a recurrent neural network
architecture pretrained on ($20{,}000$) multi-gas emission pathways to
surrogate the climate model CICERO-SCM. The surrogate model attains
near-simulator accuracy with global-mean temperature RMSE $\approx 0.0004
\mathrm{K}$ and approximately $1000\times$ faster one-step inference. When
substituted for the original simulator in a climate-policy MARL setting, it
accelerates end-to-end training by $>\!100\times$. We show that the surrogate
and simulator converge to the same optimal policies and propose a methodology
to assess this property in cases where using the simulator is intractable. Our
work allows to bypass the core computational bottleneck without sacrificing
policy fidelity, enabling large-scale multi-agent experiments across
alternative climate-policy regimes with multi-gas dynamics and high-fidelity
climate response.

*Qinglun Li,Yingqi Liu,Miao Zhang,Xiaochun Cao,Quanjun Yin,Li Shen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper focuses on addressing performance gaps between decentralized and centralized training methods through a deeper theoretical examination of Multi-Gossip Steps (MGS).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Decentralized training is communication-efficient but suffers from lower performance compared to centralized training. The aim is to understand the role and effectiveness of Multi-Gossip Steps (MGS) in bridging this gap.

Method: The authors use stability analysis to derive upper bounds on generalization error and excess error of MGS under non-convex settings without assuming bounded gradients.

Result: The analysis shows that MGS exponentially reduces optimization error, tightening the generalization error bound, but a non-negligible gap in generalization error persists compared to centralized methods.

Conclusion: MGS is effective for narrowing the performance gap between decentralized and centralized training but cannot fully eliminate it. The study also identifies key factors affecting its performance in decentralized training and validates its findings experimentally on CIFAR datasets.

Abstract: Decentralized training removes the centralized server, making it a
communication-efficient approach that can significantly improve training
efficiency, but it often suffers from degraded performance compared to
centralized training. Multi-Gossip Steps (MGS) serve as a simple yet effective
bridge between decentralized and centralized training, significantly reducing
experiment performance gaps. However, the theoretical reasons for its
effectiveness and whether this gap can be fully eliminated by MGS remain open
questions. In this paper, we derive upper bounds on the generalization error
and excess error of MGS using stability analysis, systematically answering
these two key questions. 1). Optimization Error Reduction: MGS reduces the
optimization error bound at an exponential rate, thereby exponentially
tightening the generalization error bound and enabling convergence to better
solutions. 2). Gap to Centralization: Even as MGS approaches infinity, a
non-negligible gap in generalization error remains compared to centralized
mini-batch SGD ($\mathcal{O}(T^{\frac{c\beta}{c\beta +1}}/{n m})$ in
centralized and $\mathcal{O}(T^{\frac{2c\beta}{2c\beta +2}}/{n
m^{\frac{1}{2c\beta +2}}})$ in decentralized). Furthermore, we provide the
first unified analysis of how factors like learning rate, data heterogeneity,
node count, per-node sample size, and communication topology impact the
generalization of MGS under non-convex settings without the bounded gradients
assumption, filling a critical theoretical gap in decentralized training.
Finally, promising experiments on CIFAR datasets support our theoretical
findings.

*Kazuki Egashira,Robin Staab,Thibaud Gloaguen,Mark Vero,Martin Vechev*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Modern model pruning methods for large language models can be exploited maliciously, allowing adversaries to intentionally introduce harmful behaviors into pruned models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate the overlooked security risks associated with LLM pruning methods and demonstrate their potential exploitation.

Method: The attackers identify parameters least likely to be pruned and inject malicious behaviors into them while using likely-to-be-pruned parameters to 'mask' these behaviors in the original unpruned model.

Result: Extensive testing shows that pruned models consistently exhibit strong malicious behaviors, with high success rates for jailbreak, benign instruction refusal, and targeted content injection.

Conclusion: Model pruning introduces a security vulnerability at deployment time, highlighting the need for stronger security measures in model compression techniques.

Abstract: Model pruning, i.e., removing a subset of model weights, has become a
prominent approach to reducing the memory footprint of large language models
(LLMs) during inference. Notably, popular inference engines, such as vLLM,
enable users to conveniently prune downloaded models before they are deployed.
While the utility and efficiency of pruning methods have improved
significantly, the security implications of pruning remain underexplored. In
this work, for the first time, we show that modern LLM pruning methods can be
maliciously exploited. In particular, an adversary can construct a model that
appears benign yet, once pruned, exhibits malicious behaviors. Our method is
based on the idea that the adversary can compute a proxy metric that estimates
how likely each parameter is to be pruned. With this information, the adversary
can first inject a malicious behavior into those parameters that are unlikely
to be pruned. Then, they can repair the model by using parameters that are
likely to be pruned, effectively canceling out the injected behavior in the
unpruned model. We demonstrate the severity of our attack through extensive
evaluation on five models; after any of the pruning in vLLM are applied
(Magnitude, Wanda, and SparseGPT), it consistently exhibits strong malicious
behaviors in a diverse set of attack scenarios (success rates of up to $95.7\%$
for jailbreak, $98.7\%$ for benign instruction refusal, and $99.5\%$ for
targeted content injection). Our results reveal a critical deployment-time
security gap and underscore the urgent need for stronger security awareness in
model compression.

Method: It introduces an orthogonal growth method, using interpositional layer copying for depth growth and expert duplication with injected noise for width growth, applied to Mixture-of-Experts models.

Result: Experiments on models with 70B parameters and over 1T tokens show a 10.66% accuracy improvement over training from scratch under an equivalent compute budget.

Conclusion: Checkpoint recycling is an economically efficient strategy, significantly enhancing performance while reusing prior computational investments.

Abstract: The rapidly increasing computational cost of pretraining Large Language
Models necessitates more efficient approaches. Numerous computational costs
have been invested in existing well-trained checkpoints, but many of them
remain underutilized due to engineering constraints or limited model capacity.
To efficiently reuse this "sunk" cost, we propose to recycle pretrained
checkpoints by expanding their parameter counts and continuing training. We
propose orthogonal growth method well-suited for converged Mixture-of-Experts
model: interpositional layer copying for depth growth and expert duplication
with injected noise for width growth. To determine the optimal timing for such
growth across checkpoints sequences, we perform comprehensive scaling
experiments revealing that the final accuracy has a strong positive correlation
with the amount of sunk cost, indicating that greater prior investment leads to
better performance. We scale our approach to models with 70B parameters and
over 1T training tokens, achieving 10.66% accuracy gain over training from
scratch under the same additional compute budget. Our checkpoint recycling
approach establishes a foundation for economically efficient large language
model pretraining.

*Binbin Huang,Luo Luo,Yanghua Xiao,Deqing Yang,Baojian Zhou*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper presents a novel framework using nested evolving set processes to improve Personalized PageRank (PPR) computation, achieving high efficiency with reduced time complexity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the inefficiency and high computational cost associated with existing methods for Personalized PageRank (PPR) computation on large graphs.

Method: The authors propose a framework leveraging nested evolving set processes, combined with localized inexact proximal point iteration, to solve simplified linear systems for fast PPR computation.

Result: The method achieves a time complexity of $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}\left(R^2 / (\sqrt{\alpha}\epsilon^2)\right)$ under specific conditions, providing an efficient, size-independent algorithm. Experimental results on real-world graphs confirm its rapid early-stage convergence.

Conclusion: The framework resolves an open conjecture in the field and demonstrates significant improvements in PPR computation efficiency, making it suitable for large-scale graph applications.

Abstract: This work proposes a novel framework based on nested evolving set processes
to accelerate Personalized PageRank (PPR) computation. At each stage of the
process, we employ a localized inexact proximal point iteration to solve a
simplified linear system. We show that the time complexity of such localized
methods is upper bounded by $\min\{\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(R^2/\epsilon^2),
\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(m)\}$ to obtain an $\epsilon$-approximation of the PPR
vector, where $m$ denotes the number of edges in the graph and $R$ is a
constant defined via nested evolving set processes. Furthermore, the algorithms
induced by our framework require solving only
$\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(1/\sqrt{\alpha})$ such linear systems, where $\alpha$ is
the damping factor. When $1/\epsilon^2\ll m$, this implies the existence of an
algorithm that computes an $\ epsilon $-approximation of the PPR vector with an
overall time complexity of $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}\left(R^2 /
(\sqrt{\alpha}\epsilon^2)\right)$, independent of the underlying graph size.
Our result resolves an open conjecture from existing literature. Experimental
results on real-world graphs validate the efficiency of our methods,
demonstrating significant convergence in the early stages.

### [358] [Unsupervised Radio Map Construction in Mixed LoS/NLoS Indoor Environments](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08015)
*Zheng Xing,Junting Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces a hidden Markov model (HMM)-based framework to create precise radio maps for localization and wireless communications without relying on location-labeled CSI data, achieving superior accuracy even in challenging indoor conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional methods for radio map construction require costly location calibration processes and manual data collection, which limits scalability and usability. Eliminating these steps could simplify the process while improving accuracy and accessibility.

Method: The paper uses an HMM-based framework that models channel propagation matrices and location trajectories. MIMO networks are analyzed in terms of power, delay, and angle, with distinct modeling for LOS and NLOS conditions. Simultaneous optimization covers propagation parameters, mobility models, and LOS/NLOS classification.

Result: Experimental results with simulated indoor networks show an average localization accuracy of 0.65 meters, outperforming conventional supervised methods like KNN, SVM, and DNN models in both LOS and NLOS conditions.

Conclusion: The proposed approach demonstrates its potential as a cost-effective and highly accurate solution for constructing radio maps and enhanced indoor localization, addressing challenges in both LOS and NLOS environments without requiring extensive calibration processes.

Abstract: Radio maps are essential for enhancing wireless communications and
localization. However, existing methods for constructing radio maps typically
require costly calibration processes to collect location-labeled channel state
information (CSI) datasets. This paper aims to recover the data collection
trajectory directly from the channel propagation sequence, eliminating the need
for location calibration. The key idea is to employ a hidden Markov model
(HMM)-based framework to conditionally model the channel propagation matrix,
while simultaneously modeling the location correlation in the trajectory. The
primary challenges involve modeling the complex relationship between channel
propagation in multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) networks and geographical
locations, and addressing both line-of-sight (LOS) and non-line-of-sight (NLOS)
indoor conditions. In this paper, we propose an HMM-based framework that
jointly characterizes the conditional propagation model and the evolution of
the user trajectory. Specifically, the channel propagation in MIMO networks is
modeled separately in terms of power, delay, and angle, with distinct models
for LOS and NLOS conditions. The user trajectory is modeled using a
Gaussian-Markov model. The parameters for channel propagation, the mobility
model, and LOS/NLOS classification are optimized simultaneously. Experimental
validation using simulated MIMO-Orthogonal Frequency-Division Multiplexing
(OFDM) networks with a multi-antenna uniform linear arrays (ULA) configuration
demonstrates that the proposed method achieves an average localization accuracy
of 0.65 meters in an indoor environment, covering both LOS and NLOS regions.
Moreover, the constructed radio map enables localization with a reduced error
compared to conventional supervised methods, such as k-nearest neighbors (KNN),
support vector machine (SVM), and deep neural network (DNN).

### [359] [Backdoor Vectors: a Task Arithmetic View on Backdoor Attacks and Defenses](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08016)
*Stanisław Pawlak,Jan Dubiński,Daniel Marczak,Bartłomiej Twardowski*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper addresses security vulnerabilities in model merging, presenting the concept of "Backdoor Vector" as a tool to understand backdoor attacks and proposing novel strategies like "Sparse Backdoor Vectors" and "Injection BV Subtraction" for both enhancing and defending against such attacks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address the significant security risks posed by backdoor attacks in model merging, an emerging technique for combining large deep learning models.

Method: They introduce the concept of "Backdoor Vectors" by calculating the weight difference between a clean model and a backdoored model, enabling insights into attack characteristics. They also develop "Sparse Backdoor Vectors" to enhance attack resilience and "Injection BV Subtraction" to defend against backdoor threats.

Result: The results exhibit that Sparse Backdoor Vectors improve backdoor effectiveness when leveraging model merging. Meanwhile, Injection BV Subtraction acts as an efficient defense mechanism, successfully mitigating backdoor threats even in unknown contexts.

Conclusion: The study concludes that understanding and manipulating backdoor vectors can lead to stronger defenses and more effective attacks in model merging, paving the way for secure implementations of this technique.

Abstract: Model merging (MM) recently emerged as an effective method for combining
large deep learning models. However, it poses significant security risks.
Recent research shows that it is highly susceptible to backdoor attacks, which
introduce a hidden trigger into a single fine-tuned model instance that allows
the adversary to control the output of the final merged model at inference
time. In this work, we propose a simple framework for understanding backdoor
attacks by treating the attack itself as a task vector. $Backdoor\ Vector\
(BV)$ is calculated as the difference between the weights of a fine-tuned
backdoored model and fine-tuned clean model. BVs reveal new insights into
attacks understanding and a more effective framework to measure their
similarity and transferability. Furthermore, we propose a novel method that
enhances backdoor resilience through merging dubbed $Sparse\ Backdoor\ Vector\
(SBV)$ that combines multiple attacks into a single one. We identify the core
vulnerability behind backdoor threats in MM: $inherent\ triggers$ that exploit
adversarial weaknesses in the base model. To counter this, we propose
$Injection\ BV\ Subtraction\ (IBVS)$ - an assumption-free defense against
backdoors in MM. Our results show that SBVs surpass prior attacks and is the
first method to leverage merging to improve backdoor effectiveness. At the same
time, IBVS provides a lightweight, general defense that remains effective even
when the backdoor threat is entirely unknown.

### [360] [Do We Really Need Permutations? Impact of Width Expansion on Linear Mode Connectivity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08023)
*Akira Ito,Masanori Yamada,Daiki Chijiwa,Atsutoshi Kumagai*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper finds that widening neural network models alone enables linear mode connectivity (LMC) without parameter permutations, when combined with appropriate softmax temperature calibration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding and simplifying how deep neural networks can share information or blend parameters, especially for linear mode connectivity, which has implications for model training and ensembling.

Method: The study empirically demonstrates that simply widening neural network models, alongside using a softmax temperature calibration, allows for LMC. It introduces a concept called layerwise exponentially weighted connectivity (LEWC) to explain this phenomenon.

Result: The findings show that sufficient model widening, combined with temperature calibration, eliminates the need for parameter permutations while achieving LMC. The LEWC analysis confirms that the merged models behave like ensembles of the originals.

Conclusion: Widened models inherently facilitate LMC through their architecture and output behavior, challenging prior assumptions that permutations are a necessity. The results expand our understanding of connectivity between models.

Abstract: Recently, Ainsworth et al. empirically demonstrated that, given two
independently trained models, applying a parameter permutation that preserves
the input-output behavior allows the two models to be connected by a low-loss
linear path. When such a path exists, the models are said to achieve linear
mode connectivity (LMC). Prior studies, including Ainsworth et al., have
reported that achieving LMC requires not only an appropriate permutation search
but also sufficiently wide models (e.g., a 32 $\times$ width multiplier for
ResNet-20). This is broadly believed to be because increasing the model width
ensures a large enough space of candidate permutations, increasing the chance
of finding one that yields LMC. In this work, we empirically demonstrate that,
even without any permutations, simply widening the models is sufficient for
achieving LMC when using a suitable softmax temperature calibration. We further
explain why this phenomenon arises by analyzing intermediate layer outputs.
Specifically, we introduce layerwise exponentially weighted connectivity
(LEWC), which states that the output of each layer of the merged model can be
represented as an exponentially weighted sum of the outputs of the
corresponding layers of the original models. Consequently the merged model's
output matches that of an ensemble of the original models, which facilitates
LMC. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first to show that widening
the model not only facilitates nonlinear mode connectivity, as suggested in
prior research, but also significantly increases the possibility of achieving
linear mode connectivity.

*Timon Klein,Piotr Minakowski,Sebastian Sager*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Subject-Conditioned Layer, a neural network component designed to handle subject-specific differences in EEG data, improving model robustness and performance across subjects.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Subject-specific distribution shifts hinder the development of robust foundation models for EEG decoding.

Method: The Subject-Conditioned Layer adapts to subject-specific variability by decomposing weights into shared (subject-invariant) and low-rank (subject-specific) components. It functions as a replacement for standard layers in neural networks.

Result: Models equipped with the Subject-Conditioned Layer outperform both subject-agnostic models and individually trained subject-specific models in EEG tasks.

Conclusion: The Subject-Conditioned Layer enables scalable and effective development of cross-subject foundation models for EEG decoding by enhancing adaptability and robustness to subject shifts.

Abstract: Subject-specific distribution shifts represent an important obstacle to the
development of foundation models for EEG decoding. To address this, we propose
Subject-Conditioned Layer,, an adaptive layer designed as a drop-in replacement
for standard linear or convolutional layers in any neural network architecture.
Our layer captures subject-specific variability by decomposing its weights into
a shared, subject-invariant component and a lightweight, low-rank correction
unique to each subject. This explicit separation of general knowledge from
personalized adaptation allows existing models to become robust to subject
shifts. Empirically, models equipped with our layer outperform both a
shared-weight-only model (subject-agnostic model) and the average of
individually trained subject-specific models. Consequently, the
Subject-Conditioned Layer, offers a practical and scalable path towards
building effective cross-subject foundation models for EEG.

*Daniel Jarne Ornia,Joel Dyer,Nicholas Bishop,Anisoara Calinescu,Michael Wooldridge*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper studies how learning agents should incorporate expert data in Bayesian multi-armed bandits, addressing both offline and simultaneous learning settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to understand how learners should optimally use expert data, which may differ in structure from their own experiences, to improve learning outcomes.

Method: The authors formalize the influence of expert data on learners' posteriors, derive regret bounds using mutual information, propose an information-directed rule for data source selection, and strategies for deciding when to trust expert data.

Result: Pretraining on expert data tightens regret bounds, and an information-directed rule optimally selects when to learn from expert or one's own experience.

Conclusion: The paper provides a framework quantifying the value of expert data, enabling intelligent decision-making on when agents should learn from others or rely on their own data.

Abstract: Complex learning agents are increasingly deployed alongside existing experts,
such as human operators or previously trained agents. However, it remains
unclear how should learners optimally incorporate certain forms of expert data,
which may differ in structure from the learner's own action-outcome
experiences. We study this problem in the context of Bayesian multi-armed
bandits, considering: (i) offline settings, where the learner receives a
dataset of outcomes from the expert's optimal policy before interaction, and
(ii) simultaneous settings, where the learner must choose at each step whether
to update its beliefs based on its own experience, or based on the outcome
simultaneously achieved by an expert. We formalize how expert data influences
the learner's posterior, and prove that pretraining on expert outcomes tightens
information-theoretic regret bounds by the mutual information between the
expert data and the optimal action. For the simultaneous setting, we propose an
information-directed rule where the learner processes the data source that
maximizes their one-step information gain about the optimal action. Finally, we
propose strategies for how the learner can infer when to trust the expert and
when not to, safeguarding the learner for the cases where the expert is
ineffective or compromised. By quantifying the value of expert data, our
framework provides practical, information-theoretic algorithms for agents to
intelligently decide when to learn from others.

### [363] [Approximate Domain Unlearning for Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08132)
*Kodai Kawamura,Yuta Goto,Rintaro Yanagi,Hirokatsu Kataoka,Go Irie*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Approximate Domain Unlearning (ADU), an approach to selectively reduce recognition accuracy for specified domains while preserving accuracy in others, addressing limitations in class unlearning methods for vision-language models (VLMs).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need arises from concerns about computational efficiency and information leakage in pre-trained VLMs, especially in situations requiring selective domain recognition, such as autonomous driving.

Method: The authors propose a novel approach for ADU that disentangles domain distributions in the feature space and adaptively captures instance-specific domain information, overcoming challenges posed by VLMs' strong domain generalization capabilities.

Result: Experiments demonstrate that the proposed method surpasses baseline techniques for VLM tuning, achieving effective and fine-grained domain-specific unlearning.

Conclusion: This study advances methodologies for selective domain recognition, enabling safer and more targeted applications of VLMs while maintaining their accuracy in relevant tasks.

Abstract: Pre-trained Vision-Language Models (VLMs) exhibit strong generalization
capabilities, enabling them to recognize a wide range of objects across diverse
domains without additional training. However, they often retain irrelevant
information beyond the requirements of specific downstream tasks, raising
concerns about computational efficiency and potential information leakage. This
has motivated growing interest in approximate unlearning, which aims to
selectively remove unnecessary knowledge while preserving overall model
performance. Existing approaches to approximate unlearning have primarily
focused on class unlearning, where a VLM is retrained to fail to recognize
specified object classes while maintaining accuracy for others. However, merely
forgetting object classes is often insufficient in practical applications. For
instance, an autonomous driving system should accurately recognize real cars
while avoiding misrecognition of illustrated cars depicted in roadside
advertisements as real cars, which could be hazardous. In this paper, we
introduce Approximate Domain Unlearning (ADU), a novel problem setting that
requires reducing recognition accuracy for images from specified domains (e.g.,
illustration) while preserving accuracy for other domains (e.g., real). ADU
presents new technical challenges: due to the strong domain generalization
capability of pre-trained VLMs, domain distributions are highly entangled in
the feature space, making naive approaches based on penalizing target domains
ineffective. To tackle this limitation, we propose a novel approach that
explicitly disentangles domain distributions and adaptively captures
instance-specific domain information. Extensive experiments show that our
approach outperforms baselines built upon VLM tuning techniques, paving the way
for practical and fine-grained unlearning in VLMs. Code:

### [364] [Arbitrary Entropy Policy Optimization: Entropy Is Controllable in Reinforcement Finetuning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08141)
*Chen Wang,Zhaochun Li,Jionghao Bai,Yuzhi Zhang,Shisheng Cui,Zhou Zhao,Yue Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Arbitrary Entropy Policy Optimization (AEPO) to fix entropy collapse in reinforcement finetuning for large language models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for reinforcement finetuning suffer from entropy collapse—it limits exploration and prematurely converges policies, impacting model reasoning capabilities.

Method: AEPO uses temperature-adjusted distributions for policy gradient regularization, stabilizing entropy and eliminating its collapse while maintaining precise entropy control.

Result: AEPO stabilizes entropy at desired levels, removes collapse in GRPO, clarifies the entropy-performance relationship, and generalizes the paradigm for broader optimization.

Conclusion: AEPO offers a robust solution to entropy collapse, enhancing exploration and reasoning quality in reinforcement finetuning while expanding general optimization approaches.

Abstract: Reinforcement finetuning (RFT) is essential for enhancing the reasoning
capabilities of large language models (LLM), yet the widely adopted Group
Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) suffers from entropy collapse, where
entropy monotonically decreases, exploration vanishes, and policies converge
prematurely. Existing entropy-regularized methods only partially alleviate this
issue while introducing bias and instability, leaving entropy control
unresolved and the connection between entropy, exploration, and performance
unclear. We propose Arbitrary Entropy Policy Optimization (AEPO), which
eliminates entropy collapse by replacing entropy bonuses with REINFORCE policy
gradient on temperature-adjusted distributions and stabilizing entropy through
temperature regulation. AEPO integrates three key designs: policy gradient as
regularization, distribution as regularization, and REINFORCE as
regularization, enabling precise entropy control without distorting
optimization. Experiments demonstrate three major contributions: AEPO (1)
stabilizes entropy at arbitrary target levels, effectively removing collapse in
GRPO; (2) reveals a non-monotonic relation where performance first improves
then declines with increasing entropy, clarifying the link between entropy,
exploration, and reasoning; and (3) generalizes beyond entropy, providing a
broader RFT paradigm where superior target distributions can serve as REINFORCE
regularizers.

*Aman Sharma,Paras Chopra*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This study introduces an entropy-based framework to reduce computational costs in reasoning tasks for large language models, achieving 25-50% efficiency while preserving accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address token inefficiency in reasoning tasks by leveraging emergent confidence signals in advanced post-trained models.

Method: Uses Shannon entropy derived from token-level log probabilities as a confidence signal to enable early stopping during model reasoning.

Result: Achieved consistent computational savings (25-50%) while maintaining task accuracy, showcasing the presence of emergent confidence awareness in advanced models.

Conclusion: Entropy-based confidence mechanisms are a distinctive feature in modern post-trained reasoning models and can be effectively utilized to optimize efficiency and latency.

Abstract: We introduce a simple, yet novel entropy-based framework to drive token
efficiency in large language models during reasoning tasks. Our approach uses
Shannon entropy from token-level logprobs as a confidence signal to enable
early stopping, achieving 25-50% computational savings while maintaining task
accuracy. Crucially, we demonstrate that entropy-based confidence calibration
represents an emergent property of advanced post-training optimization present
in modern reasoning models but notably absent in standard instruction-tuned and
pre-trained models (Llama 3.3 70B). We show that the entropy threshold to stop
reasoning varies from model to model but can be calculated easily in one shot
using only a few examples from existing reasoning datasets. Our results
indicate that advanced reasoning models often know that they've gotten a
correct answer early on, and that this emergent confidence awareness can be
exploited to save tokens and reduce latency. The framework demonstrates
consistent performance across reasoning-optimized model families with 25-50%
computational cost reduction while preserving accuracy, revealing that
confidence mechanisms represent a distinguishing characteristic of modern
post-trained reasoning systems versus their predecessors.

*Larissa Reichart,Cem Ata Baykara,Ali Burak Ünal,Mete Akgün,Harlin Lee*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes GALA, a scalable federated framework for unsupervised multi-source domain adaptation, suitable for scenarios with numerous heterogeneous domains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing UMDA methods struggle with scalability and performance stability as the number of diverse source domains increases, and there is a need to address this limitation efficiently.

Method: The paper introduces GALA, which includes an inter-group discrepancy minimization objective for efficient domain alignment and a temperature-controlled weighting strategy for prioritizing relevant source domains.

Result: Experiments demonstrate GALA achieves competitive or state-of-the-art performance across benchmarks and excels in diverse multi-source environments where other methods fail.

Conclusion: GALA is a robust and scalable framework for UMDA that effectively addresses challenges of high domain diversity and achieves superior performance in challenging settings.

Abstract: Unsupervised multi-source domain adaptation (UMDA) aims to learn models that
generalize to an unlabeled target domain by leveraging labeled data from
multiple, diverse source domains. While distributed UMDA methods address
privacy constraints by avoiding raw data sharing, existing approaches typically
assume a small number of sources and fail to scale effectively. Increasing the
number of heterogeneous domains often makes existing methods impractical,
leading to high computational overhead or unstable performance. We propose
GALA, a scalable and robust federated UMDA framework that introduces two key
components: (1) a novel inter-group discrepancy minimization objective that
efficiently approximates full pairwise domain alignment without quadratic
computation; and (2) a temperature-controlled, centroid-based weighting
strategy that dynamically prioritizes source domains based on alignment with
the target. Together, these components enable stable and parallelizable
training across large numbers of heterogeneous sources. To evaluate performance
in high-diversity scenarios, we introduce Digit-18, a new benchmark comprising
18 digit datasets with varied synthetic and real-world domain shifts. Extensive
experiments show that GALA consistently achieves competitive or
state-of-the-art results on standard benchmarks and significantly outperforms
prior methods in diverse multi-source settings where others fail to converge.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the potential of mmWave Wi-Fi for person identification due to its finer spatial resolution, as existing work mostly focuses on sub-6 GHz frequencies.

Method: A comparative study using synchronized sub-6 GHz and mmWave datasets with end-to-end deep learning models and consistent training pipelines.

Result: Achieved 91.2% identification accuracy using mmWave Wi-Fi signals for 20 individuals at low sampling rates (10 Hz).

Conclusion: The study highlights the significant potential of mmWave Wi-Fi for accurate person identification, demonstrating its advantages over sub-6 GHz under fair experimental conditions.

Abstract: Person identification plays a vital role in enabling intelligent,
personalized, and secure human-computer interaction. Recent research has
demonstrated the feasibility of leveraging Wi-Fi signals for passive person
identification using a person's unique gait pattern. Although most existing
work focuses on sub-6 GHz frequencies, the emergence of mmWave offers new
opportunities through its finer spatial resolution, though its comparative
advantages for person identification remain unexplored. This work presents the
first comparative study between sub-6 GHz and mmWave Wi-Fi signals for person
identification with commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) Wi-Fi, using a novel
dataset of synchronized measurements from the two frequency bands in an indoor
environment. To ensure a fair comparison, we apply identical training pipelines
and model configurations across both frequency bands. Leveraging end-to-end
deep learning, we show that even at low sampling rates (10 Hz), mmWave Wi-Fi
signals can achieve high identification accuracy (91.2% on 20 individuals) when
combined with effective background subtraction.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a hybrid model combining autoregressive (AR) and non-autoregressive (NAR) approaches to improve biological sequence generation. It outperforms traditional methods by integrating global bidirectional dependencies efficiently.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AR models, commonly used for sequence generation, struggle with capturing bidirectional dependencies crucial for tasks like peptide sequencing and protein modeling. NAR models address this but face coherence and scalability issues.

Method: The hybrid framework uses a shared encoder and two decoders: NAR for learning bidirectional features and AR for sequence synthesis. A cross-decoder attention module enables integration, complemented by a tailored training strategy to balance and stabilize learning.

Result: The hybrid model significantly outperforms AR and NAR baselines on a complex nine-species benchmark for de novo peptide sequencing, showcasing better stability and contextual understanding.

Conclusion: This work advances biological sequence modeling by harmonizing AR stability with NAR's holistic contextual awareness, offering a novel approach to complex sequence generation challenges.

Abstract: Autoregressive (AR) models, common in sequence generation, are limited in
many biological tasks such as de novo peptide sequencing and protein modeling
by their unidirectional nature, failing to capture crucial global bidirectional
token dependencies. Non-Autoregressive (NAR) models offer holistic,
bidirectional representations but face challenges with generative coherence and
scalability. To transcend this, we propose a hybrid framework enhancing AR
generation by dynamically integrating rich contextual information from
non-autoregressive mechanisms. Our approach couples a shared input encoder with
two decoders: a non-autoregressive one learning latent bidirectional biological
features, and an AR decoder synthesizing the biological sequence by leveraging
these bidirectional features. A novel cross-decoder attention module enables
the AR decoder to iteratively query and integrate these bidirectional features,
enriching its predictions. This synergy is cultivated via a tailored training
strategy with importance annealing for balanced objectives and cross-decoder
gradient blocking for stable, focused learning. Evaluations on a demanding
nine-species benchmark of de novo peptide sequencing show that our model
substantially surpasses AR and NAR baselines. It uniquely harmonizes AR
stability with NAR contextual awareness, delivering robust, superior
performance on diverse downstream data. This research advances biological
sequence modeling techniques and contributes a novel architectural paradigm for
augmenting AR models with enhanced bidirectional understanding for complex
sequence generation. Code is available at https://github.com/BEAM-Labs/denovo.

*Jiaan Luo,Feng Hong,Qiang Hu,Xiaofeng Cao,Feng Liu,Jiangchao Yao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper addresses challenges in long-tailed recognition tasks and proposes a new framework, Model Rebalancing (MORE), to mitigate class imbalance by altering parameter space allocation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to overcome challenges in long-tailed recognition, where skewed class distribution affects model generalization, especially for tail classes.

Method: The authors propose a Model Rebalancing (MORE) framework that introduces a low-rank parameter component guided by a tailored loss function and sinusoidal reweighting schedule to rebalance the model without increasing complexity or inference costs.

Result: The framework significantly improves tail-class generalization across long-tailed benchmarks for both multi-label and multi-class tasks, complementing existing imbalance mitigation methods.

Conclusion: MORE provides a robust and efficient solution for class imbalance and can serve as a plug-and-play module in long-tailed scenarios, enhancing existing methodologies.

Abstract: Long-tailed recognition is ubiquitous and challenging in deep learning and
even in the downstream finetuning of foundation models, since the skew class
distribution generally prevents the model generalization to the tail classes.
Despite the promise of previous methods from the perspectives of data
augmentation, loss rebalancing and decoupled training etc., consistent
improvement in the broad scenarios like multi-label long-tailed recognition is
difficult. In this study, we dive into the essential model capacity impact
under long-tailed context, and propose a novel framework, Model Rebalancing
(MORE), which mitigates imbalance by directly rebalancing the model's parameter
space. Specifically, MORE introduces a low-rank parameter component to mediate
the parameter space allocation guided by a tailored loss and sinusoidal
reweighting schedule, but without increasing the overall model complexity or
inference costs. Extensive experiments on diverse long-tailed benchmarks,
spanning multi-class and multi-label tasks, demonstrate that MORE significantly
improves generalization, particularly for tail classes, and effectively
complements existing imbalance mitigation methods. These results highlight
MORE's potential as a robust plug-and-play module in long-tailed settings.

TL;DR: The paper introduces D-SINK, a framework that integrates insights from specialized auxiliary models to address the challenges of class imbalance and label noise in datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Class imbalance and label noise often co-occur in deep learning datasets and hinder model performance. Combining existing methods to tackle both issues is challenging due to conflicting strategies.

Method: The D-SINK framework leverages optimal transport and Sinkhorn distillation to synergistically integrate predictions from two auxiliary models addressing class imbalance and label noise separately.

Result: Experiments on benchmark datasets show that D-SINK significantly enhances robustness and performance in learning from long-tailed noisy data.

Conclusion: D-SINK effectively utilizes complementary strengths of auxiliary models by addressing class imbalance and label noise at different granularities, resulting in improved model robustness.

Abstract: Real-world datasets for deep learning frequently suffer from the co-occurring
challenges of class imbalance and label noise, hindering model performance.
While methods exist for each issue, effectively combining them is non-trivial,
as distinguishing genuine tail samples from noisy data proves difficult, often
leading to conflicting optimization strategies. This paper presents a novel
perspective: instead of primarily developing new complex techniques from
scratch, we explore synergistically leveraging well-established, individually
'weak' auxiliary models - specialized for tackling either class imbalance or
label noise but not both. This view is motivated by the insight that class
imbalance (a distributional-level concern) and label noise (a sample-level
concern) operate at different granularities, suggesting that robustness
mechanisms for each can in principle offer complementary strengths without
conflict. We propose Dual-granularity Sinkhorn Distillation (D-SINK), a novel
framework that enhances dual robustness by distilling and integrating
complementary insights from such 'weak', single-purpose auxiliary models.
Specifically, D-SINK uses an optimal transport-optimized surrogate label
allocation to align the target model's sample-level predictions with a
noise-robust auxiliary and its class distributions with an imbalance-robust
one. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that D-SINK
significantly improves robustness and achieves strong empirical performance in
learning from long-tailed noisy data.

*Justus Viga,Penelope Mueck,Alexander Löser,Torben Weis*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces a new dataset on ship fuel consumption, defines a benchmark for prediction tasks, and evaluates models including the TabPFN foundation model, showing its potential for accurate fuel prediction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fuel consumption and emissions significantly impact economic and environmental factors in the shipping industry, necessitating accurate predictive models for better operational optimization.

Method: The study introduces a new dataset, establishes a benchmark for regression tasks, and explores in-context learning using the TabPFN model for predicting ship fuel consumption under diverse conditions.

Result: Results indicate that data-driven models, especially those considering environmental factors, improve prediction accuracy. The TabPFN model slightly outperforms other methods, and the inclusion of temporal data enhances performance.

Conclusion: The findings underscore the potential of foundation models like TabPFN with in-context learning for improving ship fuel consumption predictions, emphasizing the value of comprehensive datasets and temporal considerations.

Abstract: In the shipping industry, fuel consumption and emissions are critical factors
due to their significant impact on economic efficiency and environmental
sustainability. Accurate prediction of ship fuel consumption is essential for
further optimization of maritime operations. However, heterogeneous
methodologies and limited high-quality datasets hinder direct comparison of
modeling approaches. This paper makes three key contributions: (1) we introduce
and release a new dataset
(https://huggingface.co/datasets/krohnedigital/FuelCast) comprising operational
and environmental data from three ships; (2) we define a standardized benchmark
covering tabular regression and time-series regression (3) we investigate the
application of in-context learning for ship consumption modeling using the
TabPFN foundation model - a first in this domain to our knowledge. Our results
demonstrate strong performance across all evaluated models, supporting the
feasibility of onboard, data-driven fuel prediction. Models incorporating
environmental conditions consistently outperform simple polynomial baselines
relying solely on vessel speed. TabPFN slightly outperforms other techniques,
highlighting the potential of foundation models with in-context learning
capabilities for tabular prediction. Furthermore, including temporal context
improves accuracy.

### [372] [Expressive Value Learning for Scalable Offline Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08218)
*Nicolas Espinosa-Dice,Kiante Brantley,Wen Sun*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces EVOR, a scalable offline RL method leveraging expressive policies and value functions, achieving superior performance by avoiding traditional scalability challenges like BPTT and policy distillation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address RL's scalability issues and unlock its potential in robotics by developing a method that efficiently trains agents on large, diverse datasets without costly interactions.

Method: The EVOR approach integrates expressive Q-value functions, utilizing flow matching for training and rejection sampling for policy extraction during inference, removing the need for distillation or BPTT.

Result: Empirical results demonstrate that EVOR surpasses baseline methods in a variety of offline RL tasks.

Conclusion: EVOR successfully introduces scalable mechanisms for offline RL, advancing its practical applicability through expressive policy and value learning frameworks.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) is a powerful paradigm for learning to make
sequences of decisions. However, RL has yet to be fully leveraged in robotics,
principally due to its lack of scalability. Offline RL offers a promising
avenue by training agents on large, diverse datasets, avoiding the costly
real-world interactions of online RL. Scaling offline RL to increasingly
complex datasets requires expressive generative models such as diffusion and
flow matching. However, existing methods typically depend on either
backpropagation through time (BPTT), which is computationally prohibitive, or
policy distillation, which introduces compounding errors and limits scalability
to larger base policies. In this paper, we consider the question of how to
develop a scalable offline RL approach without relying on distillation or
backpropagation through time. We introduce Expressive Value Learning for
Offline Reinforcement Learning (EVOR): a scalable offline RL approach that
integrates both expressive policies and expressive value functions. EVOR learns
an optimal, regularized Q-function via flow matching during training. At
inference-time, EVOR performs inference-time policy extraction via rejection
sampling against the expressive value function, enabling efficient
optimization, regularization, and compute-scalable search without retraining.
Empirically, we show that EVOR outperforms baselines on a diverse set of
offline RL tasks, demonstrating the benefit of integrating expressive value
learning into offline RL.

### [373] [Post-hoc Stochastic Concept Bottleneck Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08219)
*Wiktor Jan Hoffmann,Sonia Laguna,Moritz Vandenhirtz,Emanuele Palumbo,Julia E. Vogt*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Post-hoc Stochastic Concept Bottleneck Models (PSCBMs), which augment pre-trained Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs) with a multivariate normal distribution to improve performance without retraining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs) by addressing their limitations regarding performance under interventions and the need for retraining when modeling concept dependencies.

Method: The proposed PSCBMs add a small covariance-prediction module to pre-trained CBMs, leveraging a multivariate normal distribution without retraining the backbone model. Authors also propose two novel training strategies.

Result: PSCBMs consistently enhance both concept and target accuracy over standard CBMs and perform much better under interventions while being computationally far more efficient compared to retraining stochastic models.

Conclusion: PSCBMs are a lightweight yet effective solution for improving CBM performance, especially in scenarios where retraining is infeasible, making them practical for real-world applications.

Abstract: Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs) are interpretable models that predict the
target variable through high-level human-understandable concepts, allowing
users to intervene on mispredicted concepts to adjust the final output. While
recent work has shown that modeling dependencies between concepts can improve
CBM performance, especially under interventions, such approaches typically
require retraining the entire model, which may be infeasible when access to the
original data or compute is limited. In this paper, we introduce Post-hoc
Stochastic Concept Bottleneck Models (PSCBMs), a lightweight method that
augments any pre-trained CBM with a multivariate normal distribution over
concepts by adding only a small covariance-prediction module, without
retraining the backbone model. We propose two training strategies and show on
real-world data that PSCBMs consistently match or improve both concept and
target accuracy over standard CBMs at test time. Furthermore, we show that due
to the modeling of concept dependencies, PSCBMs perform much better than CBMs
under interventions, while remaining far more efficient than retraining a
similar stochastic model from scratch.

*Michal Koren,Or Peretz,Tai Dinh,Philip S. Yu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper presents a unified framework called the Uncertainty-Aware Markov Decision Process (UAMDP) to manage uncertainty in high-stakes, dynamic environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of managing uncertainty effectively in volatile and high-stakes scenarios, such as trading and inventory control, where both forecasting and decision-making require increased precision and risk awareness.

Method: The proposed UAMDP framework combines Bayesian forecasting, posterior sampling reinforcement learning, and planning with conditional value-at-risk (CVaR) constraints. The agent utilizes belief updating, Thompson sampling, and policy optimization to achieve its goals.

Result: UAMDP outperforms deep learning baselines in forecasting accuracy (RMSE up to 25% better, sMAPE 32% better) and economic metrics (e.g., higher Sharpe ratio and reduced maximum drawdown in trading).

Conclusion: Integrating probabilistic modeling, uncertainty-driven exploration, and risk-aware control improves long-term decision-making in volatile domains, offering safer and more profitable outcomes.

Abstract: Sequential decisions in volatile, high-stakes settings require more than
maximizing expected return; they require principled uncertainty management.
This paper presents the Uncertainty-Aware Markov Decision Process (UAMDP), a
unified framework that couples Bayesian forecasting, posterior-sampling
reinforcement learning, and planning under a conditional value-at-risk (CVaR)
constraint. In a closed loop, the agent updates its beliefs over latent
dynamics, samples plausible futures via Thompson sampling, and optimizes
policies subject to preset risk tolerances. We establish regret bounds that
converge to the Bayes-optimal benchmark under standard regularity conditions.
We evaluate UAMDP in two domains-high-frequency equity trading and retail
inventory control-both marked by structural uncertainty and economic
volatility. Relative to strong deep learning baselines, UAMDP improves
long-horizon forecasting accuracy (RMSE decreases by up to 25\% and sMAPE by
32\%), and these gains translate into economic performance: the trading Sharpe
ratio rises from 1.54 to 1.74 while maximum drawdown is roughly halved. These
results show that integrating calibrated probabilistic modeling, exploration
aligned with posterior uncertainty, and risk-aware control yields a robust,
generalizable approach to safer and more profitable sequential decision-making.

*Yuchen Zhu,Wei Guo,Jaemoo Choi,Petr Molodyk,Bo Yuan,Molei Tao,Yongxin Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces Distribution Matching Policy Optimization (DMPO), a reinforcement learning technique to enhance reasoning capabilities in diffusion large language models (dLLMs) by aligning their policy distribution to an optimal reward-tilted one.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing diffusion large language models (dLLMs) need reinforcement learning to match the performance of autoregressive language models (AR-LLMs), especially for reasoning tasks. However, appropriately tailored RL algorithms for dLLMs are still missing.

Method: The paper proposes DMPO, a reinforcement learning fine-tuning method that uses cross-entropy optimization to align the dLLM's policy distribution to an optimal reward-based distribution. Additionally, it introduces weight baseline subtraction techniques to address limitations associated with small training batch sizes.

Result: DMPO achieves up to 42.9% accuracy improvement over prior state-of-the-art baselines and 55.8% improvement over the base model in reasoning benchmarks without supervised fine-tuning.

Conclusion: DMPO demonstrates that distribution matching can effectively enhance the reasoning capability of diffusion large language models, offering a significant improvement over existing approaches and base models.

Abstract: Diffusion large language models (dLLMs) are promising alternatives to
autoregressive large language models (AR-LLMs), as they potentially allow
higher inference throughput. Reinforcement learning (RL) is a crucial component
for dLLMs to achieve comparable performance with AR-LLMs on important tasks,
such as reasoning. However, RL algorithms that are well-suited for dLLMs'
unique characteristics have yet to be developed. This paper proposes
Distribution Matching Policy Optimization (DMPO), a principled and
theoretically grounded RL fine-tuning method specifically designed to enhance
the reasoning capabilities of dLLMs by matching the dLLM policy distribution to
the optimal, reward-tilted one through cross-entropy optimization. We identify
a key challenge in the implementation with a small training batch size and
propose several effective solutions through a novel weight baseline subtraction
technique. DMPO exhibits superior performance on multiple reasoning benchmarks
without supervised fine-tuning, with an accuracy improvement of up to $42.9\%$
over previously SOTA baselines and $55.8\%$ over the base model, underscoring
the effectiveness of the distribution matching framework. Our code is available

*Konrad Löhr,Shuzhou Yuan,Michael Färber*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper investigates political biases and stereotype propagation in Large Language Models (LLMs) using the Political Compass Test (PCT), revealing consistent left-leaning bias and notable implicit stereotypes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the political biases in LLMs and prevent their undue influence on public opinion and democratic processes.

Method: The study analyzes eight LLMs using the Political Compass Test, including persona-based and multilingual prompts, to assess inherent political leanings and detect explicit and implicit stereotypes.

Result: All models exhibit consistent left-leaning political alignment. Implicit stereotypes are more pronounced than explicit ones, with significant alignment between the two across models.

Conclusion: This work highlights the nuanced political biases and stereotypes in LLMs, emphasizing the importance of understanding and addressing these aspects.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly integral to information
dissemination and decision-making processes. Given their growing societal
influence, understanding potential biases, particularly within the political
domain, is crucial to prevent undue influence on public opinion and democratic
processes. This work investigates political bias and stereotype propagation
across eight prominent LLMs using the two-dimensional Political Compass Test
(PCT). Initially, the PCT is employed to assess the inherent political leanings
of these models. Subsequently, persona prompting with the PCT is used to
explore explicit stereotypes across various social dimensions. In a final step,
implicit stereotypes are uncovered by evaluating models with multilingual
versions of the PCT. Key findings reveal a consistent left-leaning political
alignment across all investigated models. Furthermore, while the nature and
extent of stereotypes vary considerably between models, implicit stereotypes
elicited through language variation are more pronounced than those identified
via explicit persona prompting. Interestingly, for most models, implicit and
explicit stereotypes show a notable alignment, suggesting a degree of
transparency or "awareness" regarding their inherent biases. This study
underscores the complex interplay of political bias and stereotypes in LLMs.

TL;DR: Investigates the ability of Large Language Model-based agents to strategically influence co-players' learning dynamics in multi-agent environments using a novel approach, ShapeLLM.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding strategic behavior in multi-agent systems with LLM agents and addressing whether these agents can impact learning dynamics and behavior through mere interaction.

Method: Introduced ShapeLLM, a model-free opponent shaping method adapted to transformer-based LLM agents, and tested its efficacy across several game-theoretic environments.

Result: LLM agents using ShapeLLM successfully influenced opponents' learning dynamics to achieve favorable outcomes in both competitive and cooperative game scenarios.

Conclusion: Opponent shaping is a critical and viable dimension of multi-agent LLM research, as LLM agents demonstrate the capability to shape and be shaped by interactions.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly being deployed as autonomous
agents in real-world environments. As these deployments scale, multi-agent
interactions become inevitable, making it essential to understand strategic
behavior in such systems. A central open question is whether LLM agents, like
reinforcement learning agents, can shape the learning dynamics and influence
the behavior of others through interaction alone. In this paper, we present the
first investigation of opponent shaping (OS) with LLM-based agents. Existing OS
algorithms cannot be directly applied to LLMs, as they require higher-order
derivatives, face scalability constraints, or depend on architectural
components that are absent in transformers. To address this gap, we introduce
ShapeLLM, an adaptation of model-free OS methods tailored for transformer-based
agents. Using ShapeLLM, we examine whether LLM agents can influence co-players'
learning dynamics across diverse game-theoretic environments. We demonstrate
that LLM agents can successfully guide opponents toward exploitable equilibria
in competitive games (Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma, Matching Pennies, and
Chicken) and promote coordination and improve collective welfare in cooperative
games (Iterated Stag Hunt and a cooperative version of the Prisoner's Dilemma).
Our findings show that LLM agents can both shape and be shaped through
interaction, establishing opponent shaping as a key dimension of multi-agent
LLM research.

*Jason Bohne,Pawel Polak,David Rosenberg,Brian Bloniarz,Gary Kazantsev*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes Mix- and MoE-DPO, a framework for aligning large language models (LLMs) with preferences using mixture models and mixture-of-experts architectures to improve expressivity in multi-task and diverse preference settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) methods for aligning large language models (LLMs) are limited by relying on a single model, which hampers their adaptability and versatility in dealing with diverse user preferences and tasks.

Method: The authors introduce Mix- and MoE-DPO, which incorporates soft mixture models and mixture-of-experts architectures. It uses latent-variable modeling and optimizes a variational evidence lower bound (ELBO) via stochastic variational inference, enhancing specialization and generalization.

Result: The framework demonstrates improved performance in generalization, reward/policy specialization, and contextual alignment on multi-preference datasets and models of various sizes.

Conclusion: Mix- and MoE-DPO provides a scalable and flexible technique for aligning large language models with user preferences, catering to heterogeneous and diverse preference distributions effectively.

Abstract: Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) has recently emerged as a simple and
effective alternative to reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) for
aligning large language models (LLMs) with user preferences. However, existing
DPO formulations rely on a single monolithic model, which limits their
expressivity in multi-task settings and their adaptability to heterogeneous or
diverse preference distributions. In this work, we propose Mix- and MoE-DPO, a
framework that extends DPO with both soft mixture models and mixture-of-experts
(MoE) architectures, using a stochastic variational inference approach. Our
method introduces a latent-variable model over expert assignments and optimizes
a variational evidence lower bound (ELBO), enabling stable and efficient
learning of specialized expert policies from preference data. Mix- and MoE-DPO
provides three key advantages over standard DPO: (i) generalization via
universal function approximation through mixtures; (ii) reward and policy
specialization through expert components tailored to distinct preference modes;
and (iii) contextual alignment through input-dependent soft gating that enables
user-specific mixture policies. Our framework supports both shared base
architectures with expert-specific policy heads and fully independent expert
models, allowing flexible trade-offs between parameter efficiency and
specialization. We validate our approach on a variety of model sizes and
multi-preference datasets, demonstrating that Mix- and MoE-DPO offers a
powerful and scalable method for preference-based LLM alignment.

*Tsuyoshi Okita*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces a hierarchical framework to improve time-series generation by embedding physical constraints into deep generative models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current time-series generation methods lack adherence to physical constraints, which reduces their statistical and physical reliability.

Method: The method integrates Fourier Neural Operators (FNOs) for learning physical operators with Conditional Flow Matching (CFM) for probabilistic generation, guided by time-dependent hierarchical physical constraints.

Result: The approach achieves 16.3% better generation quality, 46% fewer physical violations, and an 18.5% improvement in predictive accuracy compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: Embedding domain-specific physical constraints within generative models improves both the statistical and physical consistency of time-series generation.

Abstract: Conventional time-series generation often ignores domain-specific physical
constraints, limiting statistical and physical consistency. We propose a
hierarchical framework that embeds the inherent hierarchy of physical
laws-conservation, dynamics, boundary, and empirical relations-directly into
deep generative models, introducing a new paradigm of physics-informed
inductive bias. Our method combines Fourier Neural Operators (FNOs) for
learning physical operators with Conditional Flow Matching (CFM) for
probabilistic generation, integrated via time-dependent hierarchical
constraints and FNO-guided corrections. Experiments on harmonic oscillators,
human activity recognition, and lithium-ion battery degradation show 16.3%
higher generation quality, 46% fewer physics violations, and 18.5% improved
predictive accuracy over baselines.

TL;DR: This paper proposes Adaptive Random Forests (ARFs) and Drift-Aware Feature Importance (DAFI) to address dynamic feature adaptation and explainability in AI-driven 6G networks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for AI models to adapt dynamically to changing and non-stationary environments, such as 6G network scenarios influenced by multi-vendor setups, hardware upgrades, and evolving service requirements.

Method: Introduced Adaptive Random Forests (ARFs) for iterative training to enable dynamic feature adaptation and stable predictions. Proposed Drift-Aware Feature Importance (DAFI) to optimize explainability by balancing computational cost and drift detection.

Result: Iterative training of ARFs led to improved accuracy over time, while DAFI reduced runtime by up to 2 times and provided more consistent feature importance values across three datasets.

Conclusion: ARFs and DAFI together offer a reliable and efficient solution for building adaptable AI models tailored for 6G networks, addressing both adaptability and explainability challenges.

Abstract: As AI becomes a native component of 6G network control, AI models must adapt
to continuously changing conditions, including the introduction of new features
and measurements driven by multi-vendor deployments, hardware upgrades, and
evolving service requirements. To address this growing need for flexible
learning in non-stationary environments, this vision paper highlights Adaptive
Random Forests (ARFs) as a reliable solution for dynamic feature adaptation in
communication network scenarios. We show that iterative training of ARFs can
effectively lead to stable predictions, with accuracy improving over time as
more features are added. In addition, we highlight the importance of
explainability in AI-driven networks, proposing Drift-Aware Feature Importance
(DAFI) as an efficient XAI feature importance (FI) method. DAFI uses a
distributional drift detector to signal when to apply computationally intensive
FI methods instead of lighter alternatives. Our tests on 3 different datasets
indicate that our approach reduces runtime by up to 2 times, while producing
more consistent feature importance values. Together, ARFs and DAFI provide a
promising framework to build flexible AI methods adapted to 6G network
use-cases.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: RPEL is a communication-efficient, robust collaborative machine learning method that scales logarithmically with network size while tolerating adversarial behaviors without relying on central servers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the issue of training-time adversarial behaviors in collaborative machine learning systems without relying on a central server or incurring high communication overhead.

Method: RPEL uses a pull-based epidemic communication strategy where nodes pull model parameters from small random subsets of other nodes, ensuring scalability and robustness. This method reduces communication complexity to O(n log n) and maintains convergence guarantees with high probability.

Result: Empirical evaluations show that RPEL effectively handles adversarial scenarios, achieves comparable accuracy to all-to-all communication strategies, and demonstrates efficient scalability on large networks.

Conclusion: RPEL provides a robust, scalable, and efficient solution for collaborative machine learning in adversarial environments, avoiding the need for centralized coordination or high communication costs.

Abstract: Collaborative machine learning is challenged by training-time adversarial
behaviors. Existing approaches to tolerate such behaviors either rely on a
central server or induce high communication costs. We propose Robust Pull-based
Epidemic Learning (RPEL), a novel, scalable collaborative approach to ensure
robust learning despite adversaries. RPEL does not rely on any central server
and, unlike traditional methods, where communication costs grow in
$\mathcal{O}(n^2)$ with the number of nodes $n$, RPEL employs a pull-based
epidemic-based communication strategy that scales in $\mathcal{O}(n \log n)$.
By pulling model parameters from small random subsets of nodes, RPEL
significantly lowers the number of required messages without compromising
convergence guarantees, which hold with high probability. Empirical results
demonstrate that RPEL maintains robustness in adversarial settings, competes
with all-to-all communication accuracy, and scales efficiently across large
networks.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Learning to Ask (LtA), a novel framework for better human-AI collaboration in classification tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current decision-support systems (LtD) limit expert contributions to mere predictions and treat humans and AI as exclusive decision-makers, necessitating a more integrated approach.

Method: LtA uses a two-part architecture with a standard ML model and an enriched model that includes expert feedback. It selectively queries the enriched model using an optimal strategy. Two implementations are introduced: sequential and joint training.

Result: Synthetic and real expert data tests demonstrate LtA's flexibility and effectiveness in improving human-AI collaboration.

Conclusion: LtA provides a more advanced and flexible framework than LtD for incorporating expert inputs into ML decision-making, enhancing human-AI collaboration.

Abstract: Developing decision-support systems that complement human performance in
classification tasks remains an open challenge. A popular approach, Learning to
Defer (LtD), allows a Machine Learning (ML) model to pass difficult cases to a
human expert. However, LtD treats humans and ML models as mutually exclusive
decision-makers, restricting the expert contribution to mere predictions. To
address this limitation, we propose Learning to Ask (LtA), a new framework that
handles both when and how to incorporate expert input in an ML model. LtA is
based on a two-part architecture: a standard ML model and an enriched model
trained with additional expert human feedback, with a formally optimal strategy
for selecting when to query the enriched model. We provide two practical
implementations of LtA: a sequential approach, which trains the models in
stages, and a joint approach, which optimises them simultaneously. For the
latter, we design surrogate losses with realisable-consistency guarantees. Our
experiments with synthetic and real expert data demonstrate that LtA provides a
more flexible and powerful foundation for effective human-AI collaboration.

*Pál Zsámboki,Benjamin Levi,David Ansel Josef Smith,Mitansh Kagalwala,Arlington Kell,Samuel Liechty,Cong Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper investigates length generalization in transformers using the set complement task, proposing theoretical bounds and demonstrating challenges stemming from softmax compression and noisy training updates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understand how transformers can generalize reasoning tasks over input sequences of varying lengths, essential for tasks like board-game reasoning.

Method: Theoretical analysis of single-layer attention-only transformers, followed by experiments on the set complement task and analysis of OthelloGPT using dropout and Exponential Moving Average (EMA).

Result: The study finds tight bounds for model dimensions, identifies length generalization challenges (softmax compression and noisy updates), and validates dropout and EMA as effective interventions for improving performance.

Conclusion: Length generalization is limited by attention mechanism artifacts and training noise, but dropout and EMA can mitigate these effects, as shown in both set complement and OthelloGPT tasks.

Abstract: We study length generalization in transformers through the set complement
task, where a model must predict a uniform distribution over tokens absent from
an input sequence -- an ability central to board-game style reasoning. Our main
theoretical result establishes two statements. First, we prove tight bounds on
embedding and value dimensions for single-layer attention-only transformers.
Second, we show that if such a model achieves balanced logit displacement at
lengths 1 and 2, then it must generalize to longer sequences, though with
reduced precision. A mechanistic reading of the proof explains this limitation:
as more tokens are attended to, softmax compresses logit displacements, eroding
separation between valid and invalid outputs. Training dynamics also suggest a
second obstacle: when many next tokens are possible, updates become noisy. We
hypothesize that dropout can counteract the first effect and Exponential Moving
Average (EMA) the second. We validate these hypotheses through random
hyperparameter search on the set complement task, which confirms both
mechanisms. We then test OthelloGPT, a GPT-1 style model trained on random
Othello moves, and find that EMA again improves length generalization in this
more complex setting.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the need for optimized and personalized enteral nutrition in critically ill patients to improve their survival and nutritional outcomes.

Method: DeepEN employs a dueling double deep Q-network with conservative Q-learning, leveraging a curated state space and reward function to train on data from over 11,000 ICU patients.

Result: DeepEN demonstrates a 3.7 percentage-point reduction in estimated mortality (18.8% vs. 22.5%) and enhancements in nutritional biomarkers, outperforming clinician-derived and guideline-based policies.

Conclusion: The findings suggest that personalized, data-driven enteral nutrition via DeepEN can safely enhance survival and nutritional outcomes compared to traditional heuristic-based approaches.

Abstract: We introduce DeepEN, a deep reinforcement learning (RL) framework for
personalized enteral nutrition (EN) in critically ill patients. Trained offline
on over 11,000 ICU patients from the MIMIC-IV database, DeepEN generates
4-hourly recommendations for caloric, protein, and fluid intake tailored to
each patient's evolving physiology. The model integrates a curated, clinically
informed state space with a custom reward function that balances short-term
physiological and nutrition-related goals with long-term survival outcomes.
Using a dueling double deep Q-network with conservative Q-learning
regularization, DeepEN learns clinically realistic policies that align with
high-value clinician actions while discouraging unsafe deviations. Across
various qualitative and quantitative metrics, DeepEN outperforms
clinician-derived and guideline-based policies, achieving a 3.7 $\pm$ 0.17
percentage-point reduction in estimated mortality (18.8% vs 22.5%) and
improvements in key nutritional biomarkers. These findings highlight the
potential of safe, data-driven personalization of EN therapy to improve
outcomes beyond traditional guideline- or heuristic-based approaches.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a star-shaped sampling approach with a learnable re-masking scheduler for pre-trained masked diffusion models, improving sample quality and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Pre-trained masked diffusion models often struggle with irreversible decisions during sampling and underperform in low-step generation, necessitating an efficient error-correcting mechanism.

Method: The paper introduces a star-shaped sampling algorithm combined with a learnable re-masking scheduler and lightweight fine-tuning of a single layer for error correction.

Result: The proposed method significantly improves sample quality and efficiency across different scenarios, especially in low-step generation and shows superior or matching performance compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: The star-shaped paradigm and re-masking scheduler enhance diffusion model sampling, making the process more efficient and adaptable, particularly for text and code generation tasks.

Abstract: The performance of pre-trained masked diffusion models is often constrained
by their sampling procedure, which makes decisions irreversible and struggles
in low-step generation regimes. We introduce a novel sampling algorithm that
works with pre-trained models and, after a lightweight fine-tuning of a single
layer, significantly improves sample quality and efficiency. Our method
reformulates the generation process using a star-shaped paradigm, which
inherently allows for error correction. To make this process effective, we
augment it with a learnable re-masking scheduler that intelligently identifies
and revises likely errors. This approach yields a substantial quality boost,
particularly when using a small number of sampling steps. We extensively ablate
key components of our approach and show its usability in different scenarios.
In comprehensive experiments on text, and code generation, our sampling
algorithm outperforms or matches existing methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Contrastive learning's high computational demands hinder its deployment on edge and fog devices with limited resources.

Method: Evaluated four CL frameworks using energy profiling and reduced training data, and extended analysis to lightweight neural architectures.

Result: SimCLR is shown to have the lowest energy consumption among the evaluated frameworks across different data regimes.

Conclusion: Findings highlight the potential for optimizing and deploying CL frameworks efficiently in resource-constrained environments and suggest several directions for future research.

Abstract: While contrastive learning (CL) shows considerable promise in self-supervised
representation learning, its deployment on resource-constrained devices remains
largely underexplored. The substantial computational demands required for
training conventional CL frameworks pose a set of challenges, particularly in
terms of energy consumption, data availability, and memory usage. We conduct an
evaluation of four widely used CL frameworks: SimCLR, MoCo, SimSiam, and Barlow
Twins. We focus on the practical feasibility of these CL frameworks for edge
and fog deployment, and introduce a systematic benchmarking strategy that
includes energy profiling and reduced training data conditions. Our findings
reveal that SimCLR, contrary to its perceived computational cost, demonstrates
the lowest energy consumption across various data regimes. Finally, we also
extend our analysis by evaluating lightweight neural architectures when paired
with CL frameworks. Our study aims to provide insights into the resource
implications of deploying CL in edge/fog environments with limited processing
capabilities and opens several research directions for its future optimization.

*Heming Zou,Yunliang Zang,Wutong Xu,Yao Zhu,Xiangyang Ji*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FlyLoRA introduces a biologically inspired improvement to Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), tackling parameter interference and enhancing fine-tuning efficiency for foundation models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LoRA faces inefficiencies due to parameter interference, leading to suboptimal single-task and multi-task performance.

Method: FlyLoRA uses rank-wise expert activation and an implicit router—borrowed from biological inspiration—replacing trainable dense matrices with fixed sparse random projection matrices.

Result: FlyLoRA shows consistent performance improvements across diverse domains such as general knowledge, scientific QA, mathematical reasoning, and code generation.

Conclusion: FlyLoRA effectively resolves intra-task and inter-task interference, highlighting that biological principles can inspire advancements in AI design.

Abstract: Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) is a widely used parameter-efficient fine-tuning
method for foundation models, but it suffers from parameter interference,
resulting in suboptimal performance. Although Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)-based
LoRA variants show promise in mitigating intra-task correlations in single-task
instruction tuning, they introduce additional router parameters and remain
ineffective in multi-task model merging where inter-task interference arises.
Inspired by the fly olfactory circuit, we propose FlyLoRA, an implicit
MoE-based LoRA variant that introduces: (1) rank-wise expert activation in the
up-projection matrix, and (2) an implicit router that unifies expert routing
and down-projection, where a frozen sparse random projection matrix replaces
the traditional dense trainable version. This design resolves the trade-off
between intra-task decorrelation and computational efficiency by eliminating
the need for an explicit router, while inherently mitigating inter-task
interference due to the orthogonality property of random matrices. Extensive
experiments across four domains -- general knowledge understanding, scientific
question answering, mathematical reasoning, and code generation -- demonstrate
consistent performance improvements over existing methods. Beyond empirical
gains, FlyLoRA highlights how biological structures can inspire innovations in
AI technologies. Code is available at https://github.com/gfyddha/FlyLoRA.

*Lauren Anderson,Lucas Chatelain,Nicolas Tremblay,Kathryn Grandfield,David Rousseau,Aurélien Gourrier*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The study investigates deep learning super-resolution models to enhance confocal microscopy imaging of dental porosity networks, aiming to overcome field-of-view limitations and achieve better image quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of visualizing sub-microscopic dental porosity networks with limited field-of-view when using high-resolution confocal microscopy.

Method: Four deep learning SR models (RCAN, pix2pix, FSRCNN, and CycleGAN) were tested on paired high- and low-resolution confocal image sets. Image quality was analyzed using IQA metrics, segmentation, and graph analysis.

Result: IQA metrics showed inconsistent alignment with visual perception. Biology-driven segmentation and graph analysis revealed differences in model sensitivity to weak intensity features and image generation non-linearities.

Conclusion: The study highlights the inadequacy of standard IQA metrics and emphasizes biology-driven assessments for better evaluation of SR models' performance in preserving the dental porosity network.

Abstract: The mechanosensory system of teeth is currently believed to partly rely on
Odontoblast cells stimulation by fluid flow through a porosity network
extending through dentin. Visualizing the smallest sub-microscopic porosity
vessels therefore requires the highest achievable resolution from confocal
fluorescence microscopy, the current gold standard. This considerably limits
the extent of the field of view to very small sample regions. To overcome this
limitation, we tested different deep learning (DL) super-resolution (SR) models
to allow faster experimental acquisitions of lower resolution images and
restore optimal image quality by post-processing. Three supervised 2D SR models
(RCAN, pix2pix, FSRCNN) and one unsupervised (CycleGAN) were applied to a
unique set of experimentally paired high- and low-resolution confocal images
acquired with different sampling schemes, resulting in a pixel size increase of
x2, x4, x8. Model performance was quantified using a broad set of similarity
and distribution-based image quality assessment (IQA) metrics, which yielded
inconsistent results that mostly contradicted our visual perception. This
raises the question of the relevance of such generic metrics to efficiently
target the specific structure of dental porosity. To resolve this conflicting
information, the generated SR images were segmented taking into account the
specific scales and morphology of the porosity network and analysed by
comparing connected components. Additionally, the capacity of the SR models to
preserve 3D porosity connectivity throughout the confocal image stacks was
evaluated using graph analysis. This biology-driven assessment allowed a far
better mechanistic interpretation of SR performance, highlighting differences
in model sensitivity to weak intensity features and the impact of non-linearity
in image generation, which explains the failure of standard IQA metrics.

*David Madras,Joshua Safyan,Qiuyi,Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper investigates why prompt engineering techniques succeed, proposing that data/distribution-dependent perplexity acts as a prior and derives tighter generalization bounds for data-scarce scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand and explain the widespread success of prompt engineering techniques despite limited task-specific data and a large prompt space.

Method: This study derives new PAC-Bayes generalization bounds incorporating perplexity regularization, a method that limits exploration of prompts by effectively prioritizing 'natural' tasks.

Result: The authors derive generalization bounds that are meaningful even in data-scarce settings and demonstrate the practical benefit of perplexity regularization in improving generalization and bound tightness empirically.

Conclusion: Perplexity regularization offers a theoretical and practical tool for better prompt engineering, especially under data-scarce conditions, by tightening generalization bounds and improving task performance.

Abstract: Many prompt engineering techniques have been successful in practice, even
when optimizing over a large prompt space with with a small amount of
task-specific data. Recent work has partially explained this success by showing
generalization bounds which apply PAC-Bayes theory to the discrete prompt
space, but they are non-vacuous only in data-rich scenarios. We argue that such
widespread success can be more fully explained through more carefully
considering data- or distribution-dependent perplexity, which acts as an
effective prior and steers the optimization towards prompts that are more
``natural'' for the task at hand. We derive novel generalization bounds that
are non-vacuous for data-scarce prompt optimization via more useful priors,
formally analyzing how perplexity regularization tightens these bounds by
limiting exploration. Empirically, we explore both the bounds' effectiveness
and the practical benefits of perplexity regularization in improving prompt
generalization.

### [390] [Reinforcing Diffusion Models by Direct Group Preference Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08425)
*Yihong Luo,Tianyang Hu,Jing Tang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: GRPO improves large language models but struggles with diffusion models due to its need for stochasticity. DGPO solves this by learning from group-level preferences, enabling efficient deterministic sampling and faster training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address challenges in adapting reinforcement learning methods, like GRPO, to diffusion models while maintaining efficiency and effectiveness.

Method: Developed Direct Group Preference Optimization (DGPO), a reinforcement learning algorithm that eliminates the reliance on stochastic policies and uses deterministic samplers for fast training.

Result: DGPO demonstrated training speeds 20x faster than existing methods and delivered better performance on both in-domain and out-of-domain metrics.

Conclusion: DGPO simplifies and accelerates reinforcement learning for diffusion models, offering significant improvements in performance and efficiency.

Abstract: While reinforcement learning methods such as Group Relative Preference
Optimization (GRPO) have significantly enhanced Large Language Models, adapting
them to diffusion models remains challenging. In particular, GRPO demands a
stochastic policy, yet the most cost-effective diffusion samplers are based on
deterministic ODEs. Recent work addresses this issue by using inefficient
SDE-based samplers to induce stochasticity, but this reliance on model-agnostic
Gaussian noise leads to slow convergence. To resolve this conflict, we propose
Direct Group Preference Optimization (DGPO), a new online RL algorithm that
dispenses with the policy-gradient framework entirely. DGPO learns directly
from group-level preferences, which utilize relative information of samples
within groups. This design eliminates the need for inefficient stochastic
policies, unlocking the use of efficient deterministic ODE samplers and faster
training. Extensive results show that DGPO trains around 20 times faster than
existing state-of-the-art methods and achieves superior performance on both
in-domain and out-of-domain reward metrics. Code is available at

*Cheng Qian,Zuxin Liu,Shirley Kokane,Akshara Prabhakar,Jielin Qiu,Haolin Chen,Zhiwei Liu,Heng Ji,Weiran Yao,Shelby Heinecke,Silvio Savarese,Caiming Xiong,Huan Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces xRouter, a learned routing system aimed at optimizing the cost-performance trade-off in utilizing LLMs by dynamically deciding whether to answer directly or use external models, achieving better efficiency and performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large Language Models (LLMs) face challenges with balancing cost and performance, as premium models can reason well but are expensive, and smaller models are cost-effective but struggle with complexity. Current static approaches fail to adapt efficiently across tasks.

Method: xRouter utilizes a routing system where a learned router dynamically chooses between responding directly or invoking external models. It is trained end-to-end with reinforcement learning and an explicit cost-aware reward, eliminating manual routing rules.

Result: The system achieves better cost-performance trade-offs in diverse benchmarks, such as significant cost savings while maintaining comparable task completion rates. Insights into what contributes to effective learned routing are also provided.

Conclusion: xRouter advances the orchestration of LLMs by demonstrating the feasibility of cost-aware, learned routing systems and opens up new possibilities for efficient utilization through its open implementation and empirical findings.

Abstract: Modern LLM deployments confront a widening cost-performance spectrum: premium
models deliver strong reasoning but are expensive, while lightweight models are
economical yet brittle on complex tasks. Static escalation rules and keyword
heuristics under-utilize this spectrum and fail to adapt across task types. We
present xRouter, a tool-calling-based routing system in which a learned router
can either answer directly or invoke one or more external models. The router is
trained end-to-end with reinforcement learning using an explicit, cost-aware
reward that encodes cost-performance trade-offs, eliminating the need for
hand-engineered routing rules. Our implementation encompasses the full
reinforcement learning framework, including reward and cost accounting, as well
as the deployment and evaluation pipelines. Across diverse benchmarks, xRouter
achieves strong cost-performance trade-offs (e.g., substantial cost reductions
at comparable task completion rates), and provides empirical insights into what
reliably helps learned routing and what does not, ranging from model
trainability to the difficulty of eliciting sophisticated orchestration
behaviors in small open models. We hope these findings and our open
implementation will serve as a practical substrate for advancing learned,
cost-aware LLM orchestration.

TL;DR: The paper introduces 'SymTime,' a foundation model for time series analysis (TSA) that uses synthetic series-symbol data with strong correlations to address data scarcity and imbalance, achieving strong performance across major TSA tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Time series analysis faces challenges such as data scarcity and imbalance, which hinder the development of foundation models. This motivates the creation of new mechanisms for generating high-quality data to improve task performance.

Method: The authors developed a series-symbol data generation system inspired by complex dynamic systems, creating time series data paired with symbolic expressions. They then built 'SymTime,' a foundation model leveraging these data pairs to enhance time series representation through pretraining and fine-tuning.

Result: 'SymTime' exhibits competitive results across five major TSA tasks, matching or surpassing models pre-trained on real-world data.

Conclusion: The study highlights the effectiveness of series-symbol data generation and pretraining mechanisms in addressing TSA's data challenges and improving model performance, demonstrating the feasibility of synthetic approaches.

Abstract: Foundation models for time series analysis (TSA) have attracted significant
attention. However, challenges such as training data scarcity and imbalance
continue to hinder their development. Inspired by complex dynamic system
theories, we design a series-symbol data generation mechanism, enabling the
unrestricted creation of high-quality time series data paired with
corresponding symbolic expressions. To leverage series-symbol data pairs with
strong correlations, we develop \texttt{SymTime}, a pre-trained foundation
model for enhancing time series representation using symbolic information.
\texttt{SymTime} demonstrates competitive performance across five major TSA
tasks when fine-tunes with downstream tasks, rivaling foundation models
pre-trained on real-world datasets. This approach underscores the potential of
series-symbol data generation and pretraining mechanisms in overcoming data
scarcity and enhancing task performance. The code is available at

*Ankur Mali,Lawrence Hall,Jake Williams,Gordon Richards*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This work introduces a rigorous nine-dimensional framework to classify neural network activation functions, combining propagation statistics, asymptotic properties, and regularity measures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide a systematic and principled approach for classifying and designing activation functions, moving beyond heuristic comparisons currently available in neural network research.

Method: A nine-dimensional integral signature framework (S_sigma(phi)) is proposed, incorporating Gaussian propagation statistics, asymptotic slopes, and regularity measures for activation functions. The study includes theoretical proofs, Lyapunov analysis for stability, and kernel-based connections.

Result: The framework classifies eight activation functions (e.g., ReLU, tanh, Swish) into distinct families and confirms theoretical predictions through numerical validation techniques like Gauss-Hermite and Monte Carlo sampling.

Conclusion: The framework shifts activation function design from trial-and-error to a provable, systematic approach, offering new stability and kernel-conditioning insights for neural networks.

Abstract: Activation functions govern the expressivity and stability of neural
networks, yet existing comparisons remain largely heuristic. We propose a
rigorous framework for their classification via a nine-dimensional integral
signature S_sigma(phi), combining Gaussian propagation statistics (m1, g1, g2,
m2, eta), asymptotic slopes (alpha_plus, alpha_minus), and regularity measures
(TV(phi'), C(phi)). This taxonomy establishes well-posedness, affine
reparameterization laws with bias, and closure under bounded slope variation.
Dynamical analysis yields Lyapunov theorems with explicit descent constants and
identifies variance stability regions through (m2', g2). From a kernel
perspective, we derive dimension-free Hessian bounds and connect smoothness to
bounded variation of phi'. Applying the framework, we classify eight standard
activations (ReLU, leaky-ReLU, tanh, sigmoid, Swish, GELU, Mish, TeLU), proving
sharp distinctions between saturating, linear-growth, and smooth families.
Numerical Gauss-Hermite and Monte Carlo validation confirms theoretical
predictions. Our framework provides principled design guidance, moving
activation choice from trial-and-error to provable stability and kernel
conditioning.

*Kwanseok Kim,Jaehoon Hahm,Sumin Kim,Jinhwan Sul,Byunghak Kim,Joonseok Lee*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces SummDiff, a video summarization method using diffusion models to generate multiple possible summaries reflecting human subjectivity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous video summarization methods ignored the subjective nature of the task by averaging rater preferences. This paper aims to address this by incorporating individual variability into the summarization process.

Method: The authors propose framing video summarization as a conditional generation task using diffusion models, allowing for dynamic adaptation to visual contexts and production of varied summaries based on video inputs.

Result: Experiments show SummDiff achieves state-of-the-art results and generates summaries aligning well with diverse human annotator preferences on multiple benchmarks.

Conclusion: SummDiff provides a breakthrough in video summarization by addressing subjectivity and improving both performance and understanding of overlooked steps through innovative metrics.

Abstract: Video summarization is a task of shortening a video by choosing a subset of
frames while preserving its essential moments. Despite the innate subjectivity
of the task, previous works have deterministically regressed to an averaged
frame score over multiple raters, ignoring the inherent subjectivity of what
constitutes a good summary. We propose a novel problem formulation by framing
video summarization as a conditional generation task, allowing a model to learn
the distribution of good summaries and to generate multiple plausible summaries
that better reflect varying human perspectives. Adopting diffusion models for
the first time in video summarization, our proposed method, SummDiff,
dynamically adapts to visual contexts and generates multiple candidate
summaries conditioned on the input video. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that SummDiff not only achieves the state-of-the-art performance on various
benchmarks but also produces summaries that closely align with individual
annotator preferences. Moreover, we provide a deeper insight with novel metrics
from an analysis of the knapsack, which is an important last step of generating
summaries but has been overlooked in evaluation.

TL;DR: The paper introduces "In-Context Clustering" (ICC), a novel clustering approach leveraging pre-trained large language models (LLMs) for unsupervised clustering tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of traditional clustering algorithms that rely on predefined similarity measures and are therefore inflexible for complex data distributions.

Method: ICC uses pre-trained LLMs with attention mechanisms to detect cluster patterns, incorporates spectral clustering for performance, and further fine-tunes models using Next Token Prediction (NTP) loss. It can also handle text-conditioned image clustering.

Result: Experiments show that LLMs exhibit strong zero-shot clustering abilities on numeric data and can be improved for numeric and image data through fine-tuning.

Conclusion: The paper extends in-context learning to unsupervised clustering, emphasizing LLMs' flexibility and effectiveness for clustering diverse datasets, including text-conditioned images.

Abstract: We propose In-Context Clustering (ICC), a flexible LLM-based procedure for
clustering data from diverse distributions. Unlike traditional clustering
algorithms constrained by predefined similarity measures, ICC flexibly captures
complex relationships among inputs through an attention mechanism. We show that
pretrained LLMs exhibit impressive zero-shot clustering capabilities on
text-encoded numeric data, with attention matrices showing salient cluster
patterns. Spectral clustering using attention matrices offers surprisingly
competitive performance. We further enhance the clustering capabilities of LLMs
on numeric and image data through fine-tuning using the Next Token Prediction
(NTP) loss. Moreover, the flexibility of LLM prompting enables text-conditioned
image clustering, a capability that classical clustering methods lack. Our work
extends in-context learning to an unsupervised setting, showcasing the
effectiveness and flexibility of LLMs for clustering. Our code is available at

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces UML, a modality-agnostic training paradigm that leverages unpaired multimodal data to enhance representation learning in target modalities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to explore the use of unpaired multimodal data to improve representation learning in tasks involving unimodal data, addressing limitations of traditional models that require paired datasets.

Method: UML utilizes a single model that alternates between processing inputs from different modalities, sharing parameters across them based on the premise that modalities are projections of a shared underlying reality.

Result: Theoretical analysis shows richer data representations from unpaired auxiliary data. Empirical studies demonstrate improved performance in unimodal tasks, such as image and audio, when leveraging text, audio, or image data.

Conclusion: Unpaired multimodal data can be effectively utilized to enhance unimodal representation learning, making UML broadly applicable across diverse tasks.

Abstract: Traditional multimodal learners find unified representations for tasks like
visual question answering, but rely heavily on paired datasets. However, an
overlooked yet potentially powerful question is: can one leverage auxiliary
unpaired multimodal data to directly enhance representation learning in a
target modality? We introduce UML: Unpaired Multimodal Learner, a
modality-agnostic training paradigm in which a single model alternately
processes inputs from different modalities while sharing parameters across
them. This design exploits the assumption that different modalities are
projections of a shared underlying reality, allowing the model to benefit from
cross-modal structure without requiring explicit pairs. Theoretically, under
linear data-generating assumptions, we show that unpaired auxiliary data can
yield representations strictly more informative about the data-generating
process than unimodal training. Empirically, we show that using unpaired data
from auxiliary modalities -- such as text, audio, or images -- consistently
improves downstream performance across diverse unimodal targets such as image
and audio. Our project page: https://unpaired-multimodal.github.io/

*Yash Jhaveri,Harley Wiltzer,Patrick Shafto,Marc G. Bellemare,David Meger*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a reinforcement learning framework that ensures convergence to a well-defined, diversity-preserving optimal policy, using entropy regularization and a novel method called temperature decoupling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional reinforcement learning struggles to characterize learned policies beyond their expected return, creating challenges in understanding the behavior of these policies.

Method: The authors introduce a theoretical framework that uses vanishing entropy regularization and a temperature decoupling approach to ensure interpretable and consistent policy optimization.

Result: The method produces a diversity-preserving, optimal policy and allows precise estimation of its associated return distribution.

Conclusion: The proposed framework improves the interpretability and characterization of reinforcement learning policies, offering theoretical guarantees of convergence and diversity preservation.

Abstract: In the pursuit of finding an optimal policy, reinforcement learning (RL)
methods generally ignore the properties of learned policies apart from their
expected return. Thus, even when successful, it is difficult to characterize
which policies will be learned and what they will do. In this work, we present
a theoretical framework for policy optimization that guarantees convergence to
a particular optimal policy, via vanishing entropy regularization and a
temperature decoupling gambit. Our approach realizes an interpretable,
diversity-preserving optimal policy as the regularization temperature vanishes
and ensures the convergence of policy derived objects--value functions and
return distributions. In a particular instance of our method, for example, the
realized policy samples all optimal actions uniformly. Leveraging our
temperature decoupling gambit, we present an algorithm that estimates, to
arbitrary accuracy, the return distribution associated to its interpretable,
diversity-preserving optimal policy.

Motivation: The aim is to explore entropy control in model outputs as a means of improving performance across multiple domains without significant computational overhead.

Method: ERA uses specially designed activations to ensure entropy in model outputs stays above specific thresholds, optimizing performance in large language models, reinforcement learning agents, and image classifiers.

Result: ERA achieves notable performance boosts: 37.4% improvement in AIME 2025 scoring for LLMs, 30% better performance on Reinforcement Learning HumanoidBench, and a 0.69% accuracy gain for ResNet-50 on ImageNet, with less than 7% computational overhead.

Conclusion: Output activation for entropy control proves to be effective and efficient, suggesting a new pathway for building simpler, more robust algorithms.

Abstract: We propose ERA, a new paradigm that constrains the sampling entropy above
given thresholds by applying specially designed activations to the outputs of

1) for large language models(LLMs), boosting the AIME 2025 score for
Qwen2.5-Math-7B by 37.4%; 2) for continuous control reinforcement learning
agents, improving performance by more than 30% over strong baselines such as
SAC on the challenging HumanoidBench; 3) for image classification, enhancing
ImageNet top-1 accuracy by 0.69% for ResNet-50. These gains are achieved with a
computational overhead of less than 7%. Our work validates output activation as
a powerful tool for entropy control, opening a new direction for designing

*Nimrod Berman,Assaf Hallak,Assaf Shocher*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a neural network framework, "Linearizer," where traditionally nonlinear functions are made linear in specific vector spaces induced by neural networks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To extend the application of linear algebra techniques, such as SVD and pseudo-inverse, to nonlinear neural network mappings by redefining vector spaces.

Method: The study proposes an architecture that sandwiches a linear operator between two invertible neural networks, resulting in induced vector spaces where nonlinear operations become linear. This is termed the "Linearizer" framework.

Result: The framework enables collapsing diffusion model sampling into a single step, enforces idempotency for globally projective generative models, and demonstrates modular style transfer.

Conclusion: The Linearizer framework expands neural network applications by bridging nonlinear paradigms with linear algebra, proving its utility in generative modeling and efficient data transformation.

Abstract: Neural networks are famously nonlinear. However, linearity is defined
relative to a pair of vector spaces, $f$$:$$X$$\to$$Y$. Is it possible to
identify a pair of non-standard vector spaces for which a conventionally
nonlinear function is, in fact, linear? This paper introduces a method that
makes such vector spaces explicit by construction. We find that if we sandwich
a linear operator $A$ between two invertible neural networks, $f(x)=g_y^{-1}(A
g_x(x))$, then the corresponding vector spaces $X$ and $Y$ are induced by newly
defined addition and scaling actions derived from $g_x$ and $g_y$. We term this
kind of architecture a Linearizer. This framework makes the entire arsenal of
linear algebra, including SVD, pseudo-inverse, orthogonal projection and more,
applicable to nonlinear mappings. Furthermore, we show that the composition of
two Linearizers that share a neural network is also a Linearizer. We leverage
this property and demonstrate that training diffusion models using our
architecture makes the hundreds of sampling steps collapse into a single step.
We further utilize our framework to enforce idempotency (i.e. $f(f(x))=f(x)$)
on networks leading to a globally projective generative model and to
demonstrate modular style transfer.

rules to determine whether the system is In Control (InC) or Out of Control
(OutC). This study explores a bio-inspired method that digitally mimics ant
colony behavior to classify InC/OutC states and forecast imminent transitions
requiring maintenance. A case study on industrial potato chip frying provides
the application context. During each two-minute frying cycle, sequences of
eight temperature readings are collected. Each sequence is treated as a digital
ant depositing virtual pheromones, generating a Base Score. New sequences,
representing new ants, can either reinforce or weaken this score, leading to a
Modified Base Score that reflects the system's evolving condition. Signals such
as extreme temperatures, large variations within a sequence, or the detection
of change-points contribute to a Threat Score, which is added to the Modified
Base Score. Since pheromones naturally decay over time unless reinforced, an
Environmental Score is incorporated to reflect recent system dynamics,
imitating real ant behavior. This score is calculated from the Modified Base
Scores collected over the past hour. The resulting Total Score - the sum of the
Modified Base Score, Threat Score, and Environmental Score - is used as the
main indicator for real-time system classification and forecasting of
transitions from InC to OutC. This ant colony optimization-inspired approach
provides an adaptive and interpretable framework for process monitoring and
predictive maintenance in industrial environments.

### [401] [Learning Neuron Dynamics within Deep Spiking Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07341)
*Eric Jahns,Davi Moreno,Michel A. Kinsy*

Main category: cs.NE

TL;DR: The paper introduces Learnable Neuron Models (LNMs) to improve the performance of Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) by enabling dynamic and trainable neuron behaviors for better scalability and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the limitations of simple neuron models in deep SNNs, which lack rich temporal dynamics and are challenging to scale in high-performance settings.

Method: Introduce LNMs as parametric, trainable models of neuron dynamics, employing low-degree polynomial parameterization for efficient and stable training.

Result: Achieved state-of-the-art results on datasets like CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, ImageNet, and CIFAR-10 DVS using the LNMs approach.

Conclusion: Learnable Neuron Models significantly enhance deep SNNs, paving the way for scalable, efficient, and high-performing spiking architectures.

Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) offer a promising energy-efficient alternative
to Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) by utilizing sparse and asynchronous
processing through discrete spike-based computation. However, the performance
of deep SNNs remains limited by their reliance on simple neuron models, such as
the Leaky Integrate-and-Fire (LIF) model, which cannot capture rich temporal
dynamics. While more expressive neuron models exist, they require careful
manual tuning of hyperparameters and are difficult to scale effectively. This
difficulty is evident in the lack of successful implementations of complex
neuron models in high-performance deep SNNs. In this work, we address this
limitation by introducing Learnable Neuron Models (LNMs). LNMs are a general,
parametric formulation for non-linear integrate-and-fire dynamics that learn
neuron dynamics during training. By learning neuron dynamics directly from
data, LNMs enhance the performance of deep SNNs. We instantiate LNMs using
low-degree polynomial parameterizations, enabling efficient and stable
training. We demonstrate state-of-the-art performance in a variety of datasets,
including CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, ImageNet, and CIFAR-10 DVS. LNMs offer a
promising path toward more scalable and high-performing spiking architectures.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations in previous implementations of physical neural cellular automata, particularly regarding connectivity and independence between robotic cells.

Method: A modular and symmetric hardware design with battery-powered cells for rotation-invariant modularity, enabling independent operation and seamless interconnectivity.

Result: Developed a novel NCA model for isotropic shape classification and provided open-source hardware, software, simulator, and video resources.

Conclusion: This work lays the groundwork for advancing distributed robotic systems and self-organizing structures through rotation-invariant physical realization of NCA.

Abstract: This paper presents a rotation-invariant embedded platform for simulating

To demonstrate the platform's applicability, we present a novel
rotation-invariant NCA model for isotropic shape classification. The proposed
system provides a robust foundation for exploring the physical realization of
NCA, with potential applications in distributed robotic systems and

*Yi Zhang,Yue Xie,Tao Sun,Fumiya Iida*

Main category: cs.NE

TL;DR: The paper introduces a unified framework for joint optimization of robot morphology and control, identifying scenarios where co-design is necessary and beneficial.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To better understand when joint optimization of robot morphology and control is necessary for improving robotic performance in various scenarios, particularly those involving obstacles and workspace boundaries.

Method: The study embeds both morphology and control parameters into a single neural network for end-to-end optimization and evaluates the framework through case studies on obstacle-constrained reaching tasks.

Result: Co-design is found to be advantageous for tasks where baseline morphology is misaligned with task demands, but control-only optimization is sufficient when the baseline morphology already matches the task requirements.

Conclusion: The paper clarifies conditions under which co-design provides tangible benefits, contributing to the understanding of embodied intelligence and aiding in the design of robots with practical embodiment awareness.

Abstract: Robotic performance emerges from the coupling of body and controller, yet it
remains unclear when morphology-control co-design is necessary. We present a
unified framework that embeds morphology and control parameters within a single
neural network, enabling end-to-end joint optimization. Through case studies in
static-obstacle-constrained reaching, we evaluate trajectory error, success
rate, and collision probability. The results show that co-design provides clear
benefits when morphology is poorly matched to the task, such as near obstacles
or workspace boundaries, where structural adaptation simplifies control.
Conversely, when the baseline morphology already affords sufficient capability,
control-only optimization often matches or exceeds co-design. By clarifying
when control is enough and when it is not, this work advances the understanding
of embodied intelligence and offers practical guidance for embodiment-aware
robot design.

### [404] [Type, Ability, and Effect Systems: Perspectives on Purity, Semantics, and Expressiveness](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07582)
*Yuyan Bao,Tiark Rompf*

Main category: cs.PL

TL;DR: The paper evaluates systems for separating pure and impure programming by defining purity semantically and introducing measures of expressiveness, revealing that effect and capability systems are incomparable, and proposes a synthesis to combine their strengths.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Challenges exist in balancing precision and usability when separating pure computation from effectful interactions in programming. Current systems have varied strengths and weaknesses.

Method: The authors define semantic purity independently of typing systems, establish a measure of expressiveness termed "completeness", compare effect and capability systems, and propose a synthesis that integrates their advantages.

Result: Effect and capability systems are shown to be incomparable in terms of expressiveness. A synthesized type, ability, and effect system is introduced, demonstrating combined strengths and mitigation of weaknesses.

Conclusion: The synthesis provides a stronger framework for typing systems in programming, enhancing expressiveness and logical rigor without compromising usability.

Abstract: Programming benefits from a clear separation between pure, mathematical
computation and impure, effectful interaction with the world. Existing
approaches to enforce this separation include monads, type-and-effect systems,
and capability systems. All share a tension between precision and usability,
and each one has non-obvious strengths and weaknesses.
  This paper aims to raise the bar in assessing such systems. First, we propose
a semantic definition of purity, inspired by contextual equivalence, as a
baseline independent of any specific typing discipline. Second, we propose that
expressiveness should be measured by the degree of completeness, i.e., how many
semantically pure terms can be typed as pure. Using this measure, we focus on
minimal meaningful effect and capability systems and show that they are
incomparable, i.e., neither subsumes the other in terms of expressiveness.
  Based on this result, we propose a synthesis and show that type, ability, and
effect systems combine their respective strengths while avoiding their
weaknesses. As part of our formal model, we provide a logical relation to
facilitate proofs of purity and other properties for a variety of effect typing
disciplines.

### [405] [The Functional Machine Calculus III: Control](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07851)
*Willem Heijltjes*

Main category: cs.PL

TL;DR: The paper extends the Functional Machine Calculus for unifying functional and imperative paradigms to support branching and looping control flow, enabling embedding of a minimal complete imperative language.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To unify functional and imperative programming paradigms while preserving desirable properties like confluent reduction and typed termination.

Method: The calculus is extended with a continuation stack and modeled through a simple operational semantics that enhances the Krivine machine.

Result: The extension supports branching, looping, and constructs like conditionals and exception handling, providing a unified model with confluent reductions and strong normalization.

Conclusion: The calculus provides a unifying framework for functional and imperative computations, ensuring termination and maintaining desirable semantic properties.

Abstract: The Functional Machine Calculus (Heijltjes 2022) is a new approach to
unifying the imperative and functional programming paradigms. It extends the
lambda-calculus, preserving the key features of confluent reduction and typed
termination, to embed computational effects, evaluation strategies, and control
flow operations. The first instalment modelled sequential higher-order
computation with global store, input/output, probabilities, and
non-determinism, and embedded both the call-by-name and call-by-value
lambda-calculus, as well as Moggi's computational metalanguage and Levy's
call-by-push-value. The present paper extends the calculus from sequential to
branching and looping control flow. This allows the faithful embedding of a
minimal but complete imperative language, including conditionals, exception
handling, and iteration, as well as constants and algebraic data types.
  The calculus is defined through a simple operational semantics, extending the
(simplified) Krivine machine for the lambda-calculus with multiple operand
stacks to model effects and a continuation stack to model sequential,
branching, and looping computation. It features a confluent reduction relation
and a system of simple types that guarantees termination of the machine and
strong normalization of reduction (in the absence of iteration). These
properties carry over to the embedded imperative language, providing a unified
functional-imperative model of computation that supports simple types, a direct
and intuitive operational semantics, and a confluent reduction semantics.

*Corban Rivera,Grayson Byrd,Meghan Booker,Bethany Kemp,Allison Gaines,Emma Holmes,James Uplinger,Celso M de Melo,David Handelman*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: FLEET integrates language models and formal optimization to enhance coordination and scheduling in multi-robot systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address difficulties in coordinating diverse robot teams using natural language due to limitations in existing language-only and formal planning methods.

Method: Combines a large language model (LLM) to produce task graphs and fitness matrices, with a formal optimization framework for task scheduling.

Result: Achieves improved task success rates in multi-agent benchmarks and demonstrates effectiveness in hardware tests with heterogeneous robots.

Conclusion: Hybrid integration of LLMs and formal models is key to overcoming coordination challenges in robot teams while retaining flexibility and efficiency.

Abstract: Coordinating heterogeneous robot teams from free-form natural-language
instructions is hard. Language-only planners struggle with long-horizon
coordination and hallucination, while purely formal methods require
closed-world models. We present FLEET, a hybrid decentralized framework that
turns language into optimized multi-robot schedules. An LLM front-end produces
(i) a task graph with durations and precedence and (ii) a capability-aware
robot--task fitness matrix; a formal back-end solves a makespan-minimization
problem while the underlying robots execute their free-form subtasks with
agentic closed-loop control. Across multiple free-form language-guided autonomy
coordination benchmarks, FLEET improves success over state of the art
generative planners on two-agent teams across heterogeneous tasks. Ablations
show that mixed integer linear programming (MILP) primarily improves temporal
structure, while LLM-derived fitness is decisive for capability-coupled tasks;
together they deliver the highest overall performance. We demonstrate the
translation to real world challenges with hardware trials using a pair of
quadruped robots with disjoint capabilities.

*Girolamo Oddo,Roberto Nuca,Matteo Parsani*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces a lightweight data-driven model for predicting vehicle behavior under limited information, achieving high accuracy and robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Typically, vehicle dynamic models demand detailed structural information often unavailable in autonomous driving applications, necessitating effective models under data scarcity.

Method: The paper employs a lightweight encoder-decoder architecture with Gate Recurrent Unit layers to predict future vehicle states based on historical data and control actions.

Result: The model achieves under 2.6% mean relative error in extreme conditions and demonstrates robustness to noisy inputs.

Conclusion: The approach offers a data-driven, physically consistent solution for modeling vehicles without relying on detailed structural or physical information.

Abstract: Developing a dynamic model for a high-performance vehicle is a complex
problem that requires extensive structural information about the system under
analysis. This information is often unavailable to those who did not design the
vehicle and represents a typical issue in autonomous driving applications,
which are frequently developed on top of existing vehicles; therefore, vehicle
models are developed under conditions of information scarcity. This paper
proposes a lightweight encoder-decoder model based on Gate Recurrent Unit
layers to correlate the vehicle's future state with its past states, measured
onboard, and control actions the driver performs. The results demonstrate that
the model achieves a maximum mean relative error below 2.6% in extreme dynamic
conditions. It also shows good robustness when subject to noisy input data
across the interested frequency components. Furthermore, being entirely
data-driven and free from physical constraints, the model exhibits physical
consistency in the output signals, such as longitudinal and lateral
accelerations, yaw rate, and the vehicle's longitudinal velocity.

*Cael Yasutake,Zachary Kingston,Brian Plancher*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces HJCD-IK, a GPU-accelerated hybrid solver for inverse kinematics, achieving improved accuracy, speed, and efficiency compared to existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for inverse kinematics face limitations: analytical solvers are restricted to certain systems, while numerical optimization approaches are computationally costly and prone to local minima. Emerging GPU-based solutions need improvement in convergence and sampling quality.

Method: HJCD-IK combines an orientation-aware greedy coordinate descent initialization with a Jacobian-based polishing routine, leveraging GPU acceleration for improved performance.

Result: HJCD-IK achieves superior convergence speed, accuracy, and efficiency, often outperforming state-of-the-art solvers both in accuracy-latency balance and sample distribution quality.

Conclusion: The proposed method significantly advances the state-of-the-art in IK solving, and the open-source release aims to benefit the robotics community.

Abstract: Inverse Kinematics (IK) is a core problem in robotics, in which joint
configurations are found to achieve a desired end-effector pose. Although
analytical solvers are fast and efficient, they are limited to systems with low
degrees-of-freedom and specific topological structures. Numerical
optimization-based approaches are more general, but suffer from high
computational costs and frequent convergence to spurious local minima. Recent
efforts have explored the use of GPUs to combine sampling and optimization to
enhance both the accuracy and speed of IK solvers. We build on this recent
literature and introduce HJCD-IK, a GPU-accelerated, sampling-based hybrid
solver that combines an orientation-aware greedy coordinate descent
initialization scheme with a Jacobian-based polishing routine. This design
enables our solver to improve both convergence speed and overall accuracy as
compared to the state-of-the-art, consistently finding solutions along the
accuracy-latency Pareto frontier and often achieving order-of-magnitude gains.
In addition, our method produces a broad distribution of high-quality samples,
yielding the lowest maximum mean discrepancy. We release our code open-source
for the benefit of the community.

### [409] [AVO: Amortized Value Optimization for Contact Mode Switching in Multi-Finger Manipulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07548)
*Adam Hung,Fan Yang,Abhinav Kumar,Sergio Aguilera Marinovic,Soshi Iba,Rana Soltani Zarrin,Dmitry Berenson*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces Amortized Value Optimization (AVO), a method that uses a learned value function to enhance trajectory optimization for dexterous manipulation tasks, reducing computation by up to 50% while improving task performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Optimizing dexterous manipulation tasks one sub-task at a time is computationally demanding and often results in suboptimal performance due to the lack of consideration for future sub-tasks.

Method: The authors propose AVO, a method that incorporates a learned value function into trajectory optimization. This function predicts the total future task performance and provides gradients to guide optimization across sub-tasks.

Result: AVO was validated on a screwdriver grasping and turning task, improving task performance and cutting computational costs by 50% in both simulations and real-world experiments.

Conclusion: AVO effectively addresses the challenges in dexterous manipulation by bridging sub-tasks and reducing computational demands, showcasing a promising approach for improving performance in such tasks.

Abstract: Dexterous manipulation tasks often require switching between different
contact modes, such as rolling, sliding, sticking, or non-contact contact
modes. When formulating dexterous manipulation tasks as a trajectory
optimization problem, a common approach is to decompose these tasks into
sub-tasks for each contact mode, which are each solved independently.
Optimizing each sub-task independently can limit performance, as optimizing
contact points, contact forces, or other variables without information about
future sub-tasks can place the system in a state from which it is challenging
to make progress on subsequent sub-tasks. Further, optimizing these sub-tasks
is very computationally expensive. To address these challenges, we propose
Amortized Value Optimization (AVO), which introduces a learned value function
that predicts the total future task performance. By incorporating this value
function into the cost of the trajectory optimization at each planning step,
the value function gradients guide the optimizer toward states that minimize
the cost in future sub-tasks. This effectively bridges separately optimized
sub-tasks, and accelerates the optimization by reducing the amount of online
computation needed. We validate AVO on a screwdriver grasping and turning task
in both simulation and real world experiments, and show improved performance
even with 50% less computational budget compared to trajectory optimization
without the value function.

### [410] [Inspection Planning Primitives with Implicit Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07611)
*Jingyang You,Hanna Kurniawati,Lashika Medagoda*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces Inspection Planning Primitives with Implicit Models (IPIM) that allow sampling-based inspection planners to work directly with Neural Signed Distance Functions (SDFs), enabling efficient memory use while maintaining trajectory quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Efficient inspection planning is crucial due to the aging and increasing complexity of infrastructures, which require safety maintenance despite challenging computational and memory constraints.

Method: The authors propose a set of primitives, called IPIM, that allow sampling-based planners to operate solely with implicit environmental models represented by neural Signed Distance Functions (SDFs) instead of explicit models, avoiding frequent transformations.

Result: IPIM enables a rudimentary planner to generate inspection trajectories of comparable quality to state-of-the-art methods while reducing memory usage by up to 70 times in tests involving real-world complex structures.

Conclusion: IPIM demonstrates that implicit model-based inspection planning can drastically reduce memory usage without compromising trajectory quality, offering a promising solution for complex infrastructure inspections.

Abstract: The aging and increasing complexity of infrastructures make efficient
inspection planning more critical in ensuring safety. Thanks to sampling-based
motion planning, many inspection planners are fast. However, they often require
huge memory. This is particularly true when the structure under inspection is
large and complex, consisting of many struts and pillars of various geometry
and sizes. Such structures can be represented efficiently using implicit
models, such as neural Signed Distance Functions (SDFs). However, most
primitive computations used in sampling-based inspection planner have been
designed to work efficiently with explicit environment models, which in turn
requires the planner to use explicit environment models or performs frequent
transformations between implicit and explicit environment models during
planning. This paper proposes a set of primitive computations, called
Inspection Planning Primitives with Implicit Models (IPIM), that enable
sampling-based inspection planners to entirely use neural SDFs representation
during planning. Evaluation on three scenarios, including inspection of a
complex real-world structure with over 92M triangular mesh faces, indicates
that even a rudimentary sampling-based planner with IPIM can generate
inspection trajectories of similar quality to those generated by the
state-of-the-art planner, while using up to 70x less memory than the
state-of-the-art inspection planner.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper introduces GATO, a GPU-accelerated batched trajectory optimization solver that achieves real-time performance for moderate batch sizes, addressing limitations in existing MPC solutions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the computational demands of solving batch nonlinear trajectory optimization problems in real-time for Model Predictive Control (MPC) applications.

Method: The authors developed GATO, a solver co-designed across algorithms, software, and GPU computational hardware that employs a combination of block-, warp-, and thread-level parallelism within and across optimization solves to enhance computational efficiency.

Result: GATO achieves significant speedups of 18-21x over CPU baselines and 1.4-16x over GPU baselines in benchmarks, improves disturbance rejection and convergence in case studies, and is validated on industrial robotic hardware.

Conclusion: GATO fills the gap in MPC solver performance by delivering real-time throughput for moderate batch size regimes, making it a valuable tool for robotics and control systems. The system is made open-source to encourage adoption and reproducibility.

Abstract: While Model Predictive Control (MPC) delivers strong performance across
robotics applications, solving the underlying (batches of) nonlinear trajectory
optimization (TO) problems online remains computationally demanding. Existing
GPU-accelerated approaches typically (i) parallelize a single solve to meet
real-time deadlines, (ii) scale to very large batches at slower-than-real-time
rates, or (iii) achieve speed by restricting model generality (e.g., point-mass
dynamics or a single linearization). This leaves a large gap in solver
performance for many state-of-the-art MPC applications that require real-time
batches of tens to low-hundreds of solves. As such, we present GATO, an open
source, GPU-accelerated, batched TO solver co-designed across algorithm,
software, and computational hardware to deliver real-time throughput for these
moderate batch size regimes. Our approach leverages a combination of block-,
warp-, and thread-level parallelism within and across solves for ultra-high
performance. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through a
combination of: simulated benchmarks showing speedups of 18-21x over CPU
baselines and 1.4-16x over GPU baselines as batch size increases; case studies
highlighting improved disturbance rejection and convergence behavior; and
finally a validation on hardware using an industrial manipulator. We open
source GATO to support reproducibility and adoption.

TL;DR: SPaSM is a GPU-parallelized framework for real-time sequential robot manipulation with a $4000×$ speedup compared to traditional methods, achieving results in milliseconds.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome computational limitations in solving real-time, large-scale sequential robot manipulation tasks with collision-free trajectories and geometric constraints.

Method: SPaSM employs fully GPU-parallelized CUDA kernels for particle optimization, removing CPU coordination, and integrates sampling and gradient-based optimization in a two-stage approach.

Result: SPaSM achieves solution times in milliseconds with a 100% success rate, offering a 4000× speedup over previous approaches.

Conclusion: SPaSM demonstrates the capability to achieve scalable, real-time trajectory optimization for robot manipulation tasks by leveraging GPU acceleration effectively.

Abstract: Sequential robot manipulation tasks require finding collision-free
trajectories that satisfy geometric constraints across multiple object
interactions in potentially high-dimensional configuration spaces. Solving
these problems in real-time and at large scales has remained out of reach due
to computational requirements. Recently, GPU-based acceleration has shown
promising results, but prior methods achieve limited performance due to CPU-GPU
data transfer overhead and complex logic that prevents full hardware
utilization. To this end, we present SPaSM (Sampling Particle optimization for
Sequential Manipulation), a fully GPU-parallelized framework that compiles
constraint evaluation, sampling, and gradient-based optimization into optimized
CUDA kernels for end-to-end trajectory optimization without CPU coordination.
The method consists of a two-stage particle optimization strategy: first
solving placement constraints through massively parallel sampling, then lifting
solutions to full trajectory optimization in joint space. Unlike hierarchical
approaches, SPaSM jointly optimizes object placements and robot trajectories to
handle scenarios where motion feasibility constrains placement options.
Experimental evaluation on challenging benchmarks demonstrates solution times
in the realm of $\textbf{milliseconds}$ with a 100% success rate; a
$4000\times$ speedup compared to existing approaches.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper introduces Emerging-Barrier Model-Based Diffusion (EB-MBD) to address catastrophic performance degradation when constraints are applied to Model-Based Diffusion, achieving better solution quality and reduced computation time.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Constraints in Model-Based Diffusion can cause severe inefficiencies, especially in simulations like collision avoidance or underwater manipulator tasks, due to difficulty in approximating the score function.

Method: The proposed method uses emerging barrier functions inspired by interior point methods to progressively enforce constraints, avoiding the need for computationally expensive projections, and scheduling barrier parameters based on sampling liveliness.

Result: The proposed EB-MBD method improves solution quality for constrained systems in tasks like 2D collision avoidance and underwater manipulation, while requiring significantly less computation time.

Conclusion: By introducing emerging barriers, EB-MBD offers efficient handling of constraints in Model-Based Diffusion, resulting in better performance and lower computational costs.

Abstract: We propose enforcing constraints on Model-Based Diffusion by introducing
emerging barrier functions inspired by interior point methods. We show that
constraints on Model-Based Diffusion can lead to catastrophic performance
degradation, even on simple 2D systems due to sample inefficiency in the Monte
Carlo approximation of the score function. We introduce Emerging-Barrier
Model-Based Diffusion (EB-MBD) which uses progressively introduced barrier
constraints to avoid these problems, significantly improving solution quality,
without the need for computationally expensive operations such as projections.
We analyze the sampling liveliness of samples each iteration to inform barrier
parameter scheduling choice. We demonstrate results for 2D collision avoidance
and a 3D underwater manipulator system and show that our method achieves lower
cost solutions than Model-Based Diffusion, and requires orders of magnitude
less computation time than projection based methods.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper proposes a probabilistically safe planning and control strategy for bipedal robots to navigate rough terrains with uncertain elevations, leveraging Gaussian Process regression and Conformal Prediction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable bipedal robots to safely and effectively traverse rough terrains where elevation is uncertain.

Method: The framework uses Model Predictive Control (MPC), Gaussian Process regression, and Conformal Prediction to estimate terrain and account for uncertainty. It introduces contraction-based reachable tubes and a flywheel torque control law to ensure robust locomotion.

Result: The authors demonstrated the approach through physics-based simulations of a bipedal robot (Digit) in MuJoCo, showing the feasibility of navigating uncertain terrains with safety guarantees.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that the proposed probabilistic planning and control framework ensures both safety and goal reachability for bipedal robots navigating uncertain terrains.

Abstract: We address the challenge of enabling bipedal robots to traverse rough terrain
by developing probabilistically safe planning and control strategies that
ensure dynamic feasibility and centroidal robustness under terrain uncertainty.
Specifically, we propose a high-level Model Predictive Control (MPC) navigation
framework for a bipedal robot with a specified confidence level of safety that
(i) enables safe traversal toward a desired goal location across a terrain map
with uncertain elevations, and (ii) formally incorporates uncertainty bounds
into the centroidal dynamics of locomotion control. To model the rough terrain,
we employ Gaussian Process (GP) regression to estimate elevation maps and
leverage Conformal Prediction (CP) to construct calibrated confidence intervals
that capture the true terrain elevation. Building on this, we formulate
contraction-based reachable tubes that explicitly account for terrain
uncertainty, ensuring state convergence and tube invariance. In addition, we
introduce a contraction-based flywheel torque control law for the reduced-order
Linear Inverted Pendulum Model (LIPM), which stabilizes the angular momentum
about the center-of-mass (CoM). This formulation provides both probabilistic
safety and goal reachability guarantees. For a given confidence level, we
establish the forward invariance of the proposed torque control law by
demonstrating exponential stabilization of the actual CoM phase-space
trajectory and the desired trajectory prescribed by the high-level planner.
Finally, we evaluate the effectiveness of our planning framework through
physics-based simulations of the Digit bipedal robot in MuJoCo.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper introduces a framework for studying and injecting perception-related hallucination failures in autonomous vehicles to evaluate their safety risks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of existing fault injection studies in AV systems, which are often siloed by targeting specific sensors or perception modules and lack generalizability.

Method: The study reframes perception failures as component-agnostic hallucinations and develops a configurable framework to induce six types of hallucinations in a simulator. Over 18,350 simulations were executed in a specific AV traffic scenario.

Result: The experiments validate the framework statistically and highlight the safety risks of different hallucination types. Notably, hallucinations like perceptual latency and drift significantly increase collision risks.

Conclusion: The proposed hallucination injection framework is a scalable, validated, and interoperable tool that aids in AV safety validation, potentially accelerating their development while reinforcing fault tolerance and resilience.

Abstract: Perception failures in autonomous vehicles (AV) remain a major safety concern
because they are the basis for many accidents. To study how these failures
affect safety, researchers typically inject artificial faults into hardware or
software components and observe the outcomes. However, existing fault injection
studies often target a single sensor or machine perception (MP) module,
resulting in siloed frameworks that are difficult to generalize or integrate
into unified simulation environments. This work addresses that limitation by
reframing perception failures as hallucinations, false perceptions that distort
an AV situational awareness and may trigger unsafe control actions. Since
hallucinations describe only observable effects, this abstraction enables
analysis independent of specific sensors or algorithms, focusing instead on how
their faults manifest along the MP pipeline. Building on this concept, we
propose a configurable, component-agnostic hallucination injection framework
that induces six plausible hallucination types in an iterative open-source
simulator. More than 18,350 simulations were executed in which hallucinations
were injected while AVs crossed an unsignalized transverse street with traffic.
The results statistically validate the framework and quantify the impact of
each hallucination type on collisions and near misses. Certain hallucinations,
such as perceptual latency and drift, significantly increase the risk of
collision in the scenario tested, validating the proposed paradigm can stress
the AV system safety. The framework offers a scalable, statistically validated,
component agnostic, and fully interoperable toolset that simplifies and
accelerates AV safety validations, even those with novel MP architectures and
components. It can potentially reduce the time-to-market of AV and lay the
foundation for future research on fault tolerance, and resilient AV design.

*YuHang Tang,Yixuan Lou,Pengfei Han,Haoming Song,Xinyi Ye,Dong Wang,Bin Zhao*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: TrajSkill is a framework for transferring human manipulation skills to robots using sparse optical flow trajectories, visual, and textual inputs without relying on paired datasets or crafted rewards.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge the embodiment gap between human demonstrations and robot manipulators for scalable and generalizable manipulation learning.

Method: Represents human motions using sparse optical flow trajectories as embodiment-agnostic cues and synthesizes robot manipulation videos and executable actions conditioned on visual and textual data.

Result: Outperforms the state-of-the-art on simulation data by significantly reducing FVD (39.6%) and KVD (36.6%) and achieving up to 16.7% increased success rate in cross-embodiment skill transfer.

Conclusion: TrajSkill effectively enables robots to learn manipulation skills directly from human videos, demonstrating scalability and practical cross-embodiment applicability in both simulation and real-world scenarios.

Abstract: Learning manipulation skills from human demonstration videos presents a
promising yet challenging problem, primarily due to the significant embodiment
gap between human body and robot manipulators. Existing methods rely on paired
datasets or hand-crafted rewards, which limit scalability and generalization.
We propose TrajSkill, a framework for Trajectory Conditioned Cross-embodiment
Skill Transfer, enabling robots to acquire manipulation skills directly from
human demonstration videos. Our key insight is to represent human motions as
sparse optical flow trajectories, which serve as embodiment-agnostic motion
cues by removing morphological variations while preserving essential dynamics.
Conditioned on these trajectories together with visual and textual inputs,
TrajSkill jointly synthesizes temporally consistent robot manipulation videos
and translates them into executable actions, thereby achieving cross-embodiment
skill transfer. Extensive experiments are conducted, and the results on
simulation data (MetaWorld) show that TrajSkill reduces FVD by 39.6\% and KVD
by 36.6\% compared with the state-of-the-art, and improves cross-embodiment
success rate by up to 16.7\%. Real-robot experiments in kitchen manipulation
tasks further validate the effectiveness of our approach, demonstrating
practical human-to-robot skill transfer across embodiments.

*Massimiliano de Leoni,Faizan Ahmed Khan,Simone Agostinelli*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A clustering-based technique is introduced to extract routine logs from noisy UI logs more accurately than existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Develop a method to discover routine-type models for robotic process automation, overcoming challenges with noise in current techniques.

Method: Proposed a clustering-based technique and experimentally evaluated it on nine UI logs with varying levels of noise.

Result: The technique outperformed existing approaches in extracting accurate routine logs, particularly in noisy scenarios.

Conclusion: This approach enhances the extraction of routine logs and supports robust robotic process automation, even in inconsistent scenarios.

Abstract: Robotic Process Mining focuses on the identification of the routine types
performed by human resources through a User Interface. The ultimate goal is to
discover routine-type models to enable robotic process automation. The
discovery of routine-type models requires the provision of a routine log.
Unfortunately, the vast majority of existing works do not directly focus on
enabling the model discovery, limiting themselves to extracting the set of
actions that are part of the routines. They were also not evaluated in
scenarios characterized by inconsistent routine execution, hereafter referred
to as noise, which reflects natural variability and occasional errors in human
performance. This paper presents a clustering-based technique that aims to
extract routine logs. Experiments were conducted on nine UI logs from the
literature with different levels of injected noise. Our technique was compared
with existing techniques, most of which are not meant to discover routine logs
but were adapted for the purpose. The results were evaluated through standard
state-of-the-art metrics, showing that we can extract more accurate routine
logs than what the state of the art could, especially in the presence of noise.

*Yandu Chen,Kefan Gu,Yuqing Wen,Yucheng Zhao,Tiancai Wang,Liqiang Nie*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: IntentionVLA improves robotic reasoning and perception capabilities, enabling efficient inference and outperforming current models in complex intention-based interactions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current Vision-Language-Action models struggle with implicit human intention reasoning for real-world interactions.

Method: IntentionVLA introduces curriculum training with reasoning-focused data and uses compact contextual guidance during inference.

Result: Outperformed baselines by significant margins, achieving up to double the success rate in complex tasks and 40% success in zero-shot human-robot interaction.

Conclusion: IntentionVLA sets a promising direction for advanced human-robot interaction systems by improving generative reasoning and action coupling.

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models leverage pretrained vision-language
models (VLMs) to couple perception with robotic control, offering a promising
path toward general-purpose embodied intelligence. However, current SOTA VLAs
are primarily pretrained on multimodal tasks with limited relevance to embodied
scenarios, and then finetuned to map explicit instructions to actions.
Consequently, due to the lack of reasoning-intensive pretraining and
reasoning-guided manipulation, these models are unable to perform implicit
human intention reasoning required for complex, real-world interactions. To
overcome these limitations, we propose \textbf{IntentionVLA}, a VLA framework
with a curriculum training paradigm and an efficient inference mechanism. Our
proposed method first leverages carefully designed reasoning data that combine
intention inference, spatial grounding, and compact embodied reasoning,
endowing the model with both reasoning and perception capabilities. In the
following finetuning stage, IntentionVLA employs the compact reasoning outputs
as contextual guidance for action generation, enabling fast inference under
indirect instructions. Experimental results show that IntentionVLA
substantially outperforms $\pi_0$, achieving 18\% higher success rates with
direct instructions and 28\% higher than ECoT under intention instructions. On
out-of-distribution intention tasks, IntentionVLA achieves over twice the
success rate of all baselines, and further enables zero-shot human-robot
interaction with 40\% success rate. These results highlight IntentionVLA as a
promising paradigm for next-generation human-robot interaction (HRI) systems.

*Grace Cai,Nithin Parepally,Laura Zheng,Ming C. Lin*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces GM3, a physics-based model for micro-mobility vehicle dynamics that improves on the Kinematic Bicycle Model by considering tire slip, load transfer, and vehicle lean.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing modeling tools for micro-mobility vehicles lack unified physics-based formulations, failing to capture tire slip, load transfer, and rider/vehicle lean dynamics.

Method: The researchers propose the Generalized Micro-mobility Model (GM3), which uses tire brush representations to support arbitrary wheel configurations and introduces a model-agnostic simulation framework for analysis.

Result: The GM3 was validated empirically using data from the Stanford Drone Dataset, specifically analyzing biker, skater, and cart dynamics in roundabout scenarios.

Conclusion: GM3 provides a unified and accurate tool for modeling micro-mobility vehicles, addressing limitations in existing models and enhancing urban traffic simulations and autonomous vehicle training.

Abstract: Modeling the dynamics of micro-mobility vehicles (MMV) is becoming
increasingly important for training autonomous vehicle systems and building
urban traffic simulations. However, mainstream tools rely on variants of the
Kinematic Bicycle Model (KBM) or mode-specific physics that miss tire slip,
load transfer, and rider/vehicle lean. To our knowledge, no unified,
physics-based model captures these dynamics across the full range of common
MMVs and wheel layouts. We propose the "Generalized Micro-mobility Model"
(GM3), a tire-level formulation based on the tire brush representation that
supports arbitrary wheel configurations, including single/double track and
multi-wheel platforms. We introduce an interactive model-agnostic simulation
framework that decouples vehicle/layout specification from dynamics to compare
the GM3 with the KBM and other models, consisting of fixed step RK4
integration, human-in-the-loop and scripted control, real-time trajectory
traces and logging for analysis. We also empirically validate the GM3 on the
Stanford Drone Dataset's deathCircle (roundabout) scene for biker, skater, and
cart classes.

### [420] [DM1: MeanFlow with Dispersive Regularization for 1-Step Robotic Manipulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07865)
*Guowei Zou,Haitao Wang,Hejun Wu,Yukun Qian,Yuhang Wang,Weibing Li*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: DM1, a novel flow-based generative model for robotic manipulation, integrates dispersive regularization to counter representation collapse, achieving faster and more accurate performance in both simulation and real-world tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aimed to address the representation collapse issue in flow-based generative models for robotic manipulation tasks, which hampers precise control capabilities.

Method: The authors designed DM1, a flow matching framework combining MeanFlow and dispersive regularization applied across intermediate embedding layers to diversify representations without adding complexity.

Result: DM1 showed 20-40x faster inference speed and 10-20% higher success rates on RoboMimic benchmarks compared to baselines, also achieving 99% success in the Lift task. The model effectively transferred from simulation to physical robots.

Conclusion: DM1 proves that leveraging representation regularization in flow-based generative models enhances robotic manipulation efficiency and robustness, offering a simple yet effective solution for practical deployment.

Abstract: The ability to learn multi-modal action distributions is indispensable for
robotic manipulation policies to perform precise and robust control. Flow-based
generative models have recently emerged as a promising solution to learning
distributions of actions, offering one-step action generation and thus
achieving much higher sampling efficiency compared to diffusion-based methods.
However, existing flow-based policies suffer from representation collapse, the
inability to distinguish similar visual representations, leading to failures in
precise manipulation tasks. We propose DM1 (MeanFlow with Dispersive
Regularization for One-Step Robotic Manipulation), a novel flow matching
framework that integrates dispersive regularization into MeanFlow to prevent
collapse while maintaining one-step efficiency. DM1 employs multiple dispersive
regularization variants across different intermediate embedding layers,
encouraging diverse representations across training batches without introducing
additional network modules or specialized training procedures. Experiments on
RoboMimic benchmarks show that DM1 achieves 20-40 times faster inference (0.07s
vs. 2-3.5s) and improves success rates by 10-20 percentage points, with the
Lift task reaching 99% success over 85% of the baseline. Real-robot deployment
on a Franka Panda further validates that DM1 transfers effectively from
simulation to the physical world. To the best of our knowledge, this is the
first work to leverage representation regularization to enable flow-based
policies to achieve strong performance in robotic manipulation, establishing a
simple yet powerful approach for efficient and robust manipulation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current underwater robots lack the ability to autonomously perform multiple tasks due to scarce large-scale and high-quality underwater datasets.

Method: The authors present USIM, a new multi-task dataset, and U0, a VLA model that incorporates binocular vision, sensor fusion, and a convolution-attention-based module to enhance performance in underwater environments.

Result: U0 achieves an 80% success rate across various tasks and improves mobile manipulation performance by reducing target distance by 21.2% compared to baseline methods.

Conclusion: The proposed USIM and U0 demonstrate that VLA models effectively enhance underwater robotic applications and pave the way for intelligent, general underwater robots capable of scalable datasets and improved autonomy.

Abstract: Underwater environments present unique challenges for robotic operation,
including complex hydrodynamics, limited visibility, and constrained
communication. Although data-driven approaches have advanced embodied
intelligence in terrestrial robots and enabled task-specific autonomous
underwater robots, developing underwater intelligence capable of autonomously
performing multiple tasks remains highly challenging, as large-scale,
high-quality underwater datasets are still scarce. To address these
limitations, we introduce USIM, a simulation-based multi-task
Vision-Language-Action (VLA) dataset for underwater robots. USIM comprises over
561K frames from 1,852 trajectories, totaling approximately 15.6 hours of
BlueROV2 interactions across 20 tasks in 9 diverse scenarios, ranging from
visual navigation to mobile manipulation. Building upon this dataset, we
propose U0, a VLA model for general underwater robots, which integrates
binocular vision and other sensor modalities through multimodal fusion, and
further incorporates a convolution-attention-based perception focus enhancement
module (CAP) to improve spatial understanding and mobile manipulation. Across
tasks such as inspection, obstacle avoidance, scanning, and dynamic tracking,
the framework achieves a success rate of 80%, while in challenging mobile
manipulation tasks, it reduces the distance to the target by 21.2% compared
with baseline methods, demonstrating its effectiveness. USIM and U0 show that
VLA models can be effectively applied to underwater robotic applications,
providing a foundation for scalable dataset construction, improved task
autonomy, and the practical realization of intelligent general underwater
robots.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Develop a navigation system capable of operating safely and socially within human-populated indoor environments relying only on egocentric RGB-D data and odometry.

Method: They augmented the existing Falcon model with a Proactive Risk Perception Module to predict collision risks and enhance spatial awareness for socially compliant navigation.

Result: The proposed system was evaluated on the Social-HM3D benchmark, demonstrating competitive performance by achieving 2nd place out of 16 teams.

Conclusion: Integrating proactive risk perception significantly enhances social compliance and navigation efficiency in crowded, dynamic environments.

Abstract: In this report, we describe the technical details of our submission to the
IROS 2025 RoboSense Challenge Social Navigation Track. This track focuses on
developing RGBD-based perception and navigation systems that enable autonomous
agents to navigate safely, efficiently, and socially compliantly in dynamic
human-populated indoor environments. The challenge requires agents to operate
from an egocentric perspective using only onboard sensors including RGB-D
observations and odometry, without access to global maps or privileged
information, while maintaining social norm compliance such as safe distances
and collision avoidance. Building upon the Falcon model, we introduce a
Proactive Risk Perception Module to enhance social navigation performance. Our
approach augments Falcon with collision risk understanding that learns to
predict distance-based collision risk scores for surrounding humans, which
enables the agent to develop more robust spatial awareness and proactive
collision avoidance behaviors. The evaluation on the Social-HM3D benchmark
demonstrates that our method improves the agent's ability to maintain personal
space compliance while navigating toward goals in crowded indoor scenes with
dynamic human agents, achieving 2nd place among 16 participating teams in the
challenge.

TL;DR: The paper introduces DualTHOR, a simulator, and Proprio-MLLM, a model to improve planning for dual-arm humanoid robots in complex tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Limitations of current Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) in supporting dual-arm humanoid robots due to lack of simulation platforms and insufficient embodiment awareness.

Method: Developed DualTHOR simulator and proposed Proprio-MLLM, incorporating proprioceptive information with motion-based position embedding and a cross-spatial encoder.

Result: Proprio-MLLM achieves a 19.75% average improvement in planning performance over existing MLLMs in the simulator environment.

Conclusion: The study advances embodied intelligence in humanoid robotics by providing a novel simulation platform and an improved MLLM-based planning model.

Abstract: In recent years, Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated
the ability to serve as high-level planners, enabling robots to follow complex
human instructions. However, their effectiveness, especially in long-horizon
tasks involving dual-arm humanoid robots, remains limited. This limitation
arises from two main challenges: (i) the absence of simulation platforms that
systematically support task evaluation and data collection for humanoid robots,
and (ii) the insufficient embodiment awareness of current MLLMs, which hinders
reasoning about dual-arm selection logic and body positions during planning. To
address these issues, we present DualTHOR, a new dual-arm humanoid simulator,
with continuous transition and a contingency mechanism. Building on this
platform, we propose Proprio-MLLM, a model that enhances embodiment awareness
by incorporating proprioceptive information with motion-based position
embedding and a cross-spatial encoder. Experiments show that, while existing
MLLMs struggle in this environment, Proprio-MLLM achieves an average
improvement of 19.75% in planning performance. Our work provides both an
essential simulation platform and an effective model to advance embodied
intelligence in humanoid robotics. The code is available at

TL;DR: The paper introduces GRACE, a framework for enabling robots to interpret and execute manipulation tasks using Vision-Language Models (VLMs) combined with mathematically defined concepts to bridge semantic understanding and physical execution.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The challenge lies in enabling precise and generalized manipulation in unstructured environments for robots, given the gap between high-level semantic reasoning and physical execution.

Method: GRACE employs Vision-Language Models supported by Executable Analytic Concepts (EAC), transforming language instructions and visual cues into actionable robotics commands such as grasp and motion trajectories.

Result: GRACE demonstrates strong zero-shot generalization capabilities in both simulated and real-world environments, effectively performing manipulation without task-specific training.

Conclusion: The framework successfully bridges semantic reasoning with physical control, providing a unified and interpretable approach for robot manipulation tasks.

Abstract: Enabling robots to perform precise and generalized manipulation in
unstructured environments remains a fundamental challenge in embodied AI. While
Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in
semantic reasoning and task planning, a significant gap persists between their
high-level understanding and the precise physical execution required for
real-world manipulation. To bridge this "semantic-to-physical" gap, we
introduce GRACE, a novel framework that grounds VLM-based reasoning through
executable analytic concepts (EAC)-mathematically defined blueprints that
encode object affordances, geometric constraints, and semantics of
manipulation. Our approach integrates a structured policy scaffolding pipeline
that turn natural language instructions and visual information into an
instantiated EAC, from which we derive grasp poses, force directions and plan
physically feasible motion trajectory for robot execution. GRACE thus provides
a unified and interpretable interface between high-level instruction
understanding and low-level robot control, effectively enabling precise and
generalizable manipulation through semantic-physical grounding. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that GRACE achieves strong zero-shot generalization
across a variety of articulated objects in both simulated and real-world
environments, without requiring task-specific training.

*Gaofeng Li,Peisen Xu,Ruize Wang,Qi Ye,Jiming Chen,Dezhen Song,Yanlong Huang*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper proposes a method to address orientation learning problems in non-Euclidean spaces by introducing an Angle-Axis Space representation, improving the handling of multiple local constraints and angular acceleration minimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Orientation learning on the SO(3) manifold faces challenges due to its non-Euclidean nature, causing distortions and making it difficult to incorporate multiple local constraints simultaneously.

Method: The method involves generating multiple trajectories considering different local constraints and using a weighted average mechanism in Angle-Axis Space for smooth trajectory fusion.

Result: Experiments demonstrate the proposed method's ability to adapt orientations via desired points, handle angular acceleration constraints, and simultaneously incorporate multiple local constraints with reduced acceleration costs.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively resolves distortion issues for orientation learning in SO(3), enabling the use of Euclidean learning algorithms in non-Euclidean spaces while delivering improved results when handling constraints.

Abstract: Orientation learning plays a pivotal role in many tasks. However, the
rotation group SO(3) is a Riemannian manifold. As a result, the distortion
caused by non-Euclidean geometric nature introduces difficulties to the
incorporation of local constraints, especially for the simultaneous
incorporation of multiple local constraints. To address this issue, we propose
the Angle-Axis Space-based orientation representation method to solve several
orientation learning problems, including orientation adaptation and
minimization of angular acceleration. Specifically, we propose a weighted
average mechanism in SO(3) based on the angle-axis representation method. Our
main idea is to generate multiple trajectories by considering different local
constraints at different basepoints. Then these multiple trajectories are fused
to generate a smooth trajectory by our proposed weighted average mechanism,
achieving the goal to incorporate multiple local constraints simultaneously.
Compared with existing solution, ours can address the distortion issue and make
the off-theshelf Euclidean learning algorithm be re-applicable in non-Euclidean
space. Simulation and Experimental evaluations validate that our solution can
not only adapt orientations towards arbitrary desired via-points and cope with
angular acceleration constraints, but also incorporate multiple local
constraints simultaneously to achieve extra benefits, e.g., achieving smaller
acceleration costs.

these limitations and meet the growing complexity of real-world manipulation
tasks. Collected by FastUMI, a novel robotic system featuring a modular,

*Shiyuan Yin,Chenjia Bai,Zihao Zhang,Junwei Jin,Xinxin Zhang,Chi Zhang,Xuelong Li*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: LLMs are effective in reasoning for robotic planning but face challenges from hallucinations. The proposed CURE approach decomposes uncertainty to improve reliability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs are strong in understanding and planning but generate misleading hallucinations, requiring better uncertainty estimation methods.

Method: CURE estimates uncertainties separately (epistemic and intrinsic), using task clarity/familiarity measures and methods like random network distillation.

Result: In experiments with kitchen manipulation and tabletop rearrangement, CURE outperformed existing methods in aligning uncertainty estimates with actual outcomes.

Conclusion: The CURE approach enhances LLM-based planning by better handling uncertainties, making it more aligned and reliable for embodied planning tasks.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) demonstrate advanced reasoning abilities,
enabling robots to understand natural language instructions and generate
high-level plans with appropriate grounding. However, LLM hallucinations
present a significant challenge, often leading to overconfident yet potentially
misaligned or unsafe plans. While researchers have explored uncertainty
estimation to improve the reliability of LLM-based planning, existing studies
have not sufficiently differentiated between epistemic and intrinsic
uncertainty, limiting the effectiveness of uncertainty estimation. In this
paper, we present Combined Uncertainty estimation for Reliable Embodied
planning (CURE), which decomposes the uncertainty into epistemic and intrinsic
uncertainty, each estimated separately. Furthermore, epistemic uncertainty is
subdivided into task clarity and task familiarity for more accurate evaluation.
The overall uncertainty assessments are obtained using random network
distillation and multi-layer perceptron regression heads driven by LLM
features. We validated our approach in two distinct experimental settings:
kitchen manipulation and tabletop rearrangement experiments. The results show
that, compared to existing methods, our approach yields uncertainty estimates
that are more closely aligned with the actual execution outcomes.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the global scarcity of expert sonographers, particularly in resource-limited regions, for liver disease diagnostics.

Method: Developed a 588g 6-DOF cable-driven robot integrated with an AI agent using multi-modal perception and memory attention to autonomously localize and scan liver structures.

Result: The system successfully acquired standard liver ultrasound images and detected pathologies in diverse environments and patient groups, including those in remote areas.

Conclusion: The technology provides reliable autonomous sonography in challenging scenarios, paving the way to improve diagnostics access in underserved regions.

Abstract: Liver disease is a major global health burden. While ultrasound is the
first-line diagnostic tool, liver sonography requires locating multiple
non-continuous planes from positions where target structures are often not
visible, for biometric assessment and lesion detection, requiring significant
expertise. However, expert sonographers are severely scarce in resource-limited
regions. Here, we develop an autonomous lightweight ultrasound robot comprising
an AI agent that integrates multi-modal perception with memory attention for
localization of unseen target structures, and a 588-gram 6-degrees-of-freedom
cable-driven robot. By mounting on the abdomen, the system enhances robustness
against motion. Our robot can autonomously acquire expert-level standard liver
ultrasound planes and detect pathology in patients, including two from Xining,
a 2261-meter-altitude city with limited medical resources. Our system performs
effectively on rapid-motion individuals and in wilderness environments. This
work represents the first demonstration of autonomous sonography across
multiple challenging scenarios, potentially transforming access to expert-level
diagnostics in underserved regions.

comprehensively evaluate 22 navigation agents, including state-of-the-art
navigation models and multimodal large language models. The evaluation results
lift the veil on spatial intelligence in embodied navigation. Furthermore, we
propose SNav, a new spatially intelligent navigation model. SNav outperforms
existing navigation agents on NavSpace and real robot tests, establishing a
strong baseline for future work.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the control challenges in real-world underconstrained Cable-Driven Parallel Robots (CDPRs) with limited time discretization.

Method: A comparative analysis between classical PID controllers and reinforcement learning algorithms (DDPG, PPO, TRPO) was conducted.

Result: TRPO showed the best performance, achieving the lowest RMS errors, robustness to large time intervals, and reduced computational demand.

Conclusion: TRPO is identified as a robust and effective solution for complex robotic control tasks, with potential for use in dynamic environments and hybrid control strategies.

Abstract: This study evaluates the performance of classical and modern control methods
for real-world Cable-Driven Parallel Robots (CDPRs), focusing on
underconstrained systems with limited time discretization. A comparative
analysis is conducted between classical PID controllers and modern
reinforcement learning algorithms, including Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient
(DDPG), Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), and Trust Region Policy
Optimization (TRPO). The results demonstrate that TRPO outperforms other
methods, achieving the lowest root mean square (RMS) errors across various
trajectories and exhibiting robustness to larger time intervals between control
updates. TRPO's ability to balance exploration and exploitation enables stable
control in noisy, real-world environments, reducing reliance on high-frequency
sensor feedback and computational demands. These findings highlight TRPO's
potential as a robust solution for complex robotic control tasks, with
implications for dynamic environments and future applications in sensor fusion

*Baoyang Chen,Xian Xu,Huamin Qu*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Airy is an artwork demonstrating how reinforcement-trained AI robots can achieve intuitive understanding through competitive fabric-snapping performances.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the safety, trust, and oversight concerns raised by opaque AI decision making in shared human spaces.

Method: The artwork stages a competition between two AI-driven robotic arms, using principles of competition, embodied familiarity, and sensor-to-sense mapping.

Result: Observations from five exhibitions revealed audiences could consistently interpret the robots' strategies and respond emotionally to their behaviors.

Conclusion: Sensory metaphors can effectively transform complex AI systems into accessible public interfaces.

Abstract: As industrial robots move into shared human spaces, their opaque decision
making threatens safety, trust, and public oversight. This artwork, Airy, asks
whether complex multi agent AI can become intuitively understandable by staging
a competition between two reinforcement trained robot arms that snap a bedsheet
skyward. Building on three design principles, competition as a clear metric
(who lifts higher), embodied familiarity (audiences recognize fabric snapping),
and sensor to sense mapping (robot cooperation or rivalry shown through forest
and weather projections), the installation gives viewers a visceral way to read
machine intent. Observations from five international exhibitions indicate that
audiences consistently read the robots' strategies, conflict, and cooperation
in real time, with emotional reactions that mirror the system's internal state.
The project shows how sensory metaphors can turn a black box into a public
interface.

*Filip Bečanović,Kosta Jovanović,Vincent Bonnet*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper proposes a fast and robust single-level inverse optimal control (IOC) method, significantly reducing computation time while maintaining resilience to noise.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing IOC methods are either too slow due to a bilevel approach or too sensitive to noise with fast but less robust methods.

Method: The authors reformulate IOC using a single-level approach, replacing the bilevel process while ensuring equivalent results. They tested this via numerical simulations of a human-like planar reaching task.

Result: The proposed single-level IOC method demonstrated a 15x reduction in computation time compared to classical bilevel methods, while also handling high noise levels effectively.

Conclusion: The single-level IOC reformulation is both computationally efficient and robust, making it a valuable alternative to traditional bilevel methods in human motion modeling.

Abstract: Inverse optimal control (IOC) allows the retrieval of optimal cost function
weights, or behavioral parameters, from human motion. The literature on IOC
uses methods that are either based on a slow bilevel process or a fast but
noise-sensitive minimization of optimality condition violation. Assuming
equality-constrained optimal control models of human motion, this article
presents a faster but robust approach to solving IOC using a single-level
reformulation of the bilevel method and yields equivalent results. Through
numerical experiments in simulation, we analyze the robustness to noise of the
proposed single-level reformulation to the bilevel IOC formulation with a
human-like planar reaching task that is used across recent studies. The
approach shows resilience to very large levels of noise and reduces the
computation time of the IOC on this task by a factor of 15 when compared to a
classical bilevel implementation.

*Bibekananda Patra,Rajeevlochana G. Chittawadigi,Sandipan Bandyopadhyay*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper proposes a CAD-based method to validate the largest collision-free sphere for a Stewart-Gough platform manipulator by automated pose adjustments and collision checks between manipulator legs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Ensuring the operational safety of spatial parallel manipulators by determining and validating the largest collision-free operational zone around a moving platform's orientation.

Method: The validation method uses the CAD software API to automate moving platform's position checks within the surface of a computed collision-free sphere. Each manipulator pose is analyzed for potential leg collisions.

Result: The method successfully validates precomputed collision-free spheres and estimates collision-free zones for any spatial parallel manipulator.

Conclusion: The approach provides a reliable way to check manipulator safety and extends its utility for broader applicability beyond precomputed spheres.

Abstract: This paper presents a method of validation of the size of the largest
collision-free sphere (CFS) of a 6-6 Stewart-Gough platform manipulator (SGPM)
for a given orientation of its moving platform (MP) using the Application
Programming Interface (API) of a CAD software. The position of the MP is
updated via the API in an automated manner over a set of samples within a shell
enclosing the surface of the CFS. For each pose of the manipulator, each pair
of legs is investigated for mutual collisions. The CFS is considered safe or
validated iff none of the points falling inside the CFS lead to a collision
between any pair of legs. This approach can not only validate the safety of a
precomputed CFS, but also estimate the same for any spatial parallel
manipulator.

*Jason Jabbour,Dong-Ki Kim,Max Smith,Jay Patrikar,Radhika Ghosal,Youhui Wang,Ali Agha,Vijay Janapa Reddi,Shayegan Omidshafiei*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper presents GLUESTICK, a method to recover degraded functionality in pruned Vision-Language-Action models, boosting efficiency without additional training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision-Language-Action models have improved robotic tasks but are hard to deploy on resource-limited hardware. Pruning could help compress such models, but it often causes significant performance degradation.

Method: The authors propose GLUESTICK, a post-pruning recovery method that interpolates between dense and pruned model weights to compute a corrective term, applied to pruned layers during inference to regain functionality.

Result: GLUESTICK substantially restores degraded capabilities in pruned VLA models, achieving competitive memory efficiency, higher success rates, and fewer safety violations across various architectures and tasks.

Conclusion: GLUESTICK effectively balances efficiency and performance in pruned Vision-Language-Action models without requiring additional training and is compatible with various pruning algorithms.

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have advanced robotic capabilities but
remain challenging to deploy on resource-limited hardware. Pruning has enabled
efficient compression of large language models (LLMs), yet it is largely
understudied in robotics. Surprisingly, we observe that pruning VLA models
leads to drastic degradation and increased safety violations. We introduce
GLUESTICK, a post-pruning recovery method that restores much of the original
model's functionality while retaining sparsity benefits. Our method performs a
one-time interpolation between the dense and pruned models in weight-space to
compute a corrective term. This correction is used during inference by each
pruned layer to recover lost capabilities with minimal overhead. GLUESTICK
requires no additional training, is agnostic to the pruning algorithm, and
introduces a single hyperparameter that controls the tradeoff between
efficiency and accuracy. Across diverse VLA architectures and tasks in
manipulation and navigation, GLUESTICK achieves competitive memory efficiency
while substantially recovering success rates and reducing safety violations.

*Jhen Hsieh,Kuan-Hsun Tu,Kuo-Han Hung,Tsung-Wei Ke*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: DexMan is an automated framework for teaching humanoid robots dexterous manipulation using third-person videos, without requiring specialized equipment or annotations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To simplify and scale the teaching of bimanual dexterous manipulation by leveraging in-the-wild videos, addressing limitations in data collection and accuracy of prior approaches.

Method: DexMan uses noisy hand-object pose estimations from uncalibrated videos to learn robot manipulation policies, featuring contact-based rewards and eliminating the need for advanced hardware.

Result: DexMan outperforms on the TACO benchmark (ADD-S: +0.08, VSD: +0.12) and achieves a 19% higher success rate in reinforcement learning on OakInk-v2, generating diverse datasets without manual intervention.

Conclusion: DexMan is a highly effective, scalable framework for learning humanoid dexterous manipulation, significantly reducing the dependency on specialized data while improving performance.

Abstract: We present DexMan, an automated framework that converts human visual
demonstrations into bimanual dexterous manipulation skills for humanoid robots
in simulation. Operating directly on third-person videos of humans manipulating
rigid objects, DexMan eliminates the need for camera calibration, depth
sensors, scanned 3D object assets, or ground-truth hand and object motion
annotations. Unlike prior approaches that consider only simplified floating
hands, it directly controls a humanoid robot and leverages novel contact-based
rewards to improve policy learning from noisy hand-object poses estimated from
in-the-wild videos.
  DexMan achieves state-of-the-art performance in object pose estimation on the
TACO benchmark, with absolute gains of 0.08 and 0.12 in ADD-S and VSD.
Meanwhile, its reinforcement learning policy surpasses previous methods by 19%
in success rate on OakInk-v2. Furthermore, DexMan can generate skills from both
real and synthetic videos, without the need for manual data collection and
costly motion capture, and enabling the creation of large-scale, diverse
datasets for training generalist dexterous manipulation.

*Xiuwei Xu,Angyuan Ma,Hankun Li,Bingyao Yu,Zheng Zhu,Jie Zhou,Jiwen Lu*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces R2RGen, a real-to-real 3D data generation framework that efficiently augments pointcloud data for visuomotor policy training, bypassing simulators and rendering.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To achieve spatial generalization in robotic manipulation, current approaches require substantial data collection or face a sim-to-real gap, particularly in unconstrained settings.

Method: R2RGen directly augments 3D pointcloud observation-action pairs, utilizing an annotation mechanism for detailed scene parsing, group-wise augmentation for multi-object handling, and camera-aware processing for realistic sensor alignment.

Result: Empirical evaluations show R2RGen enhances data efficiency, scales up well, and is effective for mobile manipulation tasks.

Conclusion: R2RGen provides a plug-and-play, efficient alternative for generating spatially diverse datasets, addressing limitations of prior methods like reliance on simulation or fixed scenarios.

Abstract: Towards the aim of generalized robotic manipulation, spatial generalization
is the most fundamental capability that requires the policy to work robustly
under different spatial distribution of objects, environment and agent itself.
To achieve this, substantial human demonstrations need to be collected to cover
different spatial configurations for training a generalized visuomotor policy
via imitation learning. Prior works explore a promising direction that
leverages data generation to acquire abundant spatially diverse data from
minimal source demonstrations. However, most approaches face significant
sim-to-real gap and are often limited to constrained settings, such as
fixed-base scenarios and predefined camera viewpoints. In this paper, we
propose a real-to-real 3D data generation framework (R2RGen) that directly
augments the pointcloud observation-action pairs to generate real-world data.
R2RGen is simulator- and rendering-free, thus being efficient and
plug-and-play. Specifically, given a single source demonstration, we introduce
an annotation mechanism for fine-grained parsing of scene and trajectory. A
group-wise augmentation strategy is proposed to handle complex multi-object
compositions and diverse task constraints. We further present camera-aware
processing to align the distribution of generated data with real-world 3D
sensor. Empirically, R2RGen substantially enhances data efficiency on extensive
experiments and demonstrates strong potential for scaling and application on
mobile manipulation.

*Xueyi Liu,He Wang,Li Yi*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper presents a novel framework enabling simulated policies to bridge the 'reality gap' for in-hand object rotation tasks, achieving generalized manipulation of diverse objects in the real world.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the sim-to-real challenge in in-hand object rotation by overcoming the reality gap caused by the complex dynamics of dexterous manipulation.

Method: Develop a joint-wise dynamics model that learns to adapt simulation policies using data-efficient training and autonomous real-world data collection.

Result: A single policy trained in simulation successfully rotates various objects with challenging shapes, sizes, and conditions, demonstrated by real-world validations and teleoperation applications.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively generalizes simulated policies for in-hand object rotation, achieving robustness and versatility across diverse real-world scenarios.

Abstract: Achieving generalized in-hand object rotation remains a significant challenge
in robotics, largely due to the difficulty of transferring policies from
simulation to the real world. The complex, contact-rich dynamics of dexterous
manipulation create a "reality gap" that has limited prior work to constrained
scenarios involving simple geometries, limited object sizes and aspect ratios,
constrained wrist poses, or customized hands. We address this sim-to-real
challenge with a novel framework that enables a single policy, trained in
simulation, to generalize to a wide variety of objects and conditions in the
real world. The core of our method is a joint-wise dynamics model that learns
to bridge the reality gap by effectively fitting limited amount of real-world
collected data and then adapting the sim policy's actions accordingly. The
model is highly data-efficient and generalizable across different whole-hand
interaction distributions by factorizing dynamics across joints, compressing
system-wide influences into low-dimensional variables, and learning each
joint's evolution from its own dynamic profile, implicitly capturing these net
effects. We pair this with a fully autonomous data collection strategy that
gathers diverse, real-world interaction data with minimal human intervention.
Our complete pipeline demonstrates unprecedented generality: a single policy
successfully rotates challenging objects with complex shapes (e.g., animals),
high aspect ratios (up to 5.33), and small sizes, all while handling diverse
wrist orientations and rotation axes. Comprehensive real-world evaluations and
a teleoperation application for complex tasks validate the effectiveness and
robustness of our approach. Website: https://meowuu7.github.io/DexNDM/

*Hongyu Li,Lingfeng Sun,Yafei Hu,Duy Ta,Jennifer Barry,George Konidaris,Jiahui Fu*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: NovaFlow is a framework enabling robots to perform zero-shot manipulation tasks by synthesizing task descriptions into actionable robot plans, validated across different robots and object types.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable robots to perform novel manipulation tasks without relying on specific datasets, demonstrations, or embodiment-specific training, which limits generalizability.

Method: NovaFlow converts task descriptions into robot actions through video generation models, distilling 3D object flows into actionable parameters, and leveraging trajectory optimization and particle-based dynamics for control.

Result: NovaFlow successfully demonstrated zero-shot performance on a variety of tasks and robots (Franka arm and Spot robot) without needing task-specific training.

Conclusion: NovaFlow offers a generalized, transferable approach for robotic manipulation by separating task understanding from control, advancing zero-shot execution capabilities.

Abstract: Enabling robots to execute novel manipulation tasks zero-shot is a central
goal in robotics. Most existing methods assume in-distribution tasks or rely on
fine-tuning with embodiment-matched data, limiting transfer across platforms.
We present NovaFlow, an autonomous manipulation framework that converts a task
description into an actionable plan for a target robot without any
demonstrations. Given a task description, NovaFlow synthesizes a video using a
video generation model and distills it into 3D actionable object flow using
off-the-shelf perception modules. From the object flow, it computes relative
poses for rigid objects and realizes them as robot actions via grasp proposals
and trajectory optimization. For deformable objects, this flow serves as a
tracking objective for model-based planning with a particle-based dynamics
model. By decoupling task understanding from low-level control, NovaFlow
naturally transfers across embodiments. We validate on rigid, articulated, and
deformable object manipulation tasks using a table-top Franka arm and a Spot
quadrupedal mobile robot, and achieve effective zero-shot execution without
demonstrations or embodiment-specific training. Project website:

### [439] [Scalable Offline Metrics for Autonomous Driving](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08571)
*Animikh Aich,Adwait Kulkarni,Eshed Ohn-Bar*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper evaluates the shortcomings of offline evaluation for perception-based planning in robotic systems versus real-world online scenarios. The authors propose an improved offline metric that captures probable error events, achieving better correlation in both simulated and real-world settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the relationship between offline model evaluation and online real-world performance is crucial for ensuring the safety and reliability of autonomous systems but is currently understudied.

Method: A series of experiments are performed across diverse scenarios and metrics, both in simulation and real-world settings. A new offline evaluation metric based on epistemic uncertainty is proposed to better capture potential online errors.

Result: The newly proposed offline metric shows over 13% improved correlation between offline and online evaluation in simulation and even greater improvement in real-world scenarios.

Conclusion: Current offline evaluation methods for robotic systems may not accurately predict online performance. The study suggests that a metric considering epistemic uncertainty enhances the reliability of offline assessments, improving insights into real-world deployment performance.

Abstract: Real-World evaluation of perception-based planning models for robotic
systems, such as autonomous vehicles, can be safely and inexpensively conducted
offline, i.e., by computing model prediction error over a pre-collected
validation dataset with ground-truth annotations. However, extrapolating from
offline model performance to online settings remains a challenge. In these
settings, seemingly minor errors can compound and result in test-time
infractions or collisions. This relationship is understudied, particularly
across diverse closed-loop metrics and complex urban maneuvers. In this work,
we revisit this undervalued question in policy evaluation through an extensive
set of experiments across diverse conditions and metrics. Based on analysis in
simulation, we find an even worse correlation between offline and online
settings than reported by prior studies, casting doubts on the validity of
current evaluation practices and metrics for driving policies. Next, we bridge
the gap between offline and online evaluation. We investigate an offline metric
based on epistemic uncertainty, which aims to capture events that are likely to
cause errors in closed-loop settings. The resulting metric achieves over 13%
improvement in correlation compared to previous offline metrics. We further
validate the generalization of our findings beyond the simulation environment
in real-world settings, where even greater gains are observed.

### [440] [BLAZER: Bootstrapping LLM-based Manipulation Agents with Zero-Shot Data Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08572)
*Rocktim Jyoti Das,Harsh Singh,Diana Turmakhan,Muhammad Abdullah Sohail,Mingfei Han,Preslav Nakov,Fabio Pizzati,Ivan Laptev*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: BLAZER, a framework that uses zero-shot Large Language Models (LLMs) to automatically generate diverse manipulation task demonstrations in simulations, significantly boosts zero-shot task execution in robotics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current robotics lacks internet-scale diverse task demonstrations, limiting dataset scale due to manual curation. The paper addresses this by automating demonstration generation.

Method: The BLAZER framework leverages LLM planning, where simulations automatically generate task demonstrations. These outputs fine-tune the LLMs to improve planning without manual intervention.

Result: The framework significantly enhances zero-shot manipulation in both simulated and real-world contexts. It generalizes to tasks beyond training and supports downscaling LLM models.

Conclusion: BLAZER demonstrates an automated path to large-scale dataset creation for robotic manipulation training, offering robust, transferable results while decreasing dependence on manual inputs.

Abstract: Scaling data and models has played a pivotal role in the remarkable progress
of computer vision and language. Inspired by these domains, recent efforts in
robotics have similarly focused on scaling both data and model size to develop
more generalizable and robust policies. However, unlike vision and language,
robotics lacks access to internet-scale demonstrations across diverse robotic
tasks and environments. As a result, the scale of existing datasets typically
suffers from the need for manual data collection and curation. To address this
problem, here we propose BLAZER, a framework that learns manipulation policies
from automatically generated training data. We build on the zero-shot
capabilities of LLM planners and automatically generate demonstrations for
diverse manipulation tasks in simulation. Successful examples are then used to
finetune an LLM and to improve its planning capabilities without human
supervision. Notably, while BLAZER training requires access to the simulator's
state, we demonstrate direct transfer of acquired skills to sensor-based
manipulation. Through extensive experiments, we show BLAZER to significantly
improve zero-shot manipulation in both simulated and real environments.
Moreover, BLAZER improves on tasks outside of its training pool and enables
downscaling of LLM models. Our code and data will be made publicly available on
the project page.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces UniFField, a generalizable and uncertainty-aware neural feature field for combining visual, semantic, and geometric features in a single representation, addressing limitations in current 3D neural feature fields.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve robotic task execution in complex environments by addressing the scene-specific nature and lack of uncertainty modeling in existing 3D neural feature fields.

Method: Proposed UniFField, which incrementally integrates RGB-D images into a voxel-based unified representation that combines different feature modalities and predicts uncertainty. It is applicable to new environments without retraining.

Result: UniFField accurately predicts model errors in scene reconstruction and semantic feature prediction, and its uncertainty estimations enhance task performance in applications like active object search with robots.

Conclusion: The approach enables robust decision-making for robots by integrating comprehensive feature understanding with uncertainty estimation, demonstrating its utility in diverse and dynamic scenarios.

Abstract: Comprehensive visual, geometric, and semantic understanding of a 3D scene is
crucial for successful execution of robotic tasks, especially in unstructured
and complex environments. Additionally, to make robust decisions, it is
necessary for the robot to evaluate the reliability of perceived information.
While recent advances in 3D neural feature fields have enabled robots to
leverage features from pretrained foundation models for tasks such as
language-guided manipulation and navigation, existing methods suffer from two
critical limitations: (i) they are typically scene-specific, and (ii) they lack
the ability to model uncertainty in their predictions. We present UniFField, a
unified uncertainty-aware neural feature field that combines visual, semantic,
and geometric features in a single generalizable representation while also
predicting uncertainty in each modality. Our approach, which can be applied
zero shot to any new environment, incrementally integrates RGB-D images into
our voxel-based feature representation as the robot explores the scene,
simultaneously updating uncertainty estimation. We evaluate our uncertainty
estimations to accurately describe the model prediction errors in scene
reconstruction and semantic feature prediction. Furthermore, we successfully
leverage our feature predictions and their respective uncertainty for an active
object search task using a mobile manipulator robot, demonstrating the
capability for robust decision-making.

*Zixuan Feng,Sadia Afroz,Anita Sarma*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: Generative AI can increase developer burnout due to heightened job demands but offers mitigating factors like job resources and positive perceptions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Investigate how the adoption of Generative AI impacts software developers' burnout within the context of their work environments.

Method: Mixed-methods study combining surveys of 442 developers, quantitative models (PLS-SEM and regression), and qualitative analysis of open-ended responses using the Job Demands-Resources framework.

Result: GenAI adoption was found to exacerbate burnout through increased job demands, but job resources and positive attitudes toward GenAI offset some negative impacts.

Conclusion: While GenAI introduces additional work pressures, its adoption can be beneficial if supported by adequate resources and a positive outlook, reframing it as both a challenge and an opportunity.

Abstract: Generative AI (GenAI) is rapidly reshaping software development workflows.
While prior studies emphasize productivity gains, the adoption of GenAI also
introduces new pressures that may harm developers' well-being. In this paper,
we investigate the relationship between the adoption of GenAI and developers'
burnout. We utilized the Job Demands--Resources (JD--R) model as the analytic
lens in our empirical study. We employed a concurrent embedded mixed-methods
research design, integrating quantitative and qualitative evidence. We first
surveyed 442 developers across diverse organizations, roles, and levels of
experience. We then employed Partial Least Squares--Structural Equation
Modeling (PLS-SEM) and regression to model the relationships among job demands,
job resources, and burnout, complemented by a qualitative analysis of
open-ended responses to contextualize the quantitative findings. Our results
show that GenAI adoption heightens burnout by increasing job demands, while job
resources and positive perceptions of GenAI mitigate these effects, reframing
adoption as an opportunity.

TL;DR: The paper introduces HotBugs.jar, a unique dataset of 679 validated hot fixes for research on rapid debugging and automated repair.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Hot fixes are critical for addressing urgent software issues, but no datasets exist to specifically evaluate them, creating a gap in research capabilities.

Method: The dataset was created by mining 10 Apache projects for commits and issue reports, identifying 746 initial patches, manually confirming 679 as hot fixes, and packaging 110 reproducible cases with metadata.

Result: The outcome is HotBugs.jar, which provides a comprehensive benchmark of 679 hot fixes and has been adopted as the dataset for the SBSE Conference Challenge Track.

Conclusion: HotBugs.jar enables significant advancements in tools for debugging, repair, and resilience, and provides a valuable resource to push forward research on hot fixes in software systems.

Abstract: Hot fixes are urgent, unplanned changes deployed to production systems to
address time-critical issues. Despite their importance, no existing evaluation
benchmark focuses specifically on hot fixes. We present HotBugs$.$jar, the
first dataset dedicated to real-world hot fixes. From an initial mining of 10
active Apache projects totaling over 190K commits and 150K issue reports, we
identified 746 software patches that met our hot-fix criteria. After manual
evaluation, 679 were confirmed as genuine hot fixes, of which 110 are
reproducible using a test suite. Building upon the Bugs$.$jar framework,
HotBugs$.$jar integrates these 110 reproducible cases and makes available all
679 manually validated hot fixes, each enriched with comprehensive metadata to
support future research. Each hot fix was systematically identified using Jira
issue data, validated by independent reviewers, and packaged in a reproducible
format with buggy and fixed versions, test suites, and metadata. HotBugs$.$jar
has already been adopted as the official challenge dataset for the Search-Based
Software Engineering (SBSE) Conference Challenge Track, demonstrating its
immediate impact. This benchmark enables the study and evaluation of tools for
rapid debugging, automated repair, and production-grade resilience in modern

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: RustAssure automates the transpilation of C code into Rust using Large Language Models (LLMs) and employs differential symbolic testing to ensure semantic similarity between the two languages.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To leverage Rust's memory safety features for existing C codebases while addressing security concerns in software.

Method: The system uses LLMs with advanced prompt engineering to generate idiomatic and safe Rust code. It further applies differential symbolic testing to validate semantic equivalence between C and Rust code.

Result: RustAssure successfully generated compilable Rust code for 89.8% of C functions, with 69.9% of those matching the symbolic return values of their C counterparts.

Conclusion: RustAssure demonstrates the feasibility and effectiveness of using LLMs for transpiling unsafe memory-language codebases like C into memory-safe Rust, while addressing potential artifacts introduced by LLMs.

Abstract: Rust is a memory-safe programming language that significantly improves
software security. Existing codebases written in unsafe memory languages, such
as C, must first be transpiled to Rust to take advantage of Rust's improved
safety guarantees. RustAssure presents a system that uses Large Language Models
(LLMs) to automatically transpile existing C codebases to Rust. RustAssure uses
prompt engineering techniques to maximize the chances of the LLM generating
idiomatic and safe Rust code. Moreover, because LLMs often generate code with
subtle bugs that can be missed under traditional unit or fuzz testing,
RustAssure performs differential symbolic testing to establish the semantic
similarity between the original C and LLM-transpiled Rust code. We evaluated
RustAssure with five real-world applications and libraries, and showed that our
system is able to generate compilable Rust functions for 89.8% of all C
functions, of which 69.9% produced equivalent symbolic return values for both

*Dezhi Ran,Yuan Cao,Mengzhou Wu,Simin Chen,Yuzhe Guo,Jun Ren,Zihe Song,Hao Yu,Jialei Wei,Linyi Li,Wei Yang,Baishakhi Ray,Tao Xie*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper introduces APPFORGE, a benchmark for assessing LLMs' ability to create entire Android apps based on natural language specifications. Results indicate current models struggle with this complex task.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks fail to evaluate LLMs on constructing entire software systems from scratch, which is crucial for real-world applications.

Method: APPFORGE uses a multi-agent system for functionality summarization and test case synthesis, verified manually by experts and evaluated automatically via a reproducible framework.

Result: Evaluation on 12 prominent LLMs reveals poor performance, with GPT-5 achieving the best but still only 18.8% functionally correct applications.

Conclusion: Current LLMs have significant limitations in handling complex software engineering tasks, calling for advancements in the models and training methodologies.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capability in
function-level code generation tasks. Unlike isolated functions, real-world
applications demand reasoning over the entire software system: developers must
orchestrate how different components interact, maintain consistency across
states over time, and ensure the application behaves correctly within the
lifecycle and framework constraints. Yet, no existing benchmark adequately
evaluates whether LLMs can bridge this gap and construct entire software
systems from scratch. To address this gap, we propose APPFORGE, a benchmark
consisting of 101 software development problems drawn from real-world Android
apps. Given a natural language specification detailing the app functionality, a
language model is tasked with implementing the functionality into an Android
app from scratch. Developing an Android app from scratch requires understanding
and coordinating app states, lifecycle management, and asynchronous operations,
calling for LLMs to generate context-aware, robust, and maintainable code. To
construct APPFORGE, we design a multi-agent system to automatically summarize
the main functionalities from app documents and navigate the app to synthesize
test cases validating the functional correctness of app implementation.
Following rigorous manual verification by Android development experts, APPFORGE
incorporates the test cases within an automated evaluation framework that
enables reproducible assessment without human intervention, making it easily
adoptable for future research. Our evaluation on 12 flagship LLMs show that all
evaluated models achieve low effectiveness, with the best-performing model
(GPT-5) developing only 18.8% functionally correct applications, highlighting
fundamental limitations in current models' ability to handle complex,
multi-component software engineering challenges.

*Zeyu Sun,Jingjing Liang,Weiyi Wang,Chenyao Suo,Junjie Chen,Fanjiang Xu*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper introduces FLEX, a novel self-adaptive fuzzing framework that uses neural networks and feedback-driven approaches to improve MLIR testing, effectively discovering significantly more bugs compared to existing tools.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Ensuring the correctness and robustness of MLIR is challenging, with existing fuzzing methods struggling to generate diverse and valid test cases for detecting bugs.

Method: FLEX employs neural network-driven program generation, perturbed sampling to promote diversity, and a feedback-driven loop to refine the model using both crashing and non-crashing test cases.

Result: Over a 30-day testing campaign, FLEX discovered 80 unknown bugs and achieved higher coverage compared to four state-of-the-art fuzzers, detecting up to 3.5x more bugs than the best alternative in shorter evaluations.

Conclusion: FLEX demonstrates its critical advancements in bug finding and code coverage, validating the necessity of novel perturbation and augmentation strategies in dynamic fuzzing for compilers like MLIR.

Abstract: MLIR (Multi-Level Intermediate Representation) has rapidly become a
foundational technology for modern compiler frameworks, enabling extensibility
across diverse domains. However, ensuring the correctness and robustness of
MLIR itself remains challenging. Existing fuzzing approaches-based on manually
crafted templates or rule-based mutations-struggle to generate sufficiently
diverse and semantically valid test cases, making it difficult to expose subtle
or deep-seated bugs within MLIR's complex and evolving code space. In this
paper, we present FLEX, a novel self-adaptive fuzzing framework for MLIR. FLEX
leverages neural networks for program generation, a perturbed sampling strategy
to encourage diversity, and a feedback-driven augmentation loop that
iteratively improves its model using both crashing and non-crashing test cases.
Starting from a limited seed corpus, FLEX progressively learns valid syntax and
semantics and autonomously produces high-quality test inputs. We evaluate FLEX
on the upstream MLIR compiler against four state-of-the-art fuzzers. In a
30-day campaign, FLEX discovers 80 previously unknown bugs-including multiple
new root causes and parser bugs-while in 24-hour fixed-revision comparisons, it
detects 53 bugs (over 3.5x as many as the best baseline) and achieves 28.2%
code coverage, outperforming the next-best tool by 42%. Ablation studies
further confirm the critical role of both perturbed generation and diversity
augmentation in FLEX's effectiveness.

### [447] [Bug Histories as Sources of Compiler Fuzzing Mutators](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07834)
*Lingjun Liu,Feiran Qin,Owolabi Legunsen,Marcelo d'Amorim*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper proposes IssueMut, a method to mine compiler fuzzing mutators from bug histories, showing effectiveness in discovering previously missed bugs in compilers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Compiler bugs can have significant negative impacts, and current mutational compiler fuzzers are limited by the quality of mutators they use. The researchers wanted to explore compiler bug histories as a new source of mutators to improve bug detection.

Method: The authors developed IssueMut, which automates the extraction of mutators from compiler bug histories and integrates these mutators into existing compiler fuzzers. They mined 587 mutators from 1760 GCC and LLVM bug reports and tested them on these compilers.

Result: IssueMut uncovered 65 newly discovered bugs (28 in GCC and 37 in LLVM) that a state-of-the-art mutational compiler fuzzer missed, with 60 of the bugs confirmed or fixed.

Conclusion: Bug histories provide valuable insights for developing more effective compiler fuzzing mutators, and leveraging these histories can enhance the detection of elusive compiler bugs.

Abstract: Bugs in compilers, which are critical infrastructure today, can have outsized
negative impacts. Mutational fuzzers aid compiler bug detection by
systematically mutating compiler inputs, i.e., programs. Their effectiveness
depends on the quality of the mutators used. Yet, no prior work used compiler
bug histories as a source of mutators. We propose IssueMut, the first approach
for extracting compiler fuzzing mutators from bug histories. Our insight is
that bug reports contain hints about program elements that induced compiler
bugs; they can guide fuzzers towards similar bugs. IssueMut uses an automated
method to mine mutators from bug reports and retrofit such mutators into
existing mutational compiler fuzzers. Using IssueMut, we mine 587 mutators from
1760 GCC and LLVM bug reports. Then, we run IssueMut on these compilers, with
all their test inputs as seed corpora. We find that "bug history" mutators are
effective: they find new bugs that a state-of-the-art mutational compiler
fuzzer misses-28 in GCC and 37 in LLVM. Of these, 60 were confirmed or fixed,
validating our idea that bug histories have rich information that compiler
fuzzers should leverage.

TL;DR: The paper analyzes 180 automotive SoC vulnerabilities within AUTOSAR-aligned architectures and identifies root causes, affected software modules, and patterns to improve security in CCAM systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the security challenges in real-time, safety-critical CCAM environments, and to systematically analyze SoC vulnerabilities within AUTOSAR-aligned architectures to fill the gap in understanding their root causes and impact.

Method: The study analyzed 180 public automotive SoC vulnerabilities using a representative SoC software architecture model aligned with AUTOSAR principles, identifying root causes, affected modules, and mapping vulnerabilities to architectural layers and CWE categories.

Result: The paper identified 16 root causes, 56 affected software modules, dominant vulnerability patterns, and critical modules with delayed patches, providing insights for detection and mitigation strategies.

Conclusion: The findings guide actionable strategies for securing automotive CPS platforms by improving vulnerability detection, prioritization, and localization in SoC software architectures for SoC-based vehicle platforms.

Abstract: Cooperative, Connected and Automated Mobility (CCAM) are complex
cyber-physical systems (CPS) that integrate computation, communication, and
control in safety-critical environments. At their core, System-on-Chip (SoC)
platforms consolidate processing units, communication interfaces, AI
accelerators, and security modules into a single chip. AUTOSAR (AUTomotive Open
System ARchitecture) standard was developed in the automotive domain to better
manage this complexity, defining layered software structures and interfaces to
facilitate reuse of HW/SW components. However, in practice, this integrated SoC
software architecture still poses security challenges, particularly in
real-time, safety-critical environments. Recent reports highlight a surge in
SoC-related vulnerabilities, yet systematic analysis of their root causes and
impact within AUTOSAR-aligned architectures is lacking. This study fills that
gap by analyzing 180 publicly reported automotive SoC vulnerabilities, mapped
to a representative SoC software architecture model that is aligned with
AUTOSAR principles for layered abstraction and service orientation. We identify
16 root causes and 56 affected software modules, and examine mitigation delays
across Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) categories and architectural layers.
We uncover dominant vulnerability patterns and critical modules with prolonged
patch delays, and provide actionable insights for securing automotive CPS
platforms, including guides for improved detection, prioritization, and
localization strategies for SoC software architectures in SoC-based vehicle
platforms.

*Utku Boran Torun,Mehmet Taha Demircan,Mahmut Furkan Gön,Eray Tüzün*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper proposes an AI-powered bug tracking framework leveraging large language models (LLMs) to automate and enhance the traditional bug tracking process.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address inefficiencies in traditional bug tracking systems, including communication gaps, slow response times, and high human effort.

Method: Designing a framework that uses LLMs to automate tasks such as refining reports, reproducing issues, and generating candidate patches, while still incorporating human oversight.

Result: Accelerated bug resolution times, reduced human intervention, and improved collaboration between users and technical teams.

Conclusion: Integrating LLM-driven automation into bug tracking can make software maintenance faster, more efficient, and user-friendly.

Abstract: Traditional bug tracking systems rely heavily on manual reporting,
reproduction, triaging, and resolution, each carried out by different
stakeholders such as end users, customer support, developers, and testers. This
division of responsibilities requires significant coordination and widens the
communication gap between non-technical users and technical teams, slowing the
process from bug discovery to resolution. Moreover, current systems are highly
asynchronous; users often wait hours or days for a first response, delaying
fixes and contributing to frustration. This paper examines the evolution of bug
tracking, from early paper-based reporting to today's web-based and SaaS
platforms. Building on this trajectory, we propose an AI-powered bug tracking
framework that augments existing tools with intelligent, large language model
(LLM)-driven automation. Our framework addresses two main challenges: reducing
time-to-fix and minimizing human overhead. Users report issues in natural
language, while AI agents refine reports, attempt reproduction, and request
missing details. Reports are then classified, invalid ones resolved through
no-code fixes, and valid ones localized and assigned to developers. LLMs also
generate candidate patches, with human oversight ensuring correctness. By
integrating automation into each phase, our framework accelerates response
times, improves collaboration, and strengthens software maintenance practices
for a more efficient, user-centric future.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: Presents a pre-processing technique to bridge the gap between modular whitespace-sensitive and whitespace-insensitive language components in software language engineering.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reusability of modular language components is hindered by the gap between whitespace-sensitive and whitespace-insensitive languages.

Method: Introduces a preprocessing technique to convert whitespace-insensitive modular language artifacts for use in constructing whitespace-sensitive languages.

Result: Evaluated by reconstructing a simplified version of Python, demonstrating its capability to create whitespace-sensitive languages from modular components.

Conclusion: The approach enhances reusability, reduces development time, and improves quality in software language engineering.

Abstract: In Software Language Engineering, there is a trend towards reusability by
composing modular language components. However, this reusability is severely
inhibited by a gap in integrating whitespace-sensitive and
whitespace-insensitive languages. There is currently no consistent procedure
for seamlessly reusing such language components in both cases, such that
libraries often cannot be reused, and whitespacesensitive languages are
developed from scratch. This paper presents a technique for using modular,
whitespaceinsensitive language modules to construct whitespace sensitive
languages by pre-processing language artifacts before parsing. The approach is
evaluated by reconstructing a simplified version of the programming language
Python. Our solution aims to increase the reusability of existing language
components to reduce development time and increase the overall quality of
software languages.

### [451] [Beyond Grid-Locked Voxels: Neural Response Functions for Continuous Brain Encoding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07342)
*Haomiao Chen,Keith W Jamison,Mert R. Sabuncu,Amy Kuceyeski*

Main category: q-bio.NC

TL;DR: The study introduces a novel encoding model, Neural Response Function (NRF), which predicts fMRI activity across continuous 3D anatomical space rather than independent voxel grids, improving prediction accuracy and cross-subject adaptability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional fMRI encoding models lose spatial and anatomical context by treating voxel responses as independent 1D vectors. This limitation hampers data efficiency, cross-subject adaptability, and spatial resolution flexibility.

Method: The NRF framework models fMRI activity using a continuous implicit function that predicts responses at any spatial (x, y, z) coordinate in standardized MNI space, leveraging properties like local smoothness and cross-subject alignment.

Result: NRF outperformed baseline models in encoding performance and cross-subject adaptation. It also significantly reduced the data size required for training by utilizing anatomical information and spatial correlations.

Conclusion: NRF is the first anatomically aware fMRI encoding model that represents brain responses as a continuous function in 3D space, enabling resolution-agnostic analyses and advancing cross-subject adaptability.

Abstract: Neural encoding models aim to predict fMRI-measured brain responses to
natural images. fMRI data is acquired as a 3D volume of voxels, where each
voxel has a defined spatial location in the brain. However, conventional
encoding models often flatten this volume into a 1D vector and treat voxel
responses as independent outputs. This removes spatial context, discards
anatomical information, and ties each model to a subject-specific voxel grid.
We introduce the Neural Response Function (NRF), a framework that models fMRI
activity as a continuous function over anatomical space rather than a flat
vector of voxels. NRF represents brain activity as a continuous implicit
function: given an image and a spatial coordinate (x, y, z) in standardized MNI
space, the model predicts the response at that location. This formulation
decouples predictions from the training grid, supports querying at arbitrary
spatial resolutions, and enables resolution-agnostic analyses. By grounding the
model in anatomical space, NRF exploits two key properties of brain responses:
(1) local smoothness -- neighboring voxels exhibit similar response patterns;
modeling responses continuously captures these correlations and improves data
efficiency, and (2) cross-subject alignment -- MNI coordinates unify data
across individuals, allowing a model pretrained on one subject to be fine-tuned
on new subjects. In experiments, NRF outperformed baseline models in both
intrasubject encoding and cross-subject adaptation, achieving high performance
while reducing the data size needed by orders of magnitude. To our knowledge,
NRF is the first anatomically aware encoding model to move beyond flattened
voxels, learning a continuous mapping from images to brain responses in 3D
space.

TL;DR: The study explores how primate brains process complex visual scenes by analyzing large-scale neural recordings from macaques' ventral visual stream.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand neural mechanisms behind transforming complex visual inputs into coherent perceptions.

Method: Utilized linear models, encoding and decoding approaches on spiking datasets to map visual features and reconstruct images using generative models.

Result: Successfully reconstructed low-level and high-level visual features from neural activity, illustrating the hierarchical organization of the ventral visual stream.

Conclusion: This research enables perceptual reconstruction of complex visual scenes from monkey neural recordings, advancing understanding of brain-perception links.

Abstract: Understanding how the primate brain transforms complex visual scenes into
coherent perceptual experiences remains a central challenge in neuroscience.
Here, we present a comprehensive framework for interpreting monkey visual
processing by integrating encoding and decoding approaches applied to two
large-scale spiking datasets recorded from macaque using THINGS images (THINGS
macaque IT Dataset (TITD) and THINGS Ventral Stream Spiking Dataset (TVSD)). We
leverage multi-electrode array recordings from the ventral visual
stream--including V1, V4, and inferotemporal (IT) cortex--to investigate how
distributed neural populations encode and represent visual information. Our
approach employs linear models to decode spiking activity into multiple latent
visual spaces (including CLIP and VDVAE embeddings) and reconstruct images
using state-of-the-art generative models. We further utilize encoding models to
map visual features back to neural activity, enabling visualization of the
"preferred stimuli" that drive specific neural ensembles. Analyses of both
datasets reveal that it is possible to reconstruct both low-level (e.g., color,
texture) and high-level (e.g., semantic category) features of visual stimuli
from population activity, with reconstructions preserving key perceptual
attributes as quantified by feature-based similarity metrics. The
spatiotemporal spike patterns reflect the ventral stream's hierarchical
organization with anterior regions representing complex objects and categories.
Functional clustering identifies feature-specific neural ensembles, with
temporal dynamics show evolving feature selectivity post-stimulus. Our findings
demonstrate feasible, generalizable perceptual reconstruction from large-scale
monkey neural recordings, linking neural activity to perception.

Motivation: To understand the correlation between brain states and responsiveness, which is crucial for deciphering brain function and states of consciousness.

Method: Reviewed physiological and computational aspects of state-dependent brain responses systematically at cellular, circuit, mesoscale, and macroscale levels, integrating quantitative methods for network state characterization.

Result: The study provides a comparative understanding of data and models that explain mechanisms of state-dependent brain responsiveness at multiple scales.

Conclusion: Brain responsiveness is fundamentally linked to its state, and methods like PCI provide vital insights into characterizing these dynamics across scales.

Abstract: The objective of this paper is to review physiological and computational

responsiveness depends on the state of the system. This correspondence between
brain state and brain responsiveness (state-dependent responses) is outlined at
different scales from the cellular and circuit level, to the mesoscale and
macroscale level. At each scale, we review how quantitative methods can be used
to characterize network states based on brain responses, such as the
Perturbational Complexity Index (PCI). This description will compare data and
models, systematically and at multiple scales, with a focus on the mechanisms
that explain how brain responses depend on brain states.

TL;DR: The paper explores optimizing BCI-based stroke rehabilitation using simpler motor imagery tasks and shorter training sessions, showing improved performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve recovery in stroke patients, leveraging BCIs to enhance neuroplasticity and develop optimal protocols for rehabilitation.

Method: Compared motor imagery-based protocols (affected hand movement vs. rest) using datasets from healthy and stroke patients and evaluated performance via FBCSP and EEGNet.

Result: Improved BCI performance with the proposed motor imagery approach and better outcomes with shorter training sessions.

Conclusion: Simplified tasks and shorter durations can improve BCI rehabilitation protocols for stroke patients, making recovery more effective.

Abstract: Stroke is a leading cause of long-term disability and the second most common
cause of death worldwide. Although acute treatments have advanced, recovery
remains challenging and limited. Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) have emerged
as a promising tool for post-stroke rehabilitation by promoting
neuroplasticity. However, clinical outcomes remain variable, and optimal
protocols have yet to be established. This study explores strategies to
optimize BCI-based rehabilitation by comparing motor imagery of affected hand
movement versus rest, instead of the conventional left-versus-right motor
imagery. This alternative aims to simplify the task and address the weak
contralateral activation commonly observed in stroke patients. Two datasets,
one from healthy individuals and one from stroke patients, were used to
evaluate the proposed approach. The results showed improved performance using
both FBCSP and EEGNet. Additionally, we investigated the impact of session
duration and found that shorter training sessions produced better BCI
performance than longer sessions.

*Abdelhakim Benechehab,Gabriel Singer,Corentin Léger,Youssef Attia El Hili,Giuseppe Paolo,Albert Thomas,Maurizio Filippone,Balázs Kégl*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper proposes a novel bilevel optimization framework to align generative models without explicit reward signals, addressing limitations in Maximum Likelihood Estimation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Generative models, foundational to modern machine learning, face challenges with traditional Maximum Likelihood Estimation, such as poor generalization and susceptibility to catastrophic forgetting. Policy Gradient methods show promise but rely on unavailable reward signals, creating a need for reward signal-independent alignment techniques.

Method: The proposed approach employs a Bilevel Optimization framework where the reward function forms the outer-level problem and the policy gradient defines the inner-level optimization.

Result: The method is theoretically analyzed in a tractable setting and shown to generalize to practical applications including tabular classification and model-based reinforcement learning.

Conclusion: Bilevel Optimization improves generative model alignment without explicit reward signals, and the insights gained demonstrate practical applicability across various machine learning tasks. The code implementing this method is publicly released.

Abstract: Generative models form the backbone of modern machine learning, underpinning
state-of-the-art systems in text, vision, and multimodal applications. While
Maximum Likelihood Estimation has traditionally served as the dominant training
paradigm, recent work have highlighted its limitations, particularly in
generalization and susceptibility to catastrophic forgetting compared to
Reinforcement Learning techniques, such as Policy Gradient methods. However,
these approaches depend on explicit reward signals, which are often unavailable
in practice, leaving open the fundamental problem of how to align generative
models when only high-quality datasets are accessible. In this work, we address
this challenge via a Bilevel Optimization framework, where the reward function
is treated as the optimization variable of an outer-level problem, while a
policy gradient objective defines the inner-level. We then conduct a
theoretical analysis of this optimization problem in a tractable setting and
extract insights that, as we demonstrate, generalize to applications such as
tabular classification and model-based reinforcement learning. We release the
code at https://github.com/abenechehab/nll_to_po .

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper introduces a refined estimator for model performance that surpasses conventional cross-validation methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address limitations in traditional cross-validation techniques that fail to estimate the specific model destined for future use.

Method: Develop Bayesian hierarchical and empirical Bayes estimators leveraging data splits within a random-effects framework.

Result: Proposed estimators outperform conventional cross-validation and naive single-split estimators in simulations and real-data evaluations.

Conclusion: The proposed estimators provide a superior and more accurate method to assess prediction model performance.

Abstract: Cross-validation is a standard tool for obtaining a honest assessment of the
performance of a prediction model. The commonly used version repeatedly splits
data, trains the prediction model on the training set, evaluates the model
performance on the test set, and averages the model performance across
different data splits. A well-known criticism is that such cross-validation
procedure does not directly estimate the performance of the particular model
recommended for future use. In this paper, we propose a new method to estimate
the performance of a model trained on a specific (random) training set. A naive
estimator can be obtained by applying the model to a disjoint testing set.
Surprisingly, cross-validation estimators computed from other random splits can
be used to improve this naive estimator within a random-effects model
framework. We develop two estimators -- a hierarchical Bayesian estimator and
an empirical Bayes estimator -- that perform similarly to or better than both
the conventional cross-validation estimator and the naive single-split
estimator. Simulations and a real-data example demonstrate the superior
performance of the proposed method.

*Wenbin Zhou,Shixiang Zhu*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel framework to guide robustness selection in robust optimization by offering finite-sample guarantees on miscoverage and regret for robust decision-making.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current robust optimization approaches often have ad hoc robustness levels, leading to inadequate protection or overly conservative decisions. There is a need for a principled way to balance these trade-offs.

Method: The authors propose a framework that constructs estimators to trace the miscoverage-regret Pareto frontier, ensuring distribution-free and finite-sample guarantees. This helps decision-makers calibrate robustness levels effectively.

Result: The method provides a more reliable way to evaluate and adjust robustness levels across various optimization formulations, achieving sharper performance compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: This framework empowers practical decision-making by enabling a balance between robustness and conservatism, offering principled data-driven tools for high-stakes optimization problems.

Abstract: Robust optimization safeguards decisions against uncertainty by optimizing
against worst-case scenarios, yet their effectiveness hinges on a prespecified
robustness level that is often chosen ad hoc, leading to either insufficient
protection or overly conservative and costly solutions. Recent approaches using
conformal prediction construct data-driven uncertainty sets with finite-sample
coverage guarantees, but they still fix coverage targets a priori and offer
little guidance for selecting robustness levels. We propose a new framework
that provides distribution-free, finite-sample guarantees on both miscoverage
and regret for any family of robust predict-then-optimize policies. Our method
constructs valid estimators that trace out the miscoverage-regret Pareto
frontier, enabling decision-makers to reliably evaluate and calibrate
robustness levels according to their cost-risk preferences. The framework is
simple to implement, broadly applicable across classical optimization
formulations, and achieves sharper finite-sample performance than existing
approaches. These results offer the first principled data-driven methodology
for guiding robustness selection and empower practitioners to balance
robustness and conservativeness in high-stakes decision-making.

### [459] [Surrogate Graph Partitioning for Spatial Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07832)
*Yuta Shikuri,Hironori Fujisawa*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: This paper addresses spatial prediction for interpretable decision-making by proposing a graph partitioning approach to segment data points, with a focus on computational efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the challenge of limited adoption of spatial prediction models in industries that demand interpretability by introducing surrogate models for explaining black-box predictors.

Method: A mixed-integer quadratic programming problem is formulated to assign data points to spatial segments, and an approximation scheme is developed to tackle the computational complexity.

Result: The experimental results show that the developed approximation scheme is computationally efficient in correctly identifying spatial segments.

Conclusion: The proposed graph partitioning approach enables interpretable spatial segmentation while overcoming computational challenges, making it feasible for practical applications.

Abstract: Spatial prediction refers to the estimation of unobserved values from
spatially distributed observations. Although recent advances have improved the
capacity to model diverse observation types, adoption in practice remains
limited in industries that demand interpretability. To mitigate this gap,
surrogate models that explain black-box predictors provide a promising path
toward interpretable decision making. In this study, we propose a graph
partitioning problem to construct spatial segments that minimize the sum of
within-segment variances of individual predictions. The assignment of data
points to segments can be formulated as a mixed-integer quadratic programming
problem. While this formulation potentially enables the identification of exact
segments, its computational complexity becomes prohibitive as the number of
data points increases. Motivated by this challenge, we develop an approximation
scheme that leverages the structural properties of graph partitioning.
Experimental results demonstrate the computational efficiency of this

*Sanghwa Kim,Dohyun Ahn,Seungki Min*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper addresses adaptive testing to estimate a continuous ability parameter from binary responses, optimizing accuracy with minimal queries.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a method for accurately estimating continuous ability parameters using minimal binary queries, applicable in adaptive testing and online preference learning.

Method: The authors propose an algorithm that selects questions to maximize Fisher information and updates estimates using a method-of-moments approach. They introduce a test statistic for accuracy assessment.

Result: The proposed Fisher-tracking strategy is theoretically proven to achieve optimal performance in both fixed-confidence and fixed-budget regimes.

Conclusion: The study offers a theoretically-supported, efficient, and simple adaptive testing procedure for certifying accurate parameter estimates with minimal queries.

Abstract: We study the problem of estimating a continuous ability parameter from
sequential binary responses by actively asking questions with varying
difficulties, a setting that arises naturally in adaptive testing and online
preference learning. Our goal is to certify that the estimate lies within a
desired margin of error, using as few queries as possible. We propose a simple
algorithm that adaptively selects questions to maximize Fisher information and
updates the estimate using a method-of-moments approach, paired with a novel
test statistic to decide when the estimate is accurate enough. We prove that
this Fisher-tracking strategy achieves optimal performance in both
fixed-confidence and fixed-budget regimes, which are commonly invested in the
best-arm identification literature. Our analysis overcomes a key technical
challenge in the fixed-budget setting -- handling the dependence between the
evolving estimate and the query distribution -- by exploiting a structural
symmetry in the model and combining large deviation tools with Ville's
inequality. Our results provide rigorous theoretical support for simple and
efficient adaptive testing procedures.

*Xabier de Juan,Santiago Mazuelas*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper investigates the robustness and optimality of the Median-of-Means (MoM) estimator when samples are adversarially contaminated, offering new bounds on its error for multiple classes of distributions and identifying its strengths and weaknesses.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to resolve the unclear minimax optimality and limitations of the MoM estimator under adversarial contamination, especially in non-Gaussian settings.

Method: The authors derive theoretical upper and lower error bounds for MoM across various classes of distributions, including those with finite variance and those with infinite variance but finite absolute $(1+r)$-th moment.

Result: MoM is shown to be minimax optimal for distributions with finite variance and certain heavy-tailed distributions, but suboptimal for light-tailed distributions.

Conclusion: The paper extends the understanding of MoM's performance under adversarial contamination, providing both theoretical guarantees and limitations, especially highlighting its dependency on the distribution's tail behavior.

Abstract: The Median-of-Means (MoM) is a robust estimator widely used in machine
learning that is known to be (minimax) optimal in scenarios where samples are
i.i.d. In more grave scenarios, samples are contaminated by an adversary that
can inspect and modify the data. Previous work has theoretically shown the
suitability of the MoM estimator in certain contaminated settings. However, the
(minimax) optimality of MoM and its limitations under adversarial contamination
remain unknown beyond the Gaussian case. In this paper, we present upper and
lower bounds for the error of MoM under adversarial contamination for multiple
classes of distributions. In particular, we show that MoM is (minimax) optimal
in the class of distributions with finite variance, as well as in the class of
distributions with infinite variance and finite absolute $(1+r)$-th moment. We
also provide lower bounds for MoM's error that match the order of the presented
upper bounds, and show that MoM is sub-optimal for light-tailed distributions.

*Seungsu Han,Juyoung Hwang,Won Chang*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper introduces StiCTAF, a novel method using stick-breaking mixture bases and component-wise tail adaptation to enhance posterior approximation in Bayesian inference, addressing issues like multimodality and heavy tails.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional normalizing flows struggle with approximating complex posterior distributions in Bayesian inference, particularly those with multimodality and heavy tails.

Method: The approach involves learning a flexible mixture base to reduce mode-seeking bias, estimating local tail indices, and refining mixture components with shared backbone and tail transforms calibrated by the indices.

Result: Experiments on synthetic posteriors showed enhanced tail recovery and better multimodal coverage compared to existing models, while a real-data analysis demonstrated practical benefits.

Conclusion: The proposed StiCTAF method improves posterior inference by accurately modeling modes and tail behaviors without compromising computational efficiency or optimization stability.

Abstract: Normalizing flows with a Gaussian base provide a computationally efficient
way to approximate posterior distributions in Bayesian inference, but they
often struggle to capture complex posteriors with multimodality and heavy
tails. We propose a stick-breaking mixture base with component-wise tail
adaptation (StiCTAF) for posterior approximation. The method first learns a
flexible mixture base to mitigate the mode-seeking bias of reverse KL
divergence through a weighted average of component-wise ELBOs. It then
estimates local tail indices of unnormalized densities and finally refines each
mixture component using a shared backbone combined with component-specific tail
transforms calibrated by the estimated indices. This design enables accurate
mode coverage and anisotropic tail modeling while retaining exact density
evaluation and stable optimization. Experiments on synthetic posteriors
demonstrate improved tail recovery and better coverage of multiple modes
compared to benchmark models. We also present a real-data analysis illustrating
the practical benefits of our approach for posterior inference.

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper explores the balance between synthetic and real data in training models to optimize generalization while minimizing test errors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the trade-off between synthetic and real data usage in scenarios where real data is limited, and to understand its impact on model performance.

Method: A learning-theoretic framework is developed, leveraging algorithmic stability and generalization error bounds, linked to the Wasserstein distance, and analyzed with kernel ridge regression.

Result: The framework reveals a U-shaped relationship between synthetic-to-real data ratio and test error, predicting an optimal ratio validated through experiments on CIFAR-10 and clinical MRI data.

Conclusion: Optimal blending of synthetic and real data can mitigate performance degradation, even in domain adaptation tasks, providing practical guidelines for in-domain and out-of-domain applications.

Abstract: Synthetic data can improve generalization when real data is scarce, but
excessive reliance may introduce distributional mismatches that degrade
performance. In this paper, we present a learning-theoretic framework to
quantify the trade-off between synthetic and real data. Our approach leverages
algorithmic stability to derive generalization error bounds, characterizing the
optimal synthetic-to-real data ratio that minimizes expected test error as a
function of the Wasserstein distance between the real and synthetic
distributions. We motivate our framework in the setting of kernel ridge
regression with mixed data, offering a detailed analysis that may be of
independent interest. Our theory predicts the existence of an optimal ratio,
leading to a U-shaped behavior of test error with respect to the proportion of
synthetic data. Empirically, we validate this prediction on CIFAR-10 and a
clinical brain MRI dataset. Our theory extends to the important scenario of
domain adaptation, showing that carefully blending synthetic target data with
limited source data can mitigate domain shift and enhance generalization. We
conclude with practical guidance for applying our results to both in-domain and
out-of-domain scenarios.

TL;DR: The paper investigates the impact of synthetic data properties on classifier performance, with a focus on covariance matching.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand which properties of synthetic data affect generalization error in classifiers, beyond the heuristic of matching real data distribution.

Method: The authors use theoretical analysis in high-dimensional regression and extend the insights to experiments involving deep neural networks and various generative models.

Result: Covariance shift, not mean shift, influences generalization error in linear models, and covariance matching proves empirically effective for synthetic data selection.

Conclusion: Covariance matching of synthetic data is critical for improved prediction performance, validated both theoretically and experimentally across setups.

Abstract: Despite the progress in the development of generative models, their
usefulness in creating synthetic data that improve prediction performance of
classifiers has been put into question. Besides heuristic principles such as
"synthetic data should be close to the real data distribution", it is actually
not clear which specific properties affect the generalization error. Our paper
addresses this question through the lens of high-dimensional regression.
Theoretically, we show that, for linear models, the covariance shift between
the target distribution and the distribution of the synthetic data affects the
generalization error but, surprisingly, the mean shift does not. Furthermore we
prove that, in some settings, matching the covariance of the target
distribution is optimal. Remarkably, the theoretical insights from linear
models carry over to deep neural networks and generative models. We empirically
demonstrate that the covariance matching procedure (matching the covariance of
the synthetic data with that of the data coming from the target distribution)
performs well against several recent approaches for synthetic data selection,
across training paradigms, architectures, datasets and generative models used
for augmentation.

*Ivan Kirev,Lyuben Baltadzhiev,Nikola Konstantinov*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper explores the impact of performative shifts in test distributions caused by machine learning models and examines whether binary classification problems impacted by it are learnable within the PAC framework.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: With widespread machine learning adoption comes the issue of performative shifts, where deployment influences test distributions, leading to reduced test performance.

Method: The authors define performative risk minimization, utilizing data from the original distribution to estimate the shifted distribution risk unbiasedly, and apply PAC learning to various performative scenarios.

Result: It demonstrates that PAC-learnable hypothesis spaces remain learnable under performative shifts. Extensive experiments validate the method using synthetic and real data.

Conclusion: Performative effects in machine learning can be modeled and mitigated effectively within the PAC framework, ensuring binary classification problems remain solvable despite distribution shifts.

Abstract: Following the wide-spread adoption of machine learning models in real-world
applications, the phenomenon of performativity, i.e. model-dependent shifts in
the test distribution, becomes increasingly prevalent. Unfortunately, since
models are usually trained solely based on samples from the original
(unshifted) distribution, this performative shift may lead to decreased
test-time performance. In this paper, we study the question of whether and when
performative binary classification problems are learnable, via the lens of the
classic PAC (Probably Approximately Correct) learning framework. We motivate
several performative scenarios, accounting in particular for linear shifts in
the label distribution, as well as for more general changes in both the labels
and the features. We construct a performative empirical risk function, which
depends only on data from the original distribution and on the type
performative effect, and is yet an unbiased estimate of the true risk of a
classifier on the shifted distribution. Minimizing this notion of performative
risk allows us to show that any PAC-learnable hypothesis space in the standard
binary classification setting remains PAC-learnable for the considered
performative scenarios. We also conduct an extensive experimental evaluation of
our performative risk minimization method and showcase benefits on synthetic
and real data.

*Yu-Han Wu,Quentin Berthet,Gérard Biau,Claire Boyer,Romuald Elie,Pierre Marion*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper discovers that the final steps of Latent Diffusion Models (LDMs) can negatively impact sample quality and proposes that stopping earlier can improve generative outcomes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the intrinsic relationship between latent dimensions, stopping time, and sample quality in Latent Diffusion Models, and address why final diffusion steps degrade sample quality.

Method: A Gaussian framework with linear autoencoders was utilized to theoretically analyze the impact of latent dimensions and stopping times on generated sample distributions. Experiments were performed on synthetic and real-world datasets.

Result: Lower-dimensional latent spaces require early stopping for better quality, while higher-dimensional spaces benefit from later stopping. The latent dimension interacts with hyperparameters such as score matching constraints.

Conclusion: The latent dimension significantly influences sample quality, and stopping time should be considered as a critical hyperparameter in designing LDMs for optimal generative performance.

Abstract: We identify and analyze a surprising phenomenon of Latent Diffusion Models
(LDMs) where the final steps of the diffusion can degrade sample quality. In
contrast to conventional arguments that justify early stopping for numerical
stability, this phenomenon is intrinsic to the dimensionality reduction in
LDMs. We provide a principled explanation by analyzing the interaction between
latent dimension and stopping time. Under a Gaussian framework with linear
autoencoders, we characterize the conditions under which early stopping is
needed to minimize the distance between generated and target distributions.
More precisely, we show that lower-dimensional representations benefit from
earlier termination, whereas higher-dimensional latent spaces require later
stopping time. We further establish that the latent dimension interplays with
other hyperparameters of the problem such as constraints in the parameters of
score matching. Experiments on synthetic and real datasets illustrate these
properties, underlining that early stopping can improve generative quality.
Together, our results offer a theoretical foundation for understanding how the
latent dimension influences the sample quality, and highlight stopping time as
a key hyperparameter in LDMs.

TL;DR: The paper introduces A2D2E, a method to improve input variable effect estimation on model predictions, addressing scalability, sensitivity, and instability issues in existing approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations of current estimation methods for input effects on model predictions, such as poor scalability, sensitivity to out-of-distribution sampling, and instability with correlated features.

Method: The proposed method is based on Accelerated Aggregated D-Optimal Designs (A2D2E) which applies principles of experimental design for efficient and robust main effect estimation. The paper also includes theoretical guarantees like convergence and variance reduction.

Result: Demonstrates efficiency and robustness of A2D2E through simulations, real data case studies, and applications in language models, supported by theoretical proofs.

Conclusion: A2D2E overcomes existing limitations in input effect estimation methods and showcases potential with practical applications and theoretical validation.

Abstract: Recent advances in supervised learning have driven growing interest in
explaining black-box models, particularly by estimating the effects of input
variables on model predictions. However, existing approaches often face key
limitations, including poor scalability, sensitivity to out-of-distribution
sampling, and instability under correlated features. To address these issues,
we propose A2D2E, an $\textbf{E}$stimator based on $\textbf{A}$ccelerated
$\textbf{A}$ggregated $\textbf{D}$-Optimal $\textbf{D}$esigns. Our method
leverages principled experimental design to improve efficiency and robustness
in main effect estimation. We establish theoretical guarantees, including
convergence and variance reduction, and validate A2D2E through extensive
simulations. We further provide the potential of the proposed method with a
case study on real data and applications in language models. The code to

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper proposes the Dyson Diffusion Model, which uses spectral dynamics for graph diffusion, addressing the struggles of previous models in distinguishing graph families.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing graph diffusion models face challenges in distinguishing certain graph families and often require ad hoc features, due to architectural inductive biases.

Method: The authors introduce the Dyson Diffusion Model, leveraging random matrix theory and Dyson's Brownian Motion to capture spectral dynamics while preserving non-spectral data.

Result: The proposed model learns graph spectra effectively and surpasses the performance of current graph diffusion models.

Conclusion: The Dyson Diffusion Model provides an improved approach to graph generative modeling by shifting inductive biases into spectral dynamics, enhancing representational capacity.

Abstract: Diffusion models are central to generative modeling and have been adapted to
graphs by diffusing adjacency matrix representations. The challenge of having
up to $n!$ such representations for graphs with $n$ nodes is only partially
mitigated by using permutation-equivariant learning architectures. Despite
their computational efficiency, existing graph diffusion models struggle to
distinguish certain graph families, unless graph data are augmented with ad hoc
features. This shortcoming stems from enforcing the inductive bias within the
learning architecture. In this work, we leverage random matrix theory to
analytically extract the spectral properties of the diffusion process, allowing
us to push the inductive bias from the architecture into the dynamics. Building
on this, we introduce the Dyson Diffusion Model, which employs Dyson's Brownian
Motion to capture the spectral dynamics of an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process on the
adjacency matrix while retaining all non-spectral information. We demonstrate
that the Dyson Diffusion Model learns graph spectra accurately and outperforms
existing graph diffusion models.

*Jordan Cotler,Clément Hongler,Barbora Hudcová*

Main category: nlin.CG

TL;DR: The paper challenges the assumption that Turing-universal systems inherently support non-trivial self-replication by presenting a cellular automaton that is computationally universal but lacks the ability for self-replication.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to understand the conditions necessary for self-replication in physical, non-equilibrium systems, addressing limitations in current assumptions that computational universality inherently enables life-like self-replication.

Method: The authors analyze the concept of computational universality in physical systems and construct a cellular automaton that is computationally universal but incapable of sustaining self-replication. They further investigate the computational complexity of translating physical dynamics into symbolic computation, using Rule 110 as an example.

Result: The study demonstrates that computational universality does not guarantee the emergence of self-replicating dynamics and identifies essential conditions linking computation with the physical behavior of systems.

Conclusion: The findings redefine the relationship between computation, physical dynamics, and self-replication, providing criteria for assessing when a physical system could support life-like behavior.

Abstract: Self-replication is central to all life, and yet how it dynamically emerges
in physical, non-equilibrium systems remains poorly understood. Von Neumann's
pioneering work in the 1940s and subsequent developments suggest a natural
hypothesis: that any physical system capable of Turing-universal computation
can support self-replicating objects. In this work, we challenge this
hypothesis by clarifying what computational universality means for physical
systems and constructing a cellular automaton that is Turing-universal but
cannot sustain non-trivial self-replication. By analogy with biology, such
dynamics manifest transcription and translation but cannot instantiate
replication. More broadly, our work emphasizes that the computational
complexity of translating between physical dynamics and symbolic computation is
inseparable from any claim of universality (exemplified by our analysis of Rule
110) and builds mathematical foundations for identifying self-replicating
behavior. Our approach enables the formulation of necessary dynamical and
computational conditions for a physical system to constitute a living organism.

*Raisa M. Simoes,Timoteo Kelly,Eduardo J. Simoes,Praveen Rao*

Main category: cs.SI

TL;DR: This paper compares two AI-based methods to analyze political issue salience through YouTube comments, finding immigration and democracy dominate discourse over inflation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper seeks to identify and assess the main issues influencing voters’ decisions in the 2024 presidential election through innovative data-driven AI techniques.

Method: Two methodologies using natural language processing and clustering analysis were applied to analyze over 8,000 YouTube comments from election-related videos by the Wall Street Journal and New York Times during the pre-election period.

Result: Immigration and democracy were the most frequently discussed issues in user comments, followed by identity politics, while inflation was discussed far less frequently.

Conclusion: Opinion mining using user comments can yield insights into public sentiment and issue salience that rival or surpass traditional polling or survey methods.

Abstract: This paper aims to explore two competing data science methodologies to
attempt answering the question, "Which issues contributed most to voters'
choice in the 2024 presidential election?" The methodologies involve novel
empirical evidence driven by artificial intelligence (AI) techniques. By using
two distinct methods based on natural language processing and clustering
analysis to mine over eight thousand user comments on election-related YouTube
videos from one right leaning journal, Wall Street Journal, and one left
leaning journal, New York Times, during pre-election week, we quantify the
frequency of selected issue areas among user comments to infer which issues
were most salient to potential voters in the seven days preceding the November
5th election. Empirically, we primarily demonstrate that immigration and
democracy were the most frequently and consistently invoked issues in user
comments on the analyzed YouTube videos, followed by the issue of identity
politics, while inflation was significantly less frequently referenced. These
results corroborate certain findings of post-election surveys but also refute
the supposed importance of inflation as an election issue. This indicates that
variations on opinion mining, with their analysis of raw user data online, can
be more revealing than polling and surveys for analyzing election outcomes.

Motivation: To optimize rank-adaptive algorithms for matrix estimation by assessing effective rank determination's trade-offs.

Method: Instance-specific lower bounds and a proposed algorithm using Least-Squares and singular value thresholding are analyzed.

Result: Finite-sample error bounds demonstrate the algorithm’s near-optimality in performance against derived limits.

Conclusion: The study enhances understanding of matrix denoising and validates findings across applications like regression and system identification.

Abstract: We address the problem of estimating a high-dimensional matrix from linear
measurements, with a focus on designing optimal rank-adaptive algorithms. These
algorithms infer the matrix by estimating its singular values and the
corresponding singular vectors up to an effective rank, adaptively determined
based on the data. We establish instance-specific lower bounds for the sample
complexity of such algorithms, uncovering fundamental trade-offs in selecting
the effective rank: balancing the precision of estimating a subset of singular
values against the approximation cost incurred for the remaining ones. Our
analysis identifies how the optimal effective rank depends on the matrix being
estimated, the sample size, and the noise level. We propose an algorithm that
combines a Least-Squares estimator with a universal singular value thresholding
procedure. We provide finite-sample error bounds for this algorithm and
demonstrate that its performance nearly matches the derived fundamental limits.
Our results rely on an enhanced analysis of matrix denoising methods based on
singular value thresholding. We validate our findings with applications to
multivariate regression and linear dynamical system identification.

TL;DR: This paper introduces a multi-level Kriging-based surrogate method for optimizing complex engineering problems under uncertainty, outperforming state-of-the-art approaches in speed and accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a need to optimize complex engineering designs efficiently under uncertainty, which conventional methods fail to scale adequately.

Method: The paper develops a non-intrusive, fast-scaling, Kriging-based surrogate model that uses hierarchical and orthogonal decomposition to adaptively update multiple surrogates and efficiently utilize uncertainty-informed data.

Result: The proposed method proved faster and more accurate by orders of magnitude in a statistical comparison with current approaches using an analytical testbed.

Conclusion: The multi-level surrogate approach significantly optimizes resource-intensive and high-dimensional engineering problems, addressing scalability and precision challenges in uncertainty modeling.

Abstract: Engineering design involves demanding models encompassing many decision
variables and uncontrollable parameters. In addition, unavoidable aleatoric and
epistemic uncertainties can be very impactful and add further complexity. The
state-of-the-art adopts two steps, uncertainty quantification and design
optimization, to optimize systems under uncertainty by means of robust or
stochastic metrics. However, conventional scenario-based, surrogate-assisted,
and mathematical programming methods are not sufficiently scalable to be
affordable and precise in large and complex cases. Here, a multi-level approach
is proposed to accurately optimize resource-intensive, high-dimensional, and
complex engineering problems under uncertainty with minimal resources. A
non-intrusive, fast-scaling, Kriging-based surrogate is developed to map the
combined design/parameter domain efficiently. Multiple surrogates are
adaptively updated by hierarchical and orthogonal decomposition to leverage the
fewer and most uncertainty-informed data. The proposed method is statistically
compared to the state-of-the-art via an analytical testbed and is shown to be
concurrently faster and more accurate by orders of magnitude.

Motivation: To improve methods for identifying signal components by leveraging established graph clustering techniques.

Result: Numerical experiments showcase the viability of the graph clustering approach to signal component identification.

Conclusion: Graph clustering can provide many novel and effective approaches to signal identification in time-frequency representations.

Abstract: We show that the problem of identifying different signal components from a
time-frequency representation can be equivalently phrased as a graph clustering
problem: given a graph $G=(V,E)$ one aims to identify `clusters', subgraphs
that are strongly connected and have relatively few connections between them.
The graph clustering problem is well studied, we show how these ideas can
suggest (many) new ways to identify signal components. Numerical experiments

TL;DR: The paper proposes a variation of mean-field variational inference (MFVI) by rotating the coordinate system using PCA, yielding more accurate approximations with negligible cost and without complex optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The goal is to improve the accuracy of MFVI in Bayesian inference tasks without increasing computational cost or complexity.

Method: The method involves performing MFVI in a rotated coordinate system defined by PCA of the cross-covariance matrix involving the score function, iteratively transforming the target distribution closer to Gaussian.

Result: The proposed approach achieves higher accuracy in inference compared to standard MFVI, while maintaining lower computational costs than conventional normalizing flows.

Conclusion: The algorithm offers an efficient way to improve variational inference by combining MFVI with a coordinate transformation that simplifies and enhances the approximation process.

Abstract: We propose to perform mean-field variational inference (MFVI) in a rotated
coordinate system that reduces correlations between variables. The rotation is
determined by principal component analysis (PCA) of a cross-covariance matrix
involving the target's score function. Compared with standard MFVI along the
original axes, MFVI in this rotated system often yields substantially more
accurate approximations with negligible additional cost.
  MFVI in a rotated coordinate system defines a rotation and a coordinatewise
map that together move the target closer to Gaussian. Iterating this procedure
yields a sequence of transformations that progressively transforms the target
toward Gaussian. The resulting algorithm provides a computationally efficient
way to construct flow-like transport maps: it requires only MFVI subproblems,
avoids large-scale optimization, and yields transformations that are easy to
invert and evaluate. In Bayesian inference tasks, we demonstrate that the
proposed method achieves higher accuracy than standard MFVI, while maintaining
much lower computational cost than conventional normalizing flows.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve reconstruction accuracy in inverse problems, addressing limitations of both probabilistic and optimization-based methods.

Method: Local MAP Sampling (LMAPS) iteratively solves local MAP subproblems throughout the diffusion trajectory, combining probabilistic interpretation and optimization strategies.

Result: LMAPS achieves significant performance improvements in image restoration tasks like motion deblurring, JPEG restoration, quantization, and inverse scattering benchmarks.

Conclusion: LMAPS provides a unified probabilistic framework for optimization-based approaches, exceeding state-of-the-art benchmarks in various scientific and image restoration applications.

Abstract: Diffusion Posterior Sampling (DPS) provides a principled Bayesian approach to
inverse problems by sampling from $p(x_0 \mid y)$. However, in practice, the
goal of inverse problem solving is not to cover the posterior but to recover
the most accurate reconstruction, where optimization-based diffusion solvers
often excel despite lacking a clear probabilistic foundation. We introduce
Local MAP Sampling (LMAPS), a new inference framework that iteratively solving
local MAP subproblems along the diffusion trajectory. This perspective
clarifies their connection to global MAP estimation and DPS, offering a unified
probabilistic interpretation for optimization-based methods. Building on this
foundation, we develop practical algorithms with a probabilistically
interpretable covariance approximation, a reformulated objective for stability

achieves state-of-the-art performance, including $\geq 2$ dB gains on motion
deblurring, JPEG restoration, and quantization, and $>1.5$ dB improvements on

*Andreas Engelhardt,Mark Boss,Vikram Voletti,Chun-Han Yao,Hendrik P. A. Lensch,Varun Jampani*

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: The paper introduces SViM3D, a single-image-based framework for predicting multi-view consistent physically based rendering (PBR) materials, combining video diffusion models with explicit camera control for relightable and editable 3D assets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of current 3D object reconstruction methods from single images, which use simple material models and require additional steps to enable relighting and appearance editing.

Method: The method extends a latent video diffusion model to generate spatially varying PBR parameters and surface normals while maintaining consistency across different views through explicit camera control.

Result: The framework achieves state-of-the-art performance in relighting and novel view synthesis across multiple object-centric datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed approach generalizes well to various input types, enabling the creation of high-quality, relightable 3D assets applicable in AR/VR, movies, games, and other visual media contexts.

Abstract: We present Stable Video Materials 3D (SViM3D), a framework to predict
multi-view consistent physically based rendering (PBR) materials, given a
single image. Recently, video diffusion models have been successfully used to
reconstruct 3D objects from a single image efficiently. However, reflectance is
still represented by simple material models or needs to be estimated in
additional steps to enable relighting and controlled appearance edits. We
extend a latent video diffusion model to output spatially varying PBR
parameters and surface normals jointly with each generated view based on
explicit camera control. This unique setup allows for relighting and generating
a 3D asset using our model as neural prior. We introduce various mechanisms to
this pipeline that improve quality in this ill-posed setting. We show
state-of-the-art relighting and novel view synthesis performance on multiple
object-centric datasets. Our method generalizes to diverse inputs, enabling the
generation of relightable 3D assets useful in AR/VR, movies, games and other
visual media.

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: This paper proposes a method to optimize neural fields enabling prefiltered outputs in a single pass, incorporating advanced filtering techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing neural fields are limited to fixed resolution. There is a need for methods that allow dynamic and efficient filtering for broader usability.

Method: The paper introduces convolutional filtering in the input domain through Fourier feature embeddings, using closed-form modulation to enable parametric filters during training.

Result: Demonstrates faster training and inference processes with improved filtering performance compared to current approaches.

Conclusion: The proposed method enhances neural fields by allowing flexible and efficient filtering, yielding both quantitative and qualitative advancements.

Abstract: Neural fields excel at representing continuous visual signals but typically
operate at a single, fixed resolution. We present a simple yet powerful method
to optimize neural fields that can be prefiltered in a single forward pass. Key
innovations and features include: (1) We perform convolutional filtering in the
input domain by analytically scaling Fourier feature embeddings with the
filter's frequency response. (2) This closed-form modulation generalizes beyond
Gaussian filtering and supports other parametric filters (Box and Lanczos) that
are unseen at training time. (3) We train the neural field using single-sample
Monte Carlo estimates of the filtered signal. Our method is fast during both
training and inference, and imposes no additional constraints on the network
architecture. We show quantitative and qualitative improvements over existing
methods for neural-field filtering.

*Xilong Zhou,Bao-Huy Nguyen,Loïc Magne,Vladislav Golyanik,Thomas Leimkühler,Christian Theobalt*

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: The paper introduces splattable neural primitives, combining the expressivity of Neural Radiance Fields with the efficiency of primitive-based methods, achieving high-quality, fast rendering with fewer computational resources.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional radiance field representations face a trade-off between expressivity and rendering efficiency, necessitating a unified approach to tackle both issues.

Method: The authors propose primitives encoding bounded neural density fields with shallow neural networks, allowing efficient computation via analytically derived splatting kernels rather than costly ray marching.

Result: Their method matches the speed and quality of 3D Gaussian Splatting while reducing the number of primitives and parameters by factors of 10 and 6 respectively, demonstrating efficiency and effectiveness.

Conclusion: Splattable neural primitives offer a significant advancement in volumetric representation, balancing expressivity and rendering speed without needing intricate frameworks.

Abstract: Radiance fields have emerged as a predominant representation for modeling 3D
scene appearance. Neural formulations such as Neural Radiance Fields provide
high expressivity but require costly ray marching for rendering, whereas
primitive-based methods such as 3D Gaussian Splatting offer real-time
efficiency through splatting, yet at the expense of representational power.
Inspired by advances in both these directions, we introduce splattable neural
primitives, a new volumetric representation that reconciles the expressivity of
neural models with the efficiency of primitive-based splatting. Each primitive
encodes a bounded neural density field parameterized by a shallow neural
network. Our formulation admits an exact analytical solution for line
integrals, enabling efficient computation of perspectively accurate splatting
kernels. As a result, our representation supports integration along view rays
without the need for costly ray marching. The primitives flexibly adapt to
scene geometry and, being larger than prior analytic primitives, reduce the
number required per scene. On novel-view synthesis benchmarks, our approach
matches the quality and speed of 3D Gaussian Splatting while using $10\times$
fewer primitives and $6\times$ fewer parameters. These advantages arise
directly from the representation itself, without reliance on complex control or
adaptation frameworks. The project page is

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: SpotDiff is a personalized image generation approach that combines efficiency and fidelity by disentangling subject identity from other factors using a learning-based technique.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for personalized image generation either preserve high fidelity at high computational costs or are efficient but suffer from entangled representations affected by nuisance factors.

Method: SpotDiff uses a pre-trained CLIP image encoder and specialized expert networks for pose and background, with orthogonality constraints in feature space, and trains on a curated dataset with consistent pose and background variations (SpotDiff10k).

Result: SpotDiff outperforms prior methods in robust subject preservation, controllable editing, and competitive performance, requiring only 10k training samples.

Conclusion: The SpotDiff method effectively balances computational efficiency with high-quality subject identity preservation and editing capabilities in personalized image generation.

Abstract: Personalized image generation aims to faithfully preserve a reference
subject's identity while adapting to diverse text prompts. Existing
optimization-based methods ensure high fidelity but are computationally
expensive, while learning-based approaches offer efficiency at the cost of
entangled representations influenced by nuisance factors. We introduce
SpotDiff, a novel learning-based method that extracts subject-specific features
by spotting and disentangling interference. Leveraging a pre-trained CLIP image
encoder and specialized expert networks for pose and background, SpotDiff
isolates subject identity through orthogonality constraints in the feature
space. To enable principled training, we introduce SpotDiff10k, a curated
dataset with consistent pose and background variations. Experiments demonstrate
that SpotDiff achieves more robust subject preservation and controllable
editing than prior methods, while attaining competitive performance with only
10k training samples.

*Zhitong Huang,Mohan Zhang,Renhan Wang,Rui Tang,Hao Zhu,Jing Liao*

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: X2Video is the first diffusion model designed for generating photorealistic videos based on intrinsic guidance channels combined with intuitive multi-modal controls like reference images and text prompts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to enable accurate, intuitive, and versatile video generation and editing by leveraging intrinsic channels such as albedo, normal, and lighting, while supporting flexible input methods like text and images.

Method: The method extends an intrinsic-guided image generation model (XRGB) to videos using a Hybrid Self-Attention mechanism for temporal consistency, Masked Cross-Attention for global and local text prompts, and a Recursive Sampling method for long-range temporal stability.

Result: The model achieves photorealistic and temporally consistent video rendering, allows multi-modal controls, and supports editing of intrinsic properties with high fidelity.

Conclusion: X2Video demonstrates strong capabilities for photorealistic video generation guided by both intrinsic information and flexible controls, offering a breakthrough in video rendering and editing.

Abstract: We present X2Video, the first diffusion model for rendering photorealistic
videos guided by intrinsic channels including albedo, normal, roughness,
metallicity, and irradiance, while supporting intuitive multi-modal controls
with reference images and text prompts for both global and local regions. The
intrinsic guidance allows accurate manipulation of color, material, geometry,
and lighting, while reference images and text prompts provide intuitive
adjustments in the absence of intrinsic information. To enable these
functionalities, we extend the intrinsic-guided image generation model XRGB to
video generation by employing a novel and efficient Hybrid Self-Attention,
which ensures temporal consistency across video frames and also enhances
fidelity to reference images. We further develop a Masked Cross-Attention to
disentangle global and local text prompts, applying them effectively onto
respective local and global regions. For generating long videos, our novel
Recursive Sampling method incorporates progressive frame sampling, combining
keyframe prediction and frame interpolation to maintain long-range temporal
consistency while preventing error accumulation. To support the training of
X2Video, we assembled a video dataset named InteriorVideo, featuring 1,154
rooms from 295 interior scenes, complete with reliable ground-truth intrinsic
channel sequences and smooth camera trajectories. Both qualitative and
quantitative evaluations demonstrate that X2Video can produce long, temporally
consistent, and photorealistic videos guided by intrinsic conditions.
Additionally, X2Video effectively accommodates multi-modal controls with
reference images, global and local text prompts, and simultaneously supports
editing on color, material, geometry, and lighting through parametric tuning.

Result: Verification tasks for quantized GNNs are proven to be computationally intractable, but quantized models demonstrate lightweight properties and comparable accuracy and generalization.

Conclusion: Ensuring the safety of quantized GNN-based systems requires significant research due to computational intractability. Moreover, quantized GNNs offer a balance between efficiency and performance, validating their utility despite verification limitations.

Abstract: We introduce a logical language for reasoning about quantized
aggregate-combine graph neural networks with global readout (ACR-GNNs). We
provide a logical characterization and use it to prove that verification tasks
for quantized GNNs with readout are (co)NEXPTIME-complete. This result implies
that the verification of quantized GNNs is computationally intractable,
prompting substantial research efforts toward ensuring the safety of GNN-based

Result: The study outlines the asymptotic behavior and identifies limits of RK iterates influenced by noise and system characteristics, supported by numerical validations.

Conclusion: The paper expands knowledge on RK's robustness under noisy conditions, offering theoretical and practical insights for optimizing its use in real-world scenarios.

Abstract: The randomized Kaczmarz (RK) algorithm is one of the most computationally and
memory-efficient iterative algorithms for solving large-scale linear systems.
However, practical applications often involve noisy and potentially
inconsistent systems. While the convergence of RK is well understood for
consistent systems, the study of RK on noisy, inconsistent linear systems is
limited. This paper investigates the asymptotic behavior of RK iterates in
expectation when solving noisy and inconsistent systems, addressing the
locations of their limit points. We explore the roles of singular vectors of
the (noisy) coefficient matrix and derive bounds on the convergence horizon,
which depend on the noise levels and system characteristics. Finally, we
provide extensive numerical experiments that validate our theoretical findings,
offering practical insights into the algorithm's performance under realistic
conditions. These results establish a deeper understanding of the RK
algorithm's limitations and robustness in noisy environments, paving the way
for optimized applications in real-world scientific and engineering problems.

Motivation: To address the need for robust and efficient underwater hydrodynamic sensing and signal analysis for applications like robotic navigation.

Result: Experiments showed accurate vortex frequency detection (error <10%), entropy transition detection, and 86% classification accuracy for vortex regimes with real-time potential.

Conclusion: The structurally-encoded whisker sensor provides a reliable and scalable method for autonomous underwater applications like wake tracking and turbulence-aware navigation.

Abstract: This paper presents a bio-inspired underwater whisker sensor for robust
hydrodynamic disturbance detection and efficient signal analysis based on
Physical Reservoir Computing (PRC). The design uses a tapered nylon spring with
embedded accelerometers to achieve spatially distributed vibration sensing and
frequency separation along the whisker. Towing-tank experiments and
computational fluid dynamics simulations confirmed that the whisker effectively
distinguishes vortex regimes across different fin angles and maintains Strouhal
scaling with flow velocity, where higher speeds increase vibration intensity
without affecting the dominant frequencies. Frequency-domain analysis, Shannon
entropy, and machine learning further validated the sensing performance: vortex
shedding frequencies were identified with less than 10\% error, entropy
captured the transition from coherent vortex streets to turbulence, and
logistic regression achieved 86.0\% classification accuracy with
millisecond-level inference. These results demonstrate that structurally
encoded whisker sensing provides a scalable and real-time solution for
underwater perception, wake tracking, and turbulence-aware navigation in

Result: FlowLensing achieves high simulation fidelity and a speedup of over 200x compared to classical simulators, with low latency.

Conclusion: FlowLensing provides a scalable and accurate method for simulating gravitational lensing, facilitating dark matter studies and improving cosmological survey capabilities.

Abstract: Gravitational lensing is one of the most powerful probes of dark matter, yet
creating high-fidelity lensed images at scale remains a bottleneck. Existing
tools rely on ray-tracing or forward-modeling pipelines that, while precise,
are prohibitively slow. We introduce FlowLensing, a Diffusion Transformer-based
compact and efficient flow-matching model for strong gravitational lensing
simulation. FlowLensing operates in both discrete and continuous regimes,
handling classes such as different dark matter models as well as continuous
model parameters ensuring physical consistency. By enabling scalable
simulations, our model can advance dark matter studies, specifically for
probing dark matter substructure in cosmological surveys. We find that our

Conclusion: pyGinkgo adds high-performance sparse linear algebra capabilities to Python, bridging the gap between usability and performance, and positions itself as a robust tool for sparse machine learning models and scientific applications.

Abstract: Sparse linear algebra is a cornerstone of many scientific computing and

*Şener Özönder*

Main category: cond-mat.mtrl-sci

TL;DR: The paper introduces a criterion called 'learnability,' linking phase transitions to the ability of transformer models to extract structure from data. Using a self-supervised learning approach on the Ising model, it identifies shifts in training loss and attention entropy as markers of phase transitions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the challenge of identifying phase transition boundaries in systems where analytic solutions are unavailable and simulations struggle.

Method: The authors employ a transformer model with an attention mechanism trained using self-supervised learning on Monte Carlo configurations of the 2D Ising model. Unsupervised metrics such as changes in training loss and attention entropy are used to identify phase transitions.

Result: The study finds that ordered phases show enhanced learnability, evidenced by reduced training losses and structured attention, while disordered phases resist learning. Unsupervised diagnostic metrics reliably identify the critical temperature, aligning well with exact values.

Conclusion: Learnability is demonstrated as a universal and data-driven indicator of phase transitions, with implications for bridging condensed matter physics and language model behavior.

Abstract: Phase transitions mark qualitative reorganizations of collective behavior,
yet identifying their boundaries remains challenging whenever analytic
solutions are absent and conventional simulations fail. Here we introduce
learnability as a universal criterion, defined as the ability of a transformer
model containing attention mechanism to extract structure from microscopic
states. Using self-supervised learning and Monte Carlo generated configurations
of the two-dimensional Ising model, we show that ordered phases correspond to
enhanced learnability, manifested in both reduced training loss and structured
attention patterns, while disordered phases remain resistant to learning. Two
unsupervised diagnostics, the sharp jump in training loss and the rise in
attention entropy, recover the critical temperature in excellent agreement with
the exact value. Our results establish learnability as a data-driven marker of
phase transitions and highlight deep parallels between long-range order in
condensed matter and the emergence of structure in modern language models.

TL;DR: The paper discusses HEPTv2, an improved version of HEPT, designed for fast and efficient charged particle track reconstruction in collider experiments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Tracking charged particles in collider experiments is computationally heavy. Existing approaches like GNNs have high costs due to graph construction and irregular computations, necessitating more efficient alternatives.

Method: HEPT was extended to HEPTv2 by including a lightweight decoder that removes the need for post-hoc clustering like DBScan, enabling direct track assignments. This change retains efficient computation patterns and streamlines the process.

Result: HEPTv2 achieved a processing time of approximately 28 ms per event on an A100 GPU while maintaining competitive performance with traditional GNN-based pipelines.

Conclusion: HEPTv2 offers a scalable and efficient solution for particle track reconstruction, providing a viable alternative to GNN-based approaches.

Abstract: Charged particle track reconstruction is a foundational task in collider
experiments and the main computational bottleneck in particle reconstruction.
Graph neural networks (GNNs) have shown strong performance for this problem,
but costly graph construction, irregular computations, and random memory access
patterns substantially limit their throughput. The recently proposed
Hashing-based Efficient Point Transformer (HEPT) offers a theoretically
guaranteed near-linear complexity for large point cloud processing via
locality-sensitive hashing (LSH) in attention computations; however, its
evaluations have largely focused on embedding quality, and the object
condensation pipeline on which HEPT relies requires a post-hoc clustering step
(e.g., DBScan) that can dominate runtime. In this work, we make two
contributions. First, we present a unified, fair evaluation of physics tracking
performance for HEPT and a representative GNN-based pipeline under the same
dataset and metrics. Second, we introduce HEPTv2 by extending HEPT with a
lightweight decoder that eliminates the clustering stage and directly predicts
track assignments. This modification preserves HEPT's regular,
hardware-friendly computations while enabling ultra-fast end-to-end inference.
On the TrackML dataset, optimized HEPTv2 achieves approximately 28 ms per event
on an A100 while maintaining competitive tracking efficiency. These results
position HEPTv2 as a practical, scalable alternative to GNN-based pipelines for
fast tracking.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to tackle the problem of data imbalance in surgical video datasets, as rare actions and tools are under-represented and hinder the robustness of downstream models.

Method: The proposed method introduces a sparse and controllable video diffusion framework that simultaneously denoises RGB frames and optical flow while conditioning generation on sparse visual signals for enhanced control.

Result: Experiments demonstrated that SurgiFlowVid-derived synthetic videos consistently improve performance by 10-20% across applications such as action recognition, tool presence detection, and laparoscope motion prediction.

Conclusion: SurgiFlowVid is an effective approach to mitigating data imbalance in surgical datasets and could advance the understanding and utility of surgical video analysis methods.

Abstract: Surgical video datasets are essential for scene understanding, enabling
procedural modeling and intra-operative support. However, these datasets are
often heavily imbalanced, with rare actions and tools under-represented, which
limits the robustness of downstream models. We address this challenge with
$SurgiFlowVid$, a sparse and controllable video diffusion framework for
generating surgical videos of under-represented classes. Our approach
introduces a dual-prediction diffusion module that jointly denoises RGB frames
and optical flow, providing temporal inductive biases to improve motion
modeling from limited samples. In addition, a sparse visual encoder conditions
the generation process on lightweight signals (e.g., sparse segmentation masks
or RGB frames), enabling controllability without dense annotations. We validate
our approach on three surgical datasets across tasks including action
recognition, tool presence detection, and laparoscope motion prediction.
Synthetic data generated by our method yields consistent gains of 10-20% over
competitive baselines, establishing $SurgiFlowVid$ as a promising strategy to
mitigate data imbalance and advance surgical video understanding methods.

TL;DR: The study created a computational pipeline that functionally annotated Wuchereria bancrofti's dark proteome, discovering novel enzyme classes and potential drug targets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The lack of functional annotation for most of Wuchereria bancrofti's dark proteome hinders drug discovery for lymphatic filariasis.

Method: A computational pipeline involving transformers, hierarchical EC predictors, and rejection sampling was used to annotate proteins and identify drug candidates.

Result: The pipeline annotated 14,772 proteins, identified 543 novel enzyme classes, and prioritized six high-potential drug targets with strong predicted binding affinities.

Conclusion: This work provides the first large-scale map of W. bancrofti's dark proteome and offers promising drug targets, advancing early-stage drug development with experimental validation needed.

Abstract: Wuchereria bancrofti, the parasitic roundworm responsible for lymphatic
filariasis, permanently disables over 36 million people and places 657 million
at risk across 39 countries. A major bottleneck for drug discovery is the lack
of functional annotation for more than 90 percent of the W. bancrofti dark
proteome, leaving many potential targets unidentified. In this work, we present
a novel computational pipeline that converts W. bancrofti's unannotated amino
acid sequence data into precise four-level Enzyme Commission (EC) numbers and
drug candidates. We utilized a DEtection TRansformer to estimate the
probability of enzymatic function, fine-tuned a hierarchical nearest neighbor
EC predictor on 4,476 labeled parasite proteins, and applied rejection sampling
to retain only four-level EC classifications at 100 percent confidence. This
pipeline assigned precise EC numbers to 14,772 previously uncharacterized
proteins and discovered 543 EC classes not previously known in W. bancrofti. A
qualitative triage emphasizing parasite-specific targets, chemical
tractability, biochemical importance, and biological plausibility prioritized
six enzymes across five separate strategies: anti-Wolbachia cell-wall
inhibition, proteolysis blockade, transmission disruption, purinergic immune
interference, and cGMP-signaling destabilization. We curated a 43-compound

### [492] [When Light Bends to the Collective Will: A Theory and Vision for Adaptive Photonic Scale-up Domains](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08072)
*Vamsi Addanki*

Main category: cs.NI

TL;DR: The paper introduces a theoretical framework for adaptive photonic interconnects to optimize communication bottlenecks in chip-to-chip systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the bottlenecks in collective communication in scale-up systems, using programmable photonic interconnects that adapt to the structure of collective operations.

Method: The authors propose a theoretical framework that quantifies the trade-off between reconfiguration delay and performance benefits in adaptive photonic topologies.

Result: They establish connections between Birkhoff-von Neumann decomposition, maximum concurrent flow, and alpha-beta cost modeling for collective communication.

Conclusion: The paper lays foundational theoretical groundwork and outlines a research agenda to enhance algorithm design and systems integration for adaptive photonic interconnects.

Abstract: As chip-to-chip silicon photonics gain traction for their bandwidth and
energy efficiency, collective communication has emerged as a critical
bottleneck in scale-up systems. Programmable photonic interconnects offer a
promising path forward: by dynamically reconfiguring the fabric, they can
establish direct, high-bandwidth optical paths between communicating endpoints
-- \emph{synchronously and guided by the structure of collective operations}
(e.g., AllReduce). However, realizing this vision -- \emph{when light bends to
the collective will} -- requires navigating a fundamental trade-off between
reconfiguration delay and the performance gains of adaptive topologies.
  In this paper, we present a simple theoretical framework for adaptive
photonic scale-up domains that makes this trade-off explicit and clarifies when
reconfiguration is worthwhile. Along the way, we highlight a connection -- not
surprising but still powerful -- between the Birkhoff--von Neumann (BvN)
decomposition, maximum concurrent flow (a classic measure of network
throughput), and the well-known $\alpha$-$\beta$ cost model for collectives.
Finally, we outline a research agenda in algorithm design and systems
integration that can build on this foundation.

*Wenyang Jia,Jingjing Wang,Ziwei Yan,Xiangli Peng,Guohui Yuan*

Main category: cs.NI

TL;DR: BlockSDN significantly enhances blockchain scalability by implementing SDN (Software-Defined Networking), which reduces global block synchronization time considerably.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The scalability of blockchain systems is limited by inefficient peer-to-peer (P2P) broadcasting, and current optimizations rarely consider physical network conditions.

Method: BlockSDN uses an SDN-based approach with a distributed control plane, hierarchical clustering via a graph engine, and a hybrid macro-micro neighbor selection with hierarchical broadcasting.

Result: The implementation of BlockSDN reduces global block synchronization time by 65% compared to Gossip and 55% compared to Mercury.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates that SDN-enabled coordination is a promising direction to improve blockchain systems’ scalability and performance.

Abstract: The scalability of blockchain systems is constrained by inefficient P2P
broadcasting, as most existing optimizations focus only on the logical layer
without considering physical network conditions. To address this, we propose
BlockSDN, the first SDN-based integrated architecture for blockchain. BlockSDN
employs a distributed control plane for a global network view, a graph engine
for hierarchical clustering, and a hybrid macro-micro neighbor selection with
hierarchical broadcasting. A dedicated simulation platform shows that BlockSDN
reduces global block synchronization time by 65% and 55% compared to Gossip and
Mercury, respectively.These results highlight the potential of SDN-enabled
cross-layer coordination to significantly enhance blockchain scalability and
performance.

### [494] [Minimizing the Value-at-Risk of Loan Portfolio via Deep Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07444)
*Albert Di Wang,Ye Du*

Main category: q-fin.CP

TL;DR: The paper introduces two neural network models, DeNN and DSNN, for managing risk in peer-to-peer lending portfolios by optimizing Value-at-Risk and Conditional Value-at-Risk. DeNN offers better performance in many cases despite its simpler design.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the significant issue of risk management in peer-to-peer lending by enabling investors to minimize risks in loan portfolios.

Method: Propose and evaluate two deep neural network models (DeNN with low complexity and DSNN with high complexity) that predict loan default probabilities and default timing.

Result: Both models effectively reduce portfolio risks at various confidence levels, with the simpler DeNN often outperforming the more complex DSNN.

Conclusion: The study highlights the practicality and efficacy of using neural networks for portfolio risk optimization, demonstrating that simpler models like DeNN can be highly effective and outperform more complex designs.

Abstract: Risk management is a prominent issue in peer-to-peer lending. An investor may
naturally reduce his risk exposure by diversifying instead of putting all his
money on one loan. In that case, an investor may want to minimize the
Value-at-Risk (VaR) or Conditional Value-at-Risk (CVaR) of his loan portfolio.
We propose a low degree of freedom deep neural network model, DeNN, as well as
a high degree of freedom model, DSNN, to tackle the problem. In particular, our
models predict not only the default probability of a loan but also the time
when it will default. The experiments demonstrate that both models can
significantly reduce the portfolio VaRs at different confidence levels,
compared to benchmarks. More interestingly, the low degree of freedom model,
DeNN, outperforms DSNN in most scenarios.

*Pranav Sambhu,Om Guin,Madhav Sambhu,Jinho Cha*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: This paper demonstrates that integrating curriculum learning with diffusion-based synthetic augmentation significantly enhances the detection of challenging pulmonary nodules in chest X-rays, achieving better performance metrics compared to baseline models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of detecting difficult pulmonary nodules—features like low size, brightness, and contrast—that often hinder conventional AI models due to data imbalance and limited annotations.

Method: The study employs a Faster R-CNN with an FPN backbone, trained on a hybrid dataset combining real-world datasets and synthetic images generated via DDPM, while using curriculum learning guided by difficulty scores based on attributes like size and contrast.

Result: The curriculum model achieved a mean AUC of 0.95 (vs. 0.89 for baseline), with significant sensitivity and accuracy improvements (70% vs. 48% and 82% vs. 70%, respectively). Gains were consistent across all levels of detection difficulty.

Conclusion: Curriculum-guided synthetic augmentation can significantly enhance the robustness and generalization of AI models for pulmonary nodule detection in chest radiographs.

Abstract: This study evaluates whether integrating curriculum learning with
diffusion-based synthetic augmentation can enhance the detection of difficult
pulmonary nodules in chest radiographs, particularly those with low size,
brightness, and contrast, which often challenge conventional AI models due to
data imbalance and limited annotation. A Faster R-CNN with a Feature Pyramid
Network (FPN) backbone was trained on a hybrid dataset comprising
expert-labeled NODE21 (1,213 patients; 52.4 percent male; mean age 63.2 +/-
11.5 years), VinDr-CXR, CheXpert, and 11,206 DDPM-generated synthetic images.
Difficulty scores based on size, brightness, and contrast guided curriculum
learning. Performance was compared to a non-curriculum baseline using mean
average precision (mAP), Dice score, and area under the curve (AUC).
Statistical tests included bootstrapped confidence intervals, DeLong tests, and
paired t-tests. The curriculum model achieved a mean AUC of 0.95 versus 0.89
for the baseline (p < 0.001), with improvements in sensitivity (70 percent vs.
48 percent) and accuracy (82 percent vs. 70 percent). Stratified analysis
demonstrated consistent gains across all difficulty bins (Easy to Very Hard).
Grad-CAM visualizations confirmed more anatomically focused attention under
curriculum learning. These results suggest that curriculum-guided synthetic
augmentation enhances model robustness and generalization for pulmonary nodule
detection.

*Yufei Tong,Guanjie Cheng,Peihan Wu,Yicheng Zhu,Kexu Lu,Feiyi Chen,Meng Xi,Junqin Huang,Shuiguang Deng*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: SatFusion is a unified framework designed for enhancing satellite IoT images using multi-temporal and multi-source data fusion.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a need to effectively utilize complementary information from temporal and source dimensions in Sat-IoT images, as current methods fail in fully exploiting these aspects.

Method: SatFusion employs a Multi-Temporal Image Fusion module, a Multi-Source Image Fusion module, and a Fusion Composition module guided by loss functions to enhance the image fusion process.

Result: Experiments on diverse datasets such as WorldStrat, WV3, QB, and GF2 reveal that SatFusion improves fusion quality, robustness to challenging conditions, and real-world generalizability.

Conclusion: SatFusion addresses limitations in previous methods, demonstrating superior performance in real-world satellite IoT scenarios thanks to its innovative unified framework.

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of the digital society, the proliferation of
satellites in the Satellite Internet of Things (Sat-IoT) has led to the
continuous accumulation of large-scale multi-temporal and multi-source images
across diverse application scenarios. However, existing methods fail to fully
exploit the complementary information embedded in both temporal and source
dimensions. For example, Multi-Image Super-Resolution (MISR) enhances
reconstruction quality by leveraging temporal complementarity across multiple
observations, yet the limited fine-grained texture details in input images
constrain its performance. Conversely, pansharpening integrates multi-source
images by injecting high-frequency spatial information from panchromatic data,
but typically relies on pre-interpolated low-resolution inputs and assumes
noise-free alignment, making it highly sensitive to noise and misregistration.
To address these issues, we propose SatFusion: A Unified Framework for
Enhancing Satellite IoT Images via Multi-Temporal and Multi-Source Data Fusion.
Specifically, SatFusion first employs a Multi-Temporal Image Fusion (MTIF)
module to achieve deep feature alignment with the panchromatic image. Then, a
Multi-Source Image Fusion (MSIF) module injects fine-grained texture
information from the panchromatic data. Finally, a Fusion Composition module
adaptively integrates the complementary advantages of both modalities while
dynamically refining spectral consistency, supervised by a weighted combination
of multiple loss functions. Extensive experiments on the WorldStrat, WV3, QB,
and GF2 datasets demonstrate that SatFusion significantly improves fusion
quality, robustness under challenging conditions, and generalizability to
real-world Sat-IoT scenarios. The code is available at:

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: The paper introduces an AI approach for generating diagnostic radiology reports for cranial trauma cases, outperforming existing models in accuracy and utility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the diagnostic challenges in emergency medicine for traumatic brain injuries by improving timely interpretation of medical imaging data through AI.

Method: The paper employs an AI model combining an AC-BiFPN for feature extraction and a Transformer architecture to generate automatic radiology reports for traumatic brain injury cases.

Result: The model achieves superior diagnostic accuracy and report generation performance compared to traditional CNN-based models, demonstrated on the RSNA Intracranial Hemorrhage Detection dataset.

Conclusion: The proposed AI-based solution aids radiologists by improving decision-making, provides educational value for trainees, and shows promise for enhancing diagnosis in traumatic brain injury cases.

Abstract: Traumatic brain injuries present significant diagnostic challenges in
emergency medicine, where the timely interpretation of medical images is
crucial for patient outcomes. In this paper, we propose a novel AI-based
approach for automatic radiology report generation tailored to cranial trauma
cases. Our model integrates an AC-BiFPN with a Transformer architecture to
capture and process complex medical imaging data such as CT and MRI scans. The
AC-BiFPN extracts multi-scale features, enabling the detection of intricate
anomalies like intracranial hemorrhages, while the Transformer generates
coherent, contextually relevant diagnostic reports by modeling long-range
dependencies. We evaluate the performance of our model on the RSNA Intracranial
Hemorrhage Detection dataset, where it outperforms traditional CNN-based models
in both diagnostic accuracy and report generation. This solution not only
supports radiologists in high-pressure environments but also provides a
powerful educational tool for trainee physicians, offering real-time feedback
and enhancing their learning experience. Our findings demonstrate the potential
of combining advanced feature extraction with transformer-based text generation
to improve clinical decision-making in the diagnosis of traumatic brain
injuries.

### [498] [ZeroCard: Cardinality Estimation with Zero Dependence on Target Databases -- No Data, No Query, No Retraining](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07983)
*Xianghong Xu,Rong Kang,Xiao He,Lei Zhang,Jianjun Chen,Tieying Zhang*

Main category: cs.DB

TL;DR: ZeroCard introduces a novel, semantics-driven cardinality estimation method that eliminates dependence on raw data, query logs, or retraining, ensuring ease of deployment in real-world query optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing cardinality estimation methods lack generalizability and depend strongly on raw data or query logs, limiting real-world applicability.

Method: ZeroCard utilizes schema semantics to predict data distributions, employs a query template-agnostic representation, and undergoes large-scale pretraining on a query dataset, enabling off-the-shelf application.

Result: Experiments showcase that ZeroCard outperforms existing methods and facilitates seamless deployment due to its zero-dependence property.

Conclusion: Leveraging schema semantics in ZeroCard addresses key limitations in cardinality estimation, offering a practical and generalizable approach for query optimization.

Abstract: Cardinality estimation is a fundamental task in database systems and plays a
critical role in query optimization. Despite significant advances in
learning-based cardinality estimation methods, most existing approaches remain
difficult to generalize to new datasets due to their strong dependence on raw
data or queries, thus limiting their practicality in real scenarios. To
overcome these challenges, we argue that semantics in the schema may benefit
cardinality estimation, and leveraging such semantics may alleviate these
dependencies. To this end, we introduce ZeroCard, the first semantics-driven
cardinality estimation method that can be applied without any dependence on raw
data access, query logs, or retraining on the target database. Specifically, we
propose to predict data distributions using schema semantics, thereby avoiding
raw data dependence. Then, we introduce a query template-agnostic
representation method to alleviate query dependence. Finally, we construct a
large-scale query dataset derived from real-world tables and pretrain ZeroCard
on it, enabling it to learn cardinality from schema semantics and predicate
representations. After pretraining, ZeroCard's parameters can be frozen and
applied in an off-the-shelf manner. We conduct extensive experiments to
demonstrate the distinct advantages of ZeroCard and show its practical
applications in query optimization. Its zero-dependence property significantly
facilitates deployment in real-world scenarios.

### [499] [Implementing Semantic Join Operators Efficiently](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08489)
*Immanuel Trummer*

Main category: cs.DB

TL;DR: This paper introduces an optimized algorithm for performing semantic joins using large language models (LLMs), reducing computational costs while improving efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current semantic query processing engines rely on inefficient methods like nested loops to execute semantic joins using LLMs, and there is room for improvement in processing efficiency.

Method: The paper proposes a block nested loops-inspired algorithm that processes batches of rows from input tables in a single prompt to identify matching rows, with formulas for optimizing batch sizes based on LLM context window constraints. Additionally, an adaptive variant handles cases with unpredictable output sizes.

Result: The proposed algorithm significantly reduces processing costs and demonstrates strong performance compared to existing semantic join implementations in modern semantic query processing engines.

Conclusion: The method offers a promising direction for cost-effective and efficient execution of semantic joins, leveraging the strengths of LLMs in matching conditions provided in natural language.

Abstract: Semantic query processing engines often support semantic joins, enabling
users to match rows that satisfy conditions specified in natural language. Such
join conditions can be evaluated using large language models (LLMs) that solve
novel tasks without task-specific training.
  Currently, many semantic query processing engines implement semantic joins
via nested loops, invoking the LLM to evaluate the join condition on row pairs.
Instead, this paper proposes a novel algorithm, inspired by the block nested
loops join operator implementation in traditional database systems. The
proposed algorithm integrates batches of rows from both input tables into a
single prompt. The goal of the LLM invocation is to identify all matching row
pairs in the current input. The paper introduces formulas that can be used to
optimize the size of the row batches, taking into account constraints on the
size of the LLM context window (limiting both input and output size). An
adaptive variant of the proposed algorithm refers to cases in which the size of
the output is difficult to estimate. A formal analysis of asymptotic processing
costs, as well as empirical results, demonstrates that the proposed approach
reduces costs significantly and performs well compared to join implementations
used by recent semantic query processing engines.

*Ronja Strömsdörfer,Klaus Obermayer*

Main category: nlin.AO

TL;DR: The paper investigates how two adaptation mechanisms influence traveling waves in neuronal populations during slow-wave sleep using a mathematical model.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To better understand internal mechanisms modulating slow oscillations during slow-wave sleep, which are essential for brain activity and function.

Method: A spatially extended two-population Wilson-Cowan model was employed to simulate traveling waves in neuronal dynamics, integrating two types of adaptation mechanisms.

Result: Both adaptation mechanisms showed equivalency in dynamics under compensation by external inputs but produced distinct effects on wave properties, making adaptation strength crucial for inducing traveling waves.

Conclusion: Adaptation mechanisms, despite dynamic equivalence, result in distinct traveling wave propagation due to location-dependent feedback strength variations.

Abstract: During slow-wave sleep, the brain produces traveling waves of slow
oscillations (SOs; $\leq 2$ Hz), characterized by the propagation of
alternating high- and low-activity states. The question of internal mechanisms
that modulate traveling waves of SOs is still unanswered although it is
established that it is an adaptation mechanism that mediates them. One
mechanism investigated is spike-frequency adaptation, a hyperpolarizing
feedback current that is activated during periods of high-activity. An
alternative mechanism is based on hyperpolarization-activated currents, which
are positive feedback currents that are activated in low-activity states. Both
adaptation mechanisms were shown to feature SO-like dynamics in neuronal
populations, and the inclusion of a spatial domain seems to enhance observable
differences in their effects. To investigate this in detail, we examine a
spatially extended two-population Wilson-Cowan model with local spatial
coupling and the excitatory populations equipped with either one of the two
adaptation mechanisms. We describe them with the same dynamical equation and
include the inverse mode of action by changing the signs of adaptation strength
and gain. We show that the dynamical systems are mathematically equivalent
under a compensatory external input, which depends on the adaptation strength,
leading to a shift in state space of the otherwise equivalent bifurcation
structure. Strong enough adaptation is required to induce traveling waves.
Additionally, adaptation modulates the properties of the spatio-temporal
activity patterns, such as temporal and spatial frequencies, and the speed of
the traveling waves, all of which increase with increasing strength. Though
being dynamically equivalent, our results also explain why location-dependent
variations in feedback strength cause differences in the propagation of
traveling waves between both adaptation mechanisms.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To advance the understanding and classification of cubic surjective rational endomorphisms with indeterminacy loci in projective geometry.

Method: An experimental approach leveraging Python and machine learning for classification, along with pure projective geometry for theoretical results.

Result: New explicit examples of such maps were constructed, and a surjectivity condition was established for general cubic endomorphisms.

Conclusion: Surjectivity of general non-regular cubic endomorphisms on projective planes depends on their indeterminacy loci having at least three points.

Abstract: The present note studies \emph{surjective rational endomorphisms} $f:
\mathbb{P}^2 \dashrightarrow \mathbb{P}^2$ with \emph{cubic} terms and the
indeterminacy locus $I_f \ne \emptyset$. We develop an experimental approach,
based on some Python programming and Machine Learning, towards the
classification of such maps; a couple of new explicit $f$ is constructed in
this way. We also prove (via pure projective geometry) that a general
non-regular cubic endomorphism $f$ of $\mathbb{P}^2$ is surjective if and only
if the set $I_f$ has cardinality at least $3$.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a deep generative modeling framework to significantly accelerate molecular dynamics simulations by four orders of magnitude while maintaining physical realism.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional molecular dynamics simulations are limited by femtosecond time steps, constraining the exploration of slower conformational changes and relaxation processes critical for understanding chemical functions.

Method: The proposed method employs a deep generative modeling framework that extrapolates across chemical compositions and system sizes to sample molecular dynamics more efficiently while retaining atomistic detail.

Result: The framework quantitatively characterizes equilibrium ensembles and dynamical relaxation processes for small organic molecules and peptides, making previously costly simulations accessible through direct prediction.

Conclusion: This approach unlocks the ability to explore extended molecular motions, aiding in the study of conformational landscapes, thermodynamics, and kinetics pertinent to chemistry and biophysics.

Abstract: Understanding molecular structure, dynamics, and reactivity requires bridging
processes that occur across widely separated time scales. Conventional
molecular dynamics simulations provide atomistic resolution, but their
femtosecond time steps limit access to the slow conformational changes and
relaxation processes that govern chemical function. Here, we introduce a deep
generative modeling framework that accelerates sampling of molecular dynamics
by four orders of magnitude while retaining physical realism. Applied to small
organic molecules and peptides, the approach enables quantitative
characterization of equilibrium ensembles and dynamical relaxation processes
that were previously only accessible by costly brute-force simulation.
Importantly, the method generalizes across chemical composition and system
size, extrapolating to peptides larger than those used for training, and
captures chemically meaningful transitions on extended time scales. By
expanding the accessible range of molecular motions without sacrificing
atomistic detail, this approach opens new opportunities for probing
conformational landscapes, thermodynamics, and kinetics in systems central to
chemistry and biophysics.

Motivation: The paper seeks to address challenges in optical spiking neural networks, such as power limitations, crosstalk, and scalability, with an architecture that is both feasible and realistic for implementation.

Method: SEPhIA employs microring resonator modulators (MRMs), multi-wavelength sources, and physics-aware optoelectronic SNN models validated through time-domain co-simulations and experimental device parameters.

Result: The proposed architecture demonstrated over 90% classification accuracy on a four-class spike-encoded dataset, comparable to software models, and quantified the impact of photonic device parameters.

Conclusion: SEPhIA provides a scalable and efficient neuromorphic photonic computing solution grounded in realistic physical constraints, enabling effective optoelectronic spike-encoding tasks.

Abstract: Research into optical spiking neural networks (SNNs) has primarily focused on
spiking devices, networks of excitable lasers or numerical modelling of large
architectures, often overlooking key constraints such as limited optical power,
crosstalk and footprint. We introduce SEPhIA, a photonic-electronic,
multi-tiled SNN architecture emphasizing implementation feasibility and
realistic scaling. SEPhIA leverages microring resonator modulators (MRMs) and
multi-wavelength sources to achieve effective sub-one-laser-per-spiking neuron
efficiency. We validate SEPhIA at both device and architecture levels by
time-domain co-simulating excitable CMOS-MRR coupled circuits and by devising a
physics-aware, trainable optoelectronic SNN model, with both approaches
utilizing experimentally derived device parameters. The multi-layer
optoelectronic SNN achieves classification accuracies over 90% on a four-class
spike-encoded dataset, closely comparable to software models. A design space
study further quantifies how photonic device parameters impact SNN performance
under constrained signal-to-noise conditions. SEPhIA offers a scalable,

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: This paper introduces "Retentive Relevance," a new survey-based feedback measure that predicts long-term user retention more effectively than traditional signals like clicks or likes, and integrates it into a real-world recommendation system.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional recommendation systems focus on short-term user engagement metrics, but these are not reliable indicators of long-term user satisfaction or platform retention.

Method: The authors developed "Retentive Relevance," a survey-based metric assessing users' behavioral intentions to return for similar content, and validated its effectiveness using psychometric methods and large-scale modeling.

Result: Retentive Relevance was shown to outperform traditional engagement signals and other survey measures in predicting user retention, especially for users with limited historical data. Implementation in a production system improved both engagement and retention while reducing low-quality content exposure.

Conclusion: The paper presents a validated, scalable framework that integrates user-centered feedback into recommendation systems, enhancing retention, engagement, and responsible AI practices in real-world settings.

Abstract: Recommendation systems have traditionally relied on short-term engagement
signals, such as clicks and likes, to personalize content. However, these
signals are often noisy, sparse, and insufficient for capturing long-term user
satisfaction and retention. We introduce Retentive Relevance, a novel
content-level survey-based feedback measure that directly assesses users'
intent to return to the platform for similar content. Unlike other survey
measures that focus on immediate satisfaction, Retentive Relevance targets
forward-looking behavioral intentions, capturing longer term user intentions
and providing a stronger predictor of retention. We validate Retentive
Relevance using psychometric methods, establishing its convergent,
discriminant, and behavioral validity. Through large-scale offline modeling, we
show that Retentive Relevance significantly outperforms both engagement signals
and other survey measures in predicting next-day retention, especially for
users with limited historical engagement. We develop a production-ready proxy
model that integrates Retentive Relevance into the final stage of a multi-stage
ranking system on a social media platform. Calibrated score adjustments based
on this model yield substantial improvements in engagement, and retention,
while reducing exposure to low-quality content, as demonstrated by large-scale
A/B experiments. This work provides the first empirically validated framework
linking content-level user perceptions to retention outcomes in production
systems. We offer a scalable, user-centered solution that advances both
platform growth and user experience. Our work has broad implications for
responsible AI development.

TL;DR: The paper presents solutions for plagiarism detection in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems using a new dataset and a watermarking system.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the risk of unauthorized data appropriation in RAG-enhanced Large Language Models, despite their benefits in reducing hallucinations and keeping information updated.

Method: The authors create a new dataset called RPD for plagiarism detection and propose a dual-layered watermarking system with semantic and lexical protection, supported by statistical testing for detection.

Result: Experiments prove the approach is effective in various contexts, including against adversarial attacks, while still being robust across different prompts and retrieval parameters.

Conclusion: The study introduces a foundational approach to protecting intellectual property in RAG systems through innovative detection and watermarking mechanisms.

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) enhances Large Language Models (LLMs) by
mitigating hallucinations and outdated information issues, yet simultaneously
facilitates unauthorized data appropriation at scale. This paper addresses this
challenge through two key contributions. First, we introduce RPD, a novel
dataset specifically designed for RAG plagiarism detection that encompasses
diverse professional domains and writing styles, overcoming limitations in

embeds protection at both semantic and lexical levels, complemented by an

effectiveness across varying query volumes, defense prompts, and retrieval
parameters, while maintaining resilience against adversarial evasion

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: The paper introduces TaoSR-AGRL, a framework to enhance query-product relevance prediction in e-commerce search by improving reasoning capacity and training stability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the shortcomings of current methods in handling complex business rules and user queries, especially for long-tail and challenging cases, in e-commerce relevance prediction.

Method: The authors propose TaoSR-AGRL, which employs Rule-aware Reward Shaping for structured rewards and Adaptive Guided Replay to correct low-accuracy reasoning patterns during training.

Result: Experiments on real-world datasets and human evaluations show that TaoSR-AGRL improves relevance accuracy, rule adherence, and training stability compared to DPO and GRPO baselines.

Conclusion: TaoSR-AGRL effectively enhances e-commerce search relevance prediction and has been successfully deployed in Taobao, serving millions of users.

Abstract: Query-product relevance prediction is fundamental to e-commerce search and
has become even more critical in the era of AI-powered shopping, where semantic
understanding and complex reasoning directly shape the user experience and
business conversion. Large Language Models (LLMs) enable generative,
reasoning-based approaches, typically aligned via supervised fine-tuning (SFT)
or preference optimization methods like Direct Preference Optimization (DPO).
However, the increasing complexity of business rules and user queries exposes
the inability of existing methods to endow models with robust reasoning
capacity for long-tail and challenging cases. Efforts to address this via
reinforcement learning strategies like Group Relative Policy Optimization
(GRPO) often suffer from sparse terminal rewards, offering insufficient
guidance for multi-step reasoning and slowing convergence. To address these
challenges, we propose TaoSR-AGRL, an Adaptive Guided Reinforcement Learning
framework for LLM-based relevance prediction in Taobao Search Relevance.
TaoSR-AGRL introduces two key innovations: (1) Rule-aware Reward Shaping, which
decomposes the final relevance judgment into dense, structured rewards aligned
with domain-specific relevance criteria; and (2) Adaptive Guided Replay, which
identifies low-accuracy rollouts during training and injects targeted
ground-truth guidance to steer the policy away from stagnant, rule-violating
reasoning patterns toward compliant trajectories. TaoSR-AGRL was evaluated on
large-scale real-world datasets and through online side-by-side human
evaluations on Taobao Search. It consistently outperforms DPO and standard GRPO
baselines in offline experiments, improving relevance accuracy, rule adherence,
and training stability. The model trained with TaoSR-AGRL has been successfully
deployed in the main search scenario on Taobao, serving hundreds of millions of
users.

*Daniel Huwiler,Kurt Stockinger,Jonathan Fürst*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: VersionRAG improves Retrieval-Augmented Generation for versioned documents by incorporating a hierarchical graph structure and surpasses existing frameworks in accuracy and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address the challenges faced by RAG systems when technical documents evolve through versioning, leading to retrieval inaccuracies.

Method: VersionRAG uses a hierarchical graph structure to model document evolution and routes queries through specialized paths based on intent classification, supporting version-aware filtering and change detection.

Result: VersionRAG achieves 90% accuracy on the VersionQA benchmark, outperforming naive RAG (58%) and GraphRAG (64%), while reducing indexing token requirements by 97%.

Conclusion: VersionRAG establishes a novel framework for handling versioned document QA tasks and sets new benchmarks for accuracy and efficiency in the field.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems fail when documents evolve
through versioning-a ubiquitous characteristic of technical documentation.
Existing approaches achieve only 58-64% accuracy on version-sensitive
questions, retrieving semantically similar content without temporal validity
checks. We present VersionRAG, a version-aware RAG framework that explicitly
models document evolution through a hierarchical graph structure capturing
version sequences, content boundaries, and changes between document states.
During retrieval, VersionRAG routes queries through specialized paths based on
intent classification, enabling precise version-aware filtering and change
tracking. On our VersionQA benchmark-100 manually curated questions across 34
versioned technical documents-VersionRAG achieves 90% accuracy, outperforming
naive RAG (58%) and GraphRAG (64%). VersionRAG reaches 60% accuracy on implicit
change detection where baselines fail (0-10%), demonstrating its ability to
track undocumented modifications. Additionally, VersionRAG requires 97% fewer
tokens during indexing than GraphRAG, making it practical for large-scale
deployment. Our work establishes versioned document QA as a distinct task and
provides both a solution and benchmark for future research.

Conclusion: The study significantly advances capabilities in reasoning-intensive retrieval and commits to open-sourcing resources to facilitate further research.

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce ReasonEmbed, a novel text embedding model
developed for reasoning-intensive document retrieval. Our work includes three
key technical contributions. First, we propose ReMixer, a new data synthesis
method that overcomes the triviality problem prevalent in previous synthetic
datasets, enabling large-scale production of 82K high-quality training samples.
Second, we design Redapter, a self-adaptive learning algorithm that dynamically
adjusts training each sample's weight based on its reasoning intensity. This
allows the model to effectively capture the complex semantic relationships
between queries and documents. Third, we implement ReasonEmbed across multiple
backbones of varying sizes, all of which achieve superior performance on
reasoning-intensive retrieval tasks. Notably, our ReasonEmbed-Qwen3-8B model
offers a record-high nDCG@10 score of 38.1 on the BRIGHT benchmark, which
significantly outperforms existing text embedding models. We will fully
open-source our created resources in ReasonEmbed to push forward the research
advancement in this field.

TL;DR: The paper introduces PLUM, a framework that adapts Large Language Models (LLMs) for large-scale recommendation tasks, showing improved performance compared to traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Recommendation systems are critical for modern applications, and LLMs' capabilities in sequence modeling and world knowledge can revolutionize these systems.

Method: PLUM combines Semantic ID-based item tokenization, continued pre-training on domain-specific data, and task-specific fine-tuning focusing on generative retrieval methods.

Result: Experiments on YouTube's massive video recommendation datasets show that PLUM outperforms traditional models with large embedding tables in retrieval tasks.

Conclusion: PLUM successfully leverages LLMs for scalable recommendation, improves retrieval accuracy, and provides insights into optimization strategies for implementation in real-world applications.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) pose a new paradigm of modeling and computation
for information tasks. Recommendation systems are a critical application domain
poised to benefit significantly from the sequence modeling capabilities and
world knowledge inherent in these large models. In this paper, we introduce
PLUM, a framework designed to adapt pre-trained LLMs for industry-scale
recommendation tasks. PLUM consists of item tokenization using Semantic IDs,
continued pre-training (CPT) on domain-specific data, and task-specific
fine-tuning for recommendation objectives. For fine-tuning, we focus
particularly on generative retrieval, where the model is directly trained to
generate Semantic IDs of recommended items based on user context. We conduct
comprehensive experiments on large-scale internal video recommendation
datasets. Our results demonstrate that PLUM achieves substantial improvements
for retrieval compared to a heavily-optimized production model built with large
embedding tables. We also present a scaling study for the model's retrieval
performance, our learnings about CPT, a few enhancements to Semantic IDs, along
with an overview of the training and inference methods that enable launching
this framework to billions of users in YouTube.

*Aadi Singhi*

TL;DR: The paper introduces a multi-agent Bitcoin trading system leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) for improved cryptocurrency market analysis, demonstrating significant performance gains through verbal feedback mechanisms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges posed by cryptocurrency market volatility, sentiment dynamics, and regulatory shifts, which are inadequately handled by static models or historical-data-trained neural networks.

Method: The framework organizes LLMs into specialized agents that perform technical analysis, sentiment evaluation, decision-making, and performance review. It incorporates a Reflect agent delivering verbal feedback to refine trading parameters dynamically without finetuning.

Result: In back-testing from July 2024 to April 2025, the system exhibited better returns than buy-and-hold strategies in various market regimes, with up to 100% gains in sideways markets and improved losses during bearish phases.

Conclusion: Verbal feedback is a scalable and cost-effective technique for tuning LLMs in financial applications, offering improved adaptability and performance in volatile markets like cryptocurrencies.

Abstract: This paper presents a Multi Agent Bitcoin Trading system that utilizes Large
Language Models (LLMs) for alpha generation and portfolio management in the
cryptocurrencies market. Unlike equities, cryptocurrencies exhibit extreme
volatility and are heavily influenced by rapidly shifting market sentiments and
regulatory announcements, making them difficult to model using static
regression models or neural networks trained solely on historical data [53].
The proposed framework overcomes this by structuring LLMs into specialised
agents for technical analysis, sentiment evaluation, decision-making, and
performance reflection. The system improves over time through a novel verbal
feedback mechanism where a Reflect agent provides daily and weekly
natural-language critiques of trading decisions. These textual evaluations are
then injected into future prompts, allowing the system to adjust indicator
priorities, sentiment weights, and allocation logic without parameter updates
or finetuning. Back-testing on Bitcoin price data from July 2024 to April 2025
shows consistent outperformance across market regimes: the Quantitative agent
delivered over 30% higher returns in bullish phases and 15% overall gains
versus buy-and-hold, while the sentiment-driven agent turned sideways markets
from a small loss into a gain of over 100%. Adding weekly feedback further
improved total performance by 31% and reduced bearish losses by 10%. The
results demonstrate that verbal feedback represents a new, scalable, and
low-cost method of tuning LLMs for financial goals.

Main category: physics.med-ph

TL;DR: The study used deep learning-based MRI analysis to quantify hepatic vessel volumes linked to liver disease severity, demonstrating correlations with various clinical markers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the potential of deep learning-powered MRI in distinguishing hepatic vessel volume differences across liver health and disease stages, and its correlation with established liver function and disease severity markers.

Method: A retrospective analysis of 197 subjects (healthy controls and chronic liver disease patients) using a 3D U-Net model for hepatic vessel segmentation from MRI data. The volume-to-volume ratios of hepatic vessels were then compared and correlated with markers related to liver dysfunction and fibrosis/portal hypertension.

Result: The study found that liver vessel volumes (TVVR and HVVR) were significantly higher in healthy controls compared to non-advanced and advanced chronic liver disease patients. Correlations were observed between HVVR, TVVR, PVVR, and markers of disease severity like ALBI, MELD-Na, and liver stiffness.

Conclusion: Deep learning-based hepatic vessel volumetry offers a promising method to quantify liver disease severity and differentiate between health and disease stages, with meaningful correlations to existing clinical biomarkers.

Abstract: Background: We aimed to quantify hepatic vessel volumes across chronic liver
disease stages and healthy controls using deep learning-based magnetic
resonance imaging (MRI) analysis, and assess correlations with biomarkers for
liver (dys)function and fibrosis/portal hypertension.
  Methods: We assessed retrospectively healthy controls, non-advanced and
advanced chronic liver disease (ACLD) patients using a 3D U-Net model for
hepatic vessel segmentation on portal venous phase gadoxetic acid-enhanced 3-T
MRI. Total (TVVR), hepatic (HVVR), and intrahepatic portal vein-to-volume
ratios (PVVR) were compared between groups and correlated with:
albumin-bilirubin (ALBI) and model for end-stage liver disease-sodium (MELD-Na)
score, and fibrosis/portal hypertension (Fibrosis-4 [FIB-4] score, liver
stiffness measurement [LSM], hepatic venous pressure gradient [HVPG], platelet
count [PLT], and spleen volume).
  Results: We included 197 subjects, aged 54.9 $\pm$ 13.8 years (mean $\pm$
standard deviation), 111 males (56.3\%): 35 healthy controls, 44 non-ACLD, and
118 ACLD patients. TVVR and HVVR were highest in controls (3.9; 2.1),
intermediate in non-ACLD (2.8; 1.7), and lowest in ACLD patients (2.3; 1.0) ($p
\leq 0.001$). PVVR was reduced in both non-ACLD and ACLD patients (both 1.2)
compared to controls (1.7) ($p \leq 0.001$), but showed no difference between
CLD groups ($p = 0.999$). HVVR significantly correlated indirectly with FIB-4,
ALBI, MELD-Na, LSM, and spleen volume ($\rho$ ranging from -0.27 to -0.40), and
directly with PLT ($\rho = 0.36$). TVVR and PVVR showed similar but weaker
correlations.
  Conclusions: Deep learning-based hepatic vessel volumetry demonstrated
differences between healthy liver and chronic liver disease stages and shows
correlations with established markers of disease severity.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address ecosystem fragmentation in quantum computing benchmarking by enabling interoperability and flexibility in workflows.

Conclusion: The modular architecture standardizes interfaces in quantum computing benchmarking to reduce ecosystem fragmentation, enhance interoperability, and preserve optimization flexibility.

Abstract: We present a platform-agnostic modular architecture that addresses the
increasingly fragmented landscape of quantum computing benchmarking by
decoupling problem generation, circuit execution, and results analysis into
independent, interoperable components. Supporting over 20 benchmark variants
ranging from simple algorithmic tests like Bernstein-Vazirani to complex
Hamiltonian simulation with observable calculations, the system integrates with
multiple circuit generation APIs (Qiskit, CUDA-Q, Cirq) and enables diverse
workflows. We validate the architecture through successful integration with
Sandia's $\textit{pyGSTi}$ for advanced circuit analysis and CUDA-Q for
multi-GPU HPC simulations. Extensibility of the system is demonstrated by
implementing dynamic circuit variants of existing benchmarks and a new quantum
reinforcement learning benchmark, which become readily available across
multiple execution and analysis modes. Our primary contribution is identifying
and formalizing modular interfaces that enable interoperability between
incompatible benchmarking frameworks, demonstrating that standardized
interfaces reduce ecosystem fragmentation while preserving optimization
flexibility. This architecture has been developed as a key enhancement to the
continually evolving QED-C Application-Oriented Performance Benchmarks for

TL;DR: The paper establishes a connection between flow models in machine learning and the Schrödinger equation, proposing a quantum algorithm for efficient simulation and addressing various statistical problems using quantum techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore how modern machine learning models, specifically flow models, can interface with quantum computing and benefit from the unique capabilities of quantum algorithms.

Method: The paper links flow models with the Schrödinger equation and constructs a quantum algorithm leveraging this connection. It utilizes Hamiltonian simulation combined with classical learning approaches.

Result: It is shown that dynamics from flow models can be efficiently simulated on a quantum computer, enabling quantum-based statistical problems like mean estimation and property testing.

Conclusion: Quantum computers may provide advantages for statistical tasks by leveraging coherent quantum encodings of flow model distributions, thus offering insights into bridging quantum computing and advanced machine learning paradigms.

Abstract: Flow models are a cornerstone of modern machine learning. They are generative
models that progressively transform probability distributions according to
learned dynamics. Specifically, they learn a continuous-time Markov process
that efficiently maps samples from a simple source distribution into samples
from a complex target distribution. We show that these models are naturally
related to the Schr\"odinger equation, for an unusual Hamiltonian on continuous
variables. Moreover, we prove that the dynamics generated by this Hamiltonian
can be efficiently simulated on a quantum computer. Together, these results
give a quantum algorithm for preparing coherent encodings (a.k.a., qsamples)
for a vast family of probability distributions--namely, those expressible by
flow models--by reducing the task to an existing classical learning problem,
plus Hamiltonian simulation. For statistical problems defined by flow models,
such as mean estimation and property testing, this enables the use of quantum
algorithms tailored to qsamples, which may offer advantages over classical
algorithms based only on samples from a flow model. More broadly, these results
reveal a close connection between state-of-the-art machine learning models,
such as flow matching and diffusion models, and one of the main expected
capabilities of quantum computers: simulating quantum dynamics.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To tackle bottlenecks in classical path planning for NP problems and shortcomings in current quantum path planning frameworks in the NISQ era.

Method: The approach involves mapping the grid path problem to quantum energy state minimization, employing two parallel QAOA circuits for connectivity and path energy calculations, and filtering unreasonable solutions with a classical algorithm to derive approximate optimal paths.

Result: The research shows that filtering low-probability quantum states enhances the likelihood of obtaining the optimal solution, even with minimal circuit layers. Parallel circuits outperform serial circuits in finding optimal paths with higher probability.

Conclusion: By utilizing parallel QAOA circuits and effective filtering techniques, this method significantly improves the efficiency and accuracy of quantum path planning, presenting a practical advancement for the NISQ era.

Abstract: To overcome the bottleneck of classical path planning schemes in solving NP
problems and address the predicament faced by current mainstream quantum path
planning frameworks in the Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) era, this
study attempts to construct a quantum path planning solution based on parallel
Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) architecture. Specifically,
the grid path planning problem is mapped to the problem of finding the minimum
quantum energy state. Two parallel QAOA circuits are built to simultaneously
execute two solution processes, namely connectivity energy calculation and path
energy calculation. A classical algorithm is employed to filter out
unreasonable solutions of connectivity energy, and finally, the approximate
optimal solution to the path planning problem is obtained by merging the
calculation results of the two parallel circuits. The research findings
indicate that by setting appropriate filter parameters, quantum states
corresponding to position points with extremely low occurrence probabilities
can be effectively filtered out, thereby increasing the probability of
obtaining the target quantum state. Even when the circuit layer number p is
only 1, the theoretical solution of the optimal path coding combination can
still be found by leveraging the critical role of the filter. Compared with
serial circuits, parallel circuits exhibit a significant advantage, as they can
find the optimal feasible path coding combination with the highest probability.

TL;DR: The paper introduces IKNet, a framework that blends news sentiment analysis and technical indicators to predict stock prices, emphasizing context-based interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional news-based stock forecasting models lack the capability to quantitatively and contextually explain the influence of public sentiment on their predictions.

Method: The proposed IKNet model uses FinBERT to analyze significant keywords contextually. It separately processes embeddings via nonlinear projections, integrates them with technical indicators, and employs Shapley Additive Explanations for interpretable keyword-level attributions.

Result: IKNet reduced prediction RMSE by up to 32.9% and improved cumulative returns by 18.5% on S&P 500 data from 2015–2024, outperforming other models.

Conclusion: IKNet enhances prediction accuracy and provides meaningful, interpretable explanations of how news-driven sentiment impacts stock price movements.

Abstract: The increasing influence of unstructured external information, such as news
articles, on stock prices has attracted growing attention in financial markets.
Despite recent advances, most existing newsbased forecasting models represent
all articles using sentiment scores or average embeddings that capture the
general tone but fail to provide quantitative, context-aware explanations of
the impacts of public sentiment on predictions. To address this limitation, we
propose an interpretable keyword-guided network (IKNet), which is an
explainable forecasting framework that models the semantic association between
individual news keywords and stock price movements. The IKNet identifies
salient keywords via FinBERTbased contextual analysis, processes each embedding
through a separate nonlinear projection layer, and integrates their
representations with the time-series data of technical indicators to forecast
next-day closing prices. By applying Shapley Additive Explanations the model
generates quantifiable and interpretable attributions for the contribution of
each keyword to predictions. Empirical evaluations of S&P 500 data from 2015 to
2024 demonstrate that IKNet outperforms baselines, including recurrent neural
networks and transformer models, reducing RMSE by up to 32.9% and improving
cumulative returns by 18.5%. Moreover, IKNet enhances transparency by offering
contextualized explanations of volatility events driven by public sentiment.

Main category: eess.AS

TL;DR: This paper addresses the issue of robust automatic speech recognition (ASR) under domain shifts, proposing a method that uses a correction vector derived from pseudo-labels to significantly enhance recognition accuracy on African accents.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation stems from the challenge of domain shifts in ASR, where unseen accents and limited labeled data make traditional methods like pseudo-labeling prone to systematic errors.

Method: The method involves fine-tuning two ASR models from the same initialization, one using ground-truth labels and the other with pseudo-labels. The weight difference between these models forms a correction vector to adjust pseudo-label biases.

Result: The proposed method achieved up to a 35% relative reduction in Word Error Rate on AfriSpeech-200 across ten African accents using Whisper tiny as the model.

Conclusion: The proposed correction vector effectively mitigates pseudo-label biases in domain-shift scenarios for ASR, improving recognition performance significantly even on unseen accents.

Abstract: Robust ASR under domain shift is crucial because real-world systems encounter
unseen accents and domains with limited labeled data. Although pseudo-labeling
offers a practical workaround, it often introduces systematic, accent-specific
errors that filtering fails to fix. We ask: How can we correct these recurring
biases without target ground truth? We propose a simple parameter-space
correction: in a source domain containing both real and pseudo-labeled data,
two ASR models are fine-tuned from the same initialization, one on ground-truth
labels and the other on pseudo-labels, and their weight difference forms a
correction vector that captures pseudo-label biases. When applied to a
pseudo-labeled target model, this vector enhances recognition, achieving up to
a 35% relative Word Error Rate (WER) reduction on AfriSpeech-200 across ten
African accents with the Whisper tiny model.

Main category: cond-mat.dis-nn

TL;DR: The paper uses Bayesian optimization to enhance the encoding fidelity of thin-film transistors (TFTs) in physical reservoir computing, enabling high-fidelity 6-bit temporal encoding with optimized pulse parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the problem of suboptimal encoding fidelity in physical reservoir computing due to empirically chosen operation conditions, especially for time-series data processing.

Method: The authors use Bayesian optimization to systematically explore and optimize five key pulse parameters, employing normalized degree of separation (nDoS) as a metric for assessing output state separability.

Result: The study achieves high-fidelity 6-bit temporal encoding with optimized pulse parameters, demonstrates that a 4-bit optimization model can guide more complex tasks, and identifies key influential parameters like gate pulse amplitude and drain voltage.

Conclusion: This work provides the first systematic approach to determine optimal operating conditions for reservoir devices, offering a methodology that is transferable to other material platforms in physical reservoir computing.

Abstract: Utilizing the intrinsic history-dependence and nonlinearity of hardware,
physical reservoir computing is a promising neuromorphic approach to encode
time-series data for in-sensor computing. The accuracy of this encoding
critically depends on the distinguishability of multi-state outputs, which is
often limited by suboptimal and empirically chosen reservoir operation
conditions. In this work, we demonstrate a machine learning approach, Bayesian
optimization, to improve the encoding fidelity of solution-processed
Al2O3/In2O3 thin-film transistors (TFTs). We show high-fidelity 6-bit temporal
encoding by exploring five key pulse parameters and using the normalized degree
of separation (nDoS) as the metric of output state separability. Additionally,
we show that a model trained on simpler 4-bit data can effectively guide
optimization of more complex 6-bit encoding tasks, reducing experimental cost.
Specifically, for the encoding and reconstruction of binary-patterned images of
a moving car across 6 sequential frames, we demonstrate that the encoding is
more accurate when operating the TFT using optimized pulse parameters and the
4-bit optimized operating condition performs almost as well as the 6-bit
optimized condition. Finally, interpretability analysis via Shapley Additive
Explanations (SHAP) reveals that gate pulse amplitude and drain voltage are the
most influential parameters in achieving higher state separation. This work
presents the first systematic method to identify optimal operating conditions
for reservoir devices, and the approach can be extended to other physical

### [521] [Beyond independent component analysis: identifiability and algorithms](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07525)
*Alvaro Ribot,Anna Seigal,Piotr Zwiernik*

Main category: math.ST

TL;DR: The paper extends classical Independent Component Analysis (ICA) by introducing pairwise mean independence, providing a more relaxed yet identifiable framework for blind source separation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Classical ICA relies on strict independence assumptions for latent variable recovery, which can limit its applicability in scenarios where full independence isn't present.

Method: The paper introduces pairwise mean independence as a relaxed criterion and develops an algebraic recovery algorithm using least-squares optimization over the orthogonal group.

Result: Simulation results demonstrate that enforcing full independence can hinder estimation, while pairwise mean independence ensures robust and stable recovery.

Conclusion: Pairwise mean independence generalizes and extends ICA, offering a rigorous approach for blind source separation beyond the assumption of full independence.

Abstract: Independent Component Analysis (ICA) is a classical method for recovering
latent variables with useful identifiability properties. For independent
variables, cumulant tensors are diagonal; relaxing independence yields tensors
whose zero structure generalizes diagonality. These models have been the
subject of recent work in non-independent component analysis. We show that
pairwise mean independence answers the question of how much one can relax
independence: it is identifiable, any weaker notion is non-identifiable, and it
contains the models previously studied as special cases. Our results apply to
distributions with the required zero pattern at any cumulant tensor. We propose
an algebraic recovery algorithm based on least-squares optimization over the
orthogonal group. Simulations highlight robustness: enforcing full independence
can harm estimation, while pairwise mean independence enables more stable
recovery. These findings extend the classical ICA framework and provide a
rigorous basis for blind source separation beyond independence.

### [522] [Navigating Sparsities in High-Dimensional Linear Contextual Bandits](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08435)
*Rui Zhao,Zihan Chen,Zemin Zheng*

Main category: math.ST

TL;DR: The paper introduces HOPE, a novel algorithm for high-dimensional linear contextual bandit problems, effectively addressing sparsity in both model parameters and eigenvalues, achieving improved regret bounds.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for high-dimensional linear contextual bandit problems lack flexibility in addressing different sparsity types, limiting their applicability.

Method: Developed a pointwise estimator that adapts to multiple sparsity types and incorporated this into a new algorithm called HOPE.

Result: Theoretical analyses show HOPE achieves improved regret bounds in homogeneous settings while efficiently handling heterogeneous sparsity. Experiments show its superiority over current methods.

Conclusion: HOPE offers enhanced flexibility and generality compared to traditional approaches, handling mixed sparsity types effectively and improving performance.

Abstract: High-dimensional linear contextual bandit problems remain a significant
challenge due to the curse of dimensionality. Existing methods typically
consider either the model parameters to be sparse or the eigenvalues of context
covariance matrices to be (approximately) sparse, lacking general applicability
due to the rigidity of conventional reward estimators. To overcome this
limitation, a powerful pointwise estimator is introduced in this work that
adaptively navigates both kinds of sparsity. Based on this pointwise estimator,
a novel algorithm, termed HOPE, is proposed. Theoretical analyses demonstrate
that HOPE not only achieves improved regret bounds in previously discussed
homogeneous settings (i.e., considering only one type of sparsity) but also,
for the first time, efficiently handles two new challenging heterogeneous
settings (i.e., considering a mixture of two types of sparsity), highlighting
its flexibility and generality. Experiments corroborate the superiority of HOPE
over existing methods across various scenarios.

### [523] [Computational and statistical lower bounds for low-rank estimation under general inhomogeneous noise](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08541)
*Debsurya De,Dmitriy Kunisky*

Main category: math.ST

TL;DR: This paper studies computational optimality for detecting and estimating low-rank signals in inhomogeneous noise settings, providing theoretical and numerical evidence supporting the conjectured optimality of spectral algorithms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to explore computational and information-theoretic boundaries of detecting low-rank signal matrices in the generalized setting of inhomogeneous noise, especially when prior assumptions like block structures in variance profiles are relaxed.

Method: The authors analyzed graph sums from the matrix model, introducing new, tighter bounds for non-negative matrices. They compared spectral algorithms with low-degree polynomial algorithms, and conducted numerical experiments on smoothly-varying variance profile settings.

Result: The paper establishes that spectral algorithms are computationally optimal in inhomogeneous noise settings for broader signal distributions. It also extends information-theoretic lower bounds to signal distributions not previously addressed and validates the conjectured hardness for certain computational tasks.

Conclusion: The findings suggest that spectral algorithms might remain optimal for general variance profiles and provide evidence supporting computational hardness conjectures, with techniques and bounds potentially relevant to other fields like free and traffic probability.

Abstract: Recent work has generalized several results concerning the well-understood
spiked Wigner matrix model of a low-rank signal matrix corrupted by additive
i.i.d. Gaussian noise to the inhomogeneous case, where the noise has a variance
profile. In particular, for the special case where the variance profile has a
block structure, a series of results identified an effective spectral algorithm
for detecting and estimating the signal, identified the threshold signal
strength required for that algorithm to succeed, and proved
information-theoretic lower bounds that, for some special signal distributions,
match the above threshold. We complement these results by studying the
computational optimality of this spectral algorithm. Namely, we show that, for
a much broader range of signal distributions, whenever the spectral algorithm
cannot detect a low-rank signal, then neither can any low-degree polynomial
algorithm. This gives the first evidence for a computational hardness
conjecture of Guionnet, Ko, Krzakala, and Zdeborov\'a (2023). With similar
techniques, we also prove sharp information-theoretic lower bounds for a class
of signal distributions not treated by prior work. Unlike all of the above
results on inhomogeneous models, our results do not assume that the variance
profile has a block structure, and suggest that the same spectral algorithm
might remain optimal for quite general profiles. We include a numerical study
of this claim for an example of a smoothly-varying rather than
piecewise-constant profile. Our proofs involve analyzing the graph sums of a
matrix, which also appear in free and traffic probability, but we require new
bounds on these quantities that are tighter than existing ones for non-negative
matrices, which may be of independent interest.

Main category: physics.comp-ph

TL;DR: This paper introduces IdeaSearchFitter, using Large Language Models (LLMs) to improve symbolic regression by balancing accuracy and interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Symbolic regression often suffers from overfitting and generating overly complex models due to the combinatorial complexity of the search space and reliance on syntactic exploration.

Method: IdeaSearchFitter leverages LLMs to act as semantic operators within an evolutionary search, generating natural-language guided candidate expressions for better interpretability and accuracy.

Result: IdeaSearchFitter achieves competitive and noise-robust performance on the FSReD, discovers models aligned with real-world mechanisms, and derives compact parametrizations in high-energy physics data applications.

Conclusion: IdeaSearchFitter demonstrates its ability to mitigate overfitting, balance complexity with accuracy, and improve interpretability in symbolic regression tasks across various domains. The framework is publicly accessible for broader use.

Abstract: Symbolic regression (SR), the automated discovery of mathematical expressions
from data, is a cornerstone of scientific inquiry. However, it is often
hindered by the combinatorial explosion of the search space and a tendency to
overfit. Popular methods, rooted in genetic programming, explore this space
syntactically, often yielding overly complex, uninterpretable models. This
paper introduces IdeaSearchFitter, a framework that employs Large Language
Models (LLMs) as semantic operators within an evolutionary search. By
generating candidate expressions guided by natural-language rationales, our
method biases discovery towards models that are not only accurate but also
conceptually coherent and interpretable. We demonstrate IdeaSearchFitter's
efficacy across diverse challenges: it achieves competitive, noise-robust
performance on the Feynman Symbolic Regression Database (FSReD), outperforming
several strong baselines; discovers mechanistically aligned models with good
accuracy-complexity trade-offs on real-world data; and derives compact,
physically-motivated parametrizations for Parton Distribution Functions in a
frontier high-energy physics application. IdeaSearchFitter is a specialized
module within our broader iterated agent framework, IdeaSearch, which is

### [525] [Decentralised Blockchain Management Through Digital Twins](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07901)
*Georgios Diamantopoulos,Nikos Tziritas,Rami Bahsoon,Georgios Theodoropoulos*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper introduces a dynamic and decentralized mechanism for blockchain governance using digital twins and a secondary blockchain system to balance control and decentralization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current blockchain systems face challenges in maintaining decentralization while enabling effective governance and dynamic management, leading to a control-decentralization trade-off.

Method: The authors propose employing digital twins controlled by stakeholders and organize them within a secondary blockchain to orchestrate decentralized decision-making and manage the primary blockchain.

Result: Simulations show the mechanism's effectiveness in achieving consensus rapidly and reconfiguring the primary blockchain with minimal operational overhead.

Conclusion: The mechanism demonstrates that digital twins and secondary blockchain systems can enable decentralized, efficient blockchain governance and management without sacrificing decentralization.

Abstract: The necessity of blockchain systems to remain decentralised limits current
solutions to blockchain governance and dynamic management, forcing a trade-off
between control and decentralisation. In light of the above, this work proposes
a dynamic and decentralised blockchain management mechanism based on digital
twins. To ensure decentralisation, the proposed mechanism utilises multiple
digital twins that the system's stakeholders control. To facilitate
decentralised decision-making, the twins are organised in a secondary
blockchain system that orchestrates agreement on, and propagation of decisions
to the managed blockchain. This enables the management of blockchain systems
without centralised control. A preliminary evaluation of the performance and
impact of the overheads introduced by the proposed mechanism is conducted
through simulation. The results demonstrate the proposed mechanism's ability to
reach consensus on decisions quickly and reconfigure the primary blockchain
with minimal overhead.

### [526] [PATCH: Mitigating PII Leakage in Language Models with Privacy-Aware Targeted Circuit PatcHing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07452)
*Anthony Hughes,Vasisht Duddu,N. Asokan,Nikolaos Aletras,Ning Ma*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper introduces PATCH, a technique to combat PII leakage in language models by targeting and editing specific computational circuits, achieving better privacy-utility trade-offs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address PII leakage in language models, which persists despite traditional defenses like differential privacy, often at the cost of significant utility loss.

Method: A new method, PATCH, which identifies and edits PII leakage circuits in language models, aimed at reducing personal data leakage efficiently while maintaining model performance.

Result: PATCH reduces PII recall from models by up to 65%, and when paired with differential privacy, reduces residual leakage to as low as 0.01%, outperforming existing approaches.

Conclusion: PII leakage circuits are resilient to traditional defenses, but PATCH effectively mitigates their impact, achieving a superior privacy-utility balance.

Abstract: Language models (LMs) may memorize personally identifiable information (PII)
from training data, enabling adversaries to extract it during inference.
Existing defense mechanisms such as differential privacy (DP) reduce this
leakage, but incur large drops in utility. Based on a comprehensive study using
circuit discovery to identify the computational circuits responsible PII
leakage in LMs, we hypothesize that specific PII leakage circuits in LMs should
be responsible for this behavior. Therefore, we propose PATCH (Privacy-Aware
Targeted Circuit PatcHing), a novel approach that first identifies and
subsequently directly edits PII circuits to reduce leakage. PATCH achieves
better privacy-utility trade-off than existing defenses, e.g., reducing recall
of PII leakage from LMs by up to 65%. Finally, PATCH can be combined with DP to
reduce recall of residual leakage of an LM to as low as 0.01%. Our analysis
shows that PII leakage circuits persist even after the application of existing
defense mechanisms. In contrast, PATCH can effectively mitigate their impact.

TL;DR: This paper examines reasoning-based backdoor attacks in large language models (LLMs), introducing a taxonomy and discussing defenses.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address the security risks introduced by the advanced reasoning capabilities of LLMs, which adversaries can exploit to perform backdoor attacks.

Method: The authors analyze mechanisms, frameworks, and challenges of reasoning-based backdoor attacks. They propose a taxonomy classifying these attacks and discuss possible defense strategies.

Result: A taxonomy categorizing reasoning-based backdoor attacks into associative, passive, and active was introduced alongside an overview of existing and potential defense strategies.

Conclusion: The work provides a foundation for understanding and addressing reasoning-based backdoor attacks in LLMs, advancing research towards secure and trustworthy LLM usage.

Abstract: With the rise of advanced reasoning capabilities, large language models
(LLMs) are receiving increasing attention. However, although reasoning improves
LLMs' performance on downstream tasks, it also introduces new security risks,
as adversaries can exploit these capabilities to conduct backdoor attacks.
Existing surveys on backdoor attacks and reasoning security offer comprehensive
overviews but lack in-depth analysis of backdoor attacks and defenses targeting
LLMs' reasoning abilities. In this paper, we take the first step toward
providing a comprehensive review of reasoning-based backdoor attacks in LLMs by
analyzing their underlying mechanisms, methodological frameworks, and
unresolved challenges. Specifically, we introduce a new taxonomy that offers a
unified perspective for summarizing existing approaches, categorizing
reasoning-based backdoor attacks into associative, passive, and active. We also
present defense strategies against such attacks and discuss current challenges
alongside potential directions for future research. This work offers a novel
perspective, paving the way for further exploration of secure and trustworthy
LLM communities.

### [528] [Effective and Stealthy One-Shot Jailbreaks on Deployed Mobile Vision-Language Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07809)
*Renhua Ding,Xiao Yang,Zhengwei Fang,Jun Luo,Kun He,Jun Zhu*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This paper presents a stealthy one-shot jailbreak attack against large vision-language models (LVLMs) on smartphones by exploiting in-app prompt injections to manipulate UI behavior during agent operation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address overlooked vulnerabilities of LVLM-driven mobile agents to UI-level attacks and demonstrate practical techniques for exploiting these flaws.

Method: The paper introduces a three-part framework: (1) low-privilege perception-chain targeting to inject prompts via visual inputs, (2) stealthy user-invisible activation triggered by touch detection, and (3) a heuristic algorithm (HG-IDA*) for prompt injection and evasion of safety filters.

Result: The proposed attack achieved high hijack rates, including 82.5% planning and 75.0% execution success, across multiple LVLM backends and Android applications in single-shot tests.

Conclusion: Current mobile agents driven by LVLMs face intrinsic security vulnerabilities, specifically from prompt injection attacks, requiring immediate attention to strengthen autonomous smartphone operation security.

Abstract: Large vision-language models (LVLMs) enable autonomous mobile agents to
operate smartphone user interfaces, yet vulnerabilities to UI-level attacks
remain critically understudied. Existing research often depends on conspicuous
UI overlays, elevated permissions, or impractical threat models, limiting
stealth and real-world applicability. In this paper, we present a practical and
stealthy one-shot jailbreak attack that leverages in-app prompt injections:
malicious applications embed short prompts in UI text that remain inert during
human interaction but are revealed when an agent drives the UI via ADB (Android
Debug Bridge). Our framework comprises three crucial components: (1)
low-privilege perception-chain targeting, which injects payloads into malicious
apps as the agent's visual inputs; (2) stealthy user-invisible activation, a
touch-based trigger that discriminates agent from human touches using physical
touch attributes and exposes the payload only during agent operation; and (3)
one-shot prompt efficacy, a heuristic-guided, character-level
iterative-deepening search algorithm (HG-IDA*) that performs one-shot,
keyword-level detoxification to evade on-device safety filters. We evaluate
across multiple LVLM backends, including closed-source services and
representative open-source models within three Android applications, and we
observe high planning and execution hijack rates in single-shot scenarios
(e.g., GPT-4o: 82.5% planning / 75.0% execution). These findings expose a
fundamental security vulnerability in current mobile agents with immediate
implications for autonomous smartphone operation.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This paper compares Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) and Garbled Circuits (GC) for secure neural network inference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Increasing concerns over data privacy and model confidentiality necessitate advancements in Privacy-Preserving Machine Learning (PPML).

Method: The study implements a two-layer neural network using the CKKS scheme for FHE and TinyGarble2.0 framework for GC, evaluated under a semi-honest threat model based on various metrics.

Result: GC showcased faster execution and lower memory usage, while FHE enabled non-interactive inference.

Conclusion: A trade-off exists between modular GC’s speed and efficiency and FHE’s non-interactive inference capability.

Abstract: Machine Learning (ML) is making its way into fields such as healthcare,
finance, and Natural Language Processing (NLP), and concerns over data privacy
and model confidentiality continue to grow. Privacy-preserving Machine Learning
(PPML) addresses this challenge by enabling inference on private data without
revealing sensitive inputs or proprietary models. Leveraging Secure Computation
techniques from Cryptography, two widely studied approaches in this domain are
Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) and Garbled Circuits (GC). This work
presents a comparative evaluation of FHE and GC for secure neural network
inference. A two-layer neural network (NN) was implemented using the CKKS
scheme from the Microsoft SEAL library (FHE) and the TinyGarble2.0 framework
(GC) by IntelLabs. Both implementations are evaluated under the semi-honest
threat model, measuring inference output error, round-trip time, peak memory
usage, communication overhead, and communication rounds. Results reveal a
trade-off: modular GC offers faster execution and lower memory consumption,
while FHE supports non-interactive inference.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper evaluates machine learning models, specifically xLSTM and transformer encoder, for intrusion detection in ADS-B air traffic systems. xLSTM outperforms transformer methods in detection accuracy but introduces higher latency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: This paper aims to address the security vulnerabilities in ADS-B, a critical protocol in air traffic management, by improving machine learning-based intrusion detection systems.

Method: Two deep learning models, xLSTM and transformer encoder, were tested using a transfer learning strategy. Pre-training was done on benign ADS-B data, followed by fine-tuning with labeled data involving tampered messages.

Result: The xLSTM-based IDS surpassed the transformer model in accuracy (F1-score: 98.9% vs. 94.3%). While xLSTM had higher latency (7.26s vs. 2.1s for transformer), it remained within acceptable limits for ATM systems.

Conclusion: xLSTM-based IDS offers superior detection accuracy compared to transformer models, though it introduces higher inference latency. Its generalization ability and detection performance make it suitable for securing ADS-B systems despite latency constraints.

Abstract: With the growing reliance on the vulnerable Automatic Dependent
Surveillance-Broadcast (ADS-B) protocol in air traffic management (ATM),
ensuring security is critical. This study investigates emerging machine
learning models and training strategies to improve AI-based intrusion detection
systems (IDS) for ADS-B. Focusing on ground-based ATM systems, we evaluate two
deep learning IDS implementations: one using a transformer encoder and the
other an extended Long Short-Term Memory (xLSTM) network, marking the first
xLSTM-based IDS for ADS-B. A transfer learning strategy was employed, involving
pre-training on benign ADS-B messages and fine-tuning with labeled data
containing instances of tampered messages. Results show this approach
outperforms existing methods, particularly in identifying subtle attacks that
progressively undermine situational awareness. The xLSTM-based IDS achieves an
F1-score of 98.9%, surpassing the transformer-based model at 94.3%. Tests on
unseen attacks validated the generalization ability of the xLSTM model.
Inference latency analysis shows that the 7.26-second delay introduced by the
xLSTM-based IDS fits within the Secondary Surveillance Radar (SSR) refresh
interval (5-12 s), although it may be restrictive for time-critical operations.
While the transformer-based IDS achieves a 2.1-second latency, it does so at
the cost of lower detection performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The integration of UAVs and MR headsets aims to provide more intuitive and immersive control systems with enhanced situational awareness.

Method: The system introduces three key design elements: a 3D terrain map interface, a virtual ball control metaphor, and a spatial overlay for UAV tracking. A user study was conducted to qualitatively and quantitatively evaluate the design.

Result: The study found the 3D map interface intuitive, improving control accuracy and reducing workload. The virtual ball interface was intuitive but lacked physical feedback, while the spatial overlay enhanced situational awareness.

Conclusion: IGUANA demonstrates that MR-based interfaces can improve UAV usability, making control systems more intuitive and situationally aware through innovative design elements.

Abstract: As the markets for unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and mixed reality (MR)
headsets continue to grow, recent research has increasingly explored their
integration, which enables more intuitive, immersive, and situationally aware
control systems. We present IGUANA, an MR-based immersive guidance, navigation,
and control system for consumer UAVs. IGUANA introduces three key elements
beyond conventional control interfaces: (1) a 3D terrain map interface with
draggable waypoint markers and live camera preview for high-level control, (2)
a novel spatial control metaphor that uses a virtual ball as a physical analogy
for low-level control, and (3) a spatial overlay that helps track the UAV when
it is not visible with the naked eye or visual line of sight is interrupted. We
conducted a user study to evaluate our design, both quantitatively and
qualitatively, and found that (1) the 3D map interface is intuitive and easy to
use, relieving users from manual control and suggesting improved accuracy and
consistency with lower perceived workload relative to conventional dual-stick
controller, (2) the virtual ball interface is intuitive but limited by the lack
of physical feedback, and (3) the spatial overlay is very useful in enhancing
the users' situational awareness.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To advance the design of effective conversational interfaces for SAVs, addressing the need for better human-SAV interactions.

Method: The study involves creating an open-source dataset of human-SAV interactions, followed by two benchmark case studies: one using random forest and chord diagrams to identify predictors of SAV acceptance; and another comparing an LLM-based sentiment analysis tool with the TextBlob method.

Result: Results show that sentiment polarity is a key predictor of SAV acceptance, and zero-shot LLM prompts perform better in sentiment analysis compared to TextBlob, despite some limitations.

Conclusion: The dataset and findings offer a foundation for improving conversational interfaces for SAVs, highlighting the importance of sentiment modeling and adaptive interactions.

Abstract: Shared Autonomous Vehicles (SAVs) are likely to become an important part of
the transportation system, making effective human-SAV interactions an important
area of research. This paper introduces a dataset of 200 human-SAV interactions
to further this area of study. We present an open-source human-SAV
conversational dataset, comprising both textual data (e.g., 2,136 human-SAV
exchanges) and empirical data (e.g., post-interaction survey results on a range
of psychological factors). The dataset's utility is demonstrated through two
benchmark case studies: First, using random forest modeling and chord diagrams,
we identify key predictors of SAV acceptance and perceived service quality,
highlighting the critical influence of response sentiment polarity (i.e.,
perceived positivity). Second, we benchmark the performance of an LLM-based
sentiment analysis tool against the traditional lexicon-based TextBlob method.
Results indicate that even simple zero-shot LLM prompts more closely align with
user-reported sentiment, though limitations remain. This study provides novel
insights for designing conversational SAV interfaces and establishes a
foundation for further exploration into advanced sentiment modeling, adaptive
user interactions, and multimodal conversational systems.

*Emilio Estevan,María Sierra-Torralba,Eduardo López-Larraz,Luis Montesano*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: This paper explores self-supervised learning (SSL) methods to enhance sleep staging accuracy using wearable EEG devices, especially in scenarios with scarce labeled data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to tackle the challenge of label scarcity in analyzing massive volumes of unlabeled wearable EEG data for sleep staging.

Method: The researchers systematically evaluate well-established SSL methods on two EEG databases using three key evaluation scenarios: label efficiency, representation quality, and cross-dataset generalization.

Result: SSL consistently outperformed supervised approaches by up to 10% in classification performance, achieving clinical-grade accuracy with only 5-10% labeled data and showing robustness across diverse datasets.

Conclusion: SSL is a promising solution for label-efficient and scalable sleep monitoring systems using wearable EEG, reducing reliance on manual annotations and enhancing affordability.

Abstract: Wearable EEG devices have emerged as a promising alternative to
polysomnography (PSG). As affordable and scalable solutions, their widespread
adoption results in the collection of massive volumes of unlabeled data that
cannot be analyzed by clinicians at scale. Meanwhile, the recent success of
deep learning for sleep scoring has relied on large annotated datasets.
Self-supervised learning (SSL) offers an opportunity to bridge this gap,
leveraging unlabeled signals to address label scarcity and reduce annotation
effort. In this paper, we present the first systematic evaluation of SSL for
sleep staging using wearable EEG. We investigate a range of well-established
SSL methods and evaluate them on two sleep databases acquired with the Ikon
Sleep wearable EEG headband: BOAS, a high-quality benchmark containing PSG and
wearable EEG recordings with consensus labels, and HOGAR, a large collection of
home-based, self-recorded, and unlabeled recordings. Three evaluation scenarios
are defined to study label efficiency, representation quality, and
cross-dataset generalization. Results show that SSL consistently improves
classification performance by up to 10% over supervised baselines, with gains
particularly evident when labeled data is scarce. SSL achieves clinical-grade
accuracy above 80% leveraging only 5% to 10% of labeled data, while the
supervised approach requires twice the labels. Additionally, SSL
representations prove robust to variations in population characteristics,
recording environments, and signal quality. Our findings demonstrate the
potential of SSL to enable label-efficient sleep staging with wearable EEG,
reducing reliance on manual annotations and advancing the development of
affordable sleep monitoring systems.

### [536] [Development of Mental Models in Human-AI Collaboration: A Conceptual Framework](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08104)
*Joshua Holstein,Gerhard Satzger*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: This paper explores the evolution of human decision-makers' mental models in human-AI collaboration, introducing an integrated socio-technical framework to conceptualize and guide this evolution.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the gap in understanding how continuous interaction with AI systems shapes human decision-makers' mental models.

Method: The authors conceptualized three distinct mental models and designed an integrated socio-technical framework identifying mechanisms like data contextualization, reasoning transparency, and performance feedback.

Result: Three key contributions were provided: identification of three mental models (domain, information processing, complementarity-awareness), acknowledgment of their dynamic nature, and mechanisms guiding purposeful collaboration design.

Conclusion: The study advances human-AI collaboration literature by emphasizing the dynamic evolution of mental models and providing mechanisms for optimized collaboration.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence has become integral to organizational decision-making
and while research has explored many facets of this human-AI collaboration, the
focus has mainly been on designing the AI agent(s) and the way the
collaboration is set up - generally assuming a human decision-maker to be
"fixed". However, it has largely been neglected that decision-makers' mental
models evolve through their continuous interaction with AI systems. This paper
addresses this gap by conceptualizing how the design of human-AI collaboration
influences the development of three complementary and interdependent mental
models necessary for this collaboration. We develop an integrated
socio-technical framework that identifies the mechanisms driving the mental
model evolution: data contextualization, reasoning transparency, and
performance feedback. Our work advances human-AI collaboration literature
through three key contributions: introducing three distinct mental models
(domain, information processing, complementarity-awareness); recognizing the
dynamic nature of mental models; and establishing mechanisms that guide the
purposeful design of effective human-AI collaboration.

### [537] [Attribution-by-design: Ensuring Inference-Time Provenance in Generative Music Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08062)
*Fabio Morreale,Wiebke Hutiri,Joan Serrà,Alice Xiang,Yuki Mitsufuji*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: The paper addresses challenges in compensating artists in the AI-generated music era and proposes a framework with direct attribution and royalty transparency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The dilution of royalty pools and structural flaws in artist compensation systems due to AI-generated music present critical challenges for the music industry.

Method: A framework is proposed with an ontological distinction between training and inference sets, emphasizing inference-time attribution for direct and transparent compensation.

Result: Artists and rights holders gain granular control over their work, while users benefit from detailed attribution and permitted usage information.

Conclusion: The approach ensures ethical and practical solutions for fair artist compensation and integrates fairness and provenance into generative music systems.

Abstract: The rise of AI-generated music is diluting royalty pools and revealing
structural flaws in existing remuneration frameworks, challenging the
well-established artist compensation systems in the music industry. Existing
compensation solutions, such as piecemeal licensing agreements, lack
scalability and technical rigour, while current data attribution mechanisms
provide only uncertain estimates and are rarely implemented in practice. This
paper introduces a framework for a generative music infrastructure centred on
direct attribution, transparent royalty distribution, and granular control for
artists and rights' holders. We distinguish ontologically between the training
set and the inference set, which allows us to propose two complementary forms
of attribution: training-time attribution and inference-time attribution. We
here favour inference-time attribution, as it enables direct, verifiable
compensation whenever an artist's catalogue is used to condition a generated
output. Besides, users benefit from the ability to condition generations on
specific songs and receive transparent information about attribution and
permitted usage. Our approach offers an ethical and practical solution to the
pressing need for robust compensation mechanisms in the era of AI-generated
music, ensuring that provenance and fairness are embedded at the core of
generative systems.

### [538] [Detecting and Mitigating Insertion Hallucination in Video-to-Audio Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08078)
*Liyang Chen,Hongkai Chen,Yujun Cai,Sifan Li,Qingwen Ye,Yiwei Wang*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: This paper identifies and addresses the problem of 'Insertion Hallucination' in Video-to-Audio (V2A) generation, where non-existent sounds are added. It introduces new evaluation metrics and the Posterior Feature Correction (PFC) method to mitigate this issue.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Video-to-Audio generation models often suffer from a critical flaw where they generate sounds, such as speech or music, that have no visual source due to dataset biases. Current evaluation metrics completely overlook this issue, motivating the need for better detection and mitigation methods.

Method: The authors developed a systematic evaluation framework using an ensemble of audio event detectors and proposed two novel metrics (IH@vid and IH@dur) to measure hallucination issues. They also introduced Posterior Feature Correction (PFC), a training-free, inference-time method that detects and removes hallucinated audio segments through a two-step process.

Result: Experiments demonstrated that state-of-the-art V2A models exhibit severe issues with Insertion Hallucination. The proposed PFC method reduced hallucination prevalence and duration by over 50% on average while maintaining or even improving existing audio quality and synchronization metrics.

Conclusion: The paper formally defines the problem of Insertion Hallucination in V2A models, provides tools to measure it, and presents an effective solution in the form of PFC. This work advances the reliability and faithfulness of V2A generation methods.

Abstract: Video-to-Audio generation has made remarkable strides in automatically
synthesizing sound for video. However, existing evaluation metrics, which focus
on semantic and temporal alignment, overlook a critical failure mode: models
often generate acoustic events, particularly speech and music, that have no
corresponding visual source. We term this phenomenon Insertion Hallucination
and identify it as a systemic risk driven by dataset biases, such as the
prevalence of off-screen sounds, that remains completely undetected by current
metrics. To address this challenge, we first develop a systematic evaluation
framework that employs a majority-voting ensemble of multiple audio event
detectors. We also introduce two novel metrics to quantify the prevalence and
severity of this issue: IH@vid (the fraction of videos with hallucinations) and
IH@dur (the fraction of hallucinated duration). Building on this, we propose
Posterior Feature Correction, a novel training-free inference-time method that
mitigates IH. PFC operates in a two-pass process: it first generates an initial
audio output to detect hallucinated segments, and then regenerates the audio
after masking the corresponding video features at those timestamps. Experiments
on several mainstream V2A benchmarks first reveal that state-of-the-art models
suffer from severe IH. In contrast, our PFC method reduces both the prevalence
and duration of hallucinations by over 50\% on average, without degrading, and
in some cases even improving, conventional metrics for audio quality and
temporal synchronization. Our work is the first to formally define,
systematically measure, and effectively mitigate Insertion Hallucination,
paving the way for more reliable and faithful V2A models.

*Eleonora Mancini,Joan Serrà,Paolo Torroni,Yuki Mitsufuji*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: This paper proposes WEALY, a reproducible method using Whisper decoder embeddings for audio-based lyrics matching, achieving competitive performance with state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address reproducibility challenges and inconsistent baselines in audio-based lyrics matching methods.

Method: Introduction of WEALY, leveraging Whisper decoder embeddings and exploring multimodal extensions combining textual and acoustic features.

Result: WEALY achieves performance on par with state-of-the-art methods and includes detailed studies on language robustness, loss functions, and embedding strategies.

Conclusion: WEALY establishes a reliable benchmark for future research and highlights the potential of speech technologies in music information retrieval tasks.

Abstract: Audio-based lyrics matching can be an appealing alternative to other
content-based retrieval approaches, but existing methods often suffer from
limited reproducibility and inconsistent baselines. In this work, we introduce
WEALY, a fully reproducible pipeline that leverages Whisper decoder embeddings
for lyrics matching tasks. WEALY establishes robust and transparent baselines,
while also exploring multimodal extensions that integrate textual and acoustic
features. Through extensive experiments on standard datasets, we demonstrate
that WEALY achieves a performance comparable to state-of-the-art methods that
lack reproducibility. In addition, we provide ablation studies and analyses on
language robustness, loss functions, and embedding strategies. This work
contributes a reliable benchmark for future research, and underscores the
potential of speech technologies for music information retrieval tasks.
