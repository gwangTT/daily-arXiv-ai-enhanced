This is known as the sleeping model (Chatterjee, Gmyr, Pandurangan PODC\n2020) and defines the awake complexity (also called \\emph{energy complexity}),\nwhich measures the maximum number of rounds that any node is awake throughout\nthe execution. Only awake nodes can send and receive messages in a given round\nand all messages sent to sleeping nodes are lost. We present new deterministic\nconsensus algorithms that tolerate up to $f<n$ crash failures, where $n$ is the\nnumber of nodes. Our algorithms match the optimal time complexity lower bound\nof $f+1$ rounds. For multi-value consensus, where the input values are chosen\nfrom some possibly large set, we achieve an energy complexity of ${O}(\\lceil\nf^2 / n \\rceil)$ rounds, whereas for binary consensus, we show that ${O}(\\lceil\nf / \\sqrt{n} \\rceil)$ rounds are possible.", "AI": {"tldr": "The paper presents deterministic consensus algorithms in a synchronous sleeping model, achieving optimal time and efficient energy complexity for crash-tolerant consensus.", "motivation": "To optimize energy (awake complexity) and time complexity in fault-tolerant consensus within the sleeping synchronous message-passing model.", "method": "The study proposes deterministic algorithms for consensus, addressing crash-failure tolerance and optimizing energy-aware protocol design.", "result": "Optimal time of $f+1$ rounds achieved; Multi-value consensus has an energy complexity of $O(\\lceil f^2 / n \\rceil)$, and binary consensus achieves $O(\\lceil f / \\sqrt{n} \\rceil)$ energy complexity.", "conclusion": "The algorithms presented provide both time-optimal performance and substantial energy savings in crash-tolerant consensus scenarios within the sleeping model."}}

To avoid\ncode-intrusion complexity and minimize cache space wastage, it is desirable to\nmaintain a unified cache shared by all the workloads. However, existing cache\nmanagement strategies, designed for specific workloads, struggle to handle the\nheterogeneous AI workloads in a cluster -- which usually exhibit heterogeneous\naccess patterns and item storage granularities. In this paper, we propose\nIGTCache, a unified, high-efficacy cache for modern AI clusters. IGTCache\nleverages a hierarchical access abstraction, AccessStreamTree, to organize the\nrecent data accesses in a tree structure, facilitating access pattern detection\nat various granularities. Using this abstraction, IGTCache applies hypothesis\ntesting to categorize data access patterns as sequential, random, or skewed.\nBased on these detected access patterns and granularities, IGTCache tailors\noptimal cache management strategies including prefetching, eviction, and space\nallocation accordingly.
