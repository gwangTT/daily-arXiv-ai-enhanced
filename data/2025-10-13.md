### [1] [Hypothesis Hunting with Evolving Networks of Autonomous Scientific Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08619)
*Tennison Liu,Silas Ruhrberg Est√©vez,David L. Bentley,Mihaela van der Schaar*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces AScience and ASCollab as frameworks for distributed LLM-based research agents to facilitate exploratory discovery in large-scale scientific datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enable exploratory discovery in diverse and complex scientific datasets without being constrained by specific research questions.

Method: Developed AScience (conceptual framework of agents, networks, and norms) and implemented it as ASCollab (a system of heterogeneous LLM-based agents), allowing agents to self-organize, evaluate, and peer-review findings.

Result: Experiments verified that such systems enable discovery along diversity-quality-novelty dimensions, rediscover biomarkers, extend pathways, and propose new therapeutic targets.

Conclusion: Agentic networks with social self-organization can sustain large-scale hypothesis hunting, offering potential value for scientific discovery.

Abstract: Large-scale scientific datasets -- spanning health biobanks, cell atlases,
Earth reanalyses, and more -- create opportunities for exploratory discovery
unconstrained by specific research questions. We term this process hypothesis
hunting: the cumulative search for insight through sustained exploration across
vast and complex hypothesis spaces. To support it, we introduce AScience, a
framework modeling discovery as the interaction of agents, networks, and
evaluation norms, and implement it as ASCollab, a distributed system of
LLM-based research agents with heterogeneous behaviors. These agents
self-organize into evolving networks, continually producing and peer-reviewing
findings under shared standards of evaluation. Experiments show that such
social dynamics enable the accumulation of expert-rated results along the
diversity-quality-novelty frontier, including rediscoveries of established
biomarkers, extensions of known pathways, and proposals of new therapeutic
targets. While wet-lab validation remains indispensable, our experiments on
cancer cohorts demonstrate that socially structured, agentic networks can
sustain exploratory hypothesis hunting at scale.

### [2] [Optimizing delivery for quick commerce factoring qualitative assessment of generated routes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08671)
*Milon Bhattacharya,Milan Kumar*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper explores using large language models (LLMs) to enhance vehicle routing problem (VRP) solvers for last-mile delivery in India's e-commerce market, with results showing high accuracy in identifying routing issues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses inefficiencies in real-world delivery planning caused by unstructured addresses, incomplete maps, and computational constraints, which limit the effectiveness of VRP-based solvers.

Method: The study employs LLMs to critique VRP-generated routes against policy-based criteria, and evaluates this approach using 400 annotated cases.

Result: Open-source LLMs identified routing issues with 79% accuracy, while proprietary reasoning models reached up to 86%, demonstrating the effectiveness of LLM-based evaluations.

Conclusion: LLM-driven evaluation of VRP-generated routes offers a scalable way to improve cost efficiency, reliability, and sustainability in logistics, especially benefiting developing regions like India.

Abstract: Indias e-commerce market is projected to grow rapidly, with last-mile
delivery accounting for nearly half of operational expenses. Although vehicle
routing problem (VRP) based solvers are widely used for delivery planning,
their effectiveness in real-world scenarios is limited due to unstructured
addresses, incomplete maps, and computational constraints in distance
estimation. This study proposes a framework that employs large language models
(LLMs) to critique VRP-generated routes against policy-based criteria, allowing
logistics operators to evaluate and prioritise more efficient delivery plans.
As a illustration of our approach we generate, annotate and evaluated 400 cases
using large language models. Our study found that open-source LLMs identified
routing issues with 79% accuracy, while proprietary reasoning models achieved
reach upto 86%. The results demonstrate that LLM-based evaluation of
VRP-generated routes can be an effective and scalable layer of evaluation which
goes beyond beyond conventional distance and time based metrics. This has
implications for improving cost efficiency, delivery reliability, and
sustainability in last-mile logistics, especially for developing countries like
India.

### [3] [Unified World Models: Memory-Augmented Planning and Foresight for Visual Navigation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08713)
*Yifei Dong,Fengyi Wu,Guangyu Chen,Zhi-Qi Cheng,Qiyu Hu,Yuxuan Zhou,Jingdong Sun,Jun-Yan He,Qi Dai,Alexander G Hauptmann*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: UniWM is a unified approach to improve embodied visual navigation, using memory-augmented world modeling that tightly integrates foresight with action decisions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current systems for visual navigation face limitations due to modularity in planning and world modeling, causing adaptability issues in novel or dynamic scenarios.

Method: UniWM utilizes a multimodal autoregressive backbone integrating visual foresight and planning while employing a hierarchical memory mechanism to combine detailed perceptual data and context across extended horizons.

Result: Experiments demonstrate UniWM outperformed baselines, improving navigation success rates by up to 30%, reducing trajectory errors, and achieving strong zero-shot generalization on unseen datasets.

Conclusion: UniWM provides a unified, imagination-driven framework that aligns prediction with control, addressing key challenges in embodied visual navigation and boosting performance across benchmarks.

Abstract: Enabling embodied agents to effectively imagine future states is critical for
robust and generalizable visual navigation. Current state-of-the-art
approaches, however, adopt modular architectures that separate navigation
planning from visual world modeling, leading to state-action misalignment and
limited adaptability in novel or dynamic scenarios. To overcome this
fundamental limitation, we propose UniWM, a unified, memory-augmented world
model integrating egocentric visual foresight and planning within a single
multimodal autoregressive backbone. Unlike modular frameworks, UniWM explicitly
grounds action decisions in visually imagined outcomes, ensuring tight
alignment between prediction and control. A hierarchical memory mechanism
further integrates detailed short-term perceptual cues with longer-term
trajectory context, enabling stable, coherent reasoning over extended horizons.
Extensive experiments across four challenging benchmarks (Go Stanford, ReCon,
SCAND, HuRoN) demonstrate that UniWM substantially improves navigation success
rates by up to 30%, significantly reduces trajectory errors compared to strong
baselines, and exhibits impressive zero-shot generalization on the unseen
TartanDrive dataset. These results highlight UniWM as a principled step toward
unified, imagination-driven embodied navigation.

### [4] [Robust Heuristic Algorithm Design with LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08755)
*Pantea Karimi,Dany Rouhana,Pooria Namyar,Siva Kesava Reddy Kakarla,Venkat Arun,Behnaz Arzani*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper proposes using LLMs with explanation and specialization tools to create more robust and better-performing heuristics, achieving a ~28x improvement in worst-case performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the underperformance of heuristics by enhancing their design through explanations and targeted improvements.

Method: The approach involves exposing LLMs to underperforming instances, explaining the failures, and specializing heuristic design to specific input regions.

Result: Generated heuristics exhibit a ~28x better worst-case performance, improved average performance, and similar runtime compared to existing techniques like FunSearch.

Conclusion: Augmenting LLM-driven heuristic generation with diagnostic and specialization strategies can significantly enhance algorithm robustness and effectiveness.

Abstract: We posit that we can generate more robust and performant heuristics if we
augment approaches using LLMs for heuristic design with tools that explain why
heuristics underperform and suggestions about how to fix them. We find even
simple ideas that (1) expose the LLM to instances where the heuristic
underperforms; (2) explain why they occur; and (3) specialize design to regions
in the input space, can produce more robust algorithms compared to existing
techniques~ -- ~the heuristics we produce have a $\sim28\times$ better
worst-case performance compared to FunSearch, improve average performance, and
maintain the runtime.

### [5] [COMPASS: Enhancing Agent Long-Horizon Reasoning with Evolving Context](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08790)
*Guangya Wan,Mingyang Ling,Xiaoqi Ren,Rujun Han,Sheng Li,Zizhao Zhang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Long-horizon reasoning tasks often suffer from compounded errors due to poor context handling. COMPASS proposes a hierarchical multi-agent framework to improve accuracy and coherence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Long-horizon reasoning tasks challenge LLM agents due to compounded errors and context management limitations, leading to issues like distraction and hallucination.

Method: COMPASS introduces a three-component system: (1) a Main Agent for reasoning and tools, (2) a Meta-Thinker for monitoring and strategic intervention, (3) a Context Manager maintaining concise progress briefs.

Result: COMPASS boosts accuracy by up to 20% on benchmarks like GAIA, BrowseComp, and Humanity's Last Exam, with added test-time scaling and post-training context efficiency.

Conclusion: COMPASS addresses context management bottlenecks, improving coherence, accuracy, and scalability in long-horizon tasks.

Abstract: Long-horizon tasks that require sustained reasoning and multiple tool
interactions remain challenging for LLM agents: small errors compound across
steps, and even state-of-the-art models often hallucinate or lose coherence. We
identify context management as the central bottleneck -- extended histories
cause agents to overlook critical evidence or become distracted by irrelevant
information, thus failing to replan or reflect from previous mistakes. To
address this, we propose COMPASS (Context-Organized Multi-Agent Planning and
Strategy System), a lightweight hierarchical framework that separates tactical
execution, strategic oversight, and context organization into three specialized
components: (1) a Main Agent that performs reasoning and tool use, (2) a
Meta-Thinker that monitors progress and issues strategic interventions, and (3)
a Context Manager that maintains concise, relevant progress briefs for
different reasoning stages. Across three challenging benchmarks -- GAIA,
BrowseComp, and Humanity's Last Exam -- COMPASS improves accuracy by up to 20%
relative to both single- and multi-agent baselines. We further introduce a
test-time scaling extension that elevates performance to match established
DeepResearch agents, and a post-training pipeline that delegates context
management to smaller models for enhanced efficiency.

### [6] [Everyone prefers human writers, including AI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08831)
*Wouter Haverals,Meredith Martin*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper examines how humans and AI models evaluate literary style, revealing that both have a systematic bias favoring human-generated content over AI-generated content, with AI models showing stronger bias.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the subjective evaluation of literary style by both humans and AI, especially focusing on attribution bias and its implications for creative judgment in an era increasingly influenced by AI tools.

Method: The study involved two controlled experiments using literary passages from Queneau's "Exercises in Style" evaluated by human participants and AI models under various labeling conditions, along with a broader bias generalization test between 14 AI evaluators and creators.

Result: Humans exhibited a +13.7 percentage point pro-human bias, while AI models showed an even stronger +34.3 percentage point bias, demonstrating that AI systems consistently undervalue content labeled as AI-generated, independent of the creating AI.

Conclusion: AI systems not only replicate human biases against artificial creativity but also amplify them, suggesting that cultural prejudices are embedded during training. This has implications for the fairness of AI in evaluating creative work.

Abstract: As AI writing tools become widespread, we need to understand how both humans
and machines evaluate literary style, a domain where objective standards are
elusive and judgments are inherently subjective. We conducted controlled
experiments using Raymond Queneau's Exercises in Style (1947) to measure
attribution bias across evaluators. Study 1 compared human participants (N=556)
and AI models (N=13) evaluating literary passages from Queneau versus
GPT-4-generated versions under three conditions: blind, accurately labeled, and
counterfactually labeled. Study 2 tested bias generalization across a
14$\times$14 matrix of AI evaluators and creators. Both studies revealed
systematic pro-human attribution bias. Humans showed +13.7 percentage point
(pp) bias (Cohen's h = 0.28, 95% CI: 0.21-0.34), while AI models showed +34.3
percentage point bias (h = 0.70, 95% CI: 0.65-0.76), a 2.5-fold stronger effect
(P$<$0.001). Study 2 confirmed this bias operates across AI architectures
(+25.8pp, 95% CI: 24.1-27.6%), demonstrating that AI systems systematically
devalue creative content when labeled as "AI-generated" regardless of which AI
created it. We also find that attribution labels cause evaluators to invert
assessment criteria, with identical features receiving opposing evaluations
based solely on perceived authorship. This suggests AI models have absorbed
human cultural biases against artificial creativity during training. Our study
represents the first controlled comparison of attribution bias between human
and artificial evaluators in aesthetic judgment, revealing that AI systems not
only replicate but amplify this human tendency.

### [7] [What Is Your Agent's GPA? A Framework for Evaluating Agent Goal-Plan-Action Alignment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08847)
*Allison Sihan Jia,Daniel Huang,Nikhil Vytla,Nirvika Choudhury,John C Mitchell,Anupam Datta*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Agent GPA framework to evaluate agent performance using metrics like Goal Fulfillment and Plan Quality, with experimental results validating its coverage, human-like judgment, and error localization capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation behind this paper is to create a systematic evaluation framework for autonomous agents, addressing the challenge of identifying and improving their operational errors.

Method: The authors propose the Agent GPA framework, comprising five metrics to assess agent errors systematically. They validate its efficacy against benchmark datasets and internal cases.

Result: Experimental results show that the framework systematically captures agent failures, aligns well with human judgment (80%-95%), and achieves high error localization accuracy (86%).

Conclusion: The Agent GPA framework is effective for analyzing agent errors, supporting targeted improvements, and achieving reliability in autonomous agent deployments.

Abstract: We introduce the Agent GPA (Goal-Plan-Action) framework: an evaluation
paradigm based on an agent's operational loop of setting goals, devising plans,
and executing actions. The framework includes five evaluation metrics: Goal
Fulfillment, Logical Consistency, Execution Efficiency, Plan Quality, and Plan
Adherence. Logical Consistency checks that an agent's actions are consistent
with its prior actions. Execution Efficiency checks whether the agent executes
in the most efficient way to achieve its goal. Plan Quality checks whether an
agent's plans are aligned with its goals; Plan Adherence checks if an agent's
actions are aligned with its plan; and Goal Fulfillment checks that agent's
final outcomes match the stated goals. Our experimental results on two
benchmark datasets - the public TRAIL/GAIA dataset and an internal dataset for
a production-grade data agent - show that this framework (a) provides a
systematic way to cover a broad range of agent failures, including all agent
errors on the TRAIL/GAIA benchmark dataset; (b) supports LLM-judges that
exhibit strong agreement with human annotation, covering 80% to over 95%
errors; and (c) localizes errors with 86% agreement to enable targeted
improvement of agent performance.

### [8] [Repairing Regex Vulnerabilities via Localization-Guided Instructions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09037)
*Sicheol Sung,Joonghyuk Hahn,Yo-Sub Han*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces a hybrid framework, Localized Regex Repair (LRR), to address the trade-off between symbolic methods and LLMs in repairing ReDoS vulnerabilities in regexes, improving repair rates by 15.4%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address ReDoS vulnerabilities in regexes, as current symbolic and LLM approaches face challenges in precision, generalizability, and semantic correctness.

Method: The method combines a symbolic module for localizing vulnerable regex subpatterns with an LLM for generating semantically equivalent fixes for these isolated segments, leveraging both precision and generalization.

Result: The hybrid framework LRR improves the repair rate by 15.4 percentage points over the state-of-the-art methods, validating its effectiveness in complex automated repair tasks.

Conclusion: The hybrid approach successfully resolves previously intractable regex repair cases, offering a validated, effective methodology for automated repair and advancing the state-of-the-art in this domain.

Abstract: Regular expressions (regexes) are foundational to modern computing for
critical tasks like input validation and data parsing, yet their ubiquity
exposes systems to regular expression denial of service (ReDoS), a
vulnerability requiring automated repair methods. Current approaches, however,
are hampered by a trade-off. Symbolic, rule-based system are precise but fails
to repair unseen or complex vulnerability patterns. Conversely, large language
models (LLMs) possess the necessary generalizability but are unreliable for
tasks demanding strict syntactic and semantic correctness. We resolve this
impasse by introducing a hybrid framework, localized regex repair (LRR),
designed to harness LLM generalization while enforcing reliability. Our core
insight is to decouple problem identification from the repair process. First, a
deterministic, symbolic module localizes the precise vulnerable subpattern,
creating a constrained and tractable problem space. Then, the LLM invoked to
generate a semantically equivalent fix for this isolated segment. This combined
architecture successfully resolves complex repair cases intractable for
rule-based repair while avoiding the semantic errors of LLM-only approaches.
Our work provides a validated methodology for solving such problems in
automated repair, improving the repair rate by 15.4%p over the
state-of-the-art. Our code is available at https://github.com/cdltlehf/LRR.

### [9] [ReviewerToo: Should AI Join The Program Committee? A Look At The Future of Peer Review](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08867)
*Gaurav Sahu,Hugo Larochelle,Laurent Charlin,Christopher Pal*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ReviewerToo is an AI-assisted framework aimed at improving peer review consistency and scalability, validated with promising results but requiring human oversight for complex judgments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the inconsistency and scalability challenges in traditional peer review by integrating AI assistance.

Method: Development of the ReviewerToo framework using a modular design to run AI-driven experiments on structured evaluation criteria with partial or full integration into conference workflows.

Result: 81.8% accuracy for AI-assisted paper categorization vs. 83.9% for human reviewers. AI reviews rated higher quality by an LLM judge but still behind expert reviewers.

Conclusion: ReviewerToo enhances peer review consistency and fairness while complementing human expertise in complex evaluations, offering a scalable hybrid approach to scientific publishing.

Abstract: Peer review is the cornerstone of scientific publishing, yet it suffers from
inconsistencies, reviewer subjectivity, and scalability challenges. We
introduce ReviewerToo, a modular framework for studying and deploying
AI-assisted peer review to complement human judgment with systematic and
consistent assessments. ReviewerToo supports systematic experiments with
specialized reviewer personas and structured evaluation criteria, and can be
partially or fully integrated into real conference workflows. We validate
ReviewerToo on a carefully curated dataset of 1,963 paper submissions from ICLR
2025, where our experiments with the gpt-oss-120b model achieves 81.8% accuracy
for the task of categorizing a paper as accept/reject compared to 83.9% for the
average human reviewer. Additionally, ReviewerToo-generated reviews are rated
as higher quality than the human average by an LLM judge, though still trailing
the strongest expert contributions. Our analysis highlights domains where AI
reviewers excel (e.g., fact-checking, literature coverage) and where they
struggle (e.g., assessing methodological novelty and theoretical
contributions), underscoring the continued need for human expertise. Based on
these findings, we propose guidelines for integrating AI into peer-review
pipelines, showing how AI can enhance consistency, coverage, and fairness while
leaving complex evaluative judgments to domain experts. Our work provides a
foundation for systematic, hybrid peer-review systems that scale with the
growth of scientific publishing.

### [10] [GTAlign: Game-Theoretic Alignment of LLM Assistants for Mutual Welfare](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08872)
*Siqi Zhu,David Zhang,Pedro Cisneros-Velarde,Jiaxuan You*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper presents GTAlign, a game-theoretic alignment framework designed to improve interaction between large language models (LLMs) and users by promoting mutually beneficial outcomes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs often produce suboptimal responses due to misalignment between the model's reward optimization and user's welfare, such as overly verbose answers when concise ones are preferred. This highlights the need for a principled mechanism to align LLM-user interactions.

Method: The authors introduce GTAlign, which incorporates game-theoretic decision-making into LLM reasoning and training. The model simulates user-LLM interactions as strategic games using payoff matrices to assess mutual welfare and selects cooperative actions. They also define a mutual welfare reward during training to encourage socially efficient outcomes.

Result: Through extensive experiments, GTAlign demonstrated significant improvements in reasoning efficiency, answer quality, and fostering mutual welfare across diverse tasks compared to baseline models.

Conclusion: GTAlign integrates game-theoretic principles to enhance LLM-user interactions, yielding responses that are both effective and aligned with user preferences, thus achieving better mutual welfare outcomes.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable progress in reasoning,
yet sometimes produce responses that are suboptimal for users in tasks such as
writing, information seeking, or providing practical guidance. Conventional
alignment practices typically assume that maximizing model reward also
maximizes user welfare, but this assumption frequently fails in practice:
models may over-clarify or generate overly verbose reasoning when users prefer
concise answers. Such behaviors resemble the prisoner's dilemma, where
individually rational choices lead to socially suboptimal outcomes. The
fundamental challenge is the lack of a principled decision making mechanism
that mutually benefits both the LLM and the user. We propose Game-Theoretic
Alignment (GTAlign), an alignment framework that integrates game-theoretic
decision making into both reasoning and training. During reasoning, the model
explicitly treats user-LLM interaction as a strategic game: it constructs
payoff matrices within its reasoning chain to estimate welfare for both itself
and the user, and then selects actions that are mutually beneficial. During
training, we introduce a mutual welfare reward that reinforces cooperative
responses, aligning model behavior with socially efficient outcomes. In
addition, we introduce an inference technique that leverages game-theoretic
reasoning to dynamically adapt LLM's response when pricing policies of LLM
service change. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GTAlign substantially
improves reasoning efficiency, answer quality, and mutual welfare compared to
baselines across diverse tasks. The code is available at
https://github.com/ulab-uiuc/GTAlign .

### [11] [LM Fight Arena: Benchmarking Large Multimodal Models via Game Competition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08928)
*Yushuo Zheng,Zicheng Zhang,Xiongkuo Min,Huiyu Duan,Guangtao Zhai*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper proposes LM Fight Arena, a framework that evaluates multimodal AI models in a dynamic environment using the fighting game Mortal Kombat II.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the shortcomings of existing benchmarks that fail to test large multimodal models (LMMs) in real-time and adversarial scenarios.

Method: The authors designed a tournament where six leading models control the same character in Mortal Kombat II, interpreting game frames and state data to decide actions.

Result: The framework demonstrates the value of dynamic settings for assessing strategic reasoning and rapid visual processing in LMMs.

Conclusion: LM Fight Arena provides a novel, automated, and reproducible benchmark to test multimodal AI capabilities in interactive environments.

Abstract: Existing benchmarks for large multimodal models (LMMs) often fail to capture
their performance in real-time, adversarial environments. We introduce LM Fight
Arena (Large Model Fight Arena), a novel framework that evaluates LMMs by
pitting them against each other in the classic fighting game Mortal Kombat II,
a task requiring rapid visual understanding and tactical, sequential
decision-making. In a controlled tournament, we test six leading open- and
closed-source models, where each agent operates controlling the same character
to ensure a fair comparison. The models are prompted to interpret game frames
and state data to select their next actions. Unlike static evaluations, LM
Fight Arena provides a fully automated, reproducible, and objective assessment
of an LMM's strategic reasoning capabilities in a dynamic setting. This work
introduces a challenging and engaging benchmark that bridges the gap between AI
evaluation and interactive entertainment.

### [12] [RADAR: Mechanistic Pathways for Detecting Data Contamination in LLM Evaluation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08931)
*Ashish Kattamuri,Harshwardhan Fartale,Arpita Vats,Rahul Raja,Ishita Prasad*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces RADAR, a framework to detect data contamination in LLM evaluations using mechanistic interpretability features.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Data contamination challenges reliable evaluation of language models, as it may lead to models scoring high due to memorization rather than actual reasoning ability.

Method: RADAR utilizes 37 features representing confidence trajectories and deep mechanistic characteristics, coupled with an ensemble of classifiers to identify recall-based versus reasoning-based responses.

Result: RADAR achieves 93% accuracy on a diverse evaluation set, excelling in clear cases but obtaining 76.7% accuracy on ambiguous examples.

Conclusion: Mechanistic interpretability is a promising approach for improving language model evaluation beyond conventional surface-level metrics.

Abstract: Data contamination poses a significant challenge to reliable LLM evaluation,
where models may achieve high performance by memorizing training data rather
than demonstrating genuine reasoning capabilities. We introduce RADAR (Recall
vs. Reasoning Detection through Activation Representation), a novel framework
that leverages mechanistic interpretability to detect contamination by
distinguishing recall-based from reasoning-based model responses. RADAR
extracts 37 features spanning surface-level confidence trajectories and deep
mechanistic properties including attention specialization, circuit dynamics,
and activation flow patterns. Using an ensemble of classifiers trained on these
features, RADAR achieves 93\% accuracy on a diverse evaluation set, with
perfect performance on clear cases and 76.7\% accuracy on challenging ambiguous
examples. This work demonstrates the potential of mechanistic interpretability
for advancing LLM evaluation beyond traditional surface-level metrics.

*Samuel Hildebrand,Curtis Taylor,Sean Oesch,James M Ghawaly Jr,Amir Sadovnik,Ryan Shivers,Brandon Schreiber,Kevin Kurian*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces a benchmark to evaluate retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems holistically, focusing on multimodal ingestion, retrieval, and reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To fill the gap in evaluating RAG pipelines as complete systems across various modalities, rather than isolated components.

Method: 1) Create a dataset of 93 questions involving multiple modalities. 2) Define a phrase-level recall metric. 3) Use an embedding classifier to detect hallucinations. 4) Compare open-source and closed-source RAG pipelines. 5) Conduct human evaluations to validate metrics.

Result: Closed-source RAG pipelines outperform open-source ones, especially for multimodal and cross-document tasks. Human evaluations support the correctness and hallucination metrics, with high agreement scores.

Conclusion: The benchmark effectively measures the overall performance of RAG pipelines, with findings highlighting the superiority of closed-source solutions in challenging information scenarios.

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has emerged as a promising paradigm for
improving factual accuracy in large language models (LLMs). We introduce a
benchmark designed to evaluate RAG pipelines as a whole, evaluating a
pipeline's ability to ingest, retrieve, and reason about several modalities of
information, differentiating it from existing benchmarks that focus on
particular aspects such as retrieval. We present (1) a small, human-created
dataset of 93 questions designed to evaluate a pipeline's ability to ingest
textual data, tables, images, and data spread across these modalities in one or
more documents; (2) a phrase-level recall metric for correctness; (3) a
nearest-neighbor embedding classifier to identify potential pipeline
hallucinations; (4) a comparative evaluation of 2 pipelines built with
open-source retrieval mechanisms and 4 closed-source foundation models; and (5)
a third-party human evaluation of the alignment of our correctness and
hallucination metrics. We find that closed-source pipelines significantly
outperform open-source pipelines in both correctness and hallucination metrics,
with wider performance gaps in questions relying on multimodal and
cross-document information. Human evaluation of our metrics showed average
agreement of 4.62 for correctness and 4.53 for hallucination detection on a 1-5
Likert scale (5 indicating "strongly agree").

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the inefficiency and limited reasoning capabilities of existing retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems when dealing with complex, multi-hop question answering tasks.

Method: EcphoryRAG reduces token usage by up to 94% during indexing by only storing core entities and metadata. For retrieval, it performs entity extraction from queries, followed by dynamic, multi-hop associative search on a knowledge graph, inferring implicit relationships to enhance reasoning.

Result: Extensive experiments show EcphoryRAG achieves state-of-the-art performance, improving the average Exact Match (EM) score from 0.392 to 0.474 on benchmarks like 2WikiMultiHop, HotpotQA, and MuSiQue compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: EcphoryRAG demonstrates the effectiveness of its entity-cue-multi-hop retrieval paradigm, combining efficiency and reasoning capabilities to excel in complex question answering tasks.

Abstract: Cognitive neuroscience research indicates that humans leverage cues to
activate entity-centered memory traces (engrams) for complex, multi-hop
recollection. Inspired by this mechanism, we introduce EcphoryRAG, an
entity-centric knowledge graph RAG framework. During indexing, EcphoryRAG
extracts and stores only core entities with corresponding metadata, a
lightweight approach that reduces token consumption by up to 94\% compared to
other structured RAG systems. For retrieval, the system first extracts cue
entities from queries, then performs a scalable multi-hop associative search
across the knowledge graph. Crucially, EcphoryRAG dynamically infers implicit
relations between entities to populate context, enabling deep reasoning without
exhaustive pre-enumeration of relationships. Extensive evaluations on the
2WikiMultiHop, HotpotQA, and MuSiQue benchmarks demonstrate that EcphoryRAG
sets a new state-of-the-art, improving the average Exact Match (EM) score from
0.392 to 0.474 over strong KG-RAG methods like HippoRAG. These results validate
the efficacy of the entity-cue-multi-hop retrieval paradigm for complex
question answering.

### [15] [DualResearch: Entropy-Gated Dual-Graph Retrieval for Answer Reconstruction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08959)
*Jinxin Shi,Zongsheng Cao,Runmin Ma,Yusong Hu,Jie Zhou,Xin Li,Lei Bai,Liang He,Bo Zhang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: DualResearch is a framework to improve multi-tool scientific reasoning by constructing and fusing breadth semantic graphs and depth causal graphs, leading to enhanced context clarity and execution robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations such as context pollution, weak evidence, and brittle execution paths in multi-tool scientific reasoning frameworks like deep-research.

Method: The framework jointly constructs breadth semantic graphs for stable background knowledge and depth causal graphs for execution provenance. Graph evidence is fused using an entropy-gated rule in log space to improve reliability.

Result: DualResearch compresses execution logs into concise reasoning graphs, reconstructing answers effectively. It achieves a 7.7% accuracy improvement on HLE and a 6.06% improvement on GPQA benchmarks.

Conclusion: DualResearch enhances tool-driven scientific reasoning by addressing key limitations, achieving competitive performance, and improving reasoning consistency and clarity.

Abstract: The deep-research framework orchestrates external tools to perform complex,
multi-step scientific reasoning that exceeds the native limits of a single
large language model. However, it still suffers from context pollution, weak
evidentiary support, and brittle execution paths. To address these issues, we
propose DualResearch, a retrieval and fusion framework that matches the
epistemic structure of tool-intensive reasoning by jointly modeling two
complementary graphs: a breadth semantic graph that encodes stable background
knowledge, and a depth causal graph that captures execution provenance. Each
graph has a layer-native relevance function, seed-anchored semantic diffusion
for breadth, and causal-semantic path matching with reliability weighting for
depth. To reconcile their heterogeneity and query-dependent uncertainty,
DualResearch converts per-layer path evidence into answer distributions and
fuses them in log space via an entropy-gated rule with global calibration. The
fusion up-weights the more certain channel and amplifies agreement. As a
complement to deep-research systems, DualResearch compresses lengthy multi-tool
execution logs into a concise reasoning graph, and we show that it can
reconstruct answers stably and effectively. On the scientific reasoning
benchmarks HLE and GPQA, DualResearch achieves competitive performance. Using
log files from the open-source system InternAgent, its accuracy improves by
7.7% on HLE and 6.06% on GPQA.

### [16] [Semantic-Condition Tuning: Fusing Graph Context with Large Language Models for Knowledge Graph Completion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08966)
*Ruitong Liu,Yan Wen,Te Sun,Yunjia Wu,Pingyang Huang,Zihang Yu,Siyuan Li*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper presents Semantic-condition Tuning (SCT) for enhancing the fusion of Knowledge Graphs (KGs) with Large Language Models (LLMs), outperforming prevalent prefix-tuning methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of existing prefix-tuning methods, which fail to effectively utilize relational semantics in Knowledge Graphs, relying on LLMs for implicit reasoning.

Method: SCT introduces two modules: a Semantic Graph Module employing a Graph Neural Network for context-aware semantic extraction, and a Condition-Adaptive Fusion Module for deep and adaptive interaction with textual embeddings before LLM fine-tuning.

Result: SCT demonstrates significant performance improvements over prefix-tuning and other baselines on multiple knowledge graph benchmarks.

Conclusion: Semantic-condition Tuning provides a more effective approach to integrate KG-context into LLMs, enhancing accuracy and robustness for knowledge reasoning tasks.

Abstract: Fusing Knowledge Graphs with Large Language Models is crucial for
knowledge-intensive tasks like knowledge graph completion. The prevailing
paradigm, prefix-tuning, simply concatenates knowledge embeddings with text
inputs. However, this shallow fusion overlooks the rich relational semantics
within KGs and imposes a significant implicit reasoning burden on the LLM to
correlate the prefix with the text. To address these, we propose
Semantic-condition Tuning (SCT), a new knowledge injection paradigm comprising
two key modules. First, a Semantic Graph Module employs a Graph Neural Network
to extract a context-aware semantic condition from the local graph
neighborhood, guided by knowledge-enhanced relations. Subsequently, this
condition is passed to a Condition-Adaptive Fusion Module, which, in turn,
adaptively modulates the textual embedding via two parameterized projectors,
enabling a deep, feature-wise, and knowledge-aware interaction. The resulting
pre-fused embedding is then fed into the LLM for fine-tuning. Extensive
experiments on knowledge graph benchmarks demonstrate that SCT significantly
outperforms prefix-tuning and other strong baselines. Our analysis confirms
that by modulating the input representation with semantic graph context before
LLM inference, SCT provides a more direct and potent signal, enabling more
accurate and robust knowledge reasoning.

*Qixiang Yin,Huanjin Yao,Jianghao Chen,Jiaxing Huang,Zhicheng Zhao,Fei Su*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces Tiny-R1V, a new lightweight 3B model that optimizes reasoning efficiency and accuracy for multimodal tasks using innovative training and merging techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large Multimodal Language Models face challenges in reasoning efficiency, such as size, overthinking, and accuracy in lightweight scenarios, yet little research has focused on lightweight models' reasoning capabilities.

Method: Tiny-R1V achieves its goals through two stages: (1) Length-Informed Relative Policy Optimization (LIPO), a reinforcement learning method that prioritizes concise and high-quality responses, and (2) Adaptive Model Merging (AMM), which merges specialist models into a unified architecture using task vector adjustments and gradient projection regularization.

Result: Evaluations on ten reasoning benchmarks demonstrate Tiny-R1V's superior performance across tasks such as mathematics, structured data, OCR, and general multimodal reasoning, offering faster inference and higher accuracy.

Conclusion: Tiny-R1V demonstrates that lightweight models can achieve high efficiency and accuracy in multimodal reasoning, providing a more resource-effective alternative with wide applicability.

Abstract: Although Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated
remarkable capabilities across diverse tasks, they encounter numerous
challenges in terms of reasoning efficiency, such as large model size,
overthinking, and compromised accuracy in lightweight scenarios. However,
research on the reasoning capabilities of lightweight MLLMs is quite lacking.
To this end, we propose Tiny-R1V, a novel lightweight 3B model that achieves
faster inference and higher accuracy via a two-stage optimization, while
unifying multimodal reasoning across multiple tasks and using fewer tokens. In
the first stage, Tiny-R1V introduces Length-Informed Relative Policy
Optimization (LIPO), a novel reinforcement learning method, to train each
reasoning model. The LIPO is designed to dynamically adjusts advantages of
responses within groups, that is, by prioritizing concise yet high-quality
responses to encourage the generation of shorter and more accurate response. In
the second stage, we propose Adaptive Model Merging (AMM), a training-free
model merging method that merges multiple specialist models into a unified
architecture. Specifically, AMM adaptively adjusts the weights of task vectors
and robustly optimizes the merged vectors via a novel gradient projection
regularization loss function, thus mitigating redundant conflicts between them.
Extensive evaluations on ten widely-used reasoning benchmarks covering
mathematics, structured data (charts, tables, documents), OCR, and general
capabilities showcase the superior performance of Tiny-R1V, enabling
lightweight models to excel in diverse multimodal reasoning tasks.

*Yincen Qu,Huan Xiao,Feng Li,Hui Zhou,Xiangying Dai*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces a benchmark for evaluating travel plans from large language models, emphasizing feasibility, reliability, and engagement, with associated reinforcement learning improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Travel planning remains a challenging task for language models, and current benchmarks fail to thoroughly address key aspects like feasibility and user engagement.

Method: The authors propose a unified benchmarking system that uses a single reward for evaluating travel plans, moderate agreement with expert annotations, and release a large-scale dataset. They experiment with various model methods, including reinforcement learning via GRPO.

Result: Reinforcement learning techniques generally enhance itinerary feasibility and yield superior unified reward scores compared to prompt-only and supervised baselines.

Conclusion: Unified benchmarking and reinforcement learning improve travel-planning capabilities of LLMs, enabling better integration with user requests and demonstrating potential performance improvements.

Abstract: Travel planning is a valuable yet complex task that poses significant
challenges even for advanced large language models (LLMs). While recent
benchmarks have advanced in evaluating LLMs' planning capabilities, they often
fall short in evaluating feasibility, reliability, and engagement of travel
plans. We introduce a comprehensive benchmark for travel planning that unifies
fine-grained criteria into a single reward, enabling direct comparison of plan
quality and seamless integration with reinforcement learning (RL). Our
evaluator achieves moderate agreement with travel-expert annotations (60.75\%)
and outperforms multiple LLM-as-judge baselines. We further release a
large-scale dataset of 4,870 queries including 219 real-world, free-form
requests for generalization to authentic user intent. Using this benchmark, we
conduct extensive experiments across diverse methods and LLMs, including
test-time computation, neuro-symbolic approaches, supervised fine-tuning, and
RL via GRPO. Across base models, RL generally improves itinerary feasibility
over prompt-only and supervised baselines, yielding higher unified reward
scores.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper evaluates the grading abilities of state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs) using mathematical problem solutions, addressing their calibration issues in partial credit assignment and proposing workflows to improve grading reliability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to explore the ability of modern LLMs to assess mathematical proofs, focusing on their capability to identify errors, classify error severity, and assign nuanced grades beyond simple binary correctness.

Method: The researchers evaluated LLMs on a set of 90 Gemini 2.5 Pro-generated solutions on a 1-4 scale and IMO/USAMO 2025 problems on a 0-7 scale. They analyzed how well models detect errors and assign partial credit, introducing workflows that use extracted reference solutions to derive problem-specific rubrics for grading.

Result: Their proposed workflows showed enhanced alignment with human grading standards and addressed calibration gaps in partial credit assignment better than current methods. The workflows were evaluated using metrics across the annotated corpus and MathArena.

Conclusion: LLMs can improve their grading performance when applied through structured agentic workflows that ensure consistent handling of partial credit. This advancement makes their grading closer to human judgment, and the study provides foundational tools for further research in automated grading.

Abstract: State-of-the-art (SOTA) LLMs have progressed from struggling on proof-based
Olympiad problems to solving most of the IMO 2025 problems, with leading
systems reportedly handling 5 of 6 problems. Given this progress, we assess how
well these models can grade proofs: detecting errors, judging their severity,
and assigning fair scores beyond binary correctness. We study proof-analysis
capabilities using a corpus of 90 Gemini 2.5 Pro-generated solutions that we
grade on a 1-4 scale with detailed error annotations, and on MathArena solution
sets for IMO/USAMO 2025 scored on a 0-7 scale. Our analysis shows that models
can reliably flag incorrect (including subtly incorrect) solutions but exhibit
calibration gaps in how partial credit is assigned. To address this, we
introduce agentic workflows that extract and analyze reference solutions and
automatically derive problem-specific rubrics for a multi-step grading process.
We instantiate and compare different design choices for the grading workflows,
and evaluate their trade-offs. Across our annotated corpus and MathArena, our
proposed workflows achieve higher agreement with human grades and more
consistent handling of partial credit across metrics. We release all code,
data, and prompts/logs to facilitate future research.

### [20] [Auto-scaling Continuous Memory for GUI Agent](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09038)
*Wenyi Wu,Kun Zhou,Ruoxin Yuan,Vivian Yu,Stephen Wang,Zhiting Hu,Biwei Huang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces a continuous memory approach for GUI agents to address limitations in generalizing across unfamiliar interfaces and long-horizon tasks. It uses a visual language model (VLM) as an encoder, reducing context costs and preserving fine-grained visual features.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to overcome the limitations of prior GUI agents which rely on text token-based memory, leading to inflated context lengths and loss of visual detail critical for decision-making.

Method: A new continuous memory design is proposed, where GUI trajectories are encoded into embeddings using a VLM. The approach utilizes an auto-scaling data generation pipeline to collect extensive task data, and minimal fine-tuning is performed on the memory encoder.

Result: The memory-augmented agent demonstrated robust success rates in handling long-horizon tasks and adapting to distribution shifts, on real-world GUI benchmarks, and achieved performance comparable to closed-source state-of-the-art models.

Conclusion: The continuous memory approach and the cost-effective auto-scaling data flywheel provide a scalable, high-performing solution for GUI agents, improving their capability in challenging scenarios and reducing dependence on closed-source systems.

Abstract: We study how to endow GUI agents with scalable memory that help generalize
across unfamiliar interfaces and long-horizon tasks. Prior GUI agents compress
past trajectories into text tokens, which balloons context length and misses
decisive visual cues (e.g., exact widget size and position). We propose a
continuous memory that encodes each GUI trajectory into a fixed-length sequence
of continuous embeddings using the VLM itself as an encoder; these embeddings
are plugged directly into the backbone's input layer, sharply reducing context
cost while preserving fine-grained visual information. As memory size and
retrieval depth increase, performance improves monotonically, unlike text
memories that degrade with long prompts. To grow memory at low cost, we
introduce an auto-scaling data flywheel that (i) discovers new environments via
search, (ii) synthesizes tasks with an open-source VLM, (iii) rolls out
trajectories with the agent, and (iv) verifies success with the same VLM. Using
this pipeline, we collect 100k+ trajectories for about \$4000 and fine-tune
only the memory encoder (LoRA on a Q-Former, 1.2\% parameters) with 1,500
samples. On real-world GUI benchmarks, our memory-augmented agent consistently
improves success rates under long horizons and distribution shifts. Notably,
Qwen-2.5-VL-7B + continuous memory achieves performance comparable to
state-of-the-art closed-source models (e.g., GPT-4o, Claude-4).

*Sang Hun Kim,Jongmin Lee,Dongkyu Park,So Young Lee,Yosep Chong*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This study proposes integrating psychoanalysis and MBTI personality theory to construct artificial consciousness modules and evaluates their potential for simulating human-like cognition.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation for this work arises from the challenge of defining human consciousness scientifically and the limitations of current technologies like Large Language Models in replicating this phenomenon.

Method: The study develops three artificial consciousness models (self-awareness, unconsciousness, and preconsciousness) using psychoanalysis principles and designs 16 characters based on MBTI personality types. These modules are tested across ten situations, evaluating their cognitive responses.

Result: Quantitative and qualitative evaluations indicate a high likelihood of simulating consciousness, though differences between character and consciousness responses were minimal.

Conclusion: This research demonstrates that incorporating psychoanalysis and MBTI elements into AI can help construct more intuitive, human-like systems, enhancing AI's ability to engage in complex cognitive interactions.

Abstract: Human consciousness is still a concept hard to define with current scientific
understanding. Although Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated
significant advancements across various domains including translation and
summarization, human consciousness is not something to imitate with current
upfront technology owing to so-called hallucination. This study, therefore,
proposes a novel approach to address these challenges by integrating
psychoanalysis and the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) into constructing
consciousness and personality modules. We developed three artificial
consciousnesses (self-awareness, unconsciousness, and preconsciousness) based
on the principles of psychoanalysis. Additionally, we designed 16 characters
with different personalities representing the sixteen MBTI types, with several
attributes such as needs, status, and memories. To determine if our model's
artificial consciousness exhibits human-like cognition, we created ten distinct
situations considering seven attributes such as emotional understanding and
logical thinking. The decision-making process of artificial consciousness and
the final action were evaluated in three ways: survey evaluation, three-tier
classification via ChatGPT, and qualitative review. Both quantitative and
qualitative analyses indicated a high likelihood of well-simulated
consciousness, although the difference in response between different characters
and consciousnesses was not very significant. This implies that the developed
models incorporating elements of psychoanalysis and personality theory can lead
to building a more intuitive and adaptable AI system with humanoid
consciousness. Therefore, this study contributes to opening up new avenues for
improving AI interactions in complex cognitive contexts.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces MEC$^3$O, a system using multiple LLMs specialized in code complexity classes, which outperform baselines in predicting code time complexity via structured debates and consensus.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: With LLMs showing varied performance across different code time complexity classes, a system was needed to leverage their strengths while handling their weaknesses.

Method: MEC$^3$O assigns LLMs to specific complexity classes with tailored instructions and holds structured debates among them, integrating their outputs using a weighted consensus mechanism.

Result: MEC$^3$O achieved over 10% higher accuracy and macro-F1 scores compared to open-source baselines and demonstrated competitive performance against GPT-4 on code complexity predictions.

Conclusion: The multi-expert debate and consensus strategy significantly improves code complexity prediction by leveraging the individual strengths of LLMs specialized in specific areas.

Abstract: Predicting the complexity of source code is essential for software
development and algorithm analysis. Recently, Baik et al. (2025) introduced
CodeComplex for code time complexity prediction. The paper shows that LLMs
without fine-tuning struggle with certain complexity classes. This suggests
that no single LLM excels at every class, but rather each model shows
advantages in certain classes. We propose MEC$^3$O, a multi-expert consensus
system, which extends the multi-agent debate frameworks. MEC$^3$O assigns LLMs
to complexity classes based on their performance and provides them with
class-specialized instructions, turning them into experts. These experts engage
in structured debates, and their predictions are integrated through a weighted
consensus mechanism. Our expertise assignments to LLMs effectively handle
Degeneration-of-Thought, reducing reliance on a separate judge model, and
preventing convergence to incorrect majority opinions. Experiments on
CodeComplex show that MEC$^3$O outperforms the open-source baselines, achieving
at least 10% higher accuracy and macro-F1 scores. It also surpasses GPT-4o-mini
in macro-F1 scores on average and demonstrates competitive on-par F1 scores to
GPT-4o and GPT-o4-mini on average. This demonstrates the effectiveness of
multi-expert debates and weight consensus strategy to generate the final
predictions. Our code and data is available at

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes a training-free method to enhance diversity in flow-based text-to-image models during inference, without compromising image quality or alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Flow-based models for text-to-image generation follow deterministic paths, limiting diversity and requiring repeated costly sampling for exploring modes.

Method: A training-free inference-time method introduces geometric constraints including lateral spread and orthogonal stochastic perturbations to boost diversity, maintaining prompt fidelity and compatibility with common solvers.

Result: The proposed approach consistently improves diversity metrics like Vendi Score and Brisque while preserving image quality and prompt alignment.

Conclusion: The method successfully enhances diversity in text-to-image models during inference, demonstrating robust performance without retraining or modifying existing samplers.

Abstract: Flow-based text-to-image models follow deterministic trajectories, forcing
users to repeatedly sample to discover diverse modes, which is a costly and
inefficient process. We present a training-free, inference-time control
mechanism that makes the flow itself diversity-aware. Our method simultaneously
encourages lateral spread among trajectories via a feature-space objective and
reintroduces uncertainty through a time-scheduled stochastic perturbation.
Crucially, this perturbation is projected to be orthogonal to the generation
flow, a geometric constraint that allows it to boost variation without
degrading image details or prompt fidelity. Our procedure requires no
retraining or modification to the base sampler and is compatible with common
flow-matching solvers. Theoretically, our method is shown to monotonically
increase a volume surrogate while, due to its geometric constraints,
approximately preserving the marginal distribution. This provides a principled
explanation for why generation quality is robustly maintained. Empirically,
across multiple text-to-image settings under fixed sampling budgets, our method
consistently improves diversity metrics such as the Vendi Score and Brisque
over strong baselines, while upholding image quality and alignment.

*Bicheng Wang,Jinping Wang,Yibo Sue*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces a method that employs dynamic hypergraph learning and dual-driven dynamic prediction modules to predict complex network dynamics accurately and interpretably.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Complex networks exhibit non-pairwise relationships and require accurate prediction methods combining theory and data-driven approaches.

Method: The method integrates dynamic hypergraph learning to capture higher-order relations and employs the Koopman operator theory alongside physical neural differential equations for accurate, interpretable predictions.

Result: Experiments on public and industrial datasets demonstrate the method‚Äôs high accuracy and effectiveness for long-term predictions.

Conclusion: The paper successfully enhances complex network dynamic predictions by addressing higher-order relationships and balancing accuracy with interpretability.

Abstract: Learning complex network dynamics is fundamental to understanding, modelling
and controlling real-world complex systems. There are two main problems in the
task of predicting the dynamic evolution of complex networks: on the one hand,
existing methods usually use simple graphs to describe the relationships in
complex networks; however, this approach can only capture pairwise
relationships, while there may be rich non-pairwise structured relationships in
the network. First-order GNNs have difficulty in capturing dynamic non-pairwise
relationships. On the other hand, theoretical prediction models lack accuracy
and data-driven prediction models lack interpretability. To address the above
problems, this paper proposes a higher-order network dynamics identification
method for long-term dynamic prediction of complex networks. Firstly, to
address the problem that traditional graph machine learning can only deal with
pairwise relations, dynamic hypergraph learning is introduced to capture the
higher-order non-pairwise relations among complex networks and improve the
accuracy of complex network modelling. Then, a dual-driven dynamic prediction
module for physical data is proposed. The Koopman operator theory is introduced
to transform the nonlinear dynamical differential equations for the dynamic
evolution of complex networks into linear systems for solving. Meanwhile, the
physical information neural differential equation method is utilised to ensure
that the dynamic evolution conforms to the physical laws. The dual-drive
dynamic prediction module ensures both accuracy and interpretability of the
prediction. Validated on public datasets and self-built industrial chain
network datasets, the experimental results show that the method in this paper
has good prediction accuracy and long-term prediction performance.

TL;DR: This paper explores improving large language model (LLM) agents' performance in social deduction games (SDGs) by focusing on persuasive communication using reinforcement learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of emphasis on persuasive communication in existing LLM agents for SDGs, as success in these games depends on influencing others' responses.

Method: Formalizing turn-based dialogue in SDGs as a Stackelberg competition and developing a reinforcement learning framework to optimize utterances for persuasion.

Result: The proposed agents significantly outperform baselines in three diverse SDGs, showing effectiveness in persuasive communication.

Conclusion: This research advances AI capabilities in strategic social influence, with broad implications for scenarios requiring persuasive interaction.

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) agents have shown remarkable progress in social
deduction games (SDGs). However, existing approaches primarily focus on
information processing and strategy selection, overlooking the significance of
persuasive communication in influencing other players' beliefs and responses.
In SDGs, success depends not only on making correct deductions but on
convincing others to response in alignment with one's intent. To address this
limitation, we formalize turn-based dialogue in SDGs as a Stackelberg
competition, where the current player acts as the leader who strategically
influences the follower's response. Building on this theoretical foundation, we
propose a reinforcement learning framework that trains agents to optimize
utterances for persuasive impact. Through comprehensive experiments across
three diverse SDGs, we demonstrate that our agents significantly outperform
baselines. This work represents a significant step toward developing AI agents
capable of strategic social influence, with implications extending to scenarios
requiring persuasive communication.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces Probably Approximately Correct (PAC) reasoning to make large reasoning models (LRMs) more computationally efficient while bounding performance losses under user-specified tolerances.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large reasoning models (LRMs) have high computational costs during deployment, making efficient inference crucial, especially for high-stakes applications.

Method: The paper develops PAC reasoning with a monotone uncertainty score function to create an upper bound on performance loss. This establishes a threshold for deciding when LRMs can switch between thinking and nonthinking modes while ensuring performance stays within bounds.

Result: Experiments on reasoning benchmarks demonstrated that the PAC method can both reduce computational costs and maintain user-defined performance loss tolerances.

Conclusion: The proposed PAC reasoning approach achieves efficient inference in LRMs by providing reliable, performance-controlled switching between reasoning modes.

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) have achieved remarkable progress in complex
problem-solving tasks. Despite this success, LRMs typically suffer from high
computational costs during deployment, highlighting a need for efficient
inference. A popular direction of efficiency improvement is to switch the LRM
between thinking and nonthinking modes dynamically. However, such approaches
often introduce additional reasoning errors and lack statistical guarantees for
the performance loss, which are critical for high-stakes applications. In this
work, we propose Probably Approximately Correct (PAC) reasoning that controls
the performance loss under the user-specified performance loss tolerance. In
particular, we construct an upper confidence bound on the performance loss,
formulated as a monotone function of the uncertainty score, and subsequently
determine a threshold for switching to the nonthinking model. Theoretically,
using the threshold to switch between the thinking and nonthinking modes
ensures bounded performance loss in a distribution-free manner. Our
comprehensive experiments on reasoning benchmarks show that the proposed method
can save computational budgets and control the user-specified performance loss.

TL;DR: The paper explores how LLMs generate medical advice that varies by patient profiles, highlighting systemic biases in responses.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Evaluate whether LLM-generated medical advice systematically differs across social groups in readability and complexity.

Method: Simulated medical questions spanning various clinical domains posed by different patient profiles (varying in sex, age range, and ethnicity); analysis of natural language features in generated responses.

Result: Responses vary systematically between social groups, with Indigenous and intersex patients receiving less readable and more complex advice. Biases amplify for intersectional groups.

Conclusion: The paper underscores the urgent need for bias mitigation in LLMs to ensure equitable medical advice and calls for increased AI literacy among users.

Abstract: With the rapid progress of Large Language Models (LLMs), the general public
now has easy and affordable access to applications capable of answering most
health-related questions in a personalized manner. These LLMs are increasingly
proving to be competitive, and now even surpass professionals in some medical
capabilities. They hold particular promise in low-resource settings,
considering they provide the possibility of widely accessible, quasi-free
healthcare support. However, evaluations that fuel these motivations highly
lack insights into the social nature of healthcare, oblivious to health
disparities between social groups and to how bias may translate into
LLM-generated medical advice and impact users. We provide an exploratory
analysis of LLM answers to a series of medical questions spanning key clinical
domains, where we simulate these questions being asked by several patient
profiles that vary in sex, age range, and ethnicity. By comparing natural
language features of the generated responses, we show that, when LLMs are used
for medical advice generation, they generate responses that systematically
differ between social groups. In particular, Indigenous and intersex patients
receive advice that is less readable and more complex. We observe these trends
amplify when intersectional groups are considered. Considering the increasing
trust individuals place in these models, we argue for higher AI literacy and
for the urgent need for investigation and mitigation by AI developers to ensure
these systemic differences are diminished and do not translate to unjust
patient support. Our code is publicly available on GitHub.

### [29] [RegexPSPACE: A Benchmark for Evaluating LLM Reasoning on PSPACE-complete Regex Problems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09227)
*Hyundong Jin,Joonghyuk Hahn,Yo-Sub Han*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper assesses the spatial computational limitations of Large Language Models (LLMs) and Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) using benchmarks based on PSPACE-complete regex problems, providing insights into their reasoning capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to explore the computational limits of LLMs and LRMs, especially their spatial complexity, which has not been well understood despite their strong performance across various tasks.

Method: The authors constructed a dataset of over a million regex instances for PSPACE-complete problems (RegexEQ and RegexMin) using a double-exponential space exploration with a sound filtering process. They evaluated 6 LLMs and 5 LRMs for reasoning capabilities and identified common failure patterns.

Result: The evaluation revealed common limitations in LLMs and LRMs, such as verbosity and repeated reasoning errors, highlighting their challenges in tackling complex reasoning tasks.

Conclusion: The study offers a novel benchmark and quantitative evaluation framework to investigate the spatial computational limitations of LLMs and LRMs, advancing the understanding of their reasoning capacities.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) show strong performance across natural language
processing (NLP), mathematical reasoning, and programming, and recent large
reasoning models (LRMs) further emphasize explicit reasoning. Yet their
computational limits, particularly spatial complexity constrained by finite
context windows, remain poorly understood. While recent works often focus on
problems within the NP complexity class, we push the boundary by introducing a
novel benchmark grounded in two PSPACE-complete regular expression (regex)
problems: equivalence decision (RegexEQ) and minimization (RegexMin).
PSPACE-complete problems serve as a more rigorous standard for assessing
computational capacity, as their solutions require massive search space
exploration. We perform a double-exponential space exploration to construct a
labeled dataset of over a million regex instances with a sound filtering
process to build the benchmark. We conduct extensive evaluations on 6 LLMs and
5 LRMs of varying scales, revealing common failure patterns such as verbosity
and repetition. With its well-defined structure and quantitative evaluation
metrics, this work presents the first empirical investigation into the spatial
computational limitations of LLMs and LRMs, offering a new framework for
evaluating their advanced reasoning capabilities. Our code is available at

TL;DR: This paper reviews methods to enhance large language models (LLMs) by equipping them with functionalities like perception, reasoning, memory, and execution, aiming to mimic human-like autonomous behavior.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper is motivated by the limitations of traditional LLMs in performing real-world tasks and aims to explore approaches to develop agentic LLMs capable of automating complex tasks with human-level performance.

Method: The paper analyzes the incorporation of systems for perception, reasoning, memory, and execution in LLMs, using techniques like Chain-of-Thought and Tree-of-Thought for reasoning and mechanisms for short-term and long-term memory retention.

Result: Integrating perception, reasoning, memory, and execution systems enables LLMs to exhibit more capable and generalized autonomous behavior, bridging the gap with human cognitive processes.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that combining these systems can lead to the development of intelligent software agents powered by LLMs, which can autonomously perform complex tasks by mimicking human cognition.

Abstract: This paper reviews the architecture and implementation methods of agents
powered by large language models (LLMs). Motivated by the limitations of
traditional LLMs in real-world tasks, the research aims to explore patterns to
develop "agentic" LLMs that can automate complex tasks and bridge the
performance gap with human capabilities. Key components include a perception
system that converts environmental percepts into meaningful representations; a
reasoning system that formulates plans, adapts to feedback, and evaluates
actions through different techniques like Chain-of-Thought and Tree-of-Thought;
a memory system that retains knowledge through both short-term and long-term
mechanisms; and an execution system that translates internal decisions into
concrete actions. This paper shows how integrating these systems leads to more
capable and generalized software bots that mimic human cognitive processes for
autonomous and intelligent behavior.

### [31] [Localist LLMs -- A Mathematical Framework for Dynamic Locality Control](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09338)
*Joachim Diederich*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces a framework for large language models with adjustable internal representations that balance between interpretability and efficiency using a "locality dial."


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The research addresses the need for adaptable language models that can operate flexibly in domains requiring both transparency (interpretable outputs) and high efficiency (distributed representations).

Method: The framework employs group sparsity penalties on attention, information-theoretic anchor designs, and dynamic rule injection, integrating a tunable parameter called "locality dial" for model adaptability.

Result: Mathematical proofs demonstrate explicit threshold conditions where attention mechanisms focus on semantically relevant blocks, achieving high fidelity and low entropy upon exceeding group sparsity thresholds.

Conclusion: The proposed method allows dynamic adjustments between interpretability and performance, making it suitable for regulated domains demanding both precise understanding and functional robustness.

Abstract: We present a novel framework for training large language models with
continuously adjustable internal representations that span the full spectrum
from localist (interpretable, rule-based) to distributed (generalizable,
efficient) encodings. The key innovation is a locality dial, a tunable
parameter that dynamically controls the degree of localization during both
training and inference without requiring model retraining. This is achieved
through group sparsity penalties on attention mechanisms, information-theoretic
anchor design, and dynamic rule injection. We provide rigorous mathematical
proofs establishing explicit threshold conditions under which attention
provably concentrates on semantically relevant blocks, with exponential bounds
on attention entropy and pointer fidelity. Specifically, we prove that when
group sparsity penalties exceed certain threshold values, the model's attention
mechanisms concentrate on semantically relevant blocks, achieving low entropy
and high fidelity with negligible error. This framework enables practitioners
to continuously interpolate between interpretable and high-performance modes,
supporting applications in regulated domains requiring both transparency and
capability.

*Davide Maltoni,Matteo Ferrara*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Small language models can solve deductive reasoning tasks by learning rules and induction heads play a key role.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore how language models implement logical reasoning and uncover their internal mechanisms.

Method: A small language model was trained on deductive reasoning tasks and its internal representations were analyzed.

Result: The model learned the underlying rules, bypassing statistical learning, with induction heads being central to rule-based reasoning.

Conclusion: Small language models can emulate logical reasoning through rule-based learning, with induction heads as key components.

Abstract: Recent large language models have demonstrated relevant capabilities in
solving problems that require logical reasoning; however, the corresponding
internal mechanisms remain largely unexplored. In this paper, we show that a
small language model can solve a deductive reasoning task by learning the
underlying rules (rather than operating as a statistical learner). A low-level
explanation of its internal representations and computational circuits is then
provided. Our findings reveal that induction heads play a central role in the
implementation of the rule completion and rule chaining steps involved in the
logical inference required by the task.

*Augustin Delecluse,Pierre Schaus,Pascal Van Hentenryck*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces sequence variables within Constraint Programming (CP) to address limitations in modeling Vehicle Routing Problems (VRP), specifically handling optional visits and insertion-based heuristics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Classical CP models rely on successor variables, which are insufficient for dealing with optional visits or supporting insertion heuristics in VRP.

Method: The paper formalizes sequence variables, defines their domain, updates, and consistency levels, and introduces global constraints tailored for vehicle routing.

Result: Sequence variables simplify problem modeling and show competitive computational results, demonstrated on the Dial-a-Ride Problem.

Conclusion: Sequence variables enhance CP's capability to handle more complex VRP scenarios, making it a more versatile tool for modeling and solving real-world routing problems.

Abstract: Constraint Programming (CP) offers an intuitive, declarative framework for
modeling Vehicle Routing Problems (VRP), yet classical CP models based on
successor variables cannot always deal with optional visits or insertion based
heuristics. To address these limitations, this paper formalizes sequence
variables within CP. Unlike the classical successor models, this computational
domain handle optional visits and support insertion heuristics, including
insertion-based Large Neighborhood Search. We provide a clear definition of
their domain, update operations, and introduce consistency levels for
constraints on this domain. An implementation is described with the underlying
data structures required for integrating sequence variables into existing
trail-based CP solvers. Furthermore, global constraints specifically designed
for sequence variables and vehicle routing are introduced. Finally, the
effectiveness of sequence variables is demonstrated by simplifying problem
modeling and achieving competitive computational performance on the Dial-a-Ride
Problem.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper discusses how large language models (LLMs) can be harnessed to create autonomous agent systems for enhancing workflows in radiology.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to improve radiology workflows through the integration of autonomous systems, driven by LLMs, capable of managing complex tasks across multimodal data.

Method: The paper suggests equipping LLMs with external tools and feedback mechanisms for adaptive autonomy and integration with health IT systems.

Result: LLMs demonstrate promising capabilities for various individual radiology tasks, and when integrated with tools, can support complex workflows effectively.

Conclusion: LLM-driven agentic systems in radiology have the potential to automate complex tasks efficiently but face challenges such as error cascades and integration issues.

Abstract: Building agents, systems that perceive and act upon their environment with a
degree of autonomy, has long been a focus of AI research. This pursuit has
recently become vastly more practical with the emergence of large language
models (LLMs) capable of using natural language to integrate information,
follow instructions, and perform forms of "reasoning" and planning across a
wide range of tasks. With its multimodal data streams and orchestrated
workflows spanning multiple systems, radiology is uniquely suited to benefit
from agents that can adapt to context and automate repetitive yet complex
tasks. In radiology, LLMs and their multimodal variants have already
demonstrated promising performance for individual tasks such as information
extraction and report summarization. However, using LLMs in isolation
underutilizes their potential to support complex, multi-step workflows where
decisions depend on evolving context from multiple information sources.
Equipping LLMs with external tools and feedback mechanisms enables them to
drive systems that exhibit a spectrum of autonomy, ranging from semi-automated
workflows to more adaptive agents capable of managing complex processes. This
review examines the design of such LLM-driven agentic systems, highlights key
applications, discusses evaluation methods for planning and tool use, and
outlines challenges such as error cascades, tool-use efficiency, and health IT
integration.

TL;DR: The paper discusses using API-first, programmable lakehouses to ensure safe, AI-driven workflows, using Bauplan as a case study to show reproducibility, observability, and reduced risks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI automation in data lakehouses raises trust, correctness, and governance concerns for sensitive workloads.

Method: The study introduces "Bauplan," focusing on data branching, declarative environments, and integrating agents for pipeline repairs validated through correctness checks inspired by proof-carrying code.

Result: A prototype demonstrated how untrusted AI agents could safely operate within production data pipelines, ensuring safety and reducing risks.

Conclusion: API-first and programmable lakehouse designs can enable secure, reproducible, and agent-driven workflows with significant potential for wider adoption.

Abstract: Data lakehouses run sensitive workloads, where AI-driven automation raises
concerns about trust, correctness, and governance. We argue that API-first,
programmable lakehouses provide the right abstractions for safe-by-design,
agentic workflows. Using Bauplan as a case study, we show how data branching
and declarative environments extend naturally to agents, enabling
reproducibility and observability while reducing the attack surface. We present
a proof-of-concept in which agents repair data pipelines using correctness
checks inspired by proof-carrying code. Our prototype demonstrates that
untrusted AI agents can operate safely on production data and outlines a path
toward a fully agentic lakehouse.

### [36] [GraphMERT: Efficient and Scalable Distillation of Reliable Knowledge Graphs from Unstructured Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09580)
*Margarita Belova,Jiaxin Xiao,Shikhar Tuli,Niraj K. Jha*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces GraphMERT, a small graphical encoder-only model that effectively generates high-quality knowledge graphs (KGs) from unstructured text. Its neurosymbolic approach achieves state-of-the-art performance and superior symbolic representations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to overcome the scalability and interpretability issues in neurosymbolic AI by combining neural learning with symbolic reasoning, using high-quality knowledge graphs to enhance automation and trust in AI systems.

Method: The research proposes GraphMERT, an efficient model that integrates neural and symbolic systems by distilling reliable domain-specific knowledge graphs from text and its own internal representations, focusing on factual accuracy and consistency.

Result: GraphMERT outperforms large language models in generating domain-specific knowledge graphs, achieving significantly higher FActScore (69.8% vs. 40.2%) and ValidityScore (68.8% vs. 43.0%) on PubMed diabetes text.

Conclusion: GraphMERT successfully combines neural and symbolic approaches into an efficient, scalable system for generating reliable and valid domain-specific knowledge graphs, surpassing the capabilities of existing large models.

Abstract: Researchers have pursued neurosymbolic artificial intelligence (AI)
applications for nearly three decades because symbolic components provide
abstraction while neural components provide generalization. Thus, a marriage of
the two components can lead to rapid advancements in AI. Yet, the field has not
realized this promise since most neurosymbolic AI frameworks fail to scale. In
addition, the implicit representations and approximate reasoning of neural
approaches limit interpretability and trust. Knowledge graphs (KGs), a
gold-standard representation of explicit semantic knowledge, can address the
symbolic side. However, automatically deriving reliable KGs from text corpora
has remained an open problem. We address these challenges by introducing
GraphMERT, a tiny graphical encoder-only model that distills high-quality KGs
from unstructured text corpora and its own internal representations. GraphMERT
and its equivalent KG form a modular neurosymbolic stack: neural learning of
abstractions; symbolic KGs for verifiable reasoning. GraphMERT + KG is the
first efficient and scalable neurosymbolic model to achieve state-of-the-art
benchmark accuracy along with superior symbolic representations relative to
baselines.
  Concretely, we target reliable domain-specific KGs that are both (1) factual
(with provenance) and (2) valid (ontology-consistent relations with
domain-appropriate semantics). When a large language model (LLM), e.g.,
Qwen3-32B, generates domain-specific KGs, it falls short on reliability due to
prompt sensitivity, shallow domain expertise, and hallucinated relations. On
text obtained from PubMed papers on diabetes, our 80M-parameter GraphMERT
yields a KG with a 69.8% FActScore; a 32B-parameter baseline LLM yields a KG
that achieves only 40.2% FActScore. The GraphMERT KG also attains a higher
ValidityScore of 68.8%, versus 43.0% for the LLM baseline.

### [37] [LiveOIBench: Can Large Language Models Outperform Human Contestants in Informatics Olympiads?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09595)
*Kaijian Zou,Aaron Xiong,Yunxiang Zhang,Frederick Zhang,Yueqi Ren,Jirong Yang,Ayoung Lee,Shitanshu Bhushan,Lu Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces LiveOIBench, a new benchmark for evaluating coding capabilities of LLMs using complex Olympiad-level coding tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study identifies limitations in current coding benchmarks, such as lack of challenging problems, inadequate test coverage, and reliance on restrictive APIs, which necessitates a more robust and accessible testing framework for LLMs.

Method: LiveOIBench was created with 403 expert-curated Olympiad-level problems sourced from 72 official Informatics Olympiads (2023‚Äì2025), enriched with detailed test cases, performance comparison against human experts, and a self-contained evaluation system for reproducibility.

Result: In evaluation, GPT-5 achieved the 81.76th percentile, while top human contestants typically score above the 90th percentile. GPT-OSS-120B reached just a 60th percentile, exposing capability gaps between open-weight reasoning models and closed models.

Conclusion: LiveOIBench sets a new standard for benchmarking coding capabilities by offering robust and challenging tasks, revealing areas where models like GPT-5 excel and where they fall short. It suggests future models should lean towards structured analysis rather than excessive exploration.

Abstract: Competitive programming problems increasingly serve as valuable benchmarks to
evaluate the coding capabilities of large language models (LLMs) due to their
complexity and ease of verification. Yet, current coding benchmarks face
limitations such as lack of exceptionally challenging problems, insufficient
test case coverage, reliance on online platform APIs that limit accessibility.
To address these issues, we introduce LiveOIBench, a comprehensive benchmark
featuring 403 expert-curated Olympiad-level competitive programming problems,
each with an average of 60 expert-designed test cases. The problems are sourced
directly from 72 official Informatics Olympiads in different regions conducted
between 2023 and 2025. LiveOIBench distinguishes itself through four key
features: (1) meticulously curated high-quality tasks with detailed subtask
rubrics and extensive private test cases; (2) direct integration of elite
contestant performance data to enable informative comparison against
top-performing humans; (3) planned continuous, contamination-free updates from
newly released Olympiad problems; and (4) a self-contained evaluation system
facilitating offline and easy-to-reproduce assessments. Benchmarking 32 popular
general-purpose and reasoning LLMs, we find that GPT-5 achieves a notable
81.76th percentile, a strong result that nonetheless falls short of top human
contestant performance, who usually place above 90th. In contrast, among
open-weight reasoning models, GPT-OSS-120B achieves only a 60th percentile,
underscoring significant capability disparities from frontier closed models.
Detailed analyses indicate that robust reasoning models prioritize precise
problem analysis over excessive exploration, suggesting future models should
emphasize structured analysis and minimize unnecessary exploration. All data,
code, and leaderboard results will be made publicly available on our website.

### [38] [Mozart: A Chiplet Ecosystem-Accelerator Codesign Framework for Composable Bespoke Application Specific Integrated Circuits](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08873)
*Haoran Jin,Jirong Yang,Yunpeng Liu,Barry Lyu,Kangqi Zhang,Nathaniel Bleier*

Main category: cs.AR

TL;DR: The paper introduces Mozart, a chiplet ecosystem and codesign framework for creating cost-effective, bespoke AI accelerators called BASICs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the inefficiencies in AI accelerators caused by generalized assumptions about memory, batching, and heterogeneous operator requirements.

Method: Mozart constructs BASICs by leveraging operator-level disaggregation, chiplet selection, memory heterogeneity, tensor optimizations, and system-level physical validations.

Result: Mozart-generated BASICs achieve significant reductions in energy (up to 78.8%), energy-cost, energy-delay, and energy-delay-cost metrics. It also improves energy efficiency in datacenter LLM serving, speculative decoding, and autonomous vehicle perception tasks.

Conclusion: Mozart demonstrates tangible performance benefits with optimized, low-cost chiplet designs, highlighting its applicability in diverse deployment contexts.

Abstract: Modern AI acceleration faces a fundamental challenge: conventional
assumptions about memory requirements, batching effectiveness, and
latency-throughput tradeoffs are systemwide generalizations that ignore the
heterogeneous computational patterns of individual neural network operators.
However, going towards network-level customization and operator-level
heterogeneity incur substantial Non-Recurring Engineering (NRE) costs. While
chiplet-based approaches have been proposed to amortize NRE costs, reuse
opportunities remain limited without carefully identifying which chiplets are
truly necessary. This paper introduces Mozart, a chiplet ecosystem and
accelerator codesign framework that systematically constructs low cost bespoke
application-specific integrated circuits (BASICs). BASICs leverage
operator-level disaggregation to explore chiplet and memory heterogeneity,
tensor fusion, and tensor parallelism, with place-and-route validation ensuring
physical implementability. The framework also enables constraint-aware
system-level optimization across deployment contexts ranging from datacenter
inference serving to edge computing in autonomous vehicles. The evaluation
confirms that with just 8 strategically selected chiplets, Mozart-generated
composite BASICs achieve 43.5%, 25.4%, 67.7%, and 78.8% reductions in energy,
energy-cost product, energy-delay product (EDP), and energy-delay-cost product
compared to traditional homogeneous accelerators. For datacenter LLM serving,
Mozart achieves 15-19% energy reduction and 35-39% energy-cost improvement. In
speculative decoding, Mozart delivers throughput improvements of 24.6-58.6%
while reducing energy consumption by 38.6-45.6%. For autonomous vehicle
perception, Mozart reduces energy-cost by 25.54% and energy by 10.53% under
real-time constraints.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a System-on-Chip (SoC) for DNA sequencing machines, achieving significant gains in performance and energy efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current hand-sized DNA sequencers require external devices for processing, limiting mobility and increasing communication strain.

Method: A 22-nm CMOS System-on-Chip based on a RISC-V core with dedicated DNA detection accelerators was designed and fabricated.

Result: The presented SoC delivered 13X performance improvement and nearly 3000X enhancement in energy efficiency compared to commercial embedded multicore processors.

Conclusion: Integrating advanced processing into DNA sequencers can lead to truly mobile, energy-efficient solutions for real-time sequencing.

Abstract: Hand-sized Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) sequencing machines are of growing
importance in several life sciences fields as their small footprints enable a
broader range of use cases than their larger, stationary counterparts. However,
as currently designed, they lack sufficient embedded computing to process the
large volume of measurements generated by their internal sensory system. As a
consequence, they rely on external devices for additional processing
capability. This dependence on external processing places a significant
communication burden on the sequencer's embedded electronics. Moreover, it also
prevents a truly mobile solution for sequencing in real-time. Anticipating
next-generation machines that include suitably advanced processing, we present
a System-on-Chip (SoC) fabricated in 22-nm complementary metal-oxide
semiconductor (CMOS). Our design, based on a general-purpose reduced
instruction set computing (RISC-V) core, also includes accelerators for DNA
detection that allow our system to demonstrate a 13X performance improvement
over commercial embedded multicore processors combined with a near 3000X boost
in energy efficiency.

TL;DR: HERO introduces a reinforcement learning-based framework for hardware-aware quantization of Neural Radiance Field (NeRF), achieving improved latency, cost efficiency, and compact model size compared to previous methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing NeRF quantization and hardware acceleration approaches fail to optimize for hardware constraints and depend heavily on human expertise, making them inefficient and potentially sub-optimal.

Method: HERO employs reinforcement learning and integrates a NeRF accelerator simulator for real-time hardware feedback to automate the adaptation process.

Result: HERO improves latency by 1.31-1.33 times, cost efficiency by 1.29-1.33 times, and delivers a more compact model compared to the previous state-of-the-art CAQ framework.

Conclusion: HERO successfully automates and optimizes the quantization process for NeRF, effectively balancing hardware and algorithmic constraints for superior outcomes.

Abstract: Neural Radiance Field (NeRF) has emerged as a promising 3D reconstruction
method, delivering high-quality results for AR/VR applications. While
quantization methods and hardware accelerators have been proposed to enhance
NeRF's computational efficiency, existing approaches face crucial limitations.
Current quantization methods operate without considering hardware architecture,
resulting in sub-optimal solutions within the vast design space encompassing
accuracy, latency, and model size. Additionally, existing NeRF accelerators
heavily rely on human experts to explore this design space, making the
optimization process time-consuming, inefficient, and unlikely to discover
optimal solutions. To address these challenges, we introduce HERO, a
reinforcement learning framework performing hardware-aware quantization for
NeRF. Our framework integrates a NeRF accelerator simulator to generate
real-time hardware feedback, enabling fully automated adaptation to hardware
constraints. Experimental results demonstrate that HERO achieves 1.31-1.33
$\times$ better latency, 1.29-1.33 $\times$ improved cost efficiency, and a
more compact model size compared to CAQ, a previous state-of-the-art NeRF
quantization framework. These results validate our framework's capability to
effectively navigate the complex design space between hardware and algorithm
requirements, discovering superior quantization policies for NeRF
implementation. Code is available at https://github.com/ypzhng/HERO.

TL;DR: The study assesses GLiNER-BioMed for BioNER using BioASQ data and explores dictionary-based post-processing, improving F1-scores on development data but losing generalization on blind tests.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To tackle challenges in biomedical named entity recognition, particularly in differentiating similar entity types like genes and chemicals, to extract valuable information from scientific texts.

Method: Evaluation of GLiNER-BioMed with a focus on dictionary-based post-processing, and exploration of alternative methods, including Conditional Random Fields.

Result: Post-processing improved the micro F1-score from 0.79 to 0.83 on the development set but dropped to 0.77 on the blind test set, failing to outperform the baseline.

Conclusion: Although dictionary-based post-processing showed promise, overfitting to development data and lack of generalization to blind test sets remain critical barriers for applying this approach broadly.

Abstract: Biomedical Named Entity Recognition (BioNER), task6 in BioASQ (A challenge in
large-scale biomedical semantic indexing and question answering), is crucial
for extracting information from scientific literature but faces hurdles such as
distinguishing between similar entity types like genes and chemicals. This
study evaluates the GLiNER-BioMed model on a BioASQ dataset and introduces a
targeted dictionary-based post-processing strategy to address common
misclassifications. While this post-processing approach demonstrated notable
improvement on our development set, increasing the micro F1-score from a
baseline of 0.79 to 0.83, this enhancement did not generalize to the blind test
set, where the post-processed model achieved a micro F1-score of 0.77 compared
to the baselines 0.79. We also discuss insights gained from exploring
alternative methodologies, including Conditional Random Fields. This work
highlights the potential of dictionary-based refinement for pre-trained BioNER
models but underscores the critical challenge of overfitting to development
data and the necessity of ensuring robust generalization for real-world
applicability.

Motivation: Understanding how diversity affects reasoning reliability in TTS strategies and addressing gaps in safety mechanisms.

Method: Introduced RefDiv as a diagnostic protocol to stress-test TTS pipelines, analyzing multiple models and strategies.

Result: Reduced diversity strongly correlates with unsafe outputs, surpassing impacts caused by explicitly adversarial prompts.

Conclusion: Future TTS strategies need robust designs that ensure security, even under diversity constraints and stress tests like RefDiv.

Abstract: Test-Time Scaling (TTS) improves LLM reasoning by exploring multiple
candidate responses and then operating over this set to find the best output. A
tacit premise behind TTS is that sufficiently diverse candidate pools enhance
reliability. In this work, we show that this assumption in TTS introduces a
previously unrecognized failure mode. When candidate diversity is curtailed,
even by a modest amount, TTS becomes much more likely to produce unsafe
outputs. We present a reference-guided diversity reduction protocol (RefDiv)
that serves as a diagnostic attack to stress test TTS pipelines. Through
extensive experiments across four open-source models (Qwen3, Mistral, Llama3.1,
Gemma3) and two widely used TTS strategies (Monte Carlo Tree Search and
Best-of-N), constraining diversity consistently signifies the rate at which TTS
produces unsafe results. The effect is often stronger than that produced by
prompts directly with high adversarial intent scores. This observed phenomenon
also transfers across TTS strategies and to closed-source models (e.g. OpenAI
o3 and Gemini-2.5-Pro), thus indicating that this is a general and extant
property of TTS rather than a model-specific artifact. Additionally, we find
that numerous widely used safety guardrail classifiers (e.g. Llama-Guard and
OpenAI Moderation API), are unable to flag the adversarial input prompts
generated by RefDiv, demonstrating that existing defenses offer limited
protection against this diversity-driven failure mode. Through this work, we
hope to motivate future research on designing robust TTS strategies that are
both effective and secure against diversity-targeted stress tests as
illustrated by RefDiv.

### [44] [Hierarchical Self-Supervised Representation Learning for Depression Detection from Speech](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08593)
*Yuxin Li,Eng Siong Chng,Cuntai Guan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces HAREN-CTC, an advanced model for speech-based depression detection that excels in handling sparse and subtle depressive speech cues, achieving state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing speech-based depression detection methods struggle to extract meaningful features and capture irregular, sparse cues effectively. Pretrained self-supervised models like WavLM offer rich data, but current approaches fail to fully utilize the hierarchical speech representations.

Method: The proposed HAREN-CTC integrates multi-layer SSL features using cross-attention within a multitask learning framework and introduces a Hierarchical Adaptive Clustering module and a Cross-Modal Fusion module. Temporal patterns are modeled via Connectionist Temporal Classification loss.

Result: HAREN-CTC demonstrates state-of-the-art performance with macro F1-scores of 0.81 on the DAIC-WOZ dataset and 0.82 on the MODMA dataset, outperforming previous methods in both standard and generalization settings.

Conclusion: HAREN-CTC effectively leverages hierarchical speech representations and models sparse temporal patterns, offering a significant advancement in depression detection through speech. The proposed architecture considerably enhances performance and generalization.

Abstract: Speech-based depression detection (SDD) is a promising, non-invasive
alternative to traditional clinical assessments. However, it remains limited by
the difficulty of extracting meaningful features and capturing sparse,
heterogeneous depressive cues over time. Pretrained self-supervised learning
(SSL) models such as WavLM provide rich, multi-layer speech representations,
yet most existing SDD methods rely only on the final layer or search for a
single best-performing one. These approaches often overfit to specific datasets
and fail to leverage the full hierarchical structure needed to detect subtle
and persistent depression signals.
  To address this challenge, we propose HAREN-CTC, a novel architecture that
integrates multi-layer SSL features using cross-attention within a multitask
learning framework, combined with Connectionist Temporal Classification loss to
handle sparse temporal supervision. HAREN-CTC comprises two key modules: a
Hierarchical Adaptive Clustering module that reorganizes SSL features into
complementary embeddings, and a Cross-Modal Fusion module that models
inter-layer dependencies through cross-attention. The CTC objective enables
alignment-aware training, allowing the model to track irregular temporal
patterns of depressive speech cues.
  We evaluate HAREN-CTC under both an upper-bound setting with standard data
splits and a generalization setting using five-fold cross-validation. The model
achieves state-of-the-art macro F1-scores of 0.81 on DAIC-WOZ and 0.82 on
MODMA, outperforming prior methods across both evaluation scenarios.

*V. S. Raghu Parupudi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a framework to assess mathematical reasoning in AI, showing that models excel in sequential tasks but struggle with combinatorial reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To measure and diagnose specific failure points in machine learning models' mathematical reasoning capabilities.

Method: Generated reasoning outputs from GPT-3.5-turbo on GSM8K, analyzed errors using GPT-4o-mini, and clustered reasoning sentences into 'reasoning modes.'

Result: AI models excel in procedural reasoning but demonstrate significant weaknesses in combinatorial reasoning with restrictions.

Conclusion: The framework provides granular insights into AI mathematical reasoning, paving the way for improved capabilities and applications.

Abstract: A central question in artificial intelligence is the extent to which machine
learning models comprehend mathematics. To address this, we propose a novel
framework for measuring mathematical reasoning that moves beyond standard
benchmarks to diagnose specific failure points. Our method first generates
structured, step-by-step reasoning from gpt-3.5-turbo on the GSM8K dataset. We
then use a more capable analyst model, gpt-4o-mini, to categorize errors and,
crucially, perform an unsupervised clustering of every reasoning sentence to
identify emergent "reasoning modes." This analysis reveals a cognitive profile
with a stark, nonhuman-like brittleness: while the model achieves near-perfect
accuracy on procedural modes like sequential calculation, its performance on
modes requiring combinatorial reasoning with restrictions plummets. By
identifying and quantifying the reliability of these distinct reasoning skills,
our work provides a more granular method to evaluate mathematical comprehension
and offers a precise roadmap for developing new capabilities and more reliable
future applications.

### [46] [Confidence, Not Perplexity: A Better Metric for the Creative Era of LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08596)
*V. S. Raghu Parupudi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces the Confidence Score (CS) as a metric to address biases in evaluating creative text generation, outperforming reference-free metrics like self-perplexity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional reference-free metrics such as self-perplexity are heavily biased against creative text generation, creating the need for a more balanced evaluation method.

Method: The paper proposes the Confidence Score (CS), derived from a model's output probability distribution, and tests it using gpt-4o-mini on 99 creative prompts.

Result: CS preferred novel responses in 19% of cases compared to 0% for fluency-based metrics, with statistically significant results; it also distinguishes tasks by difficulty based on confidence intervals.

Conclusion: CS reduces creativity bias in text evaluation, offering a balanced metric that retains the strengths of traditional methods for assessing modern LLMs.

Abstract: Reference-free metrics like self-perplexity are strongly biased against
creative text generation. We propose the Confidence Score (CS), derived from a
model's output probability distribution, as a less biased alternative.
Experiments on gpt-4o-mini show that while fluency-based metrics prefer novel
responses in 0\% of cases on 99 creative prompts, our CS does so 19% of the
time, a statistically significant difference (95% CI for difference: [11.1%,
27.3%]). We also show that CS effectively distinguishes between easy, medium,
and hard tasks, confirmed by non-overlapping confidence intervals. The
Confidence Score thus mitigates the creativity bias of traditional metrics
while retaining their core evaluative strengths, offering a more balanced
assessment for modern LLMs.

*Devleena Das,Rajeev Patwari,Ashish Sirasao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces 'Recover-LoRA,' a method to recover performance degradations in small language models affected by suboptimal optimizations like quantization or serialization by utilizing synthetic data and logit distillation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is driven by the need to address functional degradations in language models caused by certain optimization techniques and improper model serialization, which can negatively impact their accuracy.

Method: Recover-LoRA employs synthetic data and logit distillation, training LoRA adapters on selective layers to align degraded models with their full precision counterparts.

Result: The proposed method achieves performance recovery of 5-17% on small language models with varying attention architectures, including multi-head attention (MHA) and group-query attention (GQA).

Conclusion: Recover-LoRA is effective in recovering accuracy for degraded small language models irrespective of the source of degradation, offering a lightweight and dataset-agnostic solution.

Abstract: Inference optimizations such as quantization, pruning, format and datatype
conversion, model export, and serialization can lead to functional degradations
in language model task performance. While most efforts on performance recovery
for deployment focus on robust quantization techniques, we focus on recovering
model accuracies from any sources that degrade model weights, such as improper
model serialization. In this work, we propose Recover-LoRA, a lightweight and
dataset agnostic method to recover accuracy in degraded models. Recover-LoRA
uses synthetic data and logit distillation to learn LoRA adapters on selective
layers that facilitate aligning the degraded model to its full precision model.
We investigate the utility of Recover-LoRA across a diverse set of small
language models (SLMs), including models with varying attention architectures,
multi-head attention (MHA) and group-query attention (GQA), as well as several
evaluation datasets. Our results show that Recover-LoRA recovers model
accuracies by 5-17% on MHA and GQA SLMs.

### [48] [Mnemosyne: An Unsupervised, Human-Inspired Long-Term Memory Architecture for Edge-Based LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08601)
*Aneesh Jonelagadda,Christina Hahn,Haoze Zheng,Salvatore Penachio*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces Mnemosyne, an unsupervised long-term memory architecture inspired by human memory, designed specifically for edge-based large language models (LLMs).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current long-term memory systems for LLMs either expand context inefficiently or rely on static retrieval methods unsuitable for edge-constrained devices, necessitating a new approach for memory systems with human-like realism.

Method: Mnemosyne integrates graph-based storage, modular redundancy filters, memory pruning, probabilistic recall, and core summaries derived from a subset of the memory graph, all modeled after human memory processes.

Result: Experiments on healthcare dialogues show Mnemosyne achieves the highest realism evaluation win rate of 65.8%, outperforms other methods on temporal reasoning benchmarks, and maintains competitive overall scores.

Conclusion: Mnemosyne proves to be an efficient, realistic, and edge-compatible memory architecture, showcasing enhanced recall, reasoning, and user-facing interactions in long-term conversational systems.

Abstract: Long-term memory is essential for natural, realistic dialogue. However,
current large language model (LLM) memory systems rely on either brute-force
context expansion or static retrieval pipelines that fail on edge-constrained
devices. We introduce Mnemosyne, an unsupervised, human-inspired long-term
memory architecture designed for edge-based LLMs. Our approach uses
graph-structured storage, modular substance and redundancy filters, memory
committing and pruning mechanisms, and probabilistic recall with temporal decay
and refresh processes modeled after human memory. Mnemosyne also introduces a
concentrated "core summary" efficiently derived from a fixed-length subset of
the memory graph to capture the user's personality and other domain-specific
long-term details such as, using healthcare application as an example,
post-recovery ambitions and attitude towards care. Unlike existing
retrieval-augmented methods, Mnemosyne is designed for use in longitudinal
healthcare assistants, where repetitive and semantically similar but temporally
distinct conversations are limited by naive retrieval. In experiments with
longitudinal healthcare dialogues, Mnemosyne demonstrates the highest win rate
of 65.8% in blind human evaluations of realism and long-term memory capability
compared to a baseline RAG win rate of 31.1%. Mnemosyne also achieves current
highest LoCoMo benchmark scores in temporal reasoning and single-hop retrieval
compared to other same-backboned techniques. Further, the average overall score
of 54.6% was second highest across all methods, beating commonly used Mem0 and
OpenAI baselines among others. This demonstrates that improved factual recall,
enhanced temporal reasoning, and much more natural user-facing responses can be
feasible with an edge-compatible and easily transferable unsupervised memory
architecture.

*Cong Zeng,Shengkun Tang,Yuanzhou Chen,Zhiqiang Shen,Wenchao Yu,Xujiang Zhao,Haifeng Chen,Wei Cheng,Zhiqiang Xu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper redefines the detection of AI-generated text as an out-of-distribution (OOD) detection problem, showing improved robustness and generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of prior binary classifiers in distinguishing AI-generated text from human-authored text, which fail to generalize across models and domains due to an inaccurate assumption about the uniformity of human-authored texts.

Method: Reframing the detection task as an OOD problem, treating machine-generated text as in-distribution and human-authored text as out-of-distribution. Utilizes one-class learning (DeepSVDD, HRN) and score-based techniques (energy-based methods) for robust detection.

Result: Demonstrates strong performance with 98.3% AUROC and AUPR, as well as 8.9% FPR95 on the DeepFake dataset. Framework also proves effective on multilingual, attacked, and unseen data settings.

Conclusion: Reframing detection as an OOD problem enables improved robustness and generalization, outperforming prior binary classifiers. Code, pretrained models, and demos will be provided.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT,
DeepSeek, and Claude has significantly increased the presence of AI-generated
text in digital communication. This trend has heightened the need for reliable
detection methods to distinguish between human-authored and machine-generated
content. Existing approaches both zero-shot methods and supervised classifiers
largely conceptualize this task as a binary classification problem, often
leading to poor generalization across domains and models. In this paper, we
argue that such a binary formulation fundamentally mischaracterizes the
detection task by assuming a coherent representation of human-written texts. In
reality, human texts do not constitute a unified distribution, and their
diversity cannot be effectively captured through limited sampling. This causes
previous classifiers to memorize observed OOD characteristics rather than learn
the essence of `non-ID' behavior, limiting generalization to unseen
human-authored inputs. Based on this observation, we propose reframing the
detection task as an out-of-distribution (OOD) detection problem, treating
human-written texts as distributional outliers while machine-generated texts
are in-distribution (ID) samples. To this end, we develop a detection framework
using one-class learning method including DeepSVDD and HRN, and score-based
learning techniques such as energy-based method, enabling robust and
generalizable performance. Extensive experiments across multiple datasets
validate the effectiveness of our OOD-based approach. Specifically, the
OOD-based method achieves 98.3% AUROC and AUPR with only 8.9% FPR95 on DeepFake
dataset. Moreover, we test our detection framework on multilingual, attacked,
and unseen-model and -domain text settings, demonstrating the robustness and
generalizability of our framework. Code, pretrained weights, and demo will be
released.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces YpathRAG, a pathology-specific retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) framework that enhances factual reliability and retrieval performance in pathology through hybrid retrieval and evidence-grounded judgment modules.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs struggle with hallucinations and often lack precise knowledge in high-barrier domains like pathology. Existing solutions using fine-tuning do not address the expansion of knowledge nor enforce evidence-grounded constraints.

Method: The authors developed a pathology-specific vector database and introduced YpathRAG, which integrates dual-channel hybrid retrieval (dense + sparse) and a supportive-evidence judgment module into the retrieval-generation workflow. They also created two evaluation benchmarks for assessment.

Result: YpathRAG demonstrated Recall@5 of 98.64% on the YpathR benchmark, surpassing the baseline by 23 percentage points. On challenging questions in the YpathQA-M benchmark, it improved LLM accuracies by an average of 9.0% and up to 15.6%.

Conclusion: YpathRAG offers scalable, evidence-grounded solutions for pathology-oriented RAG, enhancing retrieval accuracy and the factual reliability of LLMs in this domain.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel on general tasks yet still hallucinate in
high-barrier domains such as pathology. Prior work often relies on domain
fine-tuning, which neither expands the knowledge boundary nor enforces
evidence-grounded constraints. We therefore build a pathology vector database
covering 28 subfields and 1.53 million paragraphs, and present YpathRAG, a
pathology-oriented RAG framework with dual-channel hybrid retrieval (BGE-M3
dense retrieval coupled with vocabulary-guided sparse retrieval) and an
LLM-based supportive-evidence judgment module that closes the
retrieval-judgment-generation loop. We also release two evaluation benchmarks,
YpathR and YpathQA-M. On YpathR, YpathRAG attains Recall@5 of 98.64%, a gain of
23 percentage points over the baseline; on YpathQA-M, a set of the 300 most
challenging questions, it increases the accuracies of both general and medical
LLMs by 9.0% on average and up to 15.6%. These results demonstrate improved
retrieval quality and factual reliability, providing a scalable construction
paradigm and interpretable evaluation for pathology-oriented RAG.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces "LatentBreak," a refined adversarial method for bypassing AI safeguards in language models using semantically-altered but natural prompts, which avoid detection by perplexity-based filters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations of existing jailbreak mechanisms, which can be detected through perplexity filtering, and to craft adversarial attacks that are undetectable but effective.

Method: The proposed LatentBreak method substitutes words in input prompts with semantically equivalent alternatives to maintain naturalness and intent, while minimizing the latent space distance between adversarial and harmless prompts.

Result: LatentBreak generates shorter, more natural adversarial prompts with low perplexity, evading the detection by perplexity-based filters and showing superior performance compared to other jailbreak attacks.

Conclusion: LatentBreak demonstrates that it's possible to design stealthy and effective adversarial attacks that bypass safety mechanisms in LLMs, challenging the reliability of perplexity-based defenses.

Abstract: Jailbreaks are adversarial attacks designed to bypass the built-in safety
mechanisms of large language models. Automated jailbreaks typically optimize an
adversarial suffix or adapt long prompt templates by forcing the model to
generate the initial part of a restricted or harmful response. In this work, we
show that existing jailbreak attacks that leverage such mechanisms to unlock
the model response can be detected by a straightforward perplexity-based
filtering on the input prompt. To overcome this issue, we propose LatentBreak,
a white-box jailbreak attack that generates natural adversarial prompts with
low perplexity capable of evading such defenses. LatentBreak substitutes words
in the input prompt with semantically-equivalent ones, preserving the initial
intent of the prompt, instead of adding high-perplexity adversarial suffixes or
long templates. These words are chosen by minimizing the distance in the latent
space between the representation of the adversarial prompt and that of harmless
requests. Our extensive evaluation shows that LatentBreak leads to shorter and
low-perplexity prompts, thus outperforming competing jailbreak algorithms
against perplexity-based filters on multiple safety-aligned models.

Motivation: The rapid spread of misinformation on digital platforms harms public discourse, emotional stability, and decision-making, necessitating improvements in misinformation detection approaches.

Method: The authors systematically examined transformations such as language-switching, query length inflation, and structural reformatting, alongside implementing a multilingual, multi-agent large language model framework with retrieval-augmented generation.

Result: The framework demonstrated the capability to detect misinformation across multiple languages and transformation types, highlighting the importance of AI in maintaining online factual integrity.

Conclusion: The study emphasizes the practicality and effectiveness of deploying AI-driven misinformation detection mechanisms as plugins for real-world web applications to counter diverse adversarial attacks.

Abstract: The rapid spread of misinformation on digital platforms threatens public
discourse, emotional stability, and decision-making. While prior work has
explored various adversarial attacks in misinformation detection, the specific
transformations examined in this paper have not been systematically studied. In
particular, we investigate language-switching across English, French, Spanish,

that can be deployed as a web plugin into online platforms. Our work
underscores the importance of AI-driven misinformation detection in
safeguarding online factual integrity against diverse attacks, while showcasing
the feasibility of plugin-based deployment for real-world web applications.

TL;DR: This paper introduces a hotspot-centric approach to improve Emotion Recognition in Conversations (ERC), emphasizing localized and asynchronous evidence across different modalities (text, audio, video).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ERC is challenging due to sparse, localized, and asynchronous discriminative evidence in multimodal data.

Method: The authors propose a unified model utilizing per-utterance emotion hotspots, Hotspot-Gated Fusion for integrating hotspots with global features, a routed Mixture-of-Aligners for cross-modal alignment, and a cross-modal graph to encode conversational structure.

Result: Experiments on standard ERC benchmarks demonstrate consistent performance improvements over strong baselines, supported by ablation studies that highlight the contributions of the introduced methods.

Conclusion: The hotspot-centric approach improves modality fusion and ERC performance, opening new directions for multimodal learning and focusing on salient spans and misalignment solutions.

Abstract: Emotion Recognition in Conversations (ERC) is hard because discriminative
evidence is sparse, localized, and often asynchronous across modalities. We
center ERC on emotion hotspots and present a unified model that detects
per-utterance hotspots in text, audio, and video, fuses them with global
features via Hotspot-Gated Fusion, and aligns modalities using a routed
Mixture-of-Aligners; a cross-modal graph encodes conversational structure. This
design focuses modeling on salient spans, mitigates misalignment, and preserves
context. Experiments on standard ERC benchmarks show consistent gains over
strong baselines, with ablations confirming the contributions of HGF and MoA.
Our results point to a hotspot-centric view that can inform future multimodal
learning, offering a new perspective on modality fusion in ERC.

TL;DR: The paper introduces MMA-ASIA, a framework for evaluating cultural awareness in LLMs, particularly in Asian settings, through a unique multimodal multilingual benchmark.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the degradation in multimodal understanding and reasoning of LLMs outside of Western, high-resource settings, especially in Asian cultural contexts.

Method: The authors developed a multilingual, multimodal benchmark with 27,000 questions across 8 countries and 10 languages, focusing on cultural context and reasoning. They proposed a five-dimensional evaluation protocol and introduced a Cultural Awareness Grounding Validation Module for robust assessment.

Result: MMA-ASIA enables the analysis of cross-lingual and cross-modal disparities, provides insights into models' cultural reasoning, and identifies challenges in achieving cultural reliability in multimodal LLMs.

Conclusion: The research provides a novel dataset and evaluation framework capable of advancing the cultural reliability of multimodal LLMs, particularly within under-represented Asian contexts.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are now used worldwide, yet their multimodal
understanding and reasoning often degrade outside Western, high-resource
settings. We propose MMA-ASIA, a comprehensive framework to evaluate LLMs'
cultural awareness with a focus on Asian contexts. MMA-ASIA centers on a
human-curated, multilingual, and multimodally aligned multiple-choice benchmark
covering 8 Asian countries and 10 languages, comprising 27,000 questions; over
79 percent require multi-step reasoning grounded in cultural context, moving
beyond simple memorization. To our knowledge, this is the first dataset aligned
at the input level across three modalities: text, image (visual question
answering), and speech. This enables direct tests of cross-modal transfer.
Building on this benchmark, we propose a five-dimensional evaluation protocol
that measures: (i) cultural-awareness disparities across countries, (ii)
cross-lingual consistency, (iii) cross-modal consistency, (iv) cultural
knowledge generalization, and (v) grounding validity. To ensure rigorous
assessment, a Cultural Awareness Grounding Validation Module detects "shortcut
learning" by checking whether the requisite cultural knowledge supports correct
answers. Finally, through comparative model analysis, attention tracing, and an
innovative Vision-ablated Prefix Replay (VPR) method, we probe why models
diverge across languages and modalities, offering actionable insights for
building culturally reliable multimodal LLMs.

TL;DR: The paper introduces GraphGhost, a framework that uses graph representations of neuron activations to analyze reasoning mechanisms in LLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To better understand the structural mechanisms underlying the reasoning capabilities of LLMs, which remain underexplored.

Method: The authors represent neuron activations and signal propagation as graphs, employing algorithms like PageRank and structural interventions to analyze reasoning processes.

Result: The framework reveals shared and model-specific reasoning behaviors in LLMs and demonstrates that altering key neurons disrupts reasoning and semantic understanding.

Conclusion: GraphGhost provides valuable insights into the structural basis of reasoning in LLMs, offering tools for analysis and intervention.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate remarkable reasoning capabilities,
yet the structural mechanisms underlying these abilities remain under explored.
In this work, we introduce GraphGhost, a unified framework that represents
neuron activations and their signal propagation as graphs, explaining how LLMs
capture structural semantics from sequential inputs and generate outputs
through structurally consistent mechanisms. This graph-based perspective
enables us to employ graph algorithms such as PageRank to characterize the
properties of LLMs, revealing both shared and model-specific reasoning
behaviors across diverse datasets. We further identify the activated neurons
within GraphGhost and evaluate them through structural interventions, showing
that edits to key neuron nodes can trigger reasoning collapse, altering both
logical flow and semantic understanding. Together, these contributions position
GraphGhost as a powerful tool for analyzing, intervening in, and ultimately
understanding the structural foundations of reasoning in LLMs.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This study highlights gender biases in Large Language Models (LLMs) used in healthcare, showing inconsistencies in patient gender relevance, with models sometimes systematically favoring one gender.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper seeks to address concerns about biases within LLMs in their healthcare applications, particularly related to gender, which could impact their reliability in clinical decision-making.

Method: Researchers evaluated different LLMs using clinical case studies, assigning different genders to the models and analyzing their response consistency in diagnoses and gender relevance.

Result: Diagnoses were broadly consistent across LLM genders, but responses about the necessity of patient gender in diagnoses showed significant inconsistencies and biases across all models.

Conclusion: The study reveals potential gender-related biases in LLMs that could compromise their use in healthcare, emphasizing the importance of consistent checks to ensure fairness and reliability.

Abstract: The integration of large language models (LLMs) into healthcare holds promise
to enhance clinical decision-making, yet their susceptibility to biases remains
a critical concern. Gender has long influenced physician behaviors and patient
outcomes, raising concerns that LLMs assuming human-like roles, such as
clinicians or medical educators, may replicate or amplify gender-related
biases. Using case studies from the New England Journal of Medicine Challenge
(NEJM), we assigned genders (female, male, or unspecified) to multiple
open-source and proprietary LLMs. We evaluated their response consistency
across LLM-gender assignments regarding both LLM-based diagnosis and models'
judgments on the clinical relevance or necessity of patient gender. In our
findings, diagnoses were relatively consistent across LLM genders for most
models. However, for patient gender's relevance and necessity in LLM-based
diagnosis, all models demonstrated substantial inconsistency across LLM
genders, particularly for relevance judgements. Some models even displayed a
systematic female-male disparity in their interpretation of patient gender.
These findings present an underexplored bias that could undermine the
reliability of LLMs in clinical practice, underscoring the need for routine
checks of identity-assignment consistency when interacting with LLMs to ensure
reliable and equitable AI-supported clinical care.

Motivation: Existing math word problem datasets often lack distracting conditions, making them less effective for evaluating LLM reasoning capabilities in complex scenarios.

Method: The researchers designed an iterative framework leveraging LLMs with specialized prompts to generate meaningful distracting conditions for MWPs while preserving the original solutions.

Result: The framework efficiently produces high-quality MWPs with distracting conditions and maintains shared solutions, significantly reducing manual effort.

Conclusion: This approach enhances the reliability and challenge of MWP datasets, improving their utility as benchmarks for assessing LLM intelligence.

Abstract: Mathematical reasoning serves as a crucial testbed for evaluating the
intelligence of large language models (LLMs), and math word problems (MWPs)
represent one of the most widely used formats. Most existing MWP datasets
contain only the necessary information, while problems with distracting or
excessive conditions are often overlooked. Prior studies have shown that
popular LLMs experience a dramatic performance drop when such distracting
conditions are introduced. However, available datasets of MWPs with distracting
conditions remain limited, and most exhibit low difficulty and out-of-context
expressions. These shortcomings make the distracting conditions easy to detect
and disregard, thereby reducing the credibility of benchmarking on these
datasets. Moreover, when distracting conditions are added, the reasoning
process and answers may change, requiring intensive manual effort to check and
rewrite solutions.
  To address these issues, we design an iterative framework that leverages LLMs
to generate distracting conditions automatically. We develop a set of prompts
to revise MWPs from multiple perspectives and cognitive levels, encouraging the
creation of meaningful distracting conditions as well as suggestions for
further refinement. A key advantage of our framework is the preservation of
shared solutions between the original and revised problems: the LLMs are
explicitly guided to generate distractions that do not alter the original
solution, thus eliminating the need to produce new answers. This framework is
efficient and easy to deploy, substantially reducing the effort required to
generate MWPs with distracting conditions while maintaining high data quality.

### [58] [LLMs Show Surface-Form Brittleness Under Paraphrase Stress Tests](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08616)
*Juan Miguel Navarro Carranza*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study evaluates how paraphrased benchmark questions affect accuracy in Large Language Models (LLMs), revealing significant drops in performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address concerns about inflated benchmark scores in LLMs caused by memorization or exposure to duplicates.

Method: Developed and applied a protocol to test LLMs (Mistral-7B-Instruct and Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct) on paraphrased versions of benchmark questions. Controlled decoding, enforced output format, and conducted paraphrase-cleaning steps.

Result: Observed non-trivial accuracy drops when LLMs were tested on paraphrased items compared to original ones.

Conclusion: Paraphrasing benchmarks reveal limitations in LLM generalization abilities, supporting concerns about contamination and reliance on surface-form patterns.

Abstract: Benchmark scores for Large Language Models (LLMs) can be inflated by
memorization of test items or near duplicates. We present a simple, protocol
that probes generalization by re-evaluating models on paraphrased versions of
benchmark questions. Using Mistral-7B-Instruct and Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct, we
measure the accuracy gap between original and paraphrased items on ARC-Easy and
ARC-Challenge. Our pipeline controls decoding, enforces multiple-choice output
format, and includes a robust paraphrase-cleaning step to preserve semantics.
We find that paraphrasing induces a non-trivial accuracy drop (original vs.
paraphrased), consistent with prior concerns about contamination and brittle
surface-form shortcuts.

### [59] [JAI-1: A Thai-Centric Large Language Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08620)
*Attapol T. Rutherford,Jullajak Karnjanaekarin,Narongkorn Panitsrisit,Pontakorn Trakuekul,Sumana Sumanakul,Natchanon Pollertlam*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: JAI-1 is a Thai-centric language model with 75B parameters, designed using an upscaling strategy to preserve general intelligence while integrating extensive Thai-language knowledge.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Recent Thai models risk losing general knowledge during specialization for Thai language due to conflicts in optimized parameters.

Method: The model uses an upscaling approach by expanding a smaller English LLM's parameter space, integrating 1.5T tokens (300B Thai tokens), followed by supervised fine-tuning and alignment tuning.

Result: JAI-1 outperformed Typhoon2-70B on Thai-centric benchmarks, showcasing its effective integration of Thai-specific knowledge.

Conclusion: The innovative upscaling method preserves general intelligence and enables scalable improvements, establishing JAI-1 as a robust model for Thai language tasks.

Abstract: This technical report introduces JAI-1, a Thai-centric language model with
75B parameters. Recent Thai models have primarily relied on existing
open-source models, applying additional training without structural
modifications to specialize in Thai. However, this approach risks eroding
pre-existing knowledge in the model's parameter space during the injection of
Thai-specific information, as optimized parameters for general tasks may
conflict with new linguistic requirements. In contrast, JAI-1 adopts an
upscaling strategy: starting from a smaller, high-performing English
open-source LLM, we expanded its parameter space and utilized the newly
allocated capacity to systematically integrate Thai-language knowledge. This
methodology not only preserves the original model's general intelligence but
also establishes a unique architecture distinct from other open-source models,
enabling scalable future enhancements. During pre-training, JAI-1 was exposed
to 1.5T tokens, including over 300B Thai language tokens. This was followed by
post-training stages -- supervised fine-tuning and alignment tuning -- using
more than 600K instruction-based examples. The final model demonstrated
superior performance compared to Typhoon2-70B on Thai-centric benchmarks
(IFEval-TH, MT-Bench-TH, and JAI-Hall-Bench), validating the efficacy of its
upscaling and knowledge-integration framework.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces an occupation-conditioned strategy for sales agents to optimize conversations based on user profiles, leading to shorter and more successful dialogues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance sales dialogue systems by adapting strategies based on user profiles like age, gender, and occupation with a focus on realistic simulator studies.

Method: Develop a lightweight strategy leveraging occupation-conditioned dialogue intents, guided by user simulator profiles, to optimize conversation dynamics.

Result: Occupation significantly impacts conversational intent, and the introduced strategy aligns agent behavior with user preferences for more effective dialogues.

Conclusion: Rich simulator profiles combined with simple persona-informed strategies can improve the functionality and success rate of sales-oriented dialogue systems.

Abstract: Amid the rapid rise of agentic dialogue models, realistic user-simulator
studies are essential for tuning effective conversation strategies. This work
investigates a sales-oriented agent that adapts its dialogue based on user
profiles spanning age, gender, and occupation. While age and gender influence
overall performance, occupation produces the most pronounced differences in
conversational intent. Leveraging this insight, we introduce a lightweight,
occupation-conditioned strategy that guides the agent to prioritize intents
aligned with user preferences, resulting in shorter and more successful
dialogues. Our findings highlight the importance of rich simulator profiles and
demonstrate how simple persona-informed strategies can enhance the
effectiveness of sales-oriented dialogue systems.

### [61] [Text2Stories: Evaluating the Alignment Between Stakeholder Interviews and Generated User Stories](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08622)
*Francesco Dente,Fabiano Dalpiaz,Paolo Papotti*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A method called Text2Stories is introduced to evaluate alignment between elicitation interview transcripts and generated user stories for software requirements, using metrics of correctness and completeness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the challenge of evaluating whether software requirements automatically derived from elicitation interviews truly reflect stakeholders‚Äô needs.

Method: The approach involves segmenting the elicitation transcript into text chunks and aligning them with user stories using metrics such as correctness (proportion of supported stories) and completeness (proportion of supported transcript chunks), implemented as a matching problem.

Result: Experiments across four datasets show that using a large language model-based matcher, Text2Stories achieves 0.86 macro-F1, outperforming embedding models while retaining their utility for blocking.

Conclusion: Text2Stories provides scalable and source-faithful metrics for comparing sets of user stories, bridging gaps in automated requirement validation and enhancing user-story quality criteria.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) can be employed for automating the generation of
software requirements from natural language inputs such as the transcripts of
elicitation interviews. However, evaluating whether those derived requirements
faithfully reflect the stakeholders' needs remains a largely manual task. We
introduce Text2Stories, a task and metrics for text-to-story alignment that
allow quantifying the extent to which requirements (in the form of user
stories) match the actual needs expressed by the elicitation session
participants. Given an interview transcript and a set of user stories, our
metric quantifies (i) correctness: the proportion of stories supported by the
transcript, and (ii) completeness: the proportion of transcript supported by at
least one story. We segment the transcript into text chunks and instantiate the
alignment as a matching problem between chunks and stories. Experiments over
four datasets show that an LLM-based matcher achieves 0.86 macro-F1 on held-out
annotations, while embedding models alone remain behind but enable effective
blocking. Finally, we show how our metrics enable the comparison across sets of
stories (e.g., human vs. generated), positioning Text2Stories as a scalable,
source-faithful complement to existing user-story quality criteria.

### [62] [PARSE: LLM Driven Schema Optimization for Reliable Entity Extraction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08623)
*Anubhav Shrimal,Aryan Jain,Soumyajit Chowdhury,Promod Yenigalla*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces PARSE, a system to improve structured information extraction from unstructured text, leveraging enhanced JSON schemas optimized for LLMs and reflection-based methodologies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods treat JSON schemas as static tools for human developers, which limits their adaptability, especially when schemas are ambiguous or incomplete.

Method: The proposed system, PARSE, includes two components: ARCHITECT, which autonomously refines JSON schemas, and SCOPE, which enhances extraction reliability through reflection-based techniques with combined static and dynamic guardrails.

Result: PARSE achieved significant improvements, including a 64.7% increase in extraction accuracy on SWDE datasets, a 10% framework-wide model improvement, and a 92% reduction in extraction errors upon first retry.

Conclusion: PARSE demonstrates that optimizing JSON schemas for LLM consumption and integrating reflection-based guardrails greatly enhances extraction reliability and accuracy, paving the way for more adaptive and precise Software 3.0 systems.

Abstract: Structured information extraction from unstructured text is critical for
emerging Software 3.0 systems where LLM agents autonomously interact with APIs
and tools. Recent approaches apply large language models directly to extraction
tasks using existing JSON schemas, often with constraint decoding or
reinforcement learning approaches to ensure syntactic validity, but treat JSON
schemas as static contracts designed for human developers, leading to
suboptimal extraction performance, frequent hallucinations, and unreliable
agent behavior when schemas contain ambiguous or incomplete specifications. We
recognize that JSON schemas themselves are a form of natural language
understanding contract that encodes rules, relationships, and expectations
about data structure contracts that LLMs should be able to both interpret and
systematically improve. Consequently, we develop PARSE (Parameter Automated
Refinement and Schema Extraction), a novel system with two synergistic
components: ARCHITECT, which autonomously optimizes JSON schemas for LLM
consumption while maintaining backward compatibility through RELAY (an
integrated code generation system), and SCOPE, which implements
reflection-based extraction with combined static and LLM-based guardrails. We
evaluate PARSE qualitatively and quantitatively on three datasets including
Schema-Guided Dialogue (SGD), Structured Web Data Extraction (SWDE), and
internal retail conversation data, and find that it achieves up to 64.7%
improvement in extraction accuracy on SWDE with combined framework improvements
reaching 10% across models, while reducing extraction errors by 92% within the
first retry and and maintaining practical latency.

### [63] [Do LLMs Know They Are Being Tested? Evaluation Awareness and Incentive-Sensitive Failures in GPT-OSS-20B](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08624)
*Nisar Ahmed,Muhammad Imran Zaman,Gulshan Saleem,Ali Hassan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper examines how the framing of evaluation benchmarks for large language models (LLMs) can inflate their perceived performance, focusing on real-world deployment needs versus evaluation prompts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand if benchmarks relying on evaluation-oriented prompts unfairly inflate LLM performance and do not translate to real-world application capabilities.

Method: The study used a single model (GPT-OSS-20B) across six paired A/B scenarios, comparing evaluation-oriented prompts with real-world framing for accuracy, compliance, and structured outputs.

Result: Evaluation framing inflated chain-of-thought reasoning and decreased concise compliance, with inconsistent accuracy gains. Structured outputs improved formatting but not substantive correctness. Wording incentives influenced error types, and multilingual cases posed parity risks.

Conclusion: Careful prompt framing, neutral wording, and multilingual testing are necessary to ensure benchmarks reflect actual deployable capabilities and not inflated scores due to evaluation-designed prompts.

Abstract: Benchmarks for large language models (LLMs) often rely on rubric-scented
prompts that request visible reasoning and strict formatting, whereas real
deployments demand terse, contract-bound answers. We investigate whether such
"evaluation scent" inflates measured performance without commensurate
capability gains. Using a single open-weights model (GPT-OSS-20B), we run six
paired A/B scenarios that hold task content and decoding fixed while varying
framing (evaluation-oriented vs. real-world) and reasoning depth (Medium/High):
deterministic math, strict code-fix, citation generation, incentive flips
(caution vs. competence), CoT visibility, and multilingual (Urdu) headers.
Deterministic validators compute accuracy, answer-only compliance,
hedging/refusals, chain-of-thought (CoT) length, and schema compliance, with
pre-registered deltas and composite indices. Across scenarios, evaluation
framing reliably inflates CoT (hundreds to >1000 characters) and reduces
answer-only compliance, with limited or inconsistent accuracy gains. In
structured outputs, it improves wrappers (e.g., fenced blocks, enumerated
lists) but not regex-validated substance. Incentive wording reweights error
composition: praising caution modestly improves accuracy at high reasoning and
reduces wrong-but-confident errors, whereas praising competence yields terser
but riskier outputs. Urdu rubric headers reproduce these signatures and can
decrease accuracy at higher reasoning depth, indicating multilingual parity
risks. We provide a reproducible A/B framework (prompt banks, validators,
per-run scores, scripts; versioned DOI) and practical guidance: neutral
phrasing or dual-framing checks, contract-aware grading, style-delta reporting,
confidence governance, and multilingual dashboards to ensure that benchmark
gains reflect deployable capability.

### [64] [From What to Why: Thought-Space Recommendation with Small Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08626)
*Prosenjit Biswas,Pervez Shaik,Abhinav Thorat,Ravi Kolla,Niranjan Pedanekar*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a framework called PULSE using Small Language Models (SLMs) to enhance recommendation systems by treating rationales as primary learning signals.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve recommendation systems by leveraging the reasoning potentials of Small Language Models (SLMs), which are efficient but underexplored, especially in handling user preferences.

Method: The PULSE framework employs SLM-generated rationales supervised with interaction histories, focusing on users' actions and motivations to create robust embeddings.

Result: PULSE outperforms existing ID, Collaborative Filtering, and LLM-based models in multiple benchmarks, excelling in cross-domain recommendations and reasoning-oriented tasks.

Conclusion: PULSE leverages SLMs effectively, making recommendation systems more robust, generalizable, and efficient, while demonstrating its potential in various applications.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have advanced recommendation capabilities
through enhanced reasoning, but pose significant challenges for real-world
deployment due to high inference costs. Conversely, while Small Language Models
(SLMs) offer an efficient alternative, their reasoning capabilities for
recommendation remain underexplored. Existing systems often use natural
language rationales merely as unsupervised descriptive text, failing to harness
their full potential as learning signals. In this work our main idea is to
create a common understanding of user and items across multiple domains called
Thought Space with SLMs instead of using LLMs' distilled knowledge. To that end
we propose PULSE (Preference Understanding by Latent Semantic Embeddings), a
framework that treats SLM-generated rationales as director learning signals,
supervising them with interaction histories to jointly model user actions
(what) and their semantic drivers (why). Existing methods consider only
interactions such as sequences and embeddings, whereas PULSE treats rationales
as first-class signals, this novel design yields embeddings that are more
robust and generalizable. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PULSE
outperforms leading ID, Collaborative Filtering (CF), and LLM-based sequential
recommendation models across multiple benchmark datasets. Furthermore, PULSE
exhibits superior transferability in cross-domain recommendation and
demonstrates strong performance on downstream tasks such as reasoning-oriented
question answering. Our code is available

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ExPO-HM is introduced to elevate hateful meme detection by incorporating explanation-driven methods, surpassing prior models in performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need to enhance hateful meme detection with contextual understanding and explanations for real-world moderation.

Method: ExPO-HM integrates SFT warmup, GRPO with curriculum learning, and Conditional Decision Entropy for improved reasoning and classification.

Result: ExPO-HM outperforms state-of-the-art models, showing up to 17% improvement in F1 scores on various benchmarks for detection and reasoning.

Conclusion: ExPO-HM enhances hateful meme moderation by shifting from binary detection to explanation-based models, achieving superior performance and interpretability.

Abstract: Hateful memes have emerged as a particularly challenging form of online
abuse, motivating the development of automated detection systems. Most prior
approaches rely on direct detection, producing only binary predictions. Such
models fail to provide the context and explanations that real-world moderation
requires. Recent Explain-then-Detect approaches, using Chain-of-Thought
prompting or LMM agents, perform worse than simple SFT baselines, and even
advanced post-training methods such as GRPO fail to close the gap. Our analysis
identifies two key issues of such systems: important policy-relevant cues such
as targets and attack types are not hypothesized by the model as a likely
explanation; and the binary reward signal is insufficient to guide reasoning.
To address these challenges, we propose ExPO-HM (Explain-then-Detect Policy
Optimization for Hateful Memes), inspired by the training and evaluation
process of human annotators. ExPO-HM combines SFT warmup, GRPO with curriculum
learning, and Conditional Decision Entropy (CDE) as both metric and reward for
reasoning quality. Across three hateful meme benchmarks, ExPO-HM achieves
state-of-the-art performance on binary detection, fine-grained classification,
and reasoning quality, with up to 15\% and 17\% F1 improvement over the GRPO
and DPO baselines, respectively. By moving hateful meme detection from simple
binary alarms to explanation-driven detection, ExPO-HM provides accurate,
interpretable, and actionable moderation support.

### [66] [Next Semantic Scale Prediction via Hierarchical Diffusion Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08632)
*Cai Zhou,Chenyu Wang,Dinghuai Zhang,Shangyuan Tong,Yifei Wang,Stephen Bates,Tommi Jaakkola*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper presents Hierarchical Diffusion Language Models (HDLM), a novel approach in discrete diffusion models for language modeling, emphasizing hierarchical vocabulary and semantic abstraction for improved text generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to enhance language modeling by introducing a hierarchical vocabulary structure where tokens are organized based on their semantic abstraction levels to improve generative and validation perplexity in text generation.

Method: HDLM uses a hierarchical vocabulary with low-level tokens mapped to high-level tokens of abstract meanings. Its forward process perturbs tokens independently to higher-level ancestors, and its reverse process predicts progressively detailed semantics. The model introduces a general time-varying semantic scale prediction process and practical training methods.

Result: Experimental results show HDLM achieves lower validation and generative perplexity compared to baseline models in extensive text generation tasks.

Conclusion: HDLM provides a flexible and effective approach for hierarchical modeling of language semantics, outperforming traditional methods and validating its efficacy in text generation tasks.

Abstract: In this paper we introduce Hierarchical Diffusion Language Models (HDLM) -- a
novel family of discrete diffusion models for language modeling. HDLM builds on
a hierarchical vocabulary where low-level tokens with detailed semantics are
surjectively mapped to high-level tokens with coarse-grained meanings. In the
forward process, each token is independently perturbed to its higher-level
ancestor with more abstract semantics according to the scheduler, while in the
reverse process the model progressively predicts the next, more detailed
semantics. Taken together, HDLM provides a general time-varying next semantic
scale prediction process for language modeling. We derive closed-form
expressions for the diffusion Evidence Lower Bound (ELBO), and show that HDLM
can be implemented in a flexible manner while including the existing MDLM as a
special case. We also propose practical training techniques based on the
insights. Extensive text generation experiments validate the effectiveness of
HDLM, which demonstrates consistently lower validation and generative
perplexity than baselines.

*Chengzhengxu Li,Xiaoming Liu,Zhaohan Zhang,Shaochu Zhang,Shengchao Liu,Guoxin Ma,Yu Lan,Chao Shen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces Upfront CoT (UCoT), a framework that boosts reasoning efficiency in Large Language Models by compressing Chain-of-Thought lengths without compromising reasoning quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address the inefficiency of long Chain-of-Thought processes in Large Language Models, which cause high computational costs and latency.

Method: UCoT employs a two-step process: training a small model (compressor) to produce upfront thought embeddings rich in reasoning details, followed by optimizing the large model (executor) to use these embeddings for concise reasoning answers.

Result: On the GSM8K dataset, UCoT cuts token usage by 50% while outperforming previous state-of-the-art methods by 3.08% in reasoning accuracy.

Conclusion: UCoT effectively compresses reasoning workflows, improving efficiency and performance for reasoning tasks in LLMs without manual prompt designing or external dataset construction.

Abstract: Recent developments have enabled advanced reasoning in Large Language Models
(LLMs) via long Chain-of-Thought (CoT), while long CoT suffers from high
computational costs and significant latency losses owing to the autoregressive
nature of generative LLMs. CoT compression aims to improve efficiency in the
reasoning process by reducing output length. Previous works trade reasoning
efficiency by either laborious discrete prompt designing or the construction of
external compressed CoT datasets that sacrifice key reasoning details. In this
work, we propose Upfront CoT (UCoT): an efficient reasoning framework with
upfront thought embedding to automate CoT compression. UCoT is a cooperative
workflow involving a small model (compressor) and a large model (executor). The
first stage of UCoT trains compressor to generate upfront thought embeddings
rich in reasoning information for the executor, avoiding the drawbacks of
manually designed prompts. The second stage optimizes executor to utilize
upfront thought embeddings to derive the correct answer with short reasoning,
using a reward mechanism. Extensive experiments show that UCoT maintains the
powerful reasoning ability of executor while significantly reducing the length
of CoT. It is worth mentioning that when applying UCoT to the
Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct model, the usage of tokens on GSM8K dataset is reduced by
50\%, while the performance is 3.08\% higher than that of the state-of-the-art
(SOTA) method. The code and dataset are in supplementary material.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes a formal framework using language models to analyze stylistic choices in personal narratives, linking linguistic choices to psychological states.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a lack of systematic methods to analyze stylistic choices in personal narratives, which are crucial for understanding subjective experiences.

Method: The method integrates functional linguistics, computer science, and psychology to analyze linguistic choices in authors‚Äô narratives, focusing on features like processes, participants, and circumstances.

Result: The framework was applied to hundreds of dream narratives, including a war veteran‚Äôs case study, revealing distinctive linguistic patterns (e.g., dominance of verbal processes over mental ones).

Conclusion: The framework demonstrates how linguistic choices in personal narratives can reflect psychological states, offering insights relevant for computational linguistics and psychology.

Abstract: Personal narratives are stories authors construct to make meaning of their
experiences. Style, the distinctive way authors use language to express
themselves, is fundamental to how these narratives convey subjective
experiences. Yet there is a lack of a formal framework for systematically
analyzing these stylistic choices. We present a novel approach that formalizes
style in personal narratives as patterns in the linguistic choices authors make
when communicating subjective experiences. Our framework integrates three
domains: functional linguistics establishes language as a system of meaningful
choices, computer science provides methods for automatically extracting and
analyzing sequential patterns, and these patterns are linked to psychological
observations. Using language models, we automatically extract linguistic
features such as processes, participants, and circumstances. We apply our
framework to hundreds of dream narratives, including a case study on a war
veteran with post-traumatic stress disorder. Analysis of his narratives
uncovers distinctive patterns, particularly how verbal processes dominate over
mental ones, illustrating the relationship between linguistic choices and
psychological states.

*Joe Watson,Ivan O'Conner,Chia-Wen Chen,Luning Sun,Fang Luo,David Stillwell*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study integrates qualitative LLM-scored text data with traditional rating scales in psychological assessments, improving precision and accuracy without relying on pre-labeled data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional psychological assessments miss the nuances of respondents' natural language due to structured scales.

Method: A novel framework uses LLM-scored transcribed text alongside conventional rating scales, optimizing measurement by empirically selecting scoring instructions.

Result: Augmented tests showed increased precision, equivalent to adding multiple items to existing tests, based on both real-world and synthetic datasets.

Conclusion: The method is scalable and enhances psychometric reliability, offering applications in clinical health contexts and beyond.

Abstract: Psychological assessments typically rely on structured rating scales, which
cannot incorporate the rich nuance of a respondent's natural language. This
study leverages recent LLM advances to harness qualitative data within a novel
conceptual framework, combining LLM-scored text and traditional rating-scale
items to create an augmented test. We demonstrate this approach using
depression as a case study, developing and assessing the framework on a
real-world sample of upper secondary students (n=693) and corresponding
synthetic dataset (n=3,000). On held-out test sets, augmented tests achieved
statistically significant improvements in measurement precision and accuracy.
The information gain from the LLM items was equivalent to adding between 6.3
(real data) and 16.0 (synthetic data) items to the original 19-item test. Our
approach marks a conceptual shift in automated scoring that bypasses its
typical bottlenecks: instead of relying on pre-labelled data or complex
expert-created rubrics, we empirically select the most informative LLM scoring
instructions based on calculations of item information. This framework provides
a scalable approach for leveraging the growing stream of transcribed text to
enhance traditional psychometric measures, and we discuss its potential utility
in clinical health and beyond.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces dInfer, an efficient inference framework tailored for diffusion-based large language models (dLLMs), achieving significant speedups while maintaining high model performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The development of dInfer addresses the lack of a standardized and efficient inference framework for dLLMs, which limits their widespread adoption despite their potential advantages in parallelism and denoising-based generation.

Method: dInfer's inference pipeline is modularly designed with four components: model, diffusion iteration manager, decoding strategy, and KV-cache manager. These components are combined with algorithmic and system-level optimizations to enhance efficiency.

Result: dInfer demonstrates a $10\times$ speedup compared to Fast-dLLM and a $2$-$3\times$ speedup against AR models like QWen2.5-3B, with substantial token generation rates (e.g., over 800 tokens/second across benchmarks).

Conclusion: dInfer advances the practicality and efficiency of dLLMs, showcasing its capability to speed up inference without sacrificing output quality, and is made publicly available for further use and development.

Abstract: Diffusion-based large language models (dLLMs) have emerged as a promising
alternative to autoregressive (AR) LLMs, leveraging denoising-based generation
to enable inherent parallelism. Even more and more open-sourced dLLM models
emerge, yet their widespread adoption remains constrained by the lack of a
standardized and efficient inference framework. We present dInfer, an efficient
and extensible framework for dLLM inference. dInfer decomposes the inference
pipeline into four modular components-model, diffusion iteration manager,
decoding strategy, and KV-cache manager-and integrates novel algorithms for
each component alongside system-level optimizations. Through this combination
of algorithmic innovations and system enhancements, dInfer achieves substantial
efficiency gains without compromising output quality on LLaDA-MoE. At batch
size 1, it surpasses 1,100 tokens per second on HumanEval and averages over 800
tokens per second across six benchmarks on $8\times$ H800 GPUs. Compared to
prior systems, dInfer delivers $10\times$ speedup over Fast-dLLM while
maintaining similar model performance. Even compared with AR models (with a
comparable number of activation parameters and performance) QWen2.5-3B, which
is highly optimized with latest vLLM inference engine, dInfer still deliverers
$2$-$3\times$ speedup. The implementation of dInfer is open-sourced at

### [71] [Scaling Laws for Code: A More Data-Hungry Regime](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08702)
*Xianzhen Luo,Wenzhen Zheng,Qingfu Zhu,Rongyi Zhang,Houyi Li,Siming Huang,YuanTao Fan,Wanxiang Che*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper investigates scaling laws for Code Large Language Models (LLMs) and finds that code requires significantly higher data-to-parameter ratios than natural language (NL).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing scaling laws for training LLMs focus on NL, but code differs substantially due to its strict syntax, requiring an exploration of separate scaling principles for code-specific models.

Method: Conducted 117 experiments on Code LLMs ranging from 0.2B to 3.8B parameters and training data from 2B to 128B tokens. Analyzed performance using the Chinchilla and Farseer scaling laws.

Result: The Farseer law surpassed Chinchilla law in accuracy. Code LLMs scaled effectively with model size but needed higher data-to-parameter ratios than NL. Code-NL mixtures had varying benefits based on resource constraints.

Conclusion: Code requires a distinct scaling regime compared to NL, emphasizing the necessity of tailoring training approaches specifically for code-based LLMs.

Abstract: Code Large Language Models (LLMs) are revolutionizing software engineering.
However, scaling laws that guide the efficient training are predominantly
analyzed on Natural Language (NL). Given the fundamental differences like
strict syntax between code and NL, it is unclear whether these laws are
directly applicable to code. To address this gap, we conduct the first
large-scale empirical study of scaling laws for code, comprising 117
experimental runs with model sizes from 0.2B to 3.8B and training tokens from
2B to 128B. We fit the Chinchilla law and the Farsser law. First, the results
show that the more expressive Farseer law offers greater accuracy. Second, the
analysis reveals that Code LLMs scale effectively with model size. Crucially,
code represents a more data-hungry regime, requiring a substantially higher
data-to-parameter ratio than NL. Finally, two additional sets of experiments on
code-NL mixtures show that NL benefits resource-constrained scenarios, but
becomes a detriment at higher compute budgets.

### [72] [Thinking Longer, Not Always Smarter: Evaluating LLM Capabilities in Hierarchical Legal Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08710)
*Li Zhang,Matthias Grabmair,Morgan Gray,Kevin Ashley*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper evaluates Large Language Models (LLMs) in U.S. legal case-based reasoning, emphasizing their limitations in nuanced reasoning tasks, despite surface-level proficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study is motivated by the need to analyze LLMs' performance in the intricate process of comparing and distinguishing U.S. legal case precedents.

Method: The authors propose a three-stage reasoning framework, employing factual predicates, hierarchical organization, and verifiable rules to test LLM proficiency in legal reasoning.

Result: LLMs perform well on surface-level case reasoning but significantly struggle on hierarchical reasoning (64.82%-92.09% accuracy) and integrated analysis (11.46%-33.99% accuracy).

Conclusion: The paper highlights critical inefficiencies in LLM reasoning for legal contexts, suggesting that current systems are inadequate for robust and trustworthy legal reasoning, and requiring methodological improvements.

Abstract: Case-based reasoning is a cornerstone of U.S. legal practice, requiring
professionals to argue about a current case by drawing analogies to and
distinguishing from past precedents. While Large Language Models (LLMs) have
shown remarkable capabilities, their proficiency in this complex, nuanced form
of reasoning needs further investigation. We propose a formal framework that
decomposes the process of identifying significant distinctions between cases
into three-stage reasoning tasks. Our framework models cases using factual
predicates called factors, organizes them into a legal knowledge hierarchy, and
defines verifiable rules for identifying distinctions, analyzing their
argumentative support, and evaluating their significance. Through comprehensive
evaluation of modern reasoning LLMs, we reveal a paradox: while models achieve
high accuracy on surface-level reasoning (Task 1), performance degrades on
hierarchical reasoning (Task 2: 64.82%-92.09%) and collapses on integrated
analysis (Task 3: 11.46%-33.99%). Most strikingly, we find that models
consistently expend more computational resources on incorrect responses than
correct ones, suggesting that "thinking longer" does not always mean "thinking
smarter." Our work provides a methodology for fine-grained analysis of LLM
reasoning capabilities in complex domains and reveals fundamental limitations
that must be addressed for robust and trustworthy legal AI.

*Xianzhen Luo,Jinyang Huang,Wenzhen Zheng,Qingfu Zhu,Mingzheng Xu,Yiheng Xu,Yuantao Fan,Libo Qin,Wanxiang Che*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces a framework and algorithm for building efficient and diverse test case benchmarks (TC-Bench) to evaluate fault-detection capabilities of models with minimal redundancy, revealing a performance gap in existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the limitations of existing benchmarks for evaluating test cases generated by Large Language Models (LLMs), such as high computational costs, score inflation, and a bias towards trivial bugs instead of critical faults.

Method: Authors propose a framework that formulates benchmark construction as finding an optimal diagnostic basis in a binary code-test matrix, optimizing diversity while minimizing redundancy. They introduce an approximation algorithm called WrongSelect to address the NP-hard problem of selecting diverse wrong codes.

Result: The proposed framework was applied to a large dataset of competitive programming submissions to construct TC-Bench, a benchmark that is compact, diverse, and inflation-resistant. Evaluations revealed that existing test generation methods perform suboptimally (~60% exclusion rates) on this benchmark.

Conclusion: TC-Bench exposes limitations of current test case generation approaches and provides a robust benchmark for evaluating their efficacy in detecting diverse and critical errors.

Abstract: Evaluating test cases automatically generated by Large Language Models (LLMs)
is a critical yet challenging task. Existing benchmarks suffer from high
computational costs, score inflation, and a bias towards trivial bugs over
rare, critical faults. In this work, we ask two fundamental questions: (1) What
is the minimal set of wrong codes sufficient to represent the entire error
space? and (2) What is the minimal set of test cases needed to distinguish
them? We introduce a framework that formalizes benchmark construction as
finding an optimal diagnostic basis in a binary code-test matrix. The rank of
this matrix specifies the minimal number of independent error patterns (wrong
codes) and provides a tight upper bound on the number of test cases required
for complete fault coverage. Our objective is to identify a basis of size equal
to the matrix rank that maximizes internal diversity. To tackle this NP-hard
problem, we propose WrongSelect, an efficient approximation algorithm to select
maximally diverse wrong codes. Applying this framework to millions of
competitive programming submissions, we construct TC-Bench, a compact, diverse,
and inflation-resistant benchmark. Extensive experiments show that even the
most advanced test case generation methods achieve only ~60% exclusion rates on
TC-Bench, exposing a significant gap in their diagnostic power. Our dataset is

### [74] [How Reliable is Language Model Micro-Benchmarking?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08730)
*Gregory Yauney,Shahzaib Saqib Warraich,Swabha Swayamdipta*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Micro-benchmarking evaluates language models on a small subset of examples to save time and cost, but often fails to rank models reliably compared to full benchmarks or random sample subsets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the inefficiency and cost of full benchmark evaluations for language models by exploring the reliability of micro-benchmarking as a substitute.

Method: It introduces a meta-evaluation measure to analyze the effectiveness of micro-benchmarks in ranking model pairs, considering the trade-off between micro-benchmark size and ranking reliability.

Result: The study reveals that micro-benchmarks often fail to rank model pairs accurately, especially for models with close performance scores, requiring larger sample sizes of up to 250 examples for reliable rankings.

Conclusion: Micro-benchmarking methods are not consistently reliable with small subsets, and random sampling can be competitive at sufficient sample sizes. The findings provide actionable recommendations for balancing efficiency with reliability in model evaluation.

Abstract: Micro-benchmarking offers a solution to the often prohibitive time and cost
of language model development: evaluate on a very small subset of existing
benchmarks. Can these micro-benchmarks, however, rank models as consistently as
the full benchmarks they replace? And can they rank models more consistently
than selecting a random subset of data points? In many scenarios, we find that
the answer is no. We introduce a meta-evaluation measure for micro-benchmarking
which investigates how well a micro-benchmark can rank two models as a function
of their performance difference on the full benchmark. This approach can
determine which model pairs can be ranked correctly by a micro-benchmark,
allowing for a finer-grained analysis of the trade-off between micro-benchmark
size and reliability. Prior work has suggested selecting as few as 10 examples;
we find that no micro-benchmarking method can consistently rank model pairs 3.5
points of accuracy apart on MMLU-Pro or 4 points apart on BIG-bench Hard. In
order to consistently rank model pairs with relatively similar performances, we
show that often as many as 250 examples must be selected, at which point random
sampling is competitive with existing micro-benchmarking methods. When
comparing only 8B instruction-tuned models on MMLU-Pro micro-benchmarks with 25
examples, we find that more than half of pairwise comparisons are not likely to
be preserved. Our work provides actionable guidance for both micro-benchmark
users and developers in navigating the trade-off between evaluation efficiency
and reliability.

TL;DR: The paper addresses geocoding compositional location references using LLM-based strategies, showing improved performance and efficiency with fine-tuned models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to enhance geocoding techniques, focusing on compositional location references, which are crucial for accurate geospatial analyses of unstructured text.

Method: They evaluate LLMs' geospatial knowledge versus reasoning capabilities and propose a strategy leveraging these insights. They experiment with fine-tuned smaller LLMs compared to large off-the-shelf models.

Result: The proposed approach demonstrates improved geocoding performance, with smaller fine-tuned LLMs performing on par with larger models.

Conclusion: Fine-tuned smaller LLM models can efficiently handle geocoding tasks, providing a cost-effective and high-performance alternative to larger pre-trained models.

Abstract: Geocoding is the task of linking a location reference to an actual geographic
location and is essential for many downstream analyses of unstructured text. In
this paper, we explore the challenging setting of geocoding compositional
location references. Building on recent work demonstrating LLMs' abilities to
reason over geospatial data, we evaluate LLMs' geospatial knowledge versus
reasoning skills relevant to our task. Based on these insights, we propose an
LLM-based strategy for geocoding compositional location references. We show
that our approach improves performance for the task and that a relatively small
fine-tuned LLM can achieve comparable performance with much larger
off-the-shelf models.

TL;DR: The study evaluates multilingual responses from leading LLMs, finding GPT-5 performed best overall.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the increasing need for evaluating and guardrailing multilingual LLM responses amid their widespread usage.

Method: Applied a five-point grading rubric and judge LLM to assess five dimensions of LLM response accuracy and consistency across languages.

Result: GPT-5 excelled in all categories, particularly in Consent & Autonomy and Harm Prevention & Safety, while Gemini 2.5 Pro scored the lowest.

Conclusion: Highlights the impact of linguistic shifts on LLM performance, underscoring the need for further evaluation and improvement.

Abstract: With LLM usage becoming widespread across countries, languages, and humanity
more broadly, the need to understand and guardrail their multilingual responses
increases. Large-scale datasets for testing and benchmarking have been created
to evaluate and facilitate LLM responses across multiple dimensions. In this
study, we evaluate the responses of frontier and leading open-source models in
five dimensions across low and high-resource languages to measure LLM accuracy
and consistency across multilingual contexts. We evaluate the responses using a
five-point grading rubric and a judge LLM. Our study shows that GPT-5 performed
the best on average in each category, while other models displayed more
inconsistency across language and category. Most notably, in the Consent &
Autonomy and Harm Prevention & Safety categories, GPT scored the highest with
averages of 3.56 and 4.73, while Gemini 2.5 Pro scored the lowest with averages
of 1.39 and 1.98, respectively. These findings emphasize the need for further
testing on how linguistic shifts impact LLM responses across various categories
and improvement in these areas.

*S M Rafiuddin,Muntaha Nujat Khan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Adaptive Retention reduces sequence attention scaling in transformers through probabilistic token selection under a global budget, retaining competitive performance while enhancing efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the high computational cost of quadratic attention scaling in transformers, which limits their efficiency and applicability to long-context scenarios.

Method: Introduces Adaptive Retention, a probabilistic token selection mechanism using Bernoulli gates, Hard-Concrete relaxation, and a top-M rule for enforcing efficiency during inference.

Result: When retaining only 30-50% of tokens, the model achieves ‚â•95% of the full-model performance, reduces peak memory usage by 35-45%, and improves throughput by up to 1.8x.

Conclusion: Adaptive Retention offers a practical and architecture-independent solution to achieve efficient long-context processing in transformers without altering base attention mechanisms.

Abstract: Transformer attention scales quadratically with sequence length O(n^2),
limiting long-context use. We propose Adaptive Retention, a probabilistic,
layer-wise token selection mechanism that learns which representations to keep
under a strict global budget M. Retention is modeled with Bernoulli gates
trained via a Hard-Concrete/variational relaxation and enforced with a simple
top-M rule at inference, making the method differentiable and drop-in for
standard encoders. Across classification, extractive QA, and long-document
summarization, keeping only 30-50% of tokens preserves >= 95% of full-model
performance while cutting peak memory by ~35-45% and improving throughput by up
to ~1.8x. This architecture-agnostic approach delivers practical long-context
efficiency without modifying base attention or task heads.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces CCMOR, a benchmark for testing Chinese-language LLMs' ability to perform multi-hop reasoning and process factual knowledge, highlighting their limitations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address the lack of evaluations of LLMs in Chinese-language contexts for complex reasoning tasks.

Method: The paper uses a domain-balanced seed set, an LLM-powered question generation pipeline, and human-in-the-loop validation to create the CCMOR benchmark.

Result: Through CCMOR, state-of-the-art LLMs were shown to struggle with reasoning over long-tail knowledge, but retrieval-augmented generation improved performance significantly.

Conclusion: CCMOR provides critical insights into Chinese-language LLMs' reasoning capabilities, emphasizing the challenges in handling knowledge-intensive reasoning and the effectiveness of retrieval-augmented approaches.

Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated advanced reasoning
capabilities, their comprehensive evaluation in general Chinese-language
contexts remains understudied. To bridge this gap, we propose Chinese
Commonsense Multi-hop Reasoning (CCMOR), a novel benchmark designed to evaluate
LLMs' ability to integrate Chinese-specific factual knowledge with multi-step
logical reasoning. Specifically, we first construct a domain-balanced seed set
from existing QA datasets, then develop an LLM-powered pipeline to generate
multi-hop questions anchored on factual unit chains. To ensure the quality of
resulting dataset, we implement a human-in-the-loop verification system, where
domain experts systematically validate and refine the generated questions.
Using CCMOR, we evaluate state-of-the-art LLMs, demonstrating persistent
limitations in LLMs' ability to process long-tail knowledge and execute
knowledge-intensive reasoning. Notably, retrieval-augmented generation
substantially mitigates these knowledge gaps, yielding significant performance
gains.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MOSAIC is a framework leveraging multi-agent LLMs to tackle complex scientific coding challenges, focusing on stepwise problem decomposition and minimizing hallucinations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Scientific workflows demand rigorous, interconnected algorithms with domain-specific reasoning, unlike general-purpose coding tasks.

Method: MOSAIC uses a multi-agent, training-free design within a student-teacher paradigm, leveraging a Consolidated Context Window to address complex problems.

Result: MOSAIC surpasses existing methods in accuracy, robustness, and interpretability on scientific coding benchmarks.

Conclusion: MOSAIC is an effective, specialized framework for solving challenging scientific coding tasks using multi-agent LLMs.

Abstract: We present MOSAIC, a multi-agent Large Language Model (LLM) framework for
solving challenging scientific coding tasks. Unlike general-purpose coding,
scientific workflows require algorithms that are rigorous, interconnected with
deep domain knowledge, and incorporate domain-specific reasoning, as well as
algorithm iteration without requiring I/O test cases. Many scientific problems
also require a sequence of subproblems to be solved, leading to the final
desired result. MOSAIC is designed as a training-free framework with specially
designed agents to self-reflect, create the rationale, code, and debug within a
student-teacher paradigm to address the challenges of scientific code
generation. This design facilitates stepwise problem decomposition, targeted
error correction, and, when combined with our Consolidated Context Window
(CCW), mitigates LLM hallucinations when solving complex scientific tasks
involving chained subproblems. We evaluate MOSAIC on scientific coding
benchmarks and demonstrate that our specialized agentic framework outperforms
existing approaches in terms of accuracy, robustness, and interpretability.

*Abhishek K. Mishra,Antoine Boutet,Lucas Magnana*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper explores privacy risks in Large Language Models (LLMs) across four languages (English, Spanish, French, Italian) using medical data, revealing that language structure impacts privacy vulnerability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation behind this paper is to understand how linguistic structure and variability affect privacy risks in LLMs when they are applied in multilingual scenarios involving sensitive data.

Method: The authors quantified six linguistic indicators and evaluated three attack vectors (extraction, counterfactual memorization, membership inference) to investigate privacy leakage in LLMs trained on corpora of English, Spanish, French, and Italian medical data.

Result: The study found that privacy vulnerability is influenced by linguistic redundancy and tokenization granularity. Italian had the most privacy leakage, while English showed higher membership inference separability. French and Spanish were more resilient due to their higher morphological complexity.

Conclusion: Language structure plays a critical role in privacy leakage in LLMs, necessitating the development of language-aware privacy-preserving mechanisms in LLM applications.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed across multilingual
applications that handle sensitive data, yet their scale and linguistic
variability introduce major privacy risks. Mostly evaluated for English, this
paper investigates how language structure affects privacy leakage in LLMs
trained on English, Spanish, French, and Italian medical corpora. We quantify
six linguistic indicators and evaluate three attack vectors: extraction,
counterfactual memorization, and membership inference. Results show that
privacy vulnerability scales with linguistic redundancy and tokenization
granularity: Italian exhibits the strongest leakage, while English shows higher
membership separability. In contrast, French and Spanish display greater
resilience due to higher morphological complexity. Overall, our findings
provide the first quantitative evidence that language matters in privacy
leakage, underscoring the need for language-aware privacy-preserving mechanisms
in LLM deployments.

*Jia Ao Sun,Hao Yu,Fabrizio Gotti,Fengran Mo,Yihong Wu,Yuchen Hui,Jian-Yun Nie*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces Search-on-Graph (SoG), a framework that enables large language models (LLMs) to improve reasoning on knowledge-intensive, multi-hop questions using informed graph navigation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing KGQA methods face issues like brittleness, noise from large subgraphs, and complex exploration frameworks that expand search spaces. LLMs, meanwhile, struggle with knowledge gaps, hallucinations, and outdated information.

Method: The proposed SoG framework uses an iterative 'observe-then-navigate' principle, where LLMs analyze available relations at each step and decide the next navigation, avoiding pre-planning paths or retrieving large subgraphs.

Result: SoG achieves state-of-the-art performance across six KGQA benchmarks, offering significant improvements (+16% improvement on Wikidata benchmarks) and consistent gains on Freebase benchmarks.

Conclusion: SoG effectively improves reasoning and navigation for LLMs in KGQA tasks, addressing existing limitations without requiring fine-tuning while showing strong adaptability across different knowledge graph schemas.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive reasoning abilities
yet remain unreliable on knowledge-intensive, multi-hop questions -- they miss
long-tail facts, hallucinate when uncertain, and their internal knowledge lags
behind real-world change. Knowledge graphs (KGs) offer a structured source of
relational evidence, but existing KGQA methods face fundamental trade-offs:
compiling complete SPARQL queries without knowing available relations proves
brittle, retrieving large subgraphs introduces noise, and complex agent
frameworks with parallel exploration exponentially expand search spaces. To
address these limitations, we propose Search-on-Graph (SoG), a simple yet
effective framework that enables LLMs to perform iterative informed graph
navigation using a single, carefully designed \textsc{Search} function. Rather
than pre-planning paths or retrieving large subgraphs, SoG follows an
``observe-then-navigate'' principle: at each step, the LLM examines actual
available relations from the current entity before deciding on the next hop.
This approach further adapts seamlessly to different KG schemas and handles
high-degree nodes through adaptive filtering. Across six KGQA benchmarks
spanning Freebase and Wikidata, SoG achieves state-of-the-art performance
without fine-tuning. We demonstrate particularly strong gains on Wikidata
benchmarks (+16\% improvement over previous best methods) alongside consistent
improvements on Freebase benchmarks.

*Ragib Amin Nihal,Rui Wen,Kazuhiro Nakadai,Jun Sakuma*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces Pattern Enhanced Chain of Attack (PE-CoA), a framework for systematically constructing multi-turn jailbreaks to uncover vulnerabilities in large language models (LLMs).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the vulnerability of LLMs in handling multi-turn jailbreaks across various harm categories, which are poorly understood and inadequately tackled by existing heuristic approaches.

Method: The PE-CoA framework defines five conversation patterns to systematically exploit LLM weaknesses across twelve models and evaluates performance spanning ten harm categories.

Result: State-of-the-art performance in multi-turn jailbreaks was achieved, revealing distinct weakness profiles among models. Robustness to one conversational pattern doesn‚Äôt generally extend to others, and similar failure modes are seen within model families.

Conclusion: LLMs exhibit specific vulnerabilities dependent on conversational patterns, and existing safety training methods are inadequate. Pattern-aware defenses are needed to improve robustness against multi-turn jailbreaks.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) remain vulnerable to multi-turn jailbreaking
attacks that exploit conversational context to bypass safety constraints
gradually. These attacks target different harm categories (like malware
generation, harassment, or fraud) through distinct conversational approaches
(educational discussions, personal experiences, hypothetical scenarios).
Existing multi-turn jailbreaking methods often rely on heuristic or ad hoc
exploration strategies, providing limited insight into underlying model
weaknesses. The relationship between conversation patterns and model
vulnerabilities across harm categories remains poorly understood. We propose
Pattern Enhanced Chain of Attack (PE-CoA), a framework of five conversation
patterns to construct effective multi-turn jailbreaks through natural dialogue.
Evaluating PE-CoA on twelve LLMs spanning ten harm categories, we achieve
state-of-the-art performance, uncovering pattern-specific vulnerabilities and
LLM behavioral characteristics: models exhibit distinct weakness profiles where
robustness to one conversational pattern does not generalize to others, and
model families share similar failure modes. These findings highlight
limitations of safety training and indicate the need for pattern-aware
defenses. Code available on: https://github.com/Ragib-Amin-Nihal/PE-CoA

*Krzysztof Mrozinski,Minji Kang,Ahmed Khota,Vincent Michael Sutanto,Giovanni Gatti De Giacomo*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper explores quality estimation (QE) reranking for document-level machine translation, showing improvements in BLEURT-20 scores using learned and LLM-based metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the gap in applying quality estimation (QE) reranking to document-level machine translation, as opposed to the commonly studied sentence-level translation.

Method: The study evaluates the performance of QE reranking using the learned metric SLIDE and the LLM-based metric GEMBA-DA across various translation models, examining improvements in BLEURT-20 scores under different input sizes and candidate pools.

Result: Using SLIDE, BLEURT-20 scores improved by +2.00 with 2 candidates and by +5.09 with 32 candidates. Using GEMBA-DA, gains of +1.63 and +4.30 were achieved respectively. Document-level reranking provided noticeable gains even for long documents (512-1024 tokens).

Conclusion: Document-level QE reranking demonstrates practical benefits in improving translation quality with limited runtime overhead, making it valuable for larger-scale applications in machine translation.

Abstract: Quality estimation (QE) reranking is a form of quality-aware decoding which
aims to improve machine translation (MT) by scoring and selecting the best
candidate from a pool of generated translations. While known to be effective at
the sentence level, its application to the increasingly prominent domain of
document-level translation remains underexplored. In this work, we evaluate QE
reranking performance on document-level (rather than the typical
sentence-level) translation, using various learned and large language model
(LLM)-based QE metrics. We find that with our best learned metric, SLIDE,
BLEURT-20 scores improve by +2.00 with only two candidates, and by +5.09 with
32, across both decoder-only LLM models and encoder-decoder neural machine
translation (NMT) models. Using the best LLM-based metric, GEMBA-DA, gains of
+1.63 and +4.30 are achieved under the same conditions. Although gains shrink
with longer inputs, reranking with 32 candidates yields improvements of +2.34
(SLIDE) and +1.40 (GEMBA-DA) on our longest documents (512-1024 source tokens).
These findings demonstrate the practical value of document-level QE, with
minimal runtime overhead given suitable translation models and hardware.

TL;DR: The paper presents FinAuditing, a benchmark to evaluate large language models (LLMs) on financial auditing tasks, demonstrating their limitations in maintaining semantic, relational, and numerical consistency in structured financial documents.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of understanding and performance by LLMs in structured, taxonomy-driven financial documents, which is crucial for automating and verifying audits.

Method: The authors developed the FinAuditing benchmark, built from real US-GAAP-compliant XBRL filings. It includes three subtasks: FinSM for semantic consistency, FinRE for relational consistency, and FinMR for numerical consistency, complemented by a unified framework for evaluation.

Result: Experiments on 13 state-of-the-art LLMs showed poor performance, with accuracy dropping 60-90% when reasoning over hierarchical, multi-document structures.

Conclusion: The study highlights systematic limitations of modern LLMs in taxonomy-aligned financial reasoning, establishing FinAuditing as a critical resource for future advancements in financial intelligence systems.

Abstract: The complexity of the Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) and the
hierarchical structure of eXtensible Business Reporting Language (XBRL) filings
make financial auditing increasingly difficult to automate and verify. While
large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong capabilities in
unstructured text understanding, their ability to reason over structured,
interdependent, and taxonomy-driven financial documents remains largely
unexplored. To fill this gap, we introduce FinAuditing, the first
taxonomy-aligned, structure-aware, multi-document benchmark for evaluating LLMs
on financial auditing tasks. Built from real US-GAAP-compliant XBRL filings,
FinAuditing defines three complementary subtasks, FinSM for semantic
consistency, FinRE for relational consistency, and FinMR for numerical
consistency, each targeting a distinct aspect of structured auditing reasoning.
We further propose a unified evaluation framework integrating retrieval,
classification, and reasoning metrics across these subtasks. Extensive
zero-shot experiments on 13 state-of-the-art LLMs reveal that current models
perform inconsistently across semantic, relational, and mathematical
dimensions, with accuracy drops of up to 60-90% when reasoning over
hierarchical multi-document structures. Our findings expose the systematic
limitations of modern LLMs in taxonomy-grounded financial reasoning and
establish FinAuditing as a foundation for developing trustworthy,
structure-aware, and regulation-aligned financial intelligence systems. The
benchmark dataset is available at Hugging Face.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes multi-temperature scheduling for enhancing reasoning in Large Language Models (LLMs), by applying different temperature settings to reasoning and knowledge tokens.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations in exploration during token generation stages in LLMs' reinforcement learning, particularly focusing on reasoning versus knowledge tokens.

Method: Distinct temperature settings: higher for high-entropy reasoning tokens to promote exploration and lower for low-entropy knowledge tokens to ensure correctness.

Result: Empirical evaluations on reasoning benchmarks show improved reasoning performance in LLMs using the proposed approach.

Conclusion: Using multi-temperature techniques enhances reasoning capability in LLMs while maintaining factual correctness, showcasing promising applicability for reasoning tasks in AI.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning has demonstrated substantial improvements in the
reasoning abilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), exhibiting significant
applicability across various domains. Recent research has identified that
tokens within LLMs play distinct roles during reasoning tasks, categorizing
them into high-entropy reasoning tokens and low-entropy knowledge tokens. Prior
approaches have typically focused on restricting updates to indirectly
encourage exploration, yet they do not explicitly facilitate exploratory
behavior during the token generation stage itself. In this work, we introduce a
complementary approach that explicitly promotes exploration during sampling by
applying distinct temperature settings for different token types. Specifically,
our method employs higher temperatures for reasoning tokens to actively
encourage exploration, while retaining lower temperatures for knowledge tokens
to maintain factual correctness. Furthermore, we systematically investigate
various multi-temperature scheduling strategies and their impacts within
reinforcement learning contexts. Empirical evaluations on several reasoning
benchmarks demonstrate that our approach significantly enhances the reasoning
performance of LLMs. The code is available at

Motivation: Existing BioNER methods face challenges with nested entities, boundary ambiguities, and cross-lingual constraints, necessitating a more robust and unified approach.

Method: The BioNER task is reformulated as text generation, incorporating symbolic tagging for nested and flat entities. Bilingual joint fine-tuning and contrastive learning-based entity filtering are used to improve performance.

Result: The proposed framework achieves state-of-the-art performance on four benchmark datasets and two unseen corpora, demonstrating strong zero-shot generalization across languages.

Conclusion: The novel framework effectively enhances BioNER capabilities with improved accuracy and generalization, addressing prior limitations in multilingual and nested entity recognition settings.

Abstract: Accurate recognition of biomedical named entities is critical for medical
information extraction and knowledge discovery. However, existing methods often
struggle with nested entities, entity boundary ambiguity, and cross-lingual
generalization. In this paper, we propose a unified Biomedical Named Entity
Recognition (BioNER) framework based on Large Language Models (LLMs). We first
reformulate BioNER as a text generation task and design a symbolic tagging
strategy to jointly handle both flat and nested entities with explicit boundary
annotation. To enhance multilingual and multi-task generalization, we perform
bilingual joint fine-tuning across multiple Chinese and English datasets.
Additionally, we introduce a contrastive learning-based entity selector that
filters incorrect or spurious predictions by leveraging boundary-sensitive
positive and negative samples. Experimental results on four benchmark datasets
and two unseen corpora show that our method achieves state-of-the-art
performance and robust zero-shot generalization across languages. The source

### [87] [Autoencoding-Free Context Compression for LLMs via Contextual Semantic Anchors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08907)
*Xin Liu,RunSong Zhao,PengCheng Huang,XinYu Liu,JunYi Xiao,ChunYang Xiao,Tong Xiao,Shengxiang Gao,Zhengtao Yu,JingBo Zhu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces a novel Semantic-Anchor Compression (SAC) method for accelerating large language model (LLM) inference by efficiently compressing long contexts, outperforming existing methods with significant gains at higher compression ratios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the inefficiency of current context compression methods that rely on autoencoding tasks, which result in a mismatch between compression optimization and the actual downstream tasks.

Method: The proposed Semantic-Anchor Compression (SAC) method directly selects critical 'anchor' tokens from the context and aggregates information into their key-value representations, eliminating the need for autoencoding-based compression training. It involves anchor embeddings for identifying critical tokens and bidirectional attention modification for comprehensive context capture.

Result: SAC surpasses existing context compression techniques across various compression ratios and demonstrates significant performance improvements in out-of-distribution evaluations, particularly excelling at high compression ratios.

Conclusion: SAC proves to be an effective method for context compression in language models, addressing the limitations of autoencoding strategies and enhancing performance in real-world applications.

Abstract: Context compression presents a promising approach for accelerating large
language model (LLM) inference by compressing long contexts into compact
representations. Current context compression methods predominantly rely on
autoencoding tasks to train context-agnostic compression tokens to compress
contextual semantics. While autoencoding tasks enable compression tokens to
acquire compression capabilities, compression via autoencoding tasks creates a
fundamental mismatch: the models are optimized for reconstruction that diverge
from actual downstream tasks, thereby weakening the features more beneficial
for real-world usage. We propose Semantic-Anchor Compression (SAC), a novel
method that shifts from autoencoding task based compression to an architecture
that is equipped with this compression capability \textit{a priori}. Instead of
training models to compress contexts through autoencoding tasks, SAC directly
selects so-called anchor tokens from the original context and aggregates
contextual information into their key-value (KV) representations. By deriving
representations directly from the contextual tokens, SAC eliminates the need
for autoencoding training. To ensure compression performance while directly
leveraging anchor tokens, SAC incorporates two key designs: (1) anchor
embeddings that enable the compressor to identify critical tokens, and (2)
bidirectional attention modification that allows anchor tokens to capture
information from the entire context. Experimental results demonstrate that SAC
consistently outperforms existing context compression methods across various
compression ratios. On out-of-distribution evaluation using MRQA, SAC achieves
1 EM improvement at 5x compression over strong baselines, with increasing
advantages at higher compression ratios.

*Nicholas Deas,Kathleen McKeown*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores artificial impressions, resembling human stereotypes, in large language models (LLMs) by studying their internal representations and understanding their influence on model behavior and prompt features.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand and analyze how stereotypes or impressions akin to human behavior arise in LLMs via prompt representations and their potential impact on model performance.

Method: Researchers fit linear probes on LLM-generated prompts to predict impressions based on the Stereotype Content Model (SCM), analyzing downstream behavior and studying content influences in prompts.

Result: The study finds that impressions are inconsistently reported but are reliably decodable from hidden representations. Artificial impressions predict hedging quality and response style. Prompt features like content and dialect contribute to these impressions.

Conclusion: LLMs exhibit latent stereotype-like impressions linked to their prompts, which impact the quality and attributes of their generated responses, suggesting critical considerations for model fairness and use cases.

Abstract: We introduce and study artificial impressions--patterns in LLMs' internal
representations of prompts that resemble human impressions and stereotypes
based on language. We fit linear probes on generated prompts to predict
impressions according to the two-dimensional Stereotype Content Model (SCM).
Using these probes, we study the relationship between impressions and
downstream model behavior as well as prompt features that may inform such
impressions. We find that LLMs inconsistently report impressions when prompted,
but also that impressions are more consistently linearly decodable from their
hidden representations. Additionally, we show that artificial impressions of
prompts are predictive of the quality and use of hedging in model responses. We
also investigate how particular content, stylistic, and dialectal features in
prompts impact LLM impressions.

*Jiaming Wang,Zhe Tang,Yilin Jin,Peng Ding,Xiaoyu Li,Xuezhi Cao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces SOP-Maze, a benchmark of 397 tasks in complex business SOP scenarios to evaluate the capabilities of LLMs, revealing performance challenges including procedural adherence, dialogue nuances, and arithmetic reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address the gap in evaluating large language models in business scenarios that involve complex standard operating procedures.

Method: The authors built SOP-Maze, comprising 397 tasks from 23 SOP scenarios, categorized into LRS (wide-option tasks) and HRS (deep logical tasks). They conducted experiments analyzing three major error categories in LLM performance.

Result: State-of-the-art LLMs struggle with SOP-Maze tasks, exhibiting problems such as route blindness, conversational fragility, and calculation errors.

Conclusion: SOP-Maze uncovers critical shortcomings in LLM capability for SOP tasks, providing insights for future model development and refinement. The work is open-source for broader research.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are widely deployed as domain-specific
agents, many benchmarks have been proposed to evaluate their ability to follow
instructions and make decisions in real-world scenarios. However, business
scenarios often involve complex standard operating procedures (SOPs), and the
evaluation of LLM capabilities in such contexts has not been fully explored. To
bridge this gap, we propose SOP-Maze, a benchmark constructed from real-world
business data and adapted into a collection of 397 tasks from 23 complex SOP
scenarios. We further categorize SOP tasks into two broad classes: Lateral Root
System (LRS), representing wide-option tasks that demand precise selection; and
Heart Root System (HRS), which emphasizes deep logical reasoning with complex
branches. Extensive experiments reveal that nearly all state-of-the-art models
struggle with SOP-Maze. We conduct a comprehensive analysis and identify three
key error categories: (i) route blindness: difficulty following procedures;
(ii) conversational fragility: inability to handle real dialogue nuances; and
(iii) calculation errors: mistakes in time or arithmetic reasoning under
complex contexts. The systematic study explores LLM performance across SOP
tasks that challenge both breadth and depth, offering new insights for
improving model capabilities. We have open-sourced our work on

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper examines how governance in open-source communities evolves by analyzing 710 projects' governance documents, identifying increasing diversity and balance in roles and actions but stability in rule composition.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how open-source communities manage participation and control through evolving governance structures, and to assess potential impacts of AI-mediated workflows.

Method: The authors analyzed governance documents from 710 open-source projects, measured changes in rules, actions, and roles using metrics like entropy, richness, and Jensen Shannon divergence.

Result: Findings show that projects define more roles and actions over time, distributing them more evenly, while rule composition shows stability.

Conclusion: Governance in open-source communities evolves by expanding participation categories without concentrating authority, providing a baseline to evaluate future AI's impact on governance.

Abstract: We study how open source communities describe participation and control
through version controlled governance documents. Using a corpus of 710 projects
with paired snapshots, we parse text into actors, rules, actions, and objects,
then group them and measure change with entropy for evenness, richness for
diversity, and Jensen Shannon divergence for drift. Projects define more roles
and more actions over time, and these are distributed more evenly, while the
composition of rules remains stable. These findings indicate that governance
grows by expanding and balancing categories of participation without major
shifts in prescriptive force. The analysis provides a reproducible baseline for
evaluating whether future AI mediated workflows concentrate or redistribute
authority.

*Jingyu Zhou,Lu Ma,Hao Liang,Chengyu Shen,Bin Cui,Wentao Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper presents DARO, a dynamic approach to optimize training in RLVR scenarios, resolving limitations in difficulty-weighting schemes to improve model performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current RLVR methods using GRPO are restricted by static or simplistic weighting schemes that fail to adapt to a model's evolving learning capabilities, leading to suboptimal focus during training.

Method: The newly introduced DARO dynamically reweights loss contributions according to the learning state of each difficulty group, ensuring better adaptation to varying sample difficulties during training.

Result: DARO outperformed four prominent RLVR baselines across six math benchmarks, resulting in faster convergence and improved performance in models like Qwen2.5 and Llama3.

Conclusion: DARO enhances RLVR efficiency by addressing loss allocation issues, demonstrating its capability to dynamically balance training focus based on sample difficulty and model learning state.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have shown that reasoning
ability can be significantly enhanced through Reinforcement Learning with
Verifiable Rewards (RLVR). Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) has
emerged as the de facto approach for RLVR, inspiring numerous variants.
However, our mathematical analysis reveals that these methods are fundamentally
weighted variations of GRPO. We provide a unified view, demonstrating that
their reliance on static or overly simplistic weighting schemes tied to sample
difficulty prevents adaptation to a model's evolving capabilities. This creates
a significant loss scale issue, where training disproportionately focuses on
certain difficulty levels at the expense of others, hindering overall
performance. To address these limitations, we introduce
\textbf{Difficulty-Aware Reweighting Policy Optimization (DARO)}, a method that
dynamically adjusts the loss contribution of each difficulty group based on the
model's learning state. Extensive experiments on Qwen2.5-Math-1.5B,
Qwen2.5-Math-7B, and Llama3.1-8B show that DARO outperforms four leading
baselines across six math benchmarks, achieving significantly faster
convergence and superior final performance.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes using LoRA-based Refusal-training to enhance AI safety without compromising general performance, offering a cost-efficient solution.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the challenge of improving AI safety alignment without degrading general model performance or incurring high computational costs.

Method: The authors leverage LoRA-based Refusal-training, which focuses on safety data and works as a plug-and-play safety patch by decoupling safety into a low-rank subspace efficiently.

Result: The study demonstrates empirically and theoretically that LoRA-based training can enhance safety without interfering with a model's existing capabilities.

Conclusion: LoRA-based Refusal-training is a cost-efficient, performance-preserving method effective for AI safety alignment.

Abstract: Safety alignment is essential for building trustworthy artificial
intelligence, yet it remains challenging to enhance model safety without
degrading general performance. Current approaches require computationally
expensive searches for the optimal proportion of safety-critical and
general-purpose data to balance safety and general performance, incurring high
costs with limited gains. In this work, we show that LoRA-based
Refusal-training enables performance-preserving safety alignment even when
trained solely on safety data, demonstrating that LoRA serves as
cost-efficient, performance-preserving, and plug-and-play safety patches.
Beyond empirical findings, we provide both theoretical and experimental
evidence that LoRA effectively decouples safety into a low-rank subspace
largely orthogonal to the model's intrinsic transformation space, ensuring that
safety enhancements do not interfere with inherent capabilities.

TL;DR: LitE-SQL proposes a lightweight and efficient framework for the Text-to-SQL task, achieving high performance with fewer parameters compared to traditional LLM-based approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of existing LLM-based Text-to-SQL models regarding deployment feasibility and data privacy.

Method: The framework includes a Schema Retriever for schema linking using vector databases and a two-stage fine-tuned SQL Generator (supervised followed by reinforcement fine-tuning).

Result: LitE-SQL achieves 72.10% execution accuracy on BIRD and 88.45% on Spider 1.0, performing comparably or better than LLM-based methods using significantly fewer parameters.

Conclusion: High-quality Text-to-SQL generation is viable with lightweight models, making it ideal for privacy-sensitive and resource-limited environments.

Abstract: The Text-to-SQL task translates natural language questions into SQL queries,
enabling intuitive database interaction for non-experts. While recent methods
leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) achieve strong performance, their
reliance on proprietary models raise concerns about deployment feasibility and
data privacy. In this work, we introduce LitE-SQL, a Lightweight and Efficient
framework with two components: (i) a Schema Retriever that performs efficient
schema linking using a vector database of pre-computed schema embeddings, and
(ii) a SQL Generator fine-tuned in two stages-supervised fine-tuning followed
by execution-guided reinforcement-enabling self-correction without costly
multi-candidate generation. On BIRD, LitE-SQL achieves 72.10% execution
accuracy, and on Spider 1.0 it reaches 88.45%, demonstrating comparable or
superior performance to LLM-based methods despite using 2x to 30x fewer
parameters. Our findings demonstrate that high-quality Text-to-SQL generation
is feasible with lightweight models, offering a practical solution for
privacy-sensitive and resource-constrained settings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current performance of LLMs in AES is highly sensitive to the prompts, necessitating a more reliable method to improve consistency and alignment with human evaluations.

Method: The proposed method involves prompting LLMs to iteratively refine their scoring rubrics by reflecting on scoring rationales and discrepancies between model-generated scores and human scores.

Result: Experiments on TOEFL11 and ASAP datasets with LLMs like GPT-4.1 showed Quadratic Weighted Kappa (QWK) improvements up to 0.19 and 0.47, achieving results comparable or better than human-authored rubrics.

Conclusion: Iterative rubric refinement substantially enhances LLM-based AES, achieving better alignment with human scoring and emphasizing the importance of continual improvement in rubric design.

Abstract: The performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) is highly sensitive to the
prompts they are given. Drawing inspiration from the field of prompt
optimization, this study investigates the potential for enhancing Automated
Essay Scoring (AES) by refining the scoring rubrics used by LLMs. Specifically,
our approach prompts models to iteratively refine rubrics by reflecting on
models' own scoring rationales and observed discrepancies with human scores on
sample essays. Experiments on the TOEFL11 and ASAP datasets using GPT-4.1,
Gemini-2.5-Pro, and Qwen-3-Next-80B-A3B-Instruct show Quadratic Weighted Kappa
(QWK) improvements of up to 0.19 and 0.47, respectively. Notably, even with a
simple initial rubric, our approach achieves comparable or better QWK than
using detailed human-authored rubrics. Our findings highlight the importance of
iterative rubric refinement in LLM-based AES to enhance alignment with human
evaluations.

TL;DR: This study creates a Bangla-transliterated Chakma dataset, fine-tunes various transformer models, and observes improved performance for multilingual modeling in Chakma.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Chakma is an underrepresented Indo-Aryan language with limited language model data, motivating the need to address this gap with new datasets and modeling techniques.

Method: A novel Bangla-transliterated Chakma corpus was created, validated by native speakers, and used to fine-tune six encoder-based transformer models under masked language modeling.

Result: Fine-tuned multilingual models achieved up to 73.54% token accuracy and a perplexity as low as 2.90, outperforming pre-trained counterparts.

Conclusion: Bangla-transliterated Chakma can effectively aid transfer learning for Chakma and highlights the importance of quality datasets for low-resource languages.

Abstract: As an Indo-Aryan language with limited available data, Chakma remains largely
underrepresented in language models. In this work, we introduce a novel corpus
of contextually coherent Bangla-transliterated Chakma, curated from Chakma
literature, and validated by native speakers. Using this dataset, we fine-tune
six encoder-based multilingual and regional transformer models (mBERT,
XLM-RoBERTa, DistilBERT, DeBERTaV3, BanglaBERT, and IndicBERT) on masked
language modeling (MLM) tasks. Our experiments show that fine-tuned
multilingual models outperform their pre-trained counterparts when adapted to
Bangla-transliterated Chakma, achieving up to 73.54% token accuracy and a
perplexity as low as 2.90. Our analysis further highlights the impact of data
quality on model performance and shows the limitations of OCR pipelines for
morphologically rich Indic scripts. Our research demonstrates that
Bangla-transliterated Chakma can be very effective for transfer learning for
Chakma language, and we release our manually validated monolingual dataset to
encourage further research on multilingual language modeling for low-resource
languages.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper investigates whether large language models can distinguish between factual and hallucinated outputs using internal computations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the question of whether LLMs can reliably differentiate between true and false outputs based on their internal states.

Method: Mechanistic analysis comparing the internal representations of LLMs for two types of hallucinated outputs: those associated with subject knowledge and those detached from subject knowledge.

Result: LLMs show overlapping hidden-state geometries for hallucinations tied to subject knowledge but distinct clustered representations for hallucinations detached from subject knowledge.

Conclusion: LLMs do not encode truthfulness but only knowledge recall patterns, highlighting their inability to recognize what they don't know.

Abstract: Recent work suggests that large language models (LLMs) encode factuality
signals in their internal representations, such as hidden states, attention
weights, or token probabilities, implying that LLMs may "know what they don't
know". However, LLMs can also produce factual errors by relying on shortcuts or
spurious associations. These error are driven by the same training objective
that encourage correct predictions, raising the question of whether internal
computations can reliably distinguish between factual and hallucinated outputs.
In this work, we conduct a mechanistic analysis of how LLMs internally process
factual queries by comparing two types of hallucinations based on their
reliance on subject information. We find that when hallucinations are
associated with subject knowledge, LLMs employ the same internal recall process
as for correct responses, leading to overlapping and indistinguishable
hidden-state geometries. In contrast, hallucinations detached from subject
knowledge produce distinct, clustered representations that make them
detectable. These findings reveal a fundamental limitation: LLMs do not encode
truthfulness in their internal states but only patterns of knowledge recall,
demonstrating that "LLMs don't really know what they don't know".

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A novel multilingual Urdu-English model (Alif-1.0-8B-Instruct) was developed using a unique self-instruct technique to address challenges in low-resource languages like Urdu. It outperforms existing leading models in Urdu-specific tasks and is budget-friendly.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation behind the paper is to address challenges in developing high-performing large language models for low-resource languages, such as the scarcity of quality datasets and the need for culturally nuanced and ethically aligned translations.

Method: The authors introduced a multilingual synthetic dataset (Urdu-Instruct) using a modified self-instruct technique with unique prompts and seed values. This dataset integrates Urdu-native reasoning, bilingual translation, cultural relevance, and ethical safety alignments.

Result: The trained model, Alif-1.0-8B-Instruct, outperforms leading multilingual models (such as Mistral-7B and Qwen-2.5-7B) for Urdu-specific tasks. It shows superior performance compared to its baseline Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct within a budget of under $100.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that efficient, culturally-aligned, and high-performance LLMs for low-resource languages like Urdu can be developed using the proposed modified self-instruct approach.

Abstract: Developing a high-performing large language models (LLMs) for low-resource
languages such as Urdu, present several challenges. These challenges include
the scarcity of high-quality datasets, multilingual inconsistencies, and safety
concerns. Existing multilingual LLMs often address these issues by translating
large volumes of available data. However, such translations often lack quality
and cultural nuance while also incurring significant costs for data curation
and training. To address these issues, we propose Alif-1.0-8B-Instruct, a
multilingual Urdu-English model, that tackles these challenges with a unique
approach. We train the model on a high-quality, multilingual synthetic dataset
(Urdu-Instruct), developed using a modified self-instruct technique. By using
unique prompts and seed values for each task along with a global task pool,
this dataset incorporates Urdu-native chain-of-thought based reasoning,
bilingual translation, cultural relevance, and ethical safety alignments. This
technique significantly enhances the comprehension of Alif-1.0-8B-Instruct
model for Urdu-specific tasks. As a result, Alif-1.0-8B-Instruct, built upon
the pretrained Llama-3.1-8B, demonstrates superior performance compared to
Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct for Urdu specific-tasks. It also outperformed leading
multilingual LLMs, including Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.3, Qwen-2.5-7B-Instruct,
and Cohere-Aya-Expanse-8B, all within a training budget of under $100. Our
results demonstrate that high-performance and low-resource language LLMs can be
developed efficiently and culturally aligned using our modified self-instruct
approach. All datasets, models, and code are publicly available at:

*Chung-En Sun,Ge Yan,Akshay Kulkarni,Tsui-Wei Weng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces ReFIne, a framework for training reasoning systems to enhance interpretability, faithfulness, and reliability, alongside accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for trustworthy reasoning systems arises from existing methods prioritizing answer accuracy over aspects like interpretability, faithfulness, and reliability essential for user trust.

Method: ReFIne combines supervised fine-tuning with GRPO to encourage structured reasoning traces, clear disclosures of decisive information, and self-assessments of derivation soundness and confidence.

Result: Experiments on Qwen3 models show substantial gains in interpretability (+44.0%), faithfulness (+18.8%), and reliability (+42.4%) when ReFIne is applied.

Conclusion: Reasoning models should be optimized for trustworthiness along with accuracy, emphasizing interpretability, faithfulness, and reliability.

Abstract: Recent advances in long chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning have largely
prioritized answer accuracy and token efficiency, while overlooking aspects
critical to trustworthiness. We argue that usable reasoning systems must be
trustworthy, characterized by three properties: interpretability, faithfulness,
and reliability. To this end, we propose ReFIne, a new training framework that
integrates supervised fine-tuning with GRPO to encourage models to: (i) improve
interpretability by producing structured, tag-based traces with high-level
planning that are easier for humans to follow; (ii) enhance faithfulness by
explicitly disclosing the decisive information guiding each solution, with
consistent cross-section references; and (iii) promote reliability by providing
self-assessments of both the derivation's soundness and the confidence of the
final answer. We apply ReFIne to the Qwen3 models at multiple scales
(1.7B/4B/8B) and evaluate across mathematical benchmarks of varying difficulty.
Our experimental results show that ReFIne models generate clearer and
better-structured reasoning traces (interpretability +44.0%), more faithfully
expose their underlying decision process (faithfulness +18.8%), and offer
informative confidence estimates (reliability +42.4%). These findings highlight
an overlooked but important direction: reasoning models should be optimized not
only for accuracy, but also for broader dimensions of trustworthiness. Our code

Motivation: To explore the potential of CLMs like GPT and Llama for semantic frame induction tasks, which have primarily utilized masked language models (MLMs) so far.

Method: FrameEOL combines CLMs, in-context learning (ICL), and deep metric learning (DML) to generate embeddings, which are then clustered for semantic frame induction.

Result: The proposed approach achieved superior performance over existing methods on English and Japanese FrameNet datasets, especially excelling for Japanese with minimal examples.

Conclusion: CLMs can effectively perform semantic frame induction and provide a viable alternative to MLM-based methods, particularly for languages with limited semantic frame resources.

Abstract: Semantic frame induction is the task of clustering frame-evoking words
according to the semantic frames they evoke. In recent years, leveraging
embeddings of frame-evoking words that are obtained using masked language
models (MLMs) such as BERT has led to high-performance semantic frame
induction. Although causal language models (CLMs) such as the GPT and Llama
series succeed in a wide range of language comprehension tasks and can engage
in dialogue as if they understood frames, they have not yet been applied to
semantic frame induction. We propose a new method for semantic frame induction
based on CLMs. Specifically, we introduce FrameEOL, a prompt-based method for
obtaining Frame Embeddings that outputs One frame-name as a Label representing
the given situation. To obtain embeddings more suitable for frame induction, we
leverage in-context learning (ICL) and deep metric learning (DML). Frame
induction is then performed by clustering the resulting embeddings.
Experimental results on the English and Japanese FrameNet datasets demonstrate
that the proposed methods outperform existing frame induction methods. In
particular, for Japanese, which lacks extensive frame resources, the CLM-based
method using only 5 ICL examples achieved comparable performance to the
MLM-based method fine-tuned with DML.

### [102] [When Retrieval Succeeds and Fails: Rethinking Retrieval-Augmented Generation for LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09106)
*Yongjie Wang,Yue Yu,Kaisong Song,Jun Lin,Zhiqi Shen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper reviews Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), examining its benefits, limitations, and specific applications where it significantly improves the effectiveness of Large Language Models (LLMs).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of Large Language Models in accessing dynamic or domain-specific information and to evaluate the evolving role of Retrieval-Augmented Generation as LLMs improve.

Method: The authors conducted a comprehensive review of RAG, analysing its objectives, components, challenges, and use cases where it enhances LLMs' performance.

Result: The study identifies the critical weaknesses of RAG and highlights scenarios in which RAG significantly outperforms the standalone capabilities of LLMs.

Conclusion: The paper encourages researchers to rethink RAG's role and calls for advancements in next-generation RAG systems to maintain relevance alongside more capable LLMs.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have enabled a wide range of applications
through their powerful capabilities in language understanding and generation.
However, as LLMs are trained on static corpora, they face difficulties in
addressing rapidly evolving information or domain-specific queries.
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) was developed to overcome this limitation
by integrating LLMs with external retrieval mechanisms, allowing them to access
up-to-date and contextually relevant knowledge. However, as LLMs themselves
continue to advance in scale and capability, the relative advantages of
traditional RAG frameworks have become less pronounced and necessary. Here, we
present a comprehensive review of RAG, beginning with its overarching
objectives and core components. We then analyze the key challenges within RAG,
highlighting critical weakness that may limit its effectiveness. Finally, we
showcase applications where LLMs alone perform inadequately, but where RAG,
when combined with LLMs, can substantially enhance their effectiveness. We hope
this work will encourage researchers to reconsider the role of RAG and inspire
the development of next-generation RAG systems.

*Enze Zhang,Jiaying Wang,Mengxi Xiao,Jifei Liu,Ziyan Kuang,Rui Dong,Youzhong Dong,Sophia Ananiadou,Min Peng,Qianqian Xie*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces DITING and AgentEval frameworks for evaluating web novel translations, focusing on narrative and cultural fidelity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks for machine translation lack the ability to capture the unique traits of web novels.

Method: The paper proposed DITING, with expert annotations across six translation dimensions, and AgentEval, a multi-agent reasoning framework for better quality assessment.

Result: Chinese-trained LLMs outperform foreign counterparts, and DeepSeek-V3 excels in delivering faithful translations.

Conclusion: The research establishes a paradigm for web novel translation evaluation and provides resources for advancing translation studies.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have substantially advanced machine translation
(MT), yet their effectiveness in translating web novels remains unclear.
Existing benchmarks rely on surface-level metrics that fail to capture the
distinctive traits of this genre. To address these gaps, we introduce DITING,
the first comprehensive evaluation framework for web novel translation,
assessing narrative and cultural fidelity across six dimensions: idiom
translation, lexical ambiguity, terminology localization, tense consistency,
zero-pronoun resolution, and cultural safety, supported by over 18K
expert-annotated Chinese-English sentence pairs. We further propose AgentEval,
a reasoning-driven multi-agent evaluation framework that simulates expert
deliberation to assess translation quality beyond lexical overlap, achieving
the highest correlation with human judgments among seven tested automatic
metrics. To enable metric comparison, we develop MetricAlign, a meta-evaluation
dataset of 300 sentence pairs annotated with error labels and scalar quality
scores. Comprehensive evaluation of fourteen open, closed, and commercial
models reveals that Chinese-trained LLMs surpass larger foreign counterparts,
and that DeepSeek-V3 delivers the most faithful and stylistically coherent
translations. Our work establishes a new paradigm for exploring LLM-based web
novel translation and provides public resources to advance future research.

*Seiya Ishikura,Hiroaki Yamada,Tatsuya Hiraoka,Hiroaki Yamada,Takenobu Tokunaga*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Augmenting dialog data with think-aloud utterances (TAUs) enables LLMs to better mimic individual personality traits, specifically Agreeableness and Neuroticism.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding how large language models (LLMs) can be trained to better replicate human personality traits using augmented data.

Method: LLMs were trained using dialog data augmented with think-aloud utterances (TAUs), verbalized thoughts preceding articulated speech.

Result: LLMs trained with TAU-augmented data more accurately aligned to human Agreeableness and Neuroticism traits under the Big Five framework compared to those trained with original dialog data.

Conclusion: TAU-augmented LLMs demonstrate improved alignment with human personality traits and the quality of such augmentation significantly impacts performance.

Abstract: This study proposes augmenting dialog data with think-aloud utterances (TAUs)
for modeling individual personalities in text chat by LLM. TAU is a
verbalization of a speaker's thought before articulating the utterance. We
expect "persona LLMs" trained with TAU-augmented data can mimic the speaker's
personality trait better. We tested whether the trained persona LLMs obtain the
human personality with respect to Big Five, a framework characterizing human
personality traits from five aspects. The results showed that LLMs trained with
TAU-augmented data more closely align to the speakers' Agreeableness and
Neuroticism of Big Five than those trained with original dialog data. We also
found that the quality of TAU-augmentation impacts persona LLM's performance.

### [105] [Stronger Re-identification Attacks through Reasoning and Aggregation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09184)
*Lucas Georges Gabriel Charpentier,Pierre Lison*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces strategies to enhance re-identification attacks for assessing the robustness of text de-identification techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate the effectiveness of text de-identification methods by leveraging automated adversaries for re-identification.

Method: Two complementary strategies are proposed: analyzing multiple orderings of PII spans and incorporating reasoning models to improve reverse identification.

Result: Enhanced re-identification performance with aggregated ordering predictions and reasoning models using extensive background knowledge.

Conclusion: Advanced strategies for re-identification can offer crucial insights into the limitations and potential improvements of text de-identification methods.

Abstract: Text de-identification techniques are often used to mask personally
identifiable information (PII) from documents. Their ability to conceal the
identity of the individuals mentioned in a text is, however, hard to measure.
Recent work has shown how the robustness of de-identification methods could be
assessed by attempting the reverse process of _re-identification_, based on an
automated adversary using its background knowledge to uncover the PIIs that
have been masked. This paper presents two complementary strategies to build
stronger re-identification attacks. We first show that (1) the _order_ in which
the PII spans are re-identified matters, and that aggregating predictions
across multiple orderings leads to improved results. We also find that (2)
reasoning models can boost the re-identification performance, especially when
the adversary is assumed to have access to extensive background knowledge.

*Changjiang Gao,Zixian Huang,Jingyang Gong,Shujian Huang,Lei Li,Fei Yuan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper addresses the challenge of enhancing reasoning capabilities in translation-focused large language models. The proposed approach, layer-selective tuning on instruct LLMs, results in improved translation performance and maintains reasoning abilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large language models designed for translation often underperform on reasoning tasks, and there is a need for a method that combines reasoning and translation improvement across multiple languages.

Method: The authors propose a translation-enhanced recipe using instruct LLMs and apply layer-selective tuning on parallel data. They introduce the Qwen3-XPlus models to validate the method.

Result: Qwen3-XPlus achieves significant gains in translation accuracy, especially in low-resource languages, while also improving multilingual task performance by an average of 1+ points across seven tasks. The model retains reasoning ability similar to baseline models.

Conclusion: This approach advances multilingual translation capabilities while keeping reasoning proficiency intact, with reduced complexity and enhanced accessibility. The model and code are publicly available for further adoption.

Abstract: General Large Language Models (LLMs) excel in reasoning, but those enhanced
for translation struggle with reasoning tasks. To address this, we propose a
novel translationenhanced recipe that begins with instruct models and applies
layer-selective tuning only on parallel data. Following this pipeline, we
introduce the Qwen3-XPlus models, which demonstrate significant improvements in
translation performance across both high- and lowresource languages, achieving
15+ spBLEU and 40+ xComet in low-resource languages, like Swahili.
Interestingly, training only with small parallel datasets, Qwen3-XPlus achieves
an average improvement of 1+ points on 7 multilingual tasks while maintaining
proficiency comparable to the Qwen3 instruct model in 15 popular reasoning
datasets. This work offers a promising approach to multilingual enhancement,
significantly reducing complexity and enhancing accessibility for a wider range
of languages. The code and model are publicly available.

### [107] [DICE: Structured Reasoning in LLMs through SLM-Guided Chain-of-Thought Correction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09211)
*Yiqi Li,Yusheng Liao,Zhe Chen,Yanfeng Wang,Yu Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces DICE, a framework for refining LLM outputs using small language models, resulting in improved format accuracy and content correctness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large language models struggle to adhere to strict user-specific output requirements while reasoning. Fine-tuning them is computationally expensive and challenging due to limited access to parameters.

Method: DICE uses small language models to refine the LLM outputs through chain-of-thought correction, involving dataset construction and dual-tuning strategies for structured outputs.

Result: Experiments show DICE improves the format accuracy by 35.4% and content correctness by 29.4%, outperforming other frameworks.

Conclusion: DICE proves to be a lightweight and effective approach for refining LLM outputs, maintaining reasoning capabilities while meeting structured output specifications.

Abstract: When performing reasoning tasks with user-specific requirements, such as
strict output formats, large language models (LLMs) often prioritize reasoning
over adherence to detailed instructions. Fine-tuning LLMs on supervised
datasets to address this is impractical due to high computational costs and
limited parameter access. To tackle this, we propose DICE, a lightweight
framework that guides small language models (SLMs) to refine LLMs' outputs
through chain-of-thought (CoT) correction. DICE decouples the process by first
prompting LLMs to generate natural language responses, then using trained SLMs
to analyze and refine these outputs to meet structured output specifications.
This framework preserves LLMs' broad knowledge and reasoning capabilities while
ensuring the outputs conform to user demands. Specifically, DICE first
constructs structured CoT adaptation datasets via a two-stage method and
subsequently applies a dual-tuning strategy to fine-tune SLMs for generating
structured outputs in an analyze-then-answer pattern. Experiments demonstrate
that DICE improves the average format accuracy and content correctness of LLM
outputs by 35.4\% and 29.4\%, respectively, achieving state-of-the-art (SOTA)
performance over other competitive baselines.

*Tao Feng,Lizhen Qu,Niket Tandon,Gholamreza Haffari*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: IRIS is a hybrid framework combining statistical algorithms and LLM methods for real-time causal discovery without pre-existing datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional causal discovery methods struggle with data collection costs, redundant computation, and unrealistic assumptions. LLM-based methods excel at known relations but fail to identify novel causal ones.

Method: IRIS uses a hybrid approach combining statistical methods with LLM-based techniques. It automatically gathers documents, extracts variables, identifies missing variables, and builds causal relations iteratively.

Result: IRIS demonstrates the ability to create causal graphs in real-time using initial variables, expanding them by discovering missing variables and relations.

Conclusion: IRIS addresses limitations in causal discovery, enabling effective real-time discovery of both known and novel causal relations without depending on pre-existing datasets.

Abstract: Causal discovery is fundamental to scientific research, yet traditional
statistical algorithms face significant challenges, including expensive data
collection, redundant computation for known relations, and unrealistic
assumptions. While recent LLM-based methods excel at identifying commonly known
causal relations, they fail to uncover novel relations. We introduce IRIS
(Iterative Retrieval and Integrated System for Real-Time Causal Discovery), a
novel framework that addresses these limitations. Starting with a set of
initial variables, IRIS automatically collects relevant documents, extracts
variables, and uncovers causal relations. Our hybrid causal discovery method
combines statistical algorithms and LLM-based methods to discover known and
novel causal relations. In addition to causal discovery on initial variables,
the missing variable proposal component of IRIS identifies and incorporates
missing variables to expand the causal graphs. Our approach enables real-time
causal discovery from only a set of initial variables without requiring
pre-existing datasets.

*Giacomo Gonella,Gian Maria Campedelli,Stefano Menini,Marco Guerini*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces CrisiText, a large-scale dataset designed for generating warning messages during crisis situations. It includes over 400,000 messages and investigates various NLP methods for generation and evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to enhance AI's utilization in generating timely and effective warning messages, addressing gaps in current NLP applications that focus mostly on classification tasks during crises.

Method: The researchers created CrisiText by compiling crisis descriptions, generating event chains, and pairing events with expert-guided warning messages, alongside suboptimal warning types. They then tested supervised, zero-shot, few-shot approaches, and post-editors.

Result: Results showcased the performance of different NLG approaches, including preference alignment and supervised fine-tuning. The model was also tested in out-of-distribution scenarios.

Conclusion: CrisiText proves to be a significant resource for studying and improving automation of crisis warning systems using NLP and NLG techniques.

Abstract: Effectively identifying threats and mitigating their potential damage during
crisis situations, such as natural disasters or violent attacks, is paramount
for safeguarding endangered individuals. To tackle these challenges, AI has
been used in assisting humans in emergency situations. Still, the use of NLP
techniques remains limited and mostly focuses on classification tasks. The
significant potential of timely warning message generation using NLG
architectures, however, has been largely overlooked. In this paper we present
CrisiText, the first large-scale dataset for the generation of warning messages
across 13 different types of crisis scenarios. The dataset contains more than
400,000 warning messages (spanning almost 18,000 crisis situations) aimed at
assisting civilians during and after such events. To generate the dataset, we
started from existing crisis descriptions and created chains of events related
to the scenarios. Each event was then paired with a warning message. The
generations follow experts' written guidelines to ensure correct terminology
and factuality of their suggestions. Additionally, each message is accompanied
by three suboptimal warning types to allow for the study of different NLG
approaches. To this end, we conducted a series of experiments comparing
supervised fine-tuning setups with preference alignment, zero-shot, and
few-shot approaches. We further assessed model performance in
out-of-distribution scenarios and evaluated the effectiveness of an automatic
post-editor.

*Chenyang Gu,Yewen Pu,Bruce Yang,Xiaofan Li,Huan Gao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces DSPO (Dynamic-filter Sequence-level Policy Optimization), an RL algorithm for training LLMs to handle multi-turn search and reasoning without supervised data, improving performance significantly on QA benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for enhancing LLMs with external knowledge searching capabilities face either reliability issues using prompting or challenges with RL on complex tasks. This limits their full potential.

Method: They developed DSPO, an RL approach with sequence-level optimization and dynamic sample filtering. The model trains without supervised data for multi-turn search and reasoning.

Result: The DSPO-trained 7B model showed a 34.1% improvement over prior comparable models and outperformed a 14B model in complex QA tasks, such as HotpotQA, by nearly 9%.

Conclusion: DSPO enables LLMs to achieve robust training stability and significantly improves reasoning and search performance, bridging gaps in RL for complex interactive tasks.

Abstract: Enhancing LLMs with the ability to actively search external knowledge is
crucial for complex and real-world tasks. Current approaches either rely on
prompting to elicit the model's innate agent capabilities, or suffer from
performance ceilings and collapse when applying RL to complex interactive
tasks, leaving their true agentic potential untapped. To address this, we
introduce \textbf{D}ynamic-filter \textbf{S}equence-level \textbf{P}olicy
\textbf{O}ptimization (DSPO), an improved RL algorithm designed for robust
agent training through sequence-level optimization and dynamic sample
filtering. We train our model purely through RL to interleave multi-turn search
and reasoning, obviating the need for supervised demonstration data. Across
multiple QA benchmarks, our DSPO-trained 7B model improves over a comparable
previous work by \textbf{34.1\%}, and even outperforms the 14B model from
previous work in complex multihop QA such as HotpotQA by nearly \textbf{9\%
relative}, maintaining exceptional training stability.

### [111] [Detecting Data Contamination from Reinforcement Learning Post-training for Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09259)
*Yongding Tao,Tian Wang,Yihong Dong,Huanyu Liu,Kechi Zhang,Xiaolong Hu,Ge Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper emphasizes data contamination risks for Large Language Models (LLMs) during the RL post-training phase and introduces a detection method called Self-Critique, which significantly outperforms existing solutions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation lies in addressing the vulnerability of LLM evaluation due to data contamination in the RL post-training phase, which lacks specialized detection methods unlike earlier training phases.

Method: The proposed Self-Critique method detects contamination by analyzing the entropy collapse of LLMs after RL training, indicating policy collapse to narrow reasoning paths. Additionally, a benchmark (RL-MIA) is introduced for simulating contamination scenarios.

Result: Self-Critique shows superior performance, outperforming other methods by up to 30% in AUC across various models and contamination tasks, making contamination detection in the RL phase viable.

Conclusion: The study highlights the critical vulnerability of RL-based LLM training to contamination and demonstrates the effectiveness of Self-Critique in bridging this detection gap.

Abstract: Data contamination poses a significant threat to the reliable evaluation of
Large Language Models (LLMs). This issue arises when benchmark samples may
inadvertently appear in training sets, compromising the validity of reported
performance. While detection methods have been developed for the pre-training
and Supervised Fine-Tuning stages, a critical research gap exists for the
increasingly significant phase of Reinforcement Learning (RL) post-training. As
RL post-training becomes pivotal for advancing LLM reasoning, the absence of
specialized contamination detection methods in this paradigm presents a
critical vulnerability. To address this, we conduct the first systematic study
of data detection within RL post-training scenario and propose Self-Critique.
Our method is motivated by a key observation: after RL phase, the output
entropy distribution of LLMs tends to collapse into highly specific and sparse
modes. Self-Critique probes for the underlying policy collapse, i.e., the
model's convergence to a narrow reasoning path, which causes this entropy
reduction. To facilitate this research, we also introduce RL-MIA, a benchmark
constructed to simulate this specific contamination scenario. Extensive
experiments show that Self-Critique significantly outperforms baseline methods
across multiple models and contamination tasks, achieving an AUC improvement of
up to 30%. Whereas existing methods are close to a random guess for RL-phase
contamination, our method makes detection possible.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces CFVBench, a multimodal benchmark for evaluating video-based Multimodal Retrieval-Augmented Generation (MRAG) systems. It highlights issues in existing models and proposes Adaptive Visual Refinement (AVR) to address these challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address shortcomings in current video-based benchmark tasks, which lack modality diversity and fine-grained scene understanding, and to improve the evaluation of multimodal large language models (MLLMs).

Method: The authors created CFVBench, a benchmark with 599 videos and 5,360 QA pairs, emphasizing complex tasks requiring multimodal reasoning. Additionally, they propose an Adaptive Visual Refinement (AVR) framework for improved video analysis.

Result: The evaluation of 7 retrieval methods and 14 MLLMs reveals that existing models fail in capturing essential fine-grained multimodal details. However, implementing AVR demonstrates consistent improvements in model comprehension and performance.

Conclusion: CFVBench and the AVR framework provide valuable tools for advancing the capabilities of MLLMs, addressing limitations in fine-grained multimodal retrieval and reasoning.

Abstract: Multimodal Retrieval-Augmented Generation (MRAG) enables Multimodal Large
Language Models (MLLMs) to generate responses with external multimodal
evidence, and numerous video-based MRAG benchmarks have been proposed to
evaluate model capabilities across retrieval and generation stages. However,
existing benchmarks remain limited in modality coverage and format diversity,
often focusing on single- or limited-modality tasks, or coarse-grained scene
understanding. To address these gaps, we introduce CFVBench, a large-scale,
manually verified benchmark constructed from 599 publicly available videos,
yielding 5,360 open-ended QA pairs. CFVBench spans high-density formats and
domains such as chart-heavy reports, news broadcasts, and software tutorials,
requiring models to retrieve and reason over long temporal video spans while
maintaining fine-grained multimodal information. Using CFVBench, we
systematically evaluate 7 retrieval methods and 14 widely-used MLLMs, revealing
a critical bottleneck: current models (even GPT5 or Gemini) struggle to capture
transient yet essential fine-grained multimodal details. To mitigate this, we
propose Adaptive Visual Refinement (AVR), a simple yet effective framework that
adaptively increases frame sampling density and selectively invokes external
tools when necessary. Experiments show that AVR consistently enhances
fine-grained multimodal comprehension and improves performance across all
evaluated MLLMs

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces DyReMe, a dynamic benchmark for evaluating large language models (LLMs) in medical diagnostics, addressing shortcomings of static benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of current evaluation methods for LLMs in medical diagnostics, which overestimate performance and ignore real-world complexity.

Method: DyReMe generates dynamic, consultation-like cases with distractors and varying expression styles, and evaluates LLMs on accuracy, veracity, helpfulness, and consistency.

Result: Experiments reveal that DyReMe provides more challenging and realistic evaluations, uncovering significant misalignments between LLM performance and actual clinical practice.

Conclusion: DyReMe highlights the need for realistic evaluation frameworks to improve the reliability and trustworthiness of LLMs in medical diagnostics.

Abstract: Medical diagnostics is a high-stakes and complex domain that is critical to
patient care. However, current evaluations of large language models (LLMs) are
fundamentally misaligned with real-world clinical practice. Most of them rely
on static benchmarks derived from public medical exam items, which tend to
overestimate model performance and ignore the difference between textbook cases
and the ambiguous, varying conditions in the real world. Recent efforts toward
dynamic evaluation offer a promising alternative, but their improvements are
limited to superficial perturbations and a narrow focus on accuracy. To address
these gaps, we propose DyReMe, a dynamic benchmark for medical diagnostics that
better reflects real clinical practice. Unlike static exam-style questions,
DyReMe generates fresh, consultation-like cases that introduce distractors such
as differential diagnoses and common misdiagnosis factors. It also varies
expression styles to mimic diverse real-world query habits. Beyond accuracy,
DyReMe evaluates LLMs on three additional clinically relevant dimensions:
veracity, helpfulness, and consistency. Our experiments demonstrate that this
dynamic approach yields more challenging and realistic assessments, revealing
significant misalignments between the performance of state-of-the-art LLMs and
real clinical practice. These findings highlight the urgent need for evaluation
frameworks that better reflect the demands of trustworthy medical diagnostics.

*Jiuheng Lin,Cong Jiang,Zirui Wu,Jiarui Sun,Yansong Feng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CLARity is a cost-effective RL framework designed to improve reasoning consistency and accuracy for training LLMs in domains with limited data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Training domain-specific LLMs with scarce data presents challenges, particularly in maintaining reasoning quality while leveraging reinforcement learning.

Method: CLARity employs a consistency-aware reward system, a refine-then-monitor pipeline for training, and dynamic data reformulation to maximize limited data usage.

Result: The framework boosts response consistency by 16.5% and accuracy by 7.5% compared to baseline methods, with additional human evaluations validating improvements in coherence and professionalism.

Conclusion: CLARity offers a practical and generalizable approach to guiding expert models in reasoning consistency using smaller, general-purpose LLMs, making it an effective solution for domains with scarce data.

Abstract: Training expert LLMs in domains with scarce data is difficult, often relying
on multiple-choice questions (MCQs). However, standard outcome-based
reinforcement learning (RL) on MCQs is risky. While it may improve accuracy, we
observe it often degrades reasoning quality such as logical consistency.
Existing solutions to supervise reasoning, such as large-scale Process Reward
Models (PRMs), are prohibitively expensive. To address this, we propose
CLARity, a cost-effective RL framework that enhances reasoning quality using
only a small, general-purpose LLM. CLARity integrates a consistency-aware
reward mechanism with a 2-stage refine-then-monitor training pipeline to
enhance reasoning consistency, and a dynamic data reformulation strategy to to
better exploit limited data. Experiments demonstrate that CLARity improves
response consistency by 16.5% and accuracy by 7.5% over baselines. Human
evaluations further confirm holistic improvements in coherence and
professionalism. Thus, CLARity offers a generalizable solution that enables
smaller models to effectively guide expert models by reasoning consistency.Our

*Kohei Oda,Po-Min Chuang,Kiyoaki Shirai,Natthawut Kertkeidkachorn*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DualCSE is a new sentence embedding method designed to address implicit semantics, offering two embeddings per sentence for improved downstream tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional sentence embedding methods fail to fully capture implicit semantics, limiting their effectiveness in diverse applications.

Method: DualCSE introduces two coexisting embeddings for each sentence‚Äîone for explicit semantics and another for implicit semantics‚Äîwithin a shared vector space.

Result: Experimental evidence shows DualCSE efficiently encodes both explicit and implicit meanings, thereby enhancing performance in tasks like information retrieval and text classification.

Conclusion: DualCSE successfully overcomes traditional embedding limitations by enabling semantic adaptability and better handling of implicit meanings, proving effective in practical usage.

Abstract: Sentence embedding methods have made remarkable progress, yet they still
struggle to capture the implicit semantics within sentences. This can be
attributed to the inherent limitations of conventional sentence embedding
methods that assign only a single vector per sentence. To overcome this
limitation, we propose DualCSE, a sentence embedding method that assigns two
embeddings to each sentence: one representing the explicit semantics and the
other representing the implicit semantics. These embeddings coexist in the
shared space, enabling the selection of the desired semantics for specific
purposes such as information retrieval and text classification. Experimental
results demonstrate that DualCSE can effectively encode both explicit and
implicit meanings and improve the performance of the downstream task.

*Jiapeng Wang,Changxin Tian,Kunlong Chen,Ziqi Liu,Jiaxin Mao,Wayne Xin Zhao,Zhiqiang Zhang,Jun Zhou*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces MaP, a framework to combat instability in the evaluation of Large Language Models during pre-training by integrating checkpoint merging and the Pass@k metric.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Evaluation during pre-training of LLMs suffers from instability due to training stochasticity and noisy measurement protocols, complicating analyses of true learning dynamics.

Method: The proposed MaP framework combines checkpoint merging, which averages model weights to stabilize parameters, and the Pass@k metric, which provides a robust statistical measure of capability.

Result: Experiments demonstrate that MaP smooths performance curves, lowers inter-run variance, and improves model ranking consistency, enhancing the reliability of evaluation.

Conclusion: MaP offers a more stable methodology for evaluating LLMs, providing a solid empirical foundation for advancing research in this area.

Abstract: Reliable evaluation is fundamental to the progress of Large Language Models
(LLMs), yet the evaluation process during pre-training is plagued by
significant instability that obscures true learning dynamics. In this work, we
systematically diagnose this instability, attributing it to two distinct
sources: \textit{Parameter Instability} from training stochasticity and
\textit{Evaluation Instability} from noisy measurement protocols. To counteract
both sources of noise, we introduce \textbf{MaP}, a dual-pronged framework that
synergistically integrates checkpoint \underline{M}erging \underline{a}nd the
\underline{P}ass@k metric. Checkpoint merging smooths the parameter space by
averaging recent model weights, while Pass@k provides a robust, low-variance
statistical estimate of model capability. Extensive experiments show that MaP
yields significantly smoother performance curves, reduces inter-run variance,
and ensures more consistent model rankings. Ultimately, MaP provides a more
reliable and faithful lens for observing LLM training dynamics, laying a
crucial empirical foundation for LLM research.

### [117] [ShiZhi: A Chinese Lightweight Large Language Model for Court View Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09297)
*Zhitian Hou,Kun Zeng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces ShiZhi, a large language model for generating court views in legal cases, achieving high accuracy and BLEU scores on a newly constructed dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenge of automatically generating court views in legal cases, which is hindered by case complexity and fact diversity.

Method: Developed ShiZhi, a specialized LLM trained on a new dataset (CCVG) with over 110K fact-to-court view pairings for Chinese legal cases.

Result: ShiZhi achieves 58.5 BLEU-1 in court view generation, 86.1% accuracy, and 92.5% macro F1 in charge prediction.

Conclusion: High-quality domain-specific data allows even small LLMs to generate legally coherent court views effectively, demonstrating the potential for further advancements in AI for legal fields.

Abstract: Criminal Court View Generation (CVG) is a fundamental task in legal
artificial intelligence, aiming to automatically generate the "Court View"
section of a legal case document. Generating court views is challenging due to
the diversity and complexity of case facts, and directly generating from raw
facts may limit performance. In this paper, we present ShiZhi, the first large
language model (LLM) specifically designed for court view generation. We
construct a Chinese Court View Generation dataset, CCVG, of more than 110K
cases, each containing fact descriptions paired with corresponding court views.
Based on this dataset, ShiZhi achieving 58.5 BLEU-1 on court view generation
and 86.1\% accuracy with 92.5\% macro F1 on charge prediction. Experimental
results demonstrate that even a small LLM can generate reasonable and legally
coherent court views when trained on high-quality domain-specific data. Our
model and dataset are available at

### [118] [Mask Tokens as Prophet: Fine-Grained Cache Eviction for Efficient dLLM Inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09309)
*Jianuo Huang,Yaojie Zhang,Yicun Yang,Benhao Huang,Biqing Qi,Dongrui Liu,Linfeng Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces MaskKV, a cache eviction framework optimized for diffusion large language models (dLLMs) to tackle their high memory and computation costs. MaskKV reduces cache size while maintaining high performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The heavy computational and memory demands of dLLMs due to bidirectional attention cache mechanisms make handling long contexts in resource-limited environments challenging. Existing cache eviction strategies for autoregressive models fail to address the specific needs of dLLMs.

Method: MaskKV introduces two innovations: (1) mask-query guided scoring to identify and evict less critical prompt tokens per attention head, and (2) adaptive cache budgeting that allocates resources differently across layers and heads.

Result: MaskKV retains 94% performance with only 5% of cache memory usage and achieves up to 31x acceleration for prompts as long as 32,000 tokens on LongBench.

Conclusion: MaskKV is a highly efficient and training-free framework tailored for dLLMs, offering significant resource optimization without substantial performance loss.

Abstract: Diffusion large language models (dLLMs) present a promising alternative to
dominant autoregressive models (ARMs) by the ability of parallel decoding at
the expense of substantial computation and memory costs. Specifically, the
cache mechanism for bidirectional attention in dLLMs demands large memory
footprint, restricting their ability to handle long contexts under
resource-limited settings. Existing cache eviction strategies are designed for
ARMs and ignore the unique characteristics of dLLMs, thus leading to
unsatisfactory performance. To address these challenges, we introduce MaskKV, a
training-free cache eviction framework tailored to dLLMs, focusing on the
effect of mask tokens in dLLMs. MaskKV is built on two key innovations: (1) a
mask-query guided scoring mechanism that leverages attention weights to
identify and evict less critical prompt tokens for each head; (2) an adaptive
cache budgeting strategy that improves efficiency by reducing allocation in
intermediate layers and concentrating resources on prompt-preferring heads. On
LLaDA with MaskKV, compressing the KV cache to only 256 pairs (less than 5% of
tokens) retains 94% of the full-cache performance on LongBench and achieves up
to 31x acceleration at 32k prompt length. The code is publicly available at:

### [119] [Verifying Chain-of-Thought Reasoning via Its Computational Graph](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09312)
*Zheng Zhao,Yeskendir Koishekenov,Xianjun Yang,Naila Murray,Nicola Cancedda*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes Circuit-based Reasoning Verification (CRV), a white-box method that leverages structural features in reasoning circuits to detect and intervene in reasoning errors of language models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current verification methods for Chain-of-Thought reasoning provide limited insights into computation errors, necessitating a deeper, causal understanding.

Method: The authors introduce CRV, which analyzes structural fingerprints of attribution graphs in reasoning circuits to predict correctness. They train classifiers on these structural features to identify reasoning errors.

Result: Structural signatures in reasoning circuits are highly predictive of correctness, domain-specific, and steerable for targeted interventions, enabling correction of faulty reasoning.

Conclusion: By scrutinizing the computational process of reasoning, CRV advances the detection and correction of reasoning errors from correlation-focused methods to causal understanding and intervention.

Abstract: Current Chain-of-Thought (CoT) verification methods predict reasoning
correctness based on outputs (black-box) or activations (gray-box), but offer
limited insight into why a computation fails. We introduce a white-box method:
Circuit-based Reasoning Verification (CRV). We hypothesize that attribution
graphs of correct CoT steps, viewed as execution traces of the model's latent
reasoning circuits, possess distinct structural fingerprints from those of
incorrect steps. By training a classifier on structural features of these
graphs, we show that these traces contain a powerful signal of reasoning
errors. Our white-box approach yields novel scientific insights unattainable by
other methods. (1) We demonstrate that structural signatures of error are
highly predictive, establishing the viability of verifying reasoning directly
via its computational graph. (2) We find these signatures to be highly
domain-specific, revealing that failures in different reasoning tasks manifest
as distinct computational patterns. (3) We provide evidence that these
signatures are not merely correlational; by using our analysis to guide
targeted interventions on individual transcoder features, we successfully
correct the model's faulty reasoning. Our work shows that, by scrutinizing a
model's computational process, we can move from simple error detection to a
deeper, causal understanding of LLM reasoning.

*Yu-Chen Lu,Chong-Yan Chen,Chi-Chih Chang,Yu-Fang Hu,Kai-Chiang Wu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces Fine-grained Low-Rank Compressor (FLRC), which enhances low-rank compression for large language models, achieving significant improvements in both efficiency and performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large language models have high deployment costs due to their large parameter counts, and existing low-rank compression techniques degrade performance and are inefficient during decoding.

Method: The FLRC method optimally allocates compression ranks to different layers and implements progressive low-rank decoding to counteract performance issues.

Result: The FLRC outperforms existing low-rank compression techniques, showing up to a 17% improvement in ROUGE-L for summarization tasks.

Conclusion: FLRC provides a more efficient and robust framework for compressing large language models, enabling better performance and improved inference.

Abstract: Although large language models (LLM) have achieved remarkable performance,
their enormous parameter counts hinder deployment on resource-constrained
hardware. Low-rank compression can reduce both memory usage and computational
demand, but applying a uniform compression ratio across all layers often leads
to significant performance degradation, and previous methods perform poorly
during decoding. To address these issues, we propose the Fine-grained Low-Rank
Compressor (FLRC), which efficiently determines an optimal rank allocation for
each layer, and incorporates progressive low-rank decoding to maintain text
generation quality. Comprehensive experiments on diverse benchmarks demonstrate
the superiority of FLRC, achieving up to a 17% improvement in ROUGE-L on
summarization tasks compared to state-of-the-art low-rank compression methods,
establishing a more robust and efficient framework to improve LLM inference.

### [121] [LLP: LLM-based Product Pricing in E-commerce](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09347)
*Hairu Wang,Sheng You,Qiheng Zhang,Xike Xie,Shuguang Han,Yuchen Wu,Fei Huang,Jufeng Chen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces LLP, an LLM-based framework for dynamic second-hand product pricing, demonstrating superior results and practical deployment on a major e-commerce platform.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Individual sellers on Consumer-to-Consumer platforms face challenges in setting dynamic prices for second-hand products. Existing static regression models fail to generalize well or reflect market dynamics.

Method: LLP retrieves similar products and uses Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate price suggestions. A two-stage optimization (supervised fine-tuning and GRPO) enhances LLM reasoning on retrieved data. A confidence-based filter rejects unreliable suggestions.

Result: LLP outperforms existing methods, generalizes to unseen categories, and demonstrates practical success on a large e-commerce platform by significantly increasing the static adoption rate.

Conclusion: LLP effectively addresses market dynamics in second-hand pricing, providing accurate and generalizable solutions, and showing real-world deployment benefits.

Abstract: Unlike Business-to-Consumer e-commerce platforms (e.g., Amazon),
inexperienced individual sellers on Consumer-to-Consumer platforms (e.g., eBay)
often face significant challenges in setting prices for their second-hand
products efficiently. Therefore, numerous studies have been proposed for
automating price prediction. However, most of them are based on static
regression models, which suffer from poor generalization performance and fail
to capture market dynamics (e.g., the price of a used iPhone decreases over
time). Inspired by recent breakthroughs in Large Language Models (LLMs), we
introduce LLP, the first LLM-based generative framework for second-hand product
pricing. LLP first retrieves similar products to better align with the dynamic
market change. Afterwards, it leverages the LLMs' nuanced understanding of key
pricing information in free-form text to generate accurate price suggestions.
To strengthen the LLMs' domain reasoning over retrieved products, we apply a
two-stage optimization, supervised fine-tuning (SFT) followed by group relative
policy optimization (GRPO), on a dataset built via bidirectional reasoning.
Moreover, LLP employs a confidence-based filtering mechanism to reject
unreliable price suggestions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that LLP
substantially surpasses existing methods while generalizing well to unseen
categories. We have successfully deployed LLP on Xianyu\footnote\{Xianyu is
China's largest second-hand e-commerce platform.\}, significantly outperforming
the previous pricing method. Under the same 30\% product coverage, it raises
the static adoption rate (SAR) from 40\% to 72\%, and maintains a strong SAR of
47\% even at 90\% recall.

*Francesco Maria Molfese,Luca Moroni,Ciro Porcaro,Simone Conia,Roberto Navigli*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SLMs show good final answer accuracy in commonsense tasks, but their reasoning processes are often flawed, leading to overestimation of capabilities by traditional evaluation metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current evaluation methods for SLMs focus on answer correctness but overlook the reasoning process. This creates a gap in assessing true commonsense reasoning capabilities.

Method: Introduction of ReTraceQA benchmark for process-level evaluation, employing both expert-annotated reasoning data and LLMs as automated judges to assess reasoning quality.

Result: SLMs demonstrated flawed reasoning in 14-24% of cases where their final answers were correct. Using reasoning-aware evaluation dropped their scores by up to 25%.

Conclusion: Existing metrics overestimate SLMs' capabilities; reasoning-aware evaluation provides a clearer understanding of their true performance in commonsense reasoning.

Abstract: While Small Language Models (SLMs) have demonstrated promising performance on
an increasingly wide array of commonsense reasoning benchmarks, current
evaluation practices rely almost exclusively on the accuracy of their final
answers, neglecting the validity of the reasoning processes that lead to those
answers. To address this issue, we introduce ReTraceQA, a novel benchmark that
introduces process-level evaluation for commonsense reasoning tasks. Our
expert-annotated dataset reveals that in a substantial portion of instances
(14-24%), SLMs provide correct final answers despite flawed reasoning
processes, suggesting that the capabilities of SLMs are often overestimated by
evaluation metrics that focus only on comparing the final answer with the
ground truth. Indeed, we show that when employing strong Large Language Models
(LLMs) as automated judges for reasoning-aware evaluation rather than
answer-only metrics, SLM performance drops significantly across all models and
datasets, with scores decreasing by up to 25%.

*Yunxiang Zhang,Muhammad Khalifa,Lechen Zhang,Xin Liu,Ayoung Lee,Xinliang Frederick Zhang,Farima Fatahi Bayat,Lu Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes ThinkLogit, a method enabling large non-reasoning models to perform long reasoning tasks using logit arithmetic and a smaller reasoning model as a guide. An enhanced version, ThinkLogit-DPO, further improves accuracy via preference optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to explore whether large models can exhibit behaviors like backtracking and self-correction for reasoning tasks without additional training.

Method: ThinkLogit employs logit arithmetic and a smaller reasoning model as a guider. ThinkLogit-DPO enhances this by training the guider model using preference optimization over correct/incorrect reasoning pairs.

Result: ThinkLogit boosts reasoning accuracy by 24.5%, while ThinkLogit-DPO achieves a 29.1% improvement across five benchmarks when guided by a smaller model. The method works across different model families.

Conclusion: ThinkLogit approaches unlock long reasoning capabilities in large models without post-training, offering a cost-effective way to enhance their reasoning accuracy and compatibility with pretrained smaller models.

Abstract: Large reasoning models exhibit long chain-of-thought reasoning with
strategies such as backtracking and self-correction, though recent studies
suggest that these abilities typically require additional training. We first
investigate whether such behaviors can be elicited without any training. To
this end, we propose a decoding-time approach, ThinkLogit, which utilizes logit
arithmetic to tune a target large non-reasoning model for long reasoning using
a substantially smaller reasoning model as the guider. We then show that we can
further boost its performance by training the guider model with preference
optimization over correct/incorrect reasoning pairs sampled from both the
target and guider model, a setup we refer to as ThinkLogit-DPO. Our experiments
demonstrate that ThinkLogit and ThinkLogit-DPO achieve a relative improvement
in average accuracy by 24.5% and 29.1%, respectively, over five reasoning
benchmarks using the Qwen2.5-32B guided by R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B, a model 21x
smaller. Moreover, we find that ThinkLogit remains effective when the guider
and target come from different model families. It is also orthogonal to
post-training methods for small models, as guiders improved through supervised
distillation or reinforcement learning can be directly plugged in to yield
stronger large models, offering a practical path to unlock long reasoning in
large-scale models without costly post-training.

### [124] [NL2GenSym: Natural Language to Generative Symbolic Rules for SOAR Cognitive Architecture via Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09355)
*Fang Yuan,Junjie Zeng,Yue Hu,Zhengqiu Zhu,Quanjun Yin,Yuxiang Xie*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces NL2GenSym, a framework integrating LLMs with the SOAR cognitive architecture to automate symbolic rule generation from natural language. Experiments show notable success in enhancing efficiency and accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SOAR's adoption is limited by manual rule coding, and LLMs offer potential for streamlining rule generation. There is a lack of experimental validation of such integrations.

Method: NL2GenSym employs an Execution-Grounded Generator-Critic mechanism. The Generator uses Retrieval-Augmented Generation for initial rule proposals, while the Critic iteratively refines rules based on feedback from execution in the SOAR environment.

Result: Experiments show the framework achieves 86% success in generating symbolic rules and reduces problem-solving decision cycles significantly. It also enables smaller models to outperform larger ones.

Conclusion: NL2GenSym demonstrates effective integration of LLMs with SOAR, successfully simplifying rule generation and improving efficiency and accuracy in problem-solving tasks.

Abstract: SOAR, a classic symbol-based cognitive architecture, has been fostering the
development of general, human-like intelligent agents. Nevertheless, its
practical adoption is hindered by the laborious manual rule coding. Emerging
Large Language Models (LLMs) present the immense potential for efficient rules
generation. However, there is a critical gap that current research
predominantly focuses on conceptual frameworks and lacks robust experimental
validation. To bridge this gap, we propose \textit{N}atural \textit{L}anguage
to \textit{Gen}erative \textit{Sym}bolic Rules (NL2GenSym), a novel framework
that integrates LLMs with SOAR to autonomously produce generative symbolic
rules from natural language. Specifically, our framework introduces a novel
Execution-Grounded Generator-Critic mechanism. The LLM-based Generator, guided
by a Retrieval-Augmented Generation-accessed self-evolving domain knowledge
base, proposes rules from natural language. Subsequently, these rules are
immediately executed within the SOAR environment to rigorously validate their
correctness. Based on this execution-grounded feedback, a reflective LLM-based
Critic drives the iterative refinement of these rules. Experiments on our
specialized Water Jug Problem (WJP) dataset, utilizing both Gemini and Qwen
series models, validate the efficacy of our framework. It achieves a success
rate over 86\% in generating rules from natural language. Crucially, the
framework also generates novel heuristic rules, reducing average decision
cycles for solving the WJP to 1.98 times the optimal solution and 1/1000 of
baseline methods. Additionally, our initial experiments show that NL2GenSym
enables smaller-parameter models to achieve better performance than larger
counterparts.

*Eshaan Tanwar,Deepak Nathani,William Yang Wang,Tanmoy Chakraborty*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study investigates how fine-tuning changes domain-specific large medical language models, showing minimal modifications to representational subspace and introducing tuning vectors to capture these changes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding how fine-tuning reshapes parameters in domain-specific large language models, particularly in the medical domain, which remains underexplored.

Method: Proposed 'tuning vectors,' a framework inspired by task vectors, to measure and analyze the parameter changes induced by fine-tuning. Combined these vectors across domains to study their generalization effects.

Result: Fine-tuning alters a small subset of the model's parametric space, primarily affecting MLP layers and amplifying directions in attention heads. Combining tuning vectors improves generalization across domains.

Conclusion: The research introduces a novel, interpretable framework for analyzing specialisation in LLMs and provides insights into how fine-tuning impacts domain-specific performance and general understanding.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) fine-tuned for specific domains exhibit strong
performance; however, the underlying mechanisms by which this fine-tuning
reshapes their parametric space are not well understood. Prior works primarily
focus on auto-regressive or general-purpose instruct models, leaving
domain-specialised LLMs under-explored. We present the first systematic study
of domain-specific fine-tuning in large medical language models. Our analysis
reveals that fine-tuning modifies only a small subset of the representational
subspace, essentially preserving the pre-trained model's representation. To
interpret these changes in subspaces, we propose tuning vectors, a novel
framework inspired by task vectors, which explicitly capture the directional
parameter shifts induced by fine-tuning. We demonstrate that these vectors are
critical for enhancing both instruction-following and generation quality.
Furthermore, combining tuning vectors across different domains yields improved
generalisation. Upon closer inspection of directional alignment, we find these
vectors primarily write new directional information into the MLP layers of the
model, while amplifying existing directions in attention heads. Our findings
offer new insights into LLM adaptation and provide a general, interpretable
framework for analysing specialisation in large language models.

TL;DR: The paper introduces TEPO, a token-level optimization technique, to address the challenges in improving the mathematical reasoning abilities of LLMs, outperforming existing methods and enhancing training stability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome limitations of sparse token rewards and entropy collapse in current LLM optimization methods like GRPO.

Method: Develops TEPO, a token-level Markov Likelihood-based framework linking group-level rewards to tokens, improving token-level aggregation.

Result: Experiments demonstrate TEPO's superiority over baselines across metrics like accuracy and mathematical reasoning performance.

Conclusion: TEPO sets a new state-of-the-art for mathematical reasoning tasks and provides improved training stability for chain-of-thought methods.

Abstract: Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) has significantly advanced the
reasoning ability of large language models (LLMs), particularly by boosting
their mathematical performance. However, GRPO and related
entropy-regularization methods still face challenges rooted in the sparse token
rewards inherent to chain-of-thought (CoT). Current approaches often rely on
undifferentiated token-level entropy adjustments, which frequently lead to
entropy collapse or model collapse. In this work, we propose TEPO, a novel
token-level framework that incorporates Markov Likelihood (sequence likelihood)
links group-level rewards with tokens via token-level aggregation. Experiments
show that TEPO consistently outperforms existing baselines across key metrics
(including @k and accuracy). It not only sets a new state of the art on
mathematical reasoning tasks but also significantly enhances training
stability.

*Mert ƒ∞nan,Anthony Sicilia,Alex Xie,Saujas Vaduguru,Daniel Fried,Malihe Alikhani*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper investigates how ambiguities in natural language affect human-AI communication for data visualization tasks and proposes strategies to reduce them using multi-turn dialogues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address ambiguities in human-AI communication, specifically in generating accurate data visualization code from natural language inputs.

Method: The authors develop a taxonomy of ambiguity types and propose metrics to quantify ambiguities. They analyze these metrics using data from the DS-1000 dataset and evaluate the effectiveness of three pragmatic dialogue models in reducing ambiguities.

Result: The proposed ambiguity metrics show stronger correlations with human annotations than baseline methods. Multi-turn dialogues informed by pragmatic models significantly reduce ambiguities and improve the accuracy of generated code.

Conclusion: Reducing ambiguity through targeted multi-turn dialogues in natural language interfaces enhances the AI's ability to align with user goals, improving outcomes in data visualization tasks.

Abstract: Establishing shared goals is a fundamental step in human-AI communication.
However, ambiguities can lead to outputs that seem correct but fail to reflect
the speaker's intent. In this paper, we explore this issue with a focus on the
data visualization domain, where ambiguities in natural language impact the
generation of code that visualizes data. The availability of multiple views on
the contextual (e.g., the intended plot and the code rendering the plot) allows
for a unique and comprehensive analysis of diverse ambiguity types. We develop
a taxonomy of types of ambiguity that arise in this task and propose metrics to
quantify them. Using Matplotlib problems from the DS-1000 dataset, we
demonstrate that our ambiguity metrics better correlate with human annotations
than uncertainty baselines. Our work also explores how multi-turn dialogue can
reduce ambiguity, therefore, improve code accuracy by better matching user
goals. We evaluate three pragmatic models to inform our dialogue strategies:
Gricean Cooperativity, Discourse Representation Theory, and Questions under
Discussion. A simulated user study reveals how pragmatic dialogues reduce
ambiguity and enhance code accuracy, highlighting the value of multi-turn
exchanges in code generation.

*Ziyu Zheng,Yaming Yang,Ziyu Guan,Wei Zhao,Xinyan Huang,Weigang Lu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces a multi-scale graph prompt framework, MSGCOT, that leverages hierarchical graph features for improved performance in graph-based tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing graph prompt-tuning methods focus on single-granularity features, missing the multi-scale structural information in graph data. This oversight limits the expressiveness and effectiveness of graph-based tasks.

Method: MSGCOT employs a low-rank coarsening network to extract multi-scale structural features. These features are progressively integrated into a coarse-to-fine prompt chain to enhance reasoning capabilities.

Result: MSGCOT achieves superior performance compared to current single-granularity prompt-tuning techniques, particularly in few-shot learning scenarios, as demonstrated on eight benchmark graph datasets.

Conclusion: Incorporating multi-scale structural information into graph prompting can significantly improve task performance by enhancing the diversity and expressiveness of graph semantics.

Abstract: The "pre-train, prompt'' paradigm, designed to bridge the gap between
pre-training tasks and downstream objectives, has been extended from the NLP
domain to the graph domain and has achieved remarkable progress. Current
mainstream graph prompt-tuning methods modify input or output features using
learnable prompt vectors. However, existing approaches are confined to
single-granularity (e.g., node-level or subgraph-level) during prompt
generation, overlooking the inherently multi-scale structural information in
graph data, which limits the diversity of prompt semantics. To address this
issue, we pioneer the integration of multi-scale information into graph prompt
and propose a Multi-Scale Graph Chain-of-Thought (MSGCOT) prompting framework.
Specifically, we design a lightweight, low-rank coarsening network to
efficiently capture multi-scale structural features as hierarchical basis
vectors for prompt generation. Subsequently, mimicking human cognition from
coarse-to-fine granularity, we dynamically integrate multi-scale information at
each reasoning step, forming a progressive coarse-to-fine prompt chain.
Extensive experiments on eight benchmark datasets demonstrate that MSGCOT
outperforms the state-of-the-art single-granularity graph prompt-tuning method,
particularly in few-shot scenarios, showcasing superior performance.

TL;DR: LLM SELECTOR is a framework for efficiently selecting the best Large Language Model using limited annotations, rather than fully annotated datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the inefficiency of prior evaluation methods for selecting the best LLM, which require fully annotated datasets.

Method: The framework adaptively selects a small, informative set of queries for annotation and uses a judge-based oracle model to minimize costs.

Result: LLM SELECTOR reduced annotation costs by up to 59.62% in experiments on six benchmarks with 151 LLMs.

Conclusion: LLM SELECTOR demonstrates effective and cost-efficient active model selection for identifying the top-performing LLMs for specific tasks.

Abstract: We introduce LLM SELECTOR, the first framework for active model selection of
Large Language Models (LLMs). Unlike prior evaluation and benchmarking
approaches that rely on fully annotated datasets, LLM SELECTOR efficiently
identifies the best LLM with limited annotations. In particular, for any given
task, LLM SELECTOR adaptively selects a small set of queries to annotate that
are most informative about the best model for the task. To further reduce
annotation cost, we leverage a judge-based oracle annotation model. Through
extensive experiments on 6 benchmarks with 151 LLMs, we show that LLM SELECTOR
reduces annotation costs by up to 59.62% when selecting the best and near-best
LLM for the task.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores how Large Language Models (LLMs) encode and manipulate entity representations, introducing a novel framework for reconstructing entity mentions from internal LLM states.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: It aims to understand how LLMs internally represent entities, as entities are fundamental for grounding factual knowledge and structuring relationships in text.

Method: The researchers propose entity mention reconstruction using task vectors and introduce the Entity Lens, extending logit-lens, to predict multi-token mentions from LLM hidden states.

Result: Their findings show that LLMs have entity-specific mechanisms to represent and manipulate entities, even for multi-token entities unseen during training, providing new insights into LLMs' capacity.

Conclusion: The study enhances understanding of LLMs' internal entity representations and provides tools for deeper exploration, with potential implications for improving language model applications.

Abstract: Named entities are fundamental building blocks of knowledge in text,
grounding factual information and structuring relationships within language.
Despite their importance, it remains unclear how Large Language Models (LLMs)
internally represent entities. Prior research has primarily examined explicit
relationships, but little is known about entity representations themselves. We
introduce entity mention reconstruction as a novel framework for studying how
LLMs encode and manipulate entities. We investigate whether entity mentions can
be generated from internal representations, how multi-token entities are
encoded beyond last-token embeddings, and whether these representations capture
relational knowledge. Our proposed method, leveraging _task vectors_, allows to
consistently generate multi-token mentions from various entity representations
derived from the LLMs hidden states. We thus introduce the _Entity Lens_,
extending the _logit-lens_ to predict multi-token mentions. Our results bring
new evidence that LLMs develop entity-specific mechanisms to represent and
manipulate any multi-token entities, including those unseen during training.

TL;DR: The paper evaluates context management strategies for Spoken Dialog State Tracking using Speech-LLMs, highlighting that full spoken history yields the best performance, while compressed history balances accuracy and context size.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve dialog state tracking in spoken conversations by exploring optimal strategies for managing context with Speech-LLMs.

Method: Conduct a comparative study on multimodal, full spoken, and compressed spoken history approaches, using experiments on the SpokenWOZ corpus.

Result: The full spoken history performed the best, exceeding previous methods, while compression techniques provided competitive accuracy with reduced context size.

Conclusion: Effective utilization of context enhances dialog state tracking, and compression methods offer a practical accuracy-size trade-off.

Abstract: This paper presents a comparative study of context management strategies for
end-to-end Spoken Dialog State Tracking using Speech-LLMs. We systematically
evaluate traditional multimodal context (combining text history and spoken
current turn), full spoken history, and compressed spoken history approaches.
Our experiments on the SpokenWOZ corpus demonstrate that providing the full
spoken conversation as input yields the highest performance among models of
similar size, significantly surpassing prior methods. Furthermore, we show that
attention-pooling-based compression of the spoken history offers a strong
trade-off, maintaining competitive accuracy with reduced context size. Detailed
analysis confirms that improvements stem from more effective context
utilization.

*Minjun Kim,Hyeonseok Lim,Hangyeol Yoo,Inho Won,Seungwoo Song,Minkyung Cho,Junhun Yuk,Changsu Choi,Dongjae Shin,Huige Lee,Hoyun Song,Alice Oh,Kyungtae Lim*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces KORMo-10B, a synthetic-data-driven bilingual large language model for Korean-English, demonstrating stability and effectiveness during training and achieving high performance in reasoning and instruction-following tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to develop a fully open, large-scale bilingual language model for a lower-resource language (Korean) using synthetic data and to establish transparency and reproducibility in multilingual language modeling research.

Method: The researchers trained KORMo-10B, a 10.8B-parameter model, using a Korean-English corpus with 68.74% synthetic Korean data, ensuring balanced linguistic coverage and diverse instruction styles. Bilingual instruction tuning was applied.

Result: The model shows performance comparable to contemporary multilingual baselines in benchmarks involving reasoning, knowledge, and instruction-following tasks. Synthetic data did not cause instability or degradation during pretraining.

Conclusion: This research confirms that synthetic data can support stable large-scale pretraining, enabling near-native performance in reasoning and discourse for Korean. The study establishes a transparent and reproducible framework for using synthetic data in non-English multilingual LLM development.

Abstract: This work presents the first large-scale investigation into constructing a
fully open bilingual large language model (LLM) for a non-English language,
specifically Korean, trained predominantly on synthetic data. We introduce
KORMo-10B, a 10.8B-parameter model trained from scratch on a Korean-English
corpus in which 68.74% of the Korean portion is synthetic. Through systematic
experimentation, we demonstrate that synthetic data, when carefully curated
with balanced linguistic coverage and diverse instruction styles, does not
cause instability or degradation during large-scale pretraining. Furthermore,
the model achieves performance comparable to that of contemporary open-weight
multilingual baselines across a wide range of reasoning, knowledge, and
instruction-following benchmarks. Our experiments reveal two key findings: (1)
synthetic data can reliably sustain long-horizon pretraining without model
collapse, and (2) bilingual instruction tuning enables near-native reasoning
and discourse coherence in Korean. By fully releasing all components including
data, code, training recipes, and logs, this work establishes a transparent
framework for developing synthetic data-driven fully open models (FOMs) in
low-resource settings and sets a reproducible precedent for future multilingual
LLM research.

### [133] [Domain-Adapted Pre-trained Language Models for Implicit Information Extraction in Crash Narratives](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09434)
*Xixi Wang,Jordanka Kovaceva,Miguel Costa,Shuai Wang,Francisco Camara Pereira,Robert Thomson*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study evaluates compact open-source PLMs for analyzing unstructured crash narratives, and demonstrates their enhanced performance after fine-tuning over closed LLMs like GPT-4o, particularly in reasoning-intensive tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the difficulty in large-scale analysis of unstructured crash narratives due to privacy concerns, limited domain knowledge, and performance issues with current tools like closed LLMs.

Method: Fine-tuning techniques such as LoRA and BERT were used to inject task-specific knowledge into compact PLMs to enhance reasoning capabilities for crash analysis.

Result: Experiments using the Crash Investigation Sampling System dataset showed that the fine-tuned models outperformed GPT-4o in extracting the Manner of Collision and Crash Type while requiring fewer resources.

Conclusion: Fine-tuned compact PLMs are effective at reasoning-intensive tasks in crash narrative analysis, offering stronger performance and better resource efficiency compared to closed LLMs.

Abstract: Free-text crash narratives recorded in real-world crash databases have been
shown to play a significant role in improving traffic safety. However,
large-scale analyses remain difficult to implement as there are no documented
tools that can batch process the unstructured, non standardized text content
written by various authors with diverse experience and attention to detail. In
recent years, Transformer-based pre-trained language models (PLMs), such as
Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) and large
language models (LLMs), have demonstrated strong capabilities across various
natural language processing tasks. These models can extract explicit facts from
crash narratives, but their performance declines on inference-heavy tasks in,
for example, Crash Type identification, which can involve nearly 100
categories. Moreover, relying on closed LLMs through external APIs raises
privacy concerns for sensitive crash data. Additionally, these black-box tools
often underperform due to limited domain knowledge. Motivated by these
challenges, we study whether compact open-source PLMs can support
reasoning-intensive extraction from crash narratives. We target two challenging
objectives: 1) identifying the Manner of Collision for a crash, and 2) Crash
Type for each vehicle involved in the crash event from real-world crash
narratives. To bridge domain gaps, we apply fine-tuning techniques to inject
task-specific knowledge to LLMs with Low-Rank Adaption (LoRA) and BERT.
Experiments on the authoritative real-world dataset Crash Investigation
Sampling System (CISS) demonstrate that our fine-tuned compact models
outperform strong closed LLMs, such as GPT-4o, while requiring only minimal
training resources. Further analysis reveals that the fine-tuned PLMs can
capture richer narrative details and even correct some mislabeled annotations
in the dataset.

*Ines Altemir Marinas,Anastasiia Kucherenko,Alexander Sternfeld,Andrei Kucharavy*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper presents a full-text indexing pipeline for Apertus LLM training data, enabling transparency, safety, and efficient search capabilities for massive training datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address the challenge of limited access and lack of transparency in Large Language Model training data, which is crucial for ensuring the reliability and ethics of open-weight LLMs.

Method: The authors utilize Elasticsearch parallel indices combined with Alps infrastructure, an advanced arm64 supercluster, to index 8.6T tokens out of a massive 15.2T training dataset.

Result: The indexing pipeline successfully made training data actionable for safety measures, created an effective open web search engine, and demonstrated scalability and greener computation on modern infrastructure.

Conclusion: The findings pave the way for reproducibility in massive-scale data indexing, supporting greener computing initiatives and enhancing safety in LLM applications.

Abstract: The performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) is determined by their
training data. Despite the proliferation of open-weight LLMs, access to LLM
training data has remained limited. Even for fully open LLMs, the scale of the
data makes it all but inscrutable to the general scientific community, despite
potentially containing critical data scraped from the internet.
  In this paper, we present the full-text indexing pipeline for the Apertus LLM
training data. Leveraging Elasticsearch parallel indices and the Alps
infrastructure, a state-of-the-art, highly energy-efficient arm64 supercluster,
we were able to index 8.6T tokens out of 15.2T used to train the Apertus LLM
family, creating both a critical LLM safety tool and effectively an offline,
curated, open web search engine. Our contribution is threefold. First, we
demonstrate that Elasticsearch can be successfully ported onto next-generation
arm64-based infrastructure. Second, we demonstrate that full-text indexing at
the scale of modern LLM training datasets and the entire open web is feasible
and accessible. Finally, we demonstrate that such indices can be used to ensure
previously inaccessible jailbreak-agnostic LLM safety.
  We hope that our findings will be useful to other teams attempting
large-scale data indexing and facilitate the general transition towards greener
computation.

### [135] [Hybrid Models for Natural Language Reasoning: The Case of Syllogistic Logic](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09472)
*Manuel Vargas Guzm√°n,Jakub Szymanik,Maciej Malicki*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper explores the generalization challenge in neural models for logical reasoning, emphasizing compositionality and recursiveness, and proposes a hybrid architecture blending symbolic and neural reasoning to address shortcomings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate the limitations of large language models (LLMs) in logical reasoning, specifically their generalization capabilities in compositionality and recursiveness.

Method: The paper benchmarks LLMs using the syllogistic fragment for logical reasoning, evaluates their abilities, and introduces a hybrid architecture combining neural computation and symbolic reasoning.

Result: LLMs showed proficiency in recursiveness but struggled with compositionality. The proposed hybrid model demonstrated high efficiency and robust inference capabilities.

Conclusion: Hybrid models combining symbolic and neural methods have the potential to overcome generalization barriers in logical reasoning systems, highlighting their promise for future applications.

Abstract: Despite the remarkable progress in neural models, their ability to
generalize, a cornerstone for applications like logical reasoning, remains a
critical challenge. We delineate two fundamental aspects of this ability:
compositionality, the capacity to abstract atomic logical rules underlying
complex inferences, and recursiveness, the aptitude to build intricate
representations through iterative application of inference rules. In the
literature, these two aspects are often confounded together under the umbrella
term of generalization. To sharpen this distinction, we investigated the
logical generalization capabilities of pre-trained large language models (LLMs)
using the syllogistic fragment as a benchmark for natural language reasoning.
Though simple, this fragment provides a foundational yet expressive subset of
formal logic that supports controlled evaluation of essential reasoning
abilities. Our findings reveal a significant disparity: while LLMs demonstrate
reasonable proficiency in recursiveness, they struggle with compositionality.
To overcome these limitations and establish a reliable logical prover, we
propose a hybrid architecture integrating symbolic reasoning with neural
computation. This synergistic interaction enables robust and efficient
inference, neural components accelerate processing, while symbolic reasoning
ensures completeness. Our experiments show that high efficiency is preserved
even with relatively small neural components. As part of our proposed
methodology, this analysis gives a rationale and highlights the potential of
hybrid models to effectively address key generalization barriers in neural
reasoning systems.

### [136] [Multimodal Policy Internalization for Conversational Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09474)
*Zhenhailong Wang,Jiateng Liu,Amin Fazel,Ritesh Sarkhel,Xing Fan,Xiang Li,Chenlei Guo,Heng Ji,Ruhi Sarikaya*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces Multimodal Policy Internalization (MPI), a method to embed reasoning-intensive multimodal policies directly into large language model parameters, improving efficiency and effectiveness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As conversational agents like ChatGPT and Alexa handle increasingly complex tasks, their lengthy and complex in-context prompts for predefined policies become computationally costly and hard to follow, especially for multimodal tasks.

Method: The authors propose a three-stage training framework called TriMPI. It involves continual pretraining to embed policy knowledge, supervised finetuning, and reinforcement learning through PolicyRollout to improve policy adherence without needing the policy text during inference.

Result: TriMPI demonstrates improved accuracy, generalization, and resistance to forgetting in both synthetic and real-world multimodal tasks. The method shows promise for efficiently training multimodal agents.

Conclusion: The study introduces a novel framework and contributes datasets, training methodologies, and evaluations to advance research in multimodal policy adherence. This approach can reduce computational overhead and enhance practical deployment of conversational agents.

Abstract: Modern conversational agents like ChatGPT and Alexa+ rely on predefined
policies specifying metadata, response styles, and tool-usage rules. As these
LLM-based systems expand to support diverse business and user queries, such
policies, often implemented as in-context prompts, are becoming increasingly
complex and lengthy, making faithful adherence difficult and imposing large
fixed computational costs. With the rise of multimodal agents, policies that
govern visual and multimodal behaviors are critical but remain understudied.
Prior prompt-compression work mainly shortens task templates and
demonstrations, while existing policy-alignment studies focus only on
text-based safety rules. We introduce Multimodal Policy Internalization (MPI),
a new task that internalizes reasoning-intensive multimodal policies into model
parameters, enabling stronger policy-following without including the policy
during inference. MPI poses unique data and algorithmic challenges. We build
two datasets spanning synthetic and real-world decision-making and tool-using
tasks and propose TriMPI, a three-stage training framework. TriMPI first
injects policy knowledge via continual pretraining, then performs supervised
finetuning, and finally applies PolicyRollout, a GRPO-style reinforcement
learning extension that augments rollouts with policy-aware responses for
grounded exploration. TriMPI achieves notable gains in end-to-end accuracy,
generalization, and robustness to forgetting. As the first work on multimodal
policy internalization, we provide datasets, training recipes, and
comprehensive evaluations to foster future research. Project page:

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces "StatEval," a comprehensive benchmark targeting statistical reasoning in LLMs, encompassing a wide range of foundational and advanced problems. Results show LLMs struggle, particularly on research-level tasks, highlighting the need for improvement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current benchmarks for LLMs neglect the critical domain of statistics, which demands unique reasoning skills. The motivation is to fill this gap and elevate the evaluation of statistical intelligence in LLMs.

Method: The authors developed StatEval, comprising 13,817 foundational problems and 2374 research-proof tasks, using a scalable multi-agent pipeline with human-in-the-loop validation for quality control. A tailored evaluation framework assesses computational and proof-based tasks.

Result: Closed-source models like GPT5-mini scored below 57% on research-level problems, and open-source models performed even worse. This points to the significant difficulties LLMs face in statistical reasoning.

Conclusion: StatEval reveals the limitations of current LLMs in statistical reasoning and provides a resource to guide future model improvements in this complex domain.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable advances in
mathematical and logical reasoning, yet statistics, as a distinct and
integrative discipline, remains underexplored in benchmarking efforts. To
address this gap, we introduce \textbf{StatEval}, the first comprehensive
benchmark dedicated to statistics, spanning both breadth and depth across
difficulty levels. StatEval consists of 13,817 foundational problems covering
undergraduate and graduate curricula, together with 2374 research-level proof
tasks extracted from leading journals. To construct the benchmark, we design a
scalable multi-agent pipeline with human-in-the-loop validation that automates
large-scale problem extraction, rewriting, and quality control, while ensuring
academic rigor. We further propose a robust evaluation framework tailored to
both computational and proof-based tasks, enabling fine-grained assessment of
reasoning ability. Experimental results reveal that while closed-source models
such as GPT5-mini achieve below 57\% on research-level problems, with
open-source models performing significantly lower. These findings highlight the
unique challenges of statistical reasoning and the limitations of current LLMs.
We expect StatEval to serve as a rigorous benchmark for advancing statistical
intelligence in large language models. All data and code are available on our
web platform: https://stateval.github.io/.

*Veronica Rammouz,Aaron Gonzalez,Carlos Cruzportillo,Adrian Tan,Nicole Beebe,Anthony Rios*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper examines estimating NLP model performance without labels and evaluates methods for reliable performance rankings across domains using error predictors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand when and how NLP models can generalize across domains effectively without requiring labeled data.

Method: A two-step evaluation setup was used, incorporating four base classifiers and various large language models as error predictors, tested across 15 domains from the GeoOLID and Amazon Reviews datasets.

Result: Large language model-based error predictors showed stronger and more consistent rank correlations with true accuracy compared to drift-based or zero-shot baselines.

Conclusion: Performance estimation is more trustworthy when domain performance differences are large and when error model predictions align closely with actual failure patterns, offering guidance for cross-domain evaluations.

Abstract: Estimating model performance without labels is an important goal for
understanding how NLP models generalize. While prior work has proposed measures
based on dataset similarity or predicted correctness, it remains unclear when
these estimates produce reliable performance rankings across domains. In this
paper, we analyze the factors that affect ranking reliability using a two-step
evaluation setup with four base classifiers and several large language models
as error predictors. Experiments on the GeoOLID and Amazon Reviews datasets,
spanning 15 domains, show that large language model-based error predictors
produce stronger and more consistent rank correlations with true accuracy than
drift-based or zero-shot baselines. Our analysis reveals two key findings:
ranking is more reliable when performance differences across domains are
larger, and when the error model's predictions align with the base model's true
failure patterns. These results clarify when performance estimation methods can
be trusted and provide guidance for their use in cross-domain model evaluation.

*Mohammad Hossein Sameti,Sepehr Harfi Moridani,Ali Zarean,Hossein Sameti*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper tackles the issue of high word error rates in ASR models caused by accent and dialectal variations, through a novel framework that integrates accent classification and spectrogram-based data augmentation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current ASR models struggle with accent and dialect variations, particularly in linguistically diverse or low-resource languages like English and Persian, creating a need for models that can perform effectively despite such variations.

Method: The proposed method introduces an accent-invariant ASR framework, which involves training a spectrogram-based classifier for accent identification, masking influential spectrogram regions, and using these masked spectrograms for data augmentation to enhance ASR robustness.

Result: Using the Whisper model, the approach significantly reduces word error rates in both English and Persian speech datasets, showcasing its effectiveness. A dedicated multi-accent Persian dataset and benchmark were also introduced.

Conclusion: This study provides a pioneering solution to improve ASR performance in linguistically diverse scenarios and lays groundwork for future research in accent-resilient multilingual speech recognition systems.

Abstract: Pre-trained transformer-based models have significantly advanced automatic
speech recognition (ASR), yet they remain sensitive to accent and dialectal
variations, resulting in elevated word error rates (WER) in linguistically
diverse languages such as English and Persian. To address this challenge, we
propose an accent-invariant ASR framework that integrates accent and dialect
classification into the recognition pipeline. Our approach involves training a
spectrogram-based classifier to capture accent-specific cues, masking the
regions most influential to its predictions, and using the masked spectrograms
for data augmentation. This enhances the robustness of ASR models against
accent variability. We evaluate the method using both English and Persian
speech. For Persian, we introduce a newly collected dataset spanning multiple
regional accents, establishing the first systematic benchmark for accent
variation in Persian ASR that fills a critical gap in multilingual speech
research and provides a foundation for future studies on low-resource,
linguistically diverse languages. Experimental results with the Whisper model
demonstrate that our masking and augmentation strategy yields substantial WER
reductions in both English and Persian settings, confirming the effectiveness
of the approach. This research advances the development of multilingual ASR
systems that are resilient to accent and dialect diversity. Code and dataset

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a method called Group Relative Segment Penalization (GRSP) to address overthinking in Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) trained with Reinforcement Learning from Verifier Reward (RLVR), reducing computational costs without significantly sacrificing accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large Reasoning Models often suffer from overthinking, which increases computational costs. Current penalization methods reduce token usage but harm model performance due to overly simplistic supervision.

Method: The authors propose GRSP, a step-level regularization method leveraging a length-aware weighting mechanism for reasoning segments, aiming at balancing efficiency and accuracy.

Result: GRSP improves token efficiency, especially in harder problems, while minimally impacting accuracy. It also stabilizes reinforcement learning training and scales well across different model sizes.

Conclusion: The proposed GRSP approach effectively mitigates excessive reasoning in LRMs, achieving a better balance between computational efficiency and task accuracy.

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) boosted by Reinforcement Learning from Verifier
Reward (RLVR) have shown great power in problem solving, yet they often cause
overthinking: excessive, meandering reasoning that inflates computational cost.
Prior designs of penalization in RLVR manage to reduce token consumption while
often harming model performance, which arises from the oversimplicity of
token-level supervision. In this paper, we argue that the granularity of
supervision plays a crucial role in balancing efficiency and accuracy, and
propose Group Relative Segment Penalization (GRSP), a step-level method to
regularize reasoning. Since preliminary analyses show that reasoning segments
are strongly correlated with token consumption and model performance, we design
a length-aware weighting mechanism across segment clusters. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that GRSP achieves superior token efficiency without
heavily compromising accuracy, especially the advantages with harder problems.
Moreover, GRSP stabilizes RL training and scales effectively across model
sizes.

### [141] [Evaluating Robustness of Large Language Models Against Multilingual Typographical Errors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09536)
*Yihong Liu,Raoyuan Zhao,Lena Altinger,Hinrich Sch√ºtze,Michael A. Hedderich*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper addresses the underexplored robustness of large language models (LLMs) to typographical errors using a multilingual typo generation algorithm (MulTypo) and evaluates various models across tasks and languages.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: With LLMs increasingly used in multilingual applications, robustness against typographical errors remains underexplored, especially as real-world inputs often include such errors. This study aims to bridge this gap.

Method: The authors introduce MulTypo, a multilingual typo generation algorithm based on language-specific keyboard layouts and typing behavior, and evaluate 18 open-source LLMs across multiple tasks and languages under clean and noisy input conditions.

Result: The results show that typos degrade LLM performance across tasks, particularly in generative and reasoning tasks, although some tasks (e.g., natural language inference) are more robust. Language-dependent robustness is observed, with high-resource languages and translation from English showing greater resilience.

Conclusion: The study highlights the importance of noise-aware training and evaluating LLMs for multilingual robustness, emphasizing the need to address typographical errors in real-world applications.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in multilingual,
real-world applications with user inputs -- naturally introducing typographical
errors (typos). Yet most benchmarks assume clean input, leaving the robustness
of LLMs to typos across languages largely underexplored. To address this gap,
we introduce MulTypo, a multilingual typo generation algorithm that simulates
human-like errors based on language-specific keyboard layouts and typing
behavior. We evaluate 18 open-source LLMs across three model families and five
downstream tasks spanning language inference, multi-choice question answering,
mathematical reasoning, and machine translation tasks. Our results show that
typos consistently degrade performance, particularly in generative tasks and
those requiring reasoning -- while the natural language inference task is
comparatively more robust. Instruction tuning improves clean-input performance
but may increase brittleness under noise. We also observe language-dependent
robustness: high-resource languages are generally more robust than low-resource
ones, and translation from English is more robust than translation into
English. Our findings underscore the need for noise-aware training and
multilingual robustness evaluation. We make our code and data publicly
available.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Sandwiched Policy Gradient (SPG) for diffusion large language models (dLLMs), addressing challenges in reinforcement learning alignment with human preferences due to issues with log-likelihood calculation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve the alignment of diffusion large language models (dLLMs) with human preferences or task-specific rewards, overcoming issues with standard policy gradient methods caused by intractable log-likelihood calculations.

Method: The paper proposes the SPG approach, leveraging both an upper and a lower bound of the true log-likelihood in policy gradient computation, instead of relying on one-sided surrogates like the evidence lower bound (ELBO).

Result: SPG outperforms ELBO-based and one-step estimation baselines, achieving accuracy improvements across four tasks: +3.6% in GSM8K, +2.6% in MATH500, +18.4% in Countdown, and +27.0% in Sudoku.

Conclusion: SPG successfully mitigates policy gradient bias in dLLMs and provides a more efficient mechanism for RL alignment, demonstrating superior performance across various benchmarks.

Abstract: Diffusion large language models (dLLMs) are emerging as an efficient
alternative to autoregressive models due to their ability to decode multiple
tokens in parallel. However, aligning dLLMs with human preferences or
task-specific rewards via reinforcement learning (RL) is challenging because
their intractable log-likelihood precludes the direct application of standard
policy gradient methods. While prior work uses surrogates like the evidence
lower bound (ELBO), these one-sided approximations can introduce significant
policy gradient bias. To address this, we propose the Sandwiched Policy
Gradient (SPG) that leverages both an upper and a lower bound of the true
log-likelihood. Experiments show that SPG significantly outperforms baselines
based on ELBO or one-step estimation. Specifically, SPG improves the accuracy
over state-of-the-art RL methods for dLLMs by 3.6% in GSM8K, 2.6% in MATH500,
18.4% in Countdown and 27.0% in Sudoku.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper examines Diffusion Large Language Models (DLLMs) and their conflict between parallel decoding and causal order reasoning, termed Parallel-Sequential Contradiction (PSC).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations and inefficiencies of DLLMs in reconciling parallel decoding with rigorous sequential reasoning.

Method: Behavioral analyses on reasoning tasks coupled with empirical evaluations across three scaling dimensions: parallel, diffusion, and sequential. Proposed mitigations include parallel-oriented prompting, diffusion early stopping, and parallel scaling.

Result: DLLMs revert to autoregressive-like behavior for complex reasoning tasks, with PSC limiting their reasoning depth, self-reflection, and exploratory breadth. Empirical improvements are consistent only for parallel scaling.

Conclusion: PSC is a fundamental constraint of DLLMs, but mitigations like parallel-oriented prompting and diffusion early stopping show promise in reducing these inefficiencies.

Abstract: Recently, Diffusion Large Language Models (DLLMs) have offered high
throughput and effective sequential reasoning, making them a competitive
alternative to autoregressive LLMs (ALLMs). However, parallel decoding, which
enables simultaneous token updates, conflicts with the causal order often
required for rigorous reasoning. We first identify this conflict as the core
Parallel-Sequential Contradiction (PSC). Behavioral analyses in both simple and
complex reasoning tasks show that DLLMs exhibit genuine parallelism only for
directly decidable outputs. As task difficulty increases, they revert to
autoregressive-like behavior, a limitation exacerbated by autoregressive
prompting, which nearly doubles the number of decoding steps with remasking
without improving quality. Moreover, PSC restricts DLLMs' self-reflection,
reasoning depth, and exploratory breadth. To further characterize PSC, we
introduce three scaling dimensions for DLLMs: parallel, diffusion, and
sequential. Empirically, while parallel scaling yields consistent improvements,
diffusion and sequential scaling are constrained by PSC. Based on these
findings, we propose several practical mitigations, parallel-oriented
prompting, diffusion early stopping, and parallel scaling, to reduce
PSC-induced ineffectiveness and inefficiencies.

TL;DR: The paper addresses the challenge of efficient multilingual medical video retrieval, developing a multi-stage framework with hierarchical indexing and targeted scoring to achieve state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to effectively retrieve relevant medical instructional videos from multilingual archives to answer complex multilingual and multi-hop questions.

Method: A multi-stage framework involving semantic chunking of subtitles, knowledge graph enrichment, hierarchical indexing with multilingual embeddings, and targeted rescoring by lightweight LLMs.

Result: Experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art performance on multilingual video corpus retrieval tasks, with ablation studies showing contributions of the framework's key components.

Conclusion: The method provides an efficient and precise solution for multilingual video retrieval in medical archives, balancing scalability and accuracy.

Abstract: Retrieving relevant instructional videos from multilingual medical archives
is crucial for answering complex, multi-hop questions across language
boundaries. However, existing systems either compress hour-long videos into
coarse embeddings or incur prohibitive costs for fine-grained matching. We
tackle the Multilingual Video Corpus Retrieval (mVCR) task in the NLPCC-2025
M4IVQA challenge with a multi-stage framework that integrates multilingual
semantics, domain terminology, and efficient long-form processing. Video
subtitles are divided into semantically coherent chunks, enriched with concise
knowledge-graph (KG) facts, and organized into a hierarchical tree whose node
embeddings are generated by a language-agnostic multilingual encoder. At query
time, the same encoder embeds the input question; a coarse-to-fine tree search
prunes irrelevant branches, and only the top-ranked chunks are re-scored by a
lightweight large language model (LLM). This design avoids exhaustive
cross-encoder scoring while preserving chunk-level precision. Experiments on
the mVCR test set demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, and ablation
studies confirm the complementary contributions of KG enrichment, hierarchical
indexing, and targeted LLM re-ranking. The proposed method offers an accurate
and scalable solution for multilingual retrieval in specialized medical video
collections.

TL;DR: The paper studies multilingual Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning in large reasoning models (LRMs), focusing on performance, consistency, and faithfulness of intermediate reasoning steps across languages.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the underexplored aspect of intermediate reasoning traces in multilingual contexts, beyond just final-answer accuracy, and highlight variations in language-specific CoT reasoning.

Method: The study evaluates multilingual CoT reasoning by analyzing three dimensions: compliance, answer accuracy/consistency, crosslingual consistency by interchanging thinking traces, and faithfulness of reasoning traces using perturbation-based methods such as truncation and error injection.

Result: The research uncovers strong language preferences, significant performance variations across languages, and differences in the quality and reliability of thinking traces. It also shows that the models rely on thinking traces differently depending on the language.

Conclusion: The paper advances understanding of multilingual CoT reasoning, revealing substantial language-dependent variations and emphasizing the importance of studying intermediate reasoning traces in multilingual settings. Code and data are released for future research.

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) increasingly rely on step-by-step
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning to improve task performance, particularly in
high-resource languages such as English. While recent work has examined
final-answer accuracy in multilingual settings, the thinking traces themselves,
i.e., the intermediate steps that lead to the final answer, remain
underexplored. In this paper, we present the first comprehensive study of
multilingual CoT reasoning, evaluating three key dimensions: performance,
consistency, and faithfulness. We begin by measuring language compliance,
answer accuracy, and answer consistency when LRMs are explicitly instructed or
prompt-hacked to think in a target language, revealing strong language
preferences and divergent performance across languages. Next, we assess
crosslingual consistency of thinking traces by interchanging them between
languages. We find that the quality and effectiveness of thinking traces vary
substantially depending on the prompt language. Finally, we adapt
perturbation-based techniques -- i.e., truncation and error injection -- to
probe the faithfulness of thinking traces across languages, showing that models
rely on traces to varying degrees. We release our code and data to support
future research.

### [146] [WUGNECTIVES: Novel Entity Inferences of Language Models from Discourse Connectives](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09556)
*Daniel Brubaker,William Sheffield,Junyi Jessy Li,Kanishka Misra*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper presents a study on whether discourse connectives can help language models (LMs) infer world knowledge using a new dataset, WUGNECTIVES. They test various LMs and observe improvements when fine-tuned but find challenges with concessive connectives.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to investigate whether discourse connectives can improve language models' ability to infer world knowledge, reversing the typical focus on using world knowledge to predict discourse connectives.

Method: The paper introduces WUGNECTIVES, a dataset of 8,880 stimuli, and evaluates 17 language models across different scales and training settings to study how connectives link entities to specific attributes.

Result: The study found that fine-tuning LMs led to improved reasoning behavior for most connectives, though performance varied by connective type, especially with concessive meanings posing systematic challenges.

Conclusion: The study highlights the potential for more detailed research on how language cues influence reasoning in LMs, demonstrating that connectives can provide functional insights beyond their traditional roles.

Abstract: The role of world knowledge has been particularly crucial to predict the
discourse connective that marks the discourse relation between two arguments,
with language models (LMs) being generally successful at this task. We flip
this premise in our work, and instead study the inverse problem of
understanding whether discourse connectives can inform LMs about the world. To
this end, we present WUGNECTIVES, a dataset of 8,880 stimuli that evaluates
LMs' inferences about novel entities in contexts where connectives link the
entities to particular attributes. On investigating 17 different LMs at various
scales, and training regimens, we found that tuning an LM to show reasoning
behavior yields noteworthy improvements on most connectives. At the same time,
there was a large variation in LMs' overall performance across connective type,
with all models systematically struggling on connectives that express a
concessive meaning. Our findings pave the way for more nuanced investigations
into the functional role of language cues as captured by LMs. We release
WUGNECTIVES at https://github.com/sheffwb/wugnectives.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces AutoPR, a framework to automatically transform research papers into promotional content to reduce human effort.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The growing reliance of scholars on social platforms for discovery and the effort authors dedicate to promoting their work prompt the need for automation to improve efficiency.

Method: The authors present AutoPR and PRAgent, which extract, synthesize, and adapt research content for platform optimization using PRBench as a benchmark.

Result: PRAgent outperforms baseline LLM pipelines with significant increases in engagement metrics like watch time, likes, and audience targeting.

Conclusion: AutoPR is proposed as a scalable and measurable solution for automating academic content promotion while enhancing audience reach and engagement.

Abstract: As the volume of peer-reviewed research surges, scholars increasingly rely on
social platforms for discovery, while authors invest considerable effort in
promoting their work to ensure visibility and citations. To streamline this
process and reduce the reliance on human effort, we introduce Automatic
Promotion (AutoPR), a novel task that transforms research papers into accurate,
engaging, and timely public content. To enable rigorous evaluation, we release
PRBench, a multimodal benchmark that links 512 peer-reviewed articles to
high-quality promotional posts, assessing systems along three axes: Fidelity
(accuracy and tone), Engagement (audience targeting and appeal), and Alignment
(timing and channel optimization). We also introduce PRAgent, a multi-agent
framework that automates AutoPR in three stages: content extraction with
multimodal preparation, collaborative synthesis for polished outputs, and
platform-specific adaptation to optimize norms, tone, and tagging for maximum
reach. When compared to direct LLM pipelines on PRBench, PRAgent demonstrates
substantial improvements, including a 604% increase in total watch time, a 438%
rise in likes, and at least a 2.9x boost in overall engagement. Ablation
studies show that platform modeling and targeted promotion contribute the most
to these gains. Our results position AutoPR as a tractable, measurable research
problem and provide a roadmap for scalable, impactful automated scholarly
communication.

### [148] [Dyna-Mind: Learning to Simulate from Experience for Better AI Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09577)
*Xiao Yu,Baolin Peng,Michel Galley,Hao Cheng,Qianhui Wu,Janardhan Kulkarni,Suman Nath,Zhou Yu,Jianfeng Gao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces Dyna-Mind, a two-stage training framework that integrates mental simulation into AI reasoning to improve performance in long-horizon, interactive tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI reasoning models excel in math and coding but struggle with complex, interactive environments. The paper seeks to address this gap by enabling AI agents to mentally simulate future actions before executing them.

Method: The proposed Dyna-Mind framework involves two stages: (1) ReSim, which trains agents to generate structured reasoning from interaction-grounded simulations, and (2) Dyna-GRPO, which uses reinforcement learning to refine decision-making through feedback from real-world rollouts.

Result: Experiments on synthetic benchmarks (Sokoban, ALFWorld) and a realistic benchmark (AndroidWorld) show that ReSim enhances simulation capabilities and Dyna-GRPO improves policies for planning-intensive tasks.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates the importance of simulation-based reasoning in advancing AI agents' ability to plan and act effectively in complex environments.

Abstract: Reasoning models have recently shown remarkable progress in domains such as
math and coding. However, their expert-level abilities in math and coding
contrast sharply with their performance in long-horizon, interactive tasks such
as web navigation and computer/phone-use. Inspired by literature on human
cognition, we argue that current AI agents need ''vicarious trial and error'' -
the capacity to mentally simulate alternative futures before acting - in order
to enhance their understanding and performance in complex interactive
environments. We introduce Dyna-Mind, a two-stage training framework that
explicitly teaches (V)LM agents to integrate such simulation into their
reasoning. In stage 1, we introduce Reasoning with Simulations (ReSim), which
trains the agent to generate structured reasoning traces from expanded search
trees built from real experience gathered through environment interactions.
ReSim thus grounds the agent's reasoning in faithful world dynamics and equips
it with the ability to anticipate future states in its reasoning. In stage 2,
we propose Dyna-GRPO, an online reinforcement learning method to further
strengthen the agent's simulation and decision-making ability by using both
outcome rewards and intermediate states as feedback from real rollouts.
Experiments on two synthetic benchmarks (Sokoban and ALFWorld) and one
realistic benchmark (AndroidWorld) demonstrate that (1) ReSim effectively
infuses simulation ability into AI agents, and (2) Dyna-GRPO leverages outcome
and interaction-level signals to learn better policies for long-horizon,
planning-intensive tasks. Together, these results highlight the central role of
simulation in enabling AI agents to reason, plan, and act more effectively in
the ever more challenging environments.

*Donghang Wu,Haoyang Zhang,Jun Chen,Xiangyu,Zhang,Hexin Liu,Eng Siong Chng,Fei Tian,Xuerui Yang,Xiangyu Zhang,Daxin Jiang,Gang Yu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces Mind-Paced Speaking (MPS), a dual-brain framework that enables Spoken Language Models (SLMs) to perform real-time Chain-of-Thought reasoning with reduced latency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-time Spoken Language Models struggle with Chain-of-Thought reasoning due to latency issues in sequential generation, and there is a need for frameworks that integrate reasoning while maintaining fluency.

Method: The paper proposes a "dual-brain" approach: a Formulation Brain for reasoning and an Articulation Brain for speech generation, allowing simultaneous processing without mode-switching.

Result: MPS achieves significant performance improvements, such as 92.8% accuracy on Spoken-MQA and 82.5 on URO-Bench, surpassing existing methods and maintaining reasoning quality similar to pre-computation models.

Conclusion: Mind-Paced Speaking bridges the gap between real-time reasoning and interaction, offering promising advancements in both latency and reasoning fidelity for SLMs.

Abstract: Real-time Spoken Language Models (SLMs) struggle to leverage Chain-of-Thought
(CoT) reasoning due to the prohibitive latency of generating the entire thought
process sequentially. Enabling SLMs to think while speaking, similar to humans,
is attracting increasing attention. We present, for the first time, Mind-Paced
Speaking (MPS), a brain-inspired framework that enables high-fidelity,
real-time reasoning. Similar to how humans utilize distinct brain regions for
thinking and responding, we propose a novel dual-brain approach, employing a
"Formulation Brain" for high-level reasoning to pace and guide a separate
"Articulation Brain" for fluent speech generation. This division of labor
eliminates mode-switching, preserving the integrity of the reasoning process.
Experiments show that MPS significantly outperforms existing
think-while-speaking methods and achieves reasoning performance comparable to
models that pre-compute the full CoT before speaking, while drastically
reducing latency. Under a zero-latency configuration, the proposed method
achieves an accuracy of 92.8% on the mathematical reasoning task Spoken-MQA and
attains a score of 82.5 on the speech conversation task URO-Bench. Our work
effectively bridges the gap between high-quality reasoning and real-time
interaction.

### [150] [Prompting Test-Time Scaling Is A Strong LLM Reasoning Data Augmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09599)
*Sondos Mahmoud Bsharat,Zhiqiang Shen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes Prompting Test-Time Scaling (P-TTS), a method to enhance the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) with minimal data annotation by systematically varying prompts. It significantly improves model performance on various benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the labor-intensive process of curating large reasoning datasets required to optimize reasoning capabilities in LLMs while maintaining high performance.

Method: The proposed method, P-TTS, uses a pool of only 90 reasoning samples, applies diverse instruction prompting to synthesize reasoning contexts during inference, and fine-tunes LLMs of different sizes on this augmented data.

Result: P-TTS-enhanced models substantially outperform baseline methods (S1 and S1.1) on mathematical reasoning benchmarks like AIME2024 & 25, showing marked accuracy improvements. Additionally, P-TTS enhances generalization on out-of-domain benchmarks.

Conclusion: The approach demonstrates that test-time scaling of prompts effectively explores reasoning patterns in LLMs, offering an efficient, scalable, and resource-effective solution for reasoning enhancement in constrained or dynamic domains.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive reasoning
capabilities when provided with chain-of-thought exemplars, but curating large
reasoning datasets remains laborious and resource-intensive. In this work, we
introduce Prompting Test-Time Scaling (P-TTS), a simple yet effective
inference-time data augmentation strategy for enhancing LLM reasoning through
finetuning. Rather than collecting thousands or even millions of examples,
P-TTS leverages a small pool of only 90 manually selected reasoning instances
and systematically varies exemplar augmentation through principled instruction
prompting intensities at test time to synthesize diverse reasoning trajectory
contexts. Then we finetune the various sizes of Qwen-2.5 models on P-TTS data.
Across a suite of mathematical reasoning AIME2024 & 25, MATH500, and
GPQA-Diamond, our P-TTS-7B and 32B models outperform the prior competitive
baselines like S1 and S1.1 (1K-shot), achieving absolute accuracy gains of
+26.66% and +30.00% on AIME'24 (7B), and +13.34% and +6.67% on AIME'25 (7B);
P-TTS-32B yields gains of +23.33% and +16.63% on AIME'24, and +26.63% and
+3.33% on AIME'25 (vs. S1 and S1.1, respectively), with comparable or better
performance on MATH500 and GPQA-Diamond. We further show that P-TTS enhances
zero-shot generalization accuracy on out-of-domain reasoning benchmarks of
Gaokao, Kaoyan, OlympiadBench, AMC23, GradeSchoolMath, and Minerva. Our
analysis suggests that test-time scaling effectively explores the latent space
of reasoning patterns, amplifying LLM problem-solving with minimal annotation
overhead, and further unlocking the reasoning potential and capabilities of
LLMs. Prompting Test-Time Scaling offers a practical, low-cost way to elicit
LLM reasoning in resource-constrained or rapidly evolving domains.

### [151] [Beyond CNNs: Efficient Fine-Tuning of Multi-Modal LLMs for Object Detection on Low-Data Regimes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08589)
*Nirmal Elamon,Rouzbeh Davoudi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper evaluates CNN and transformer-based large language models (LLMs) for detecting artificial text overlays in images, showing LLMs can be fine-tuned on fewer than 1,000 images for significant accuracy improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to explore how emerging LLMs can be optimized for specialized visual tasks like artificial text overlay detection, addressing inefficiencies when used out-of-the-box and comparing their effectiveness against traditional CNNs.

Method: The authors conducted experiments comparing fine-tuned CNNs, zero-shot pre-trained multi-modal LLMs, and fine-tuned LLMs, leveraging limited data (under 1,000 images) for fine-tuning and focusing on language-guided prompts.

Result: Fine-tuned LLMs achieved up to 36% accuracy improvement compared to pre-trained versions, matching or exceeding CNN-based baseline models that required significantly more data.

Conclusion: LLMs demonstrate strong adaptability and data efficiency for precise visual tasks, bridging the gap between vision and language. The research provides actionable strategies for leveraging multi-modal transformers in low-resource environments.

Abstract: The field of object detection and understanding is rapidly evolving, driven
by advances in both traditional CNN-based models and emerging multi-modal large
language models (LLMs). While CNNs like ResNet and YOLO remain highly effective
for image-based tasks, recent transformer-based LLMs introduce new capabilities
such as dynamic context reasoning, language-guided prompts, and holistic scene
understanding. However, when used out-of-the-box, the full potential of LLMs
remains underexploited, often resulting in suboptimal performance on
specialized visual tasks. In this work, we conduct a comprehensive comparison
of fine-tuned traditional CNNs, zero-shot pre-trained multi-modal LLMs, and
fine-tuned multi-modal LLMs on the challenging task of artificial text overlay
detection in images. A key contribution of our study is demonstrating that LLMs
can be effectively fine-tuned on very limited data (fewer than 1,000 images) to
achieve up to 36% accuracy improvement, matching or surpassing CNN-based
baselines that typically require orders of magnitude more data. By exploring
how language-guided models can be adapted for precise visual understanding with
minimal supervision, our work contributes to the broader effort of bridging
vision and language, offering novel insights into efficient cross-modal
learning strategies. These findings highlight the adaptability and data
efficiency of LLM-based approaches for real-world object detection tasks and
provide actionable guidance for applying multi-modal transformers in
low-resource visual environments. To support continued progress in this area,
we have made the code used to fine-tune the models available in our GitHub,
enabling future improvements and reuse in related applications.

*Hyeonggeun Han,Sehwan Kim,Hyungjun Joo,Sangwoo Hong,Jungwoo Lee*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper addresses privacy concerns in text-to-image diffusion models by proposing strategies to adjust initial noise samples, facilitating earlier escape from memorization zones and maintaining alignment with input prompts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation behind this work is to address privacy and copyright concerns caused by training data memorization in text-to-image diffusion models, which can lead to replicated outputs violating user expectations.

Method: The authors identify the role of initial noise samples in steering the denoising trajectory and propose two strategies that adjust these samples to promote earlier escape from memorization zones, either collectively or individually.

Result: Empirical evaluation shows that adjusting initial noise samples significantly reduces memorized outputs and improves alignment between generated images and their input prompts.

Conclusion: The proposed methods provide effective mitigation strategies for training data memorization in text-to-image diffusion models by leveraging insights into initial noise sample adjustments.

Abstract: Despite their impressive generative capabilities, text-to-image diffusion
models often memorize and replicate training data, prompting serious concerns
over privacy and copyright. Recent work has attributed this memorization to an
attraction basin-a region where applying classifier-free guidance (CFG) steers
the denoising trajectory toward memorized outputs-and has proposed deferring
CFG application until the denoising trajectory escapes this basin. However,
such delays often result in non-memorized images that are poorly aligned with
the input prompts, highlighting the need to promote earlier escape so that CFG
can be applied sooner in the denoising process. In this work, we show that the
initial noise sample plays a crucial role in determining when this escape
occurs. We empirically observe that different initial samples lead to varying
escape times. Building on this insight, we propose two mitigation strategies
that adjust the initial noise-either collectively or individually-to find and
utilize initial samples that encourage earlier basin escape. These approaches
significantly reduce memorization while preserving image-text alignment.

*Siiri Lepp√§lampi,Sonja M. Hyrynsalmi,Erno Vanhala*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper examines representational biases in AI-generated occupational images created by DALL-E 3 and Ideogram, finding that gender stereotypes persist in the visuals.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate overlooked representation biases in AI-generated visualizations, particularly in occupational settings, and ensure diverse representation in media and professional use.

Method: Over 750 occupation-related images were generated using DALL-E 3 and Ideogram, then analyzed thematically to identify patterns of gender representation.

Result: The analysis revealed that both DALL-E 3 and Ideogram reinforce traditional gender stereotypes in AI-generated occupational images, though to different extents.

Conclusion: AI visualization tools risk perpetuating narrow representations of genders. The authors provide recommendations for practitioners and researchers to promote diversity in AI-generated images.

Abstract: Generative AI offers vast opportunities for creating visualisations, such as
graphics, videos, and images. However, recent studies around AI-generated
visualisations have primarily focused on the creation process and image
quality, overlooking representational biases. This study addresses this gap by
testing representation biases in AI-generated pictures in an occupational
setting and evaluating how two AI image generator tools, DALL-E 3 and Ideogram,
compare. Additionally, the study discusses topics such as ageing and emotions
in AI-generated images. As AI image tools are becoming more widely used,
addressing and mitigating harmful gender biases becomes essential to ensure
diverse representation in media and professional settings. In this study, over
750 AI-generated images of occupations were prompted. The thematic analysis
results revealed that both DALL-E 3 and Ideogram reinforce traditional gender
stereotypes in AI-generated images, although to varying degrees. These findings
emphasise that AI visualisation tools risk reinforcing narrow representations.
In our discussion section, we propose suggestions for practitioners,
individuals and researchers to increase representation when generating images
with visible genders.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve the efficiency of VAR without compromising image generation quality, by addressing computational redundancy during repeated Transformer calls.

Method: Incorporating a dynamic Mixture-of-Experts router with scale-aware thresholding to optimize expert selection based on token complexity and resolution, avoiding the need for extra training.

Result: Achieved 20% fewer FLOPs, 11% faster inference, and matching image quality compared to the dense baseline.

Conclusion: This novel approach successfully reduces computational demands and enhances efficiency in VAR image generation, maintaining competitive quality.

Abstract: Visual Autoregressive Models (VAR) offer efficient and high-quality image
generation but suffer from computational redundancy due to repeated Transformer
calls at increasing resolutions. We introduce a dynamic Mixture-of-Experts
router integrated into VAR. The new architecture allows to trade compute for
quality through scale-aware thresholding. This thresholding strategy balances
expert selection based on token complexity and resolution, without requiring

### [156] [Out-of-Distribution Detection in LiDAR Semantic Segmentation Using Epistemic Uncertainty from Hierarchical GMMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08631)
*Hanieh Shojaei Miandashti,Claus Brenner*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces an unsupervised method for detecting out-of-distribution (OOD) objects by utilizing epistemic uncertainties derived from a hierarchical Bayesian modeling of Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) parameters in the feature space of deep neural networks, achieving significant improvements over existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Detecting OOD objects is essential to improve scene understanding and prevent misclassification of unknown objects into known classes, a challenge in LiDAR point cloud semantic segmentation.

Method: The approach employs hierarchical Bayesian modeling of Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) parameters for calculating epistemic uncertainty in neural network feature space, eliminating reliance on auxiliary datasets or predictive entropy methods.

Result: The method demonstrated an 18% increase in AUROC, 22% improvement in AUPRC, and a 36% reduction in FPR95 on the SemanticKITTI dataset, outperforming predictive entropy-based approaches.

Conclusion: The proposed methodology effectively addresses uncertainty issues in OOD detection, offers superior performance, and avoids common pitfalls of existing unsupervised methods, marking it as a notable advancement in scene understanding for LiDAR point cloud segmentation.

Abstract: In addition to accurate scene understanding through precise semantic
segmentation of LiDAR point clouds, detecting out-of-distribution (OOD)
objects, instances not encountered during training, is essential to prevent the
incorrect assignment of unknown objects to known classes. While supervised OOD
detection methods depend on auxiliary OOD datasets, unsupervised methods avoid
this requirement but typically rely on predictive entropy, the entropy of the
predictive distribution obtained by averaging over an ensemble or multiple
posterior weight samples. However, these methods often conflate epistemic
(model) and aleatoric (data) uncertainties, misclassifying ambiguous in
distribution regions as OOD. To address this issue, we present an unsupervised
OOD detection approach that employs epistemic uncertainty derived from
hierarchical Bayesian modeling of Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) parameters in
the feature space of a deep neural network. Without requiring auxiliary data or
additional training stages, our approach outperforms existing uncertainty-based
methods on the SemanticKITTI dataset, achieving an 18\% improvement in AUROC,
22\% increase in AUPRC, and 36\% reduction in FPR95 (from 76\% to 40\%),
compared to the predictive entropy approach used in prior works.

*Conor McCarthy,Loes Quirijnen,Jan Peter van Zandwijk,Zeno Geradts,Marcel Worring*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper addresses limitations in Human Activity Recognition (HAR) by proposing Hi-OSCAR, a Hierarchical Open-set Classifier that identifies known activities and recognizes unknowns, supported by a new dataset, NFI_FARED.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional HAR systems struggle to deal with unseen activities and class overlap, limiting their reliability and functionality in real-world scenarios.

Method: The authors introduce Hi-OSCAR, a classification framework that organizes activity classes into a hierarchy, enabling open-set recognition and localization of unknown activities to the nearest internal node.

Result: Hi-OSCAR achieves state-of-the-art accuracy for known activities while successfully rejecting and providing insights on unknown activities.

Conclusion: Hi-OSCAR improves open-set HAR classification, and the new NFI_FARED dataset is a valuable resource for further research in this domain.

Abstract: Within Human Activity Recognition (HAR), there is an insurmountable gap
between the range of activities performed in life and those that can be
captured in an annotated sensor dataset used in training. Failure to properly
handle unseen activities seriously undermines any HAR classifier's reliability.
Additionally within HAR, not all classes are equally dissimilar, some
significantly overlap or encompass other sub-activities. Based on these
observations, we arrange activity classes into a structured hierarchy. From
there, we propose Hi-OSCAR: a Hierarchical Open-set Classifier for Activity
Recognition, that can identify known activities at state-of-the-art accuracy
while simultaneously rejecting unknown activities. This not only enables
open-set classification, but also allows for unknown classes to be localized to
the nearest internal node, providing insight beyond a binary "known/unknown"
classification. To facilitate this and future open-set HAR research, we
collected a new dataset: NFI_FARED. NFI_FARED contains data from multiple
subjects performing nineteen activities from a range of contexts, including
daily living, commuting, and rapid movements, which is fully public and
available for download.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The research introduces HiMIR, a hierarchical and efficient scheduling framework for image retrieval that improves accuracy and reduces computation compared to current systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional multi-vector retrieval (MVR) systems suffer from limited accuracy and inefficiency due to sub-optimal alignment and redundancy during matching. The study aims to address these issues in multimodal large language model (MLLM) applications.

Method: HiMIR employs a novel hierarchical approach that uses multiple levels of granularity to improve query-object alignment and reduce redundancy. It also uses cross-hierarchy similarity consistency and hierarchy sparsity to minimize unnecessary computations. Automatic configuration of parameters for different datasets adds practicality.

Result: The proposed HiMIR framework significantly improves retrieval accuracy while reducing computational costs by up to 3.5 times compared to existing MVR systems.

Conclusion: HiMIR demonstrates the potential for substantial advancements in image retrieval, enhancing both accuracy and computational efficiency for diverse multimodal scenarios.

Abstract: To effectively leverage user-specific data, retrieval augmented generation
(RAG) is employed in multimodal large language model (MLLM) applications.
However, conventional retrieval approaches often suffer from limited retrieval
accuracy. Recent advances in multi-vector retrieval (MVR) improve accuracy by
decomposing queries and matching against segmented images. They still suffer
from sub-optimal accuracy and efficiency, overlooking alignment between the
query and varying image objects and redundant fine-grained image segments. In
this work, we present an efficient scheduling framework for image retrieval -
HiMIR. First, we introduce a novel hierarchical paradigm, employing multiple
intermediate granularities for varying image objects to enhance alignment.
Second, we minimize redundancy in retrieval by leveraging cross-hierarchy
similarity consistency and hierarchy sparsity to minimize unnecessary matching
computation. Furthermore, we configure parameters for each dataset
automatically for practicality across diverse scenarios. Our empirical study
shows that, HiMIR not only achieves substantial accuracy improvements but also
reduces computation by up to 3.5 times over the existing MVR system.

*Mostafa Mohammadpour,Mehdi Zekriyapanah Gashti,Yusif S. Gasimov*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper presents a novel method for detecting high-frequency oscillations (HFOs), utilizing an unsupervised clustering technique for automated classification, achieving high sensitivity and precision.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve precision in identifying epileptogenic zones for epilepsy surgery, overcoming challenges in HFOs detection, including labor-intensive manual processes.

Method: The authors developed an automated detection approach using unsupervised clustering and S-transform-based event extraction in the time-frequency domain.

Result: The method demonstrated 97.67% sensitivity, 98.57% precision, and an F-score of 97.78% on controlled datasets. For epilepsy patients, results aligned strongly with surgical outcomes, with a 0.73 HFO rate ratio between resected and non-resected regions.

Conclusion: Automated detection methods like the proposed approach enhance reliability and precision in pinpointing epileptogenic zones, supporting HFOs as critical biomarkers to optimize surgical outcomes.

Abstract: High-frequency oscillations (HFOs) are a new biomarker for identifying the
epileptogenic zone. Mapping HFO-generating regions can improve the precision of
resection sites in patients with refractory epilepsy. However, detecting HFOs
remains challenging, and their clinical features are not yet fully defined.
Visual identification of HFOs is time-consuming, labor-intensive, and
subjective. As a result, developing automated methods to detect HFOs is
critical for research and clinical use. In this study, we developed a novel
method for detecting HFOs in the ripple and fast ripple frequency bands (80-500
Hz). We validated it using both controlled datasets and data from epilepsy
patients. Our method employs an unsupervised clustering technique to categorize
events extracted from the time-frequency domain using the S-transform. The
proposed detector differentiates HFOs events from spikes, background activity,
and artifacts. Compared to existing detectors, our method achieved a
sensitivity of 97.67%, a precision of 98.57%, and an F-score of 97.78% on the
controlled dataset. In epilepsy patients, our results showed a stronger
correlation with surgical outcomes, with a ratio of 0.73 between HFOs rates in
resected versus non-resected contacts. The study confirmed previous findings
that HFOs are promising biomarkers of epileptogenicity in epileptic patients.
Removing HFOs, especially fast ripple, leads to seizure freedom, while
remaining HFOs lead to seizure recurrence.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper explores DINOv2's representational nature by analyzing concepts using SAEs, revealing specialized functional roles and introducing the Minkowski Representation Hypothesis (MRH).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To better understand the representational nature of DINOv2 and explore how its learned concepts contribute to downstream tasks such as object recognition, segmentation, and depth estimation.

Method: The study uses Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) to create a 32,000-unit dictionary to examine task-specific recruitment of learned concepts, their geometry, and conceptual structure.

Result: The representations show functional specialization in tasks, evolve toward coherence (away from maximal orthogonality), and are organized through convex mixtures of archetypes, supporting a structured representational format.

Conclusion: The study proposes the Minkowski Representation Hypothesis (MRH) as a refined framework for interpreting representations in vision transformers like DINOv2.

Abstract: DINOv2 is routinely deployed to recognize objects, scenes, and actions; yet
the nature of what it perceives remains unknown. As a working baseline, we
adopt the Linear Representation Hypothesis (LRH) and operationalize it using
SAEs, producing a 32,000-unit dictionary that serves as the interpretability
backbone of our study, which unfolds in three parts.
  In the first part, we analyze how different downstream tasks recruit concepts
from our learned dictionary, revealing functional specialization:
classification exploits "Elsewhere" concepts that fire everywhere except on
target objects, implementing learned negations; segmentation relies on boundary
detectors forming coherent subspaces; depth estimation draws on three distinct
monocular depth cues matching visual neuroscience principles.
  Following these functional results, we analyze the geometry and statistics of
the concepts learned by the SAE. We found that representations are partly dense
rather than strictly sparse. The dictionary evolves toward greater coherence
and departs from maximally orthogonal ideals (Grassmannian frames). Within an
image, tokens occupy a low dimensional, locally connected set persisting after
removing position. These signs suggest representations are organized beyond
linear sparsity alone.
  Synthesizing these observations, we propose a refined view: tokens are formed
by combining convex mixtures of archetypes (e.g., a rabbit among animals, brown
among colors, fluffy among textures). This structure is grounded in Gardenfors'
conceptual spaces and in the model's mechanism as multi-head attention produces
sums of convex mixtures, defining regions bounded by archetypes. We introduce
the Minkowski Representation Hypothesis (MRH) and examine its empirical
signatures and implications for interpreting vision-transformer
representations.

*Zhe Dong,Yuzhe Sun,Haochen Jiang,Tianzhu Liu,Yanfeng Gu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes a remote sensing image restoration method, PhyDAE, which explicitly models degradation physics and outperforms state-of-the-art methods across multiple restoration tasks with enhanced efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the limitations of existing image restoration methods, which overly rely on implicit feature representations and fail to explicitly model the complex degradation physics impacting remote sensing images.

Method: PhyDAE, a two-stage cascaded architecture, transforms implicit degradation features into explicit decision signals. It uses residual manifold projection and frequency-aware decomposition to analyze degradations, while incorporating computationally efficient, physics-consistent modules.

Result: Experiments on three benchmark datasets show that PhyDAE delivers superior performance across restoration tasks like haze, noise, blur, and low-light correction. It also reduces parameter count and computational complexity significantly.

Conclusion: PhyDAE effectively balances performance and efficiency, demonstrating substantial benefits over existing methods. Its novel degradation modeling approach advances remote sensing image restoration.

Abstract: Remote sensing images inevitably suffer from various degradation factors
during acquisition, including atmospheric interference, sensor limitations, and
imaging conditions. These complex and heterogeneous degradations pose severe
challenges to image quality and downstream interpretation tasks. Addressing
limitations of existing all-in-one restoration methods that overly rely on
implicit feature representations and lack explicit modeling of degradation
physics, this paper proposes Physics-Guided Degradation-Adaptive Experts
(PhyDAE). The method employs a two-stage cascaded architecture transforming
degradation information from implicit features into explicit decision signals,
enabling precise identification and differentiated processing of multiple
heterogeneous degradations including haze, noise, blur, and low-light
conditions. The model incorporates progressive degradation mining and
exploitation mechanisms, where the Residual Manifold Projector (RMP) and
Frequency-Aware Degradation Decomposer (FADD) comprehensively analyze
degradation characteristics from manifold geometry and frequency perspectives.
Physics-aware expert modules and temperature-controlled sparse activation
strategies are introduced to enhance computational efficiency while ensuring
imaging physics consistency. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets
(MD-RSID, MD-RRSHID, and MDRS-Landsat) demonstrate that PhyDAE achieves
superior performance across all four restoration tasks, comprehensively
outperforming state-of-the-art methods. Notably, PhyDAE substantially improves
restoration quality while achieving significant reductions in parameter count
and computational complexity, resulting in remarkable efficiency gains compared
to mainstream approaches and achieving optimal balance between performance and
efficiency. Code is available at https://github.com/HIT-SIRS/PhyDAE.

Result: Hulu-Med demonstrates state-of-the-art performance across 30 benchmarks, surpassing open-source models and rivaling proprietary systems in tasks such as visual reasoning, report generation, and multilingual rare disease analysis.

Conclusion: The open-source pipeline of Hulu-Med reveals that high-performance medical VLMs can be achieved transparently, supporting accessible and impactful clinical AI solutions.

Abstract: Real-world clinical decision-making grapples with integrating information
from diverse data modalities, including medical text, 2D/3D images, and video,
leading to inefficiencies and potential diagnostic oversights. While generalist
vision-language models (VLMs) offer promise, their medical development faces
challenges of opaque pipelines, data scarcity, and architectural inflexibility.
Here we present Hulu-Med, a transparent medical VLM that unifies understanding
across all these modalities. Built upon a unified patch-based vision encoder
and an LLM decoder, Hulu-Med was progressively trained on 16.7 million (M)
samples to scale from 2D to 3D and video comprehension. The medical-aware token
reduction enables efficient training, requiring only 4,000 to 40,000 GPU hours
for 7B to 32B parameter variants. Extensive evaluation across 30 benchmarks
exhibits state-of-the-art performance, surpassing leading open-source models
and competing with proprietary systems in tasks spanning visual
question-answering, medical report generation, and complex reasoning in
multilingual and rare disease scenarios. By open-sourcing our complete
pipeline, we establish that high-performance medical VLM can be achieved
transparently, providing a foundational tool for accessible and impactful

*Nicolas Ewen,Jairo Diaz-Rodriguez,Kelly Ramsay*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Structured Output Regularization (SOR) addresses limitations in traditional transfer learning by freezing network structures and applying group lasso and $L_1$ penalties, leading to competitive results in few-shot medical imaging tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional transfer learning often struggles with adapting to domain-specific features and overfitting when data is limited.

Method: SOR freezes internal network structures while applying group lasso and $L_1$ penalties. This optimizes domain-specific adaptation without requiring significant additional parameters.

Result: SOR demonstrated competitive performance on three few-shot medical imaging classification tasks using DenseNet121 and EfficientNetB4 architectures compared to existing benchmarks.

Conclusion: SOR offers an efficient and broadly applicable framework for improving transfer learning outcomes, particularly in domains with limited data.

Abstract: Traditional transfer learning typically reuses large pre-trained networks by
freezing some of their weights and adding task-specific layers. While this
approach is computationally efficient, it limits the model's ability to adapt
to domain-specific features and can still lead to overfitting with very limited
data. To address these limitations, we propose Structured Output Regularization
(SOR), a simple yet effective framework that freezes the internal network
structures (e.g., convolutional filters) while using a combination of group
lasso and $L_1$ penalties. This framework tailors the model to specific data
with minimal additional parameters and is easily applicable to various network
components, such as convolutional filters or various blocks in neural networks
enabling broad applicability for transfer learning tasks. We evaluate SOR on
three few shot medical imaging classification tasks and we achieve competitive
results using DenseNet121, and EfficientNetB4 bases compared to established
benchmarks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Puffin, a unified multimodal model for camera-centric understanding and generation, integrating language and spatial cues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To combine spatial intelligence tasks of understanding and generating scenes from arbitrary viewpoints, which are currently studied separately.

Method: Developed Puffin, a model trained on 4 million vision-language-camera triplets, incorporating a paradigm that treats cameras as language, enabling reasoning across visual and geometric contexts.

Result: Puffin outperforms specialized models in camera-centric tasks and generalizes to diverse cross-view tasks such as spatial imagination and photography guidance.

Conclusion: Puffin showcases the potential for unified multimodal spatial intelligence by bridging the gap between cameras, language, and vision.

Abstract: Camera-centric understanding and generation are two cornerstones of spatial
intelligence, yet they are typically studied in isolation. We present Puffin, a
unified camera-centric multimodal model that extends spatial awareness along
the camera dimension. Puffin integrates language regression and diffusion-based
generation to interpret and create scenes from arbitrary viewpoints. To bridge
the modality gap between cameras and vision-language, we introduce a novel
paradigm that treats camera as language, enabling thinking with camera. This
guides the model to align spatially grounded visual cues with photographic
terminology while reasoning across geometric context. Puffin is trained on
Puffin-4M, a large-scale dataset of 4 million vision-language-camera triplets.
We incorporate both global camera parameters and pixel-wise camera maps,
yielding flexible and reliable spatial generation. Experiments demonstrate
Puffin superior performance over specialized models for camera-centric
generation and understanding. With instruction tuning, Puffin generalizes to
diverse cross-view tasks such as spatial imagination, world exploration, and
photography guidance. We will release the code, models, dataset pipeline, and
benchmark to advance multimodal spatial intelligence research.

TL;DR: This paper introduces BEAR, a benchmark to evaluate multimodal large language models (MLLMs) on embodied capabilities, and proposes BEAR-Agent to improve MLLM performance on such tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks for MLLMs lack a comprehensive and systematic evaluation of their embodied capabilities across various domains, which hinders advancement in this area.

Method: The paper presents BEAR, a benchmark with 4,469 entries across 14 domains and 6 categories targeting atomic embodied capabilities, and introduces BEAR-Agent, which integrates pretrained vision models with MLLMs to enhance their embodied abilities.

Result: Evaluation of 20 MLLMs using BEAR highlights their limitations, while BEAR-Agent improves performance by 9.12% absolute and 17.5% relative on GPT-5 across diverse embodied capabilities.

Conclusion: BEAR provides a detailed framework for assessing and enhancing MLLM embodied capabilities. The improvements demonstrated by BEAR-Agent signify its potential to boost performance in simulated embodied tasks.

Abstract: Embodied capabilities refer to a suite of fundamental abilities for an agent
to perceive, comprehend, and interact with the physical world. While multimodal
large language models (MLLMs) show promise as embodied agents, a thorough and
systematic evaluation of their embodied capabilities remains underexplored, as
existing benchmarks primarily focus on specific domains such as planning or
spatial understanding. To bridge this gap, we introduce BEAR, a comprehensive
and fine-grained benchmark that evaluates MLLMs on atomic embodied
capabilities. BEAR comprises 4,469 interleaved image-video-text entries across
14 domains in 6 categories, including tasks from low-level pointing, trajectory
understanding, spatial reasoning, to high-level planning. Extensive evaluation
results of 20 representative MLLMs reveal their persistent limitations across
all domains of embodied capabilities. To tackle the shortfall, we propose
BEAR-Agent, a multimodal conversable agent that integrates pretrained vision
models to strengthen MLLM perception, 3D understanding, and planning
capabilities. It substantially enhances MLLM performance across diverse
embodied capabilities on BEAR, yielding a 9.12% absolute gain and a relative
improvement of 17.5% on GPT-5. Furthermore, our experiments indicate that
improving MLLM embodied capabilities can benefit embodied tasks in simulated
environments. Project website: https://bear-official66.github.io/

*Jiayang Liu,Daniel Tso,Yiming Bu,Qinru Qiu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes a biologically inspired defense framework for deep learning models to mitigate adversarial attacks without retraining, demonstrating improved robustness and reduced training overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Adversarial attacks pose a challenge to deep learning model deployment, and current methods to enhance robustness are computationally intensive. The paper investigates biological mechanisms as an alternative.

Method: The approach integrates three biological mechanisms: foveal-peripheral processing, saccadic eye movements guided by reinforcement learning, and cortical filling-in to preprocess images before classification.

Result: Experiments on the ImageNet dataset show enhanced robustness of diverse classifiers against adversarial attacks, with reduced training burden compared to prior techniques.

Conclusion: The biologically inspired defense method improves system robustness, preserves image semantic integrity, and can be seamlessly integrated with existing classifiers without retraining.

Abstract: Adversarial attacks significantly challenge the safe deployment of deep
learning models, particularly in real-world applications. Traditional defenses
often rely on computationally intensive optimization (e.g., adversarial
training or data augmentation) to improve robustness, whereas the human visual
system achieves inherent robustness to adversarial perturbations through
evolved biological mechanisms. We hypothesize that attention guided
non-homogeneous sparse sampling and predictive coding plays a key role in this
robustness. To test this hypothesis, we propose a novel defense framework
incorporating three key biological mechanisms: foveal-peripheral processing,
saccadic eye movements, and cortical filling-in. Our approach employs
reinforcement learning-guided saccades to selectively capture multiple
foveal-peripheral glimpses, which are integrated into a reconstructed image
before classification. This biologically inspired preprocessing effectively
mitigates adversarial noise, preserves semantic integrity, and notably requires
no retraining or fine-tuning of downstream classifiers, enabling seamless
integration with existing systems. Experiments on the ImageNet dataset
demonstrate that our method improves system robustness across diverse
classifiers and attack types, while significantly reducing training overhead
compared to both biologically and non-biologically inspired defense techniques.

Abstract: This paper presents a real-time spill detection system that utilizes
pretrained deep learning models with RGB and thermal imaging to classify spill
vs. no-spill scenarios across varied environments. Using a balanced binary
dataset (4,000 images), our experiments demonstrate the advantages of thermal
imaging in inference speed, accuracy, and model size. We achieve up to 100%
accuracy using lightweight models like VGG19 and NasNetMobile, with thermal
models performing faster and more robustly across different lighting
conditions. Our system runs on consumer-grade hardware (RTX 4080) and achieves

TL;DR: The paper introduces LinearSR, a framework for photorealistic image super-resolution (SR) using linear attention, overcoming previous challenges and achieving state-of-the-art quality and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the computational bottlenecks in image SR caused by quadratic complexity in self-attention and explore the untapped potential of linear attention for photorealistic SR.

Method: LinearSR employs a holistic approach, featuring ESGF for stability, SNR-based MoE for balancing perception and distortion, and TAG for efficient guidance.

Result: LinearSR achieves state-of-the-art perceptual quality with exceptional computational efficiency, with competitive inference speed and robust results.

Conclusion: LinearSR lays the groundwork for leveraging linear attention in photorealistic SR, setting a paradigm for future efficient generative super-resolution research.

Abstract: Generative models for Image Super-Resolution (SR) are increasingly powerful,
yet their reliance on self-attention's quadratic complexity (O(N^2)) creates a
major computational bottleneck. Linear Attention offers an O(N) solution, but
its promise for photorealistic SR has remained largely untapped, historically
hindered by a cascade of interrelated and previously unsolved challenges. This
paper introduces LinearSR, a holistic framework that, for the first time,
systematically overcomes these critical hurdles. Specifically, we resolve a
fundamental, training instability that causes catastrophic model divergence
using our novel "knee point"-based Early-Stopping Guided Fine-tuning (ESGF)
strategy. Furthermore, we mitigate the classic perception-distortion trade-off
with a dedicated SNR-based Mixture of Experts (MoE) architecture. Finally, we
establish an effective and lightweight guidance paradigm, TAG, derived from our
"precision-over-volume" principle. Our resulting LinearSR model simultaneously
delivers state-of-the-art perceptual quality with exceptional efficiency. Its
core diffusion forward pass (1-NFE) achieves SOTA-level speed, while its
overall multi-step inference time remains highly competitive. This work
provides the first robust methodology for applying Linear Attention in the
photorealistic SR domain, establishing a foundational paradigm for future
research in efficient generative super-resolution.

Motivation: The paper aims to address the need for accurate, non-invasive, and efficient methods for wildlife population monitoring, as traditional methods like leg banding are invasive and time-consuming.

Method: The researchers developed an unsupervised pipeline combining YOLO and Grounding DINO for object detection, optical flow blur detection, DINOv2 for image encoding, and clustering methods to extract key frames from videos of parrots.

Result: The pipeline yielded high-accuracy key frame collections for kƒÅkƒÅ re-identification, demonstrating effectiveness in recognizing individuals.

Conclusion: The approach provides a non-invasive and efficient solution for wildlife monitoring, offering potential for broader applications in ecology and conservation biology, especially in challenging environments.

Abstract: Accurate recognition and re-identification of individual animals is essential
for successful wildlife population monitoring. Traditional methods, such as leg
banding of birds, are time consuming and invasive. Recent progress in
artificial intelligence, particularly computer vision, offers encouraging
solutions for smart conservation and efficient automation. This study presents
a unique pipeline for extracting high-quality key frames from videos of
k\={a}k\={a} (Nestor meridionalis), a threatened forest-dwelling parrot in New
Zealand. Key frame extraction is well-studied in person re-identification,
however, its application to wildlife is limited. Using video recordings at a
custom-built feeder, we extract key frames and evaluate the re-identification
performance of our pipeline. Our unsupervised methodology combines object
detection using YOLO and Grounding DINO, optical flow blur detection, image
encoding with DINOv2, and clustering methods to identify representative key
frames. The results indicate that our proposed key frame selection methods
yield image collections which achieve high accuracy in k\={a}k\={a}
re-identification, providing a foundation for future research using media
collected in more diverse and challenging environments. Through the use of
artificial intelligence and computer vision, our non-invasive and efficient
approach provides a valuable alternative to traditional physical tagging
methods for recognising k\={a}k\={a} individuals and therefore improving the
monitoring of populations. This research contributes to developing fresh
approaches in wildlife monitoring, with applications in ecology and
conservation biology.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Q-Router, an advanced framework for video quality assessment (VQA) that improves generalization, interpretability, and extensibility by integrating a multi-tiered system using vision-language models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The existing VQA models suffer from poor generalization across diverse video types, limited interpretability, and lack of extensibility for novel use cases, necessitating a more robust and flexible solution.

Method: The authors propose Q-Router, which employs a multi-tier routing system integrating expert models and vision-language models (VLMs) to dynamically ensemble the most suitable experts based on input video semantics. The system prioritizes interpretability through specific spatiotemporal artifact localization.

Result: Q-Router exceeds state-of-the-art performance across various benchmarks, improves generalization, and provides significant interpretability. It also demonstrates capability in spatiotemporal artifact localization and performs well in quality-based question answering.

Conclusion: Q-Router is a unified and versatile framework that advances VQA systems by delivering robust, interpretable, and extensible performance across diverse video sources, with potential utility in video generation tasks.

Abstract: Video quality assessment (VQA) is a fundamental computer vision task that
aims to predict the perceptual quality of a given video in alignment with human
judgments. Existing performant VQA models trained with direct score supervision
suffer from (1) poor generalization across diverse content and tasks, ranging
from user-generated content (UGC), short-form videos, to AI-generated content
(AIGC), (2) limited interpretability, and (3) lack of extensibility to novel
use cases or content types. We propose Q-Router, an agentic framework for
universal VQA with a multi-tier model routing system. Q-Router integrates a
diverse set of expert models and employs vision--language models (VLMs) as
real-time routers that dynamically reason and then ensemble the most
appropriate experts conditioned on the input video semantics. We build a
multi-tiered routing system based on the computing budget, with the heaviest
tier involving a specific spatiotemporal artifacts localization for
interpretability. This agentic design enables Q-Router to combine the
complementary strengths of specialized experts, achieving both flexibility and
robustness in delivering consistent performance across heterogeneous video
sources and tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Q-Router matches or
surpasses state-of-the-art VQA models on a variety of benchmarks, while
substantially improving generalization and interpretability. Moreover, Q-Router
excels on the quality-based question answering benchmark, Q-Bench-Video,
highlighting its promise as a foundation for next-generation VQA systems.
Finally, we show that Q-Router capably localizes spatiotemporal artifacts,
showing potential as a reward function for post-training video generation
models.

*Yuanhao Zou,Zhaozheng Yin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper focuses on advancing Medical Visual Question Answering (Med-VQA) with a framework addressing modality alignment challenges, hard negatives, and knowledge fusion via innovative methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance Med-VQA by tackling issues like lack of unified modality alignment solutions, unaddressed hard negatives, and irrelevant knowledge fusion techniques.

Method: 1. Unified modality alignment using contrastive learning and optimal transport theory. 2. Hard negative mining with soft labels and discrimination methods. 3. A Gated Cross-Attention Module incorporating answer vocabulary as prior knowledge.

Result: The proposed methods achieve superior performance on popular Med-VQA datasets such as RAD-VQA, SLAKE, PathVQA, and VQA-2019.

Conclusion: The framework effectively resolves key challenges in Med-VQA, setting a new performance benchmark and demonstrating the potential for systematic solutions in medical vision and language tasks.

Abstract: Medical Visual Question Answering (Med-VQA) is a challenging task that
requires a deep understanding of both medical images and textual questions.
Although recent works leveraging Medical Vision-Language Pre-training (Med-VLP)
have shown strong performance on the Med-VQA task, there is still no unified
solution for modality alignment, and the issue of hard negatives remains
under-explored. Additionally, commonly used knowledge fusion techniques for
Med-VQA may introduce irrelevant information. In this work, we propose a
framework to address these challenges through three key contributions: (1) a
unified solution for heterogeneous modality alignments across multiple levels,
modalities, views, and stages, leveraging methods like contrastive learning and
optimal transport theory; (2) a hard negative mining method that employs soft
labels for multi-modality alignments and enforces the hard negative pair
discrimination; and (3) a Gated Cross-Attention Module for Med-VQA that
integrates the answer vocabulary as prior knowledge and selects relevant
information from it. Our framework outperforms the previous state-of-the-art on
widely used Med-VQA datasets like RAD-VQA, SLAKE, PathVQA and VQA-2019.

*Rohan Choudhury,Shanchuan Lin,Jianyi Wang,Hao Chen,Qi Zhao,Feng Cheng,Lu Jiang,Kris Kitani,Laszlo A. Jeni*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SkipSR is proposed to speed up video super-resolution (SR) by skipping computation for low-detail regions, achieving up to 60% faster processing with no loss in perceptual quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Video SR methods are slow and expensive due to uniform processing of all pixels, even in low-detail regions.

Method: SkipSR identifies low-detail regions from low-resolution input and skips computation for these areas while super-resolving only the necessary regions.

Result: SkipSR preserves perceptual quality while significantly reducing computation time, offering up to 60% faster latency compared to prior models on 720p videos.

Conclusion: The framework provides an improved approach to video SR by addressing inefficiencies in computation, maximizing speed without sacrificing quality.

Abstract: Diffusion-based super-resolution (SR) is a key component in video generation
and video restoration, but is slow and expensive, limiting scalability to
higher resolutions and longer videos. Our key insight is that many regions in
video are inherently low-detail and gain little from refinement, yet current
methods process all pixels uniformly. To take advantage of this, we propose
SkipSR, a simple framework for accelerating video SR by identifying low-detail
regions directly from low-resolution input, then skipping computation on them
entirely, only super-resolving the areas that require refinement. This simple
yet effective strategy preserves perceptual quality in both standard and
one-step diffusion SR models while significantly reducing computation. In
standard SR benchmarks, our method achieves up to 60% faster end-to-end latency
than prior models on 720p videos with no perceptible loss in quality. Video
demos are available at https://rccchoudhury.github.io/skipsr/

TL;DR: This paper proposes D-CoDe, a novel training-free adaptation framework for extending image-pretrained vision-language models (VLMs) to video tasks by addressing challenges like perception bottleneck and token overload.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To extend image-pretrained VLMs to video-language tasks despite challenges posed by dense and temporally complex visual inputs.

Method: D-CoDe incorporates dynamic compression to select representative frames and reduce redundancy, and question decomposition to reformulate queries into sub-questions for better video understanding.

Result: D-CoDe improves video understanding across various benchmarks and excels in handling long-video, complex video-language tasks.

Conclusion: D-CoDe demonstrates that training-free adaptation techniques can effectively enable video capabilities in image-pretrained VLMs by addressing perception bottleneck and token overload challenges.

Abstract: Video large language models (Vid-LLMs), which excel in diverse video-language
tasks, can be effectively constructed by adapting image-pretrained
vision-language models (VLMs). However, this adaptation remains challenging, as
it requires processing dense and temporally extended visual inputs that exceed
the capacity of image-based models. This paper identifies the perception
bottleneck and token overload as key challenges in extending image-based VLMs
to the video domain. To address these issues, we propose D-CoDe, a
training-free adaptation framework that incorporates dynamic compression and
question decomposition. Specifically, dynamic compression alleviates the
perception bottleneck through adaptive selection of representative frames and
content-aware aggregation of spatial tokens, thereby reducing redundancy while
preserving informative content. In parallel, question decomposition mitigates
token overload by reformulating the original query into sub-questions, guiding
the model to focus on distinct aspects of the video and enabling more
comprehensive understanding. Experiments demonstrate that D-CoDe effectively
improves video understanding across various benchmarks. Furthermore, strong
performance on the challenging long-video benchmark highlights the potential of
D-CoDe in handling complex video-language tasks. Code is available at

### [174] [FOLK: Fast Open-Vocabulary 3D Instance Segmentation via Label-guided Knowledge Distillation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08849)
*Hongrui Wu,Zhicheng Gao,Jin Cao,Kelu Yao,Wen Shen,Zhihua Wei*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces FOLK, an open-vocabulary 3D instance segmentation method that avoids traditional reliance on computationally expensive 2D mapping strategies, boosting inference speed and accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for open-vocabulary 3D instance segmentation heavily depend on mapping 3D data to 2D images, which introduces noise from occlusions and slows inference. Faster and more direct solutions are required.

Method: FOLK introduces a label-guided knowledge distillation method, where a teacher model captures 2D embeddings enriched with visibility and viewpoint diversity. These embeddings are distilled into a 3D student model that directly processes 3D point clouds.

Result: Experiments on ScanNet200 and Replica datasets show state-of-the-art performance with FOLK achieving an AP50 score of 35.7 on ScanNet200, along with an inference speed improvement of up to 152.2x compared to prior methods.

Conclusion: The proposed method significantly accelerates open-vocabulary 3D segmentation while maintaining high accuracy. It provides an effective and efficient approach to classify instances directly from 3D point clouds.

Abstract: Open-vocabulary 3D instance segmentation seeks to segment and classify
instances beyond the annotated label space. Existing methods typically map 3D
instances to 2D RGB-D images, and then employ vision-language models (VLMs) for
classification. However, such a mapping strategy usually introduces noise from
2D occlusions and incurs substantial computational and memory costs during
inference, slowing down the inference speed. To address the above problems, we
propose a Fast Open-vocabulary 3D instance segmentation method via Label-guided
Knowledge distillation (FOLK). Our core idea is to design a teacher model that
extracts high-quality instance embeddings and distills its open-vocabulary
knowledge into a 3D student model. In this way, during inference, the distilled
3D model can directly classify instances from the 3D point cloud, avoiding
noise caused by occlusions and significantly accelerating the inference
process. Specifically, we first design a teacher model to generate a 2D CLIP
embedding for each 3D instance, incorporating both visibility and viewpoint
diversity, which serves as the learning target for distillation. We then
develop a 3D student model that directly produces a 3D embedding for each 3D
instance. During training, we propose a label-guided distillation algorithm to
distill open-vocabulary knowledge from label-consistent 2D embeddings into the
student model. FOLK conducted experiments on the ScanNet200 and Replica
datasets, achieving state-of-the-art performance on the ScanNet200 dataset with
an AP50 score of 35.7, while running approximately 6.0x to 152.2x faster than
previous methods. All codes will be released after the paper is accepted.

*Ronan John,Anis Chihoub,Ryan Meegan,Gina Sidelli,Jeffery Neyhart,Peter Oudemans,Kristin Dana*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a self-supervised approach using vision transformers (ViTs) for monitoring cranberry crop growth, avoiding manual image annotations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to automate the time-intensive task of change monitoring in cranberry farming, which is currently done manually, by leveraging deep learning techniques.

Method: The method involves fine-tuning vision transformers (ViTs) with a two-fold pretext task (time regression and class prediction) to create an interpretable temporal model of crop growth, all while avoiding manual annotations.

Result: The resulting model generates 2D temporal tracks that predict growth over time and distinguish differences among cranberry varieties. Additionally, a novel time-lapse dataset featuring eight cranberry varieties is introduced.

Conclusion: This approach demonstrates potential in automating and innovating crop growth modeling, and it is extendable to other crops. The dataset and code are made publicly available to support further research.

Abstract: Change monitoring is an essential task for cranberry farming as it provides
both breeders and growers with the ability to analyze growth, predict yield,
and make treatment decisions. However, this task is often done manually,
requiring significant time on the part of a cranberry grower or breeder. Deep
learning based change monitoring holds promise, despite the caveat of
hard-to-interpret high dimensional features and hand-annotations for
fine-tuning. To address this gap, we introduce a method for modeling crop
growth based on fine-tuning vision transformers (ViTs) using a self-supervised
approach that avoids tedious image annotations. We use a two-fold pretext task
(time regression and class prediction) to learn a latent space for the
time-lapse evolution of plant and fruit appearance. The resulting 2D temporal
tracks provide an interpretable time-series model of crop growth that can be
used to: 1) predict growth over time and 2) distinguish temporal differences of
cranberry varieties. We also provide a novel time-lapse dataset of cranberry
fruit featuring eight distinct varieties, observed 52 times over the growing
season (span of around four months), annotated with information about fungicide
application, yield, and rot. Our approach is general and can be applied to
other crops and applications (code and dataset can be found at https://github.

### [176] [PHyCLIP: $\ell_1$-Product of Hyperbolic Factors Unifies Hierarchy and Compositionality in Vision-Language Representation Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08919)
*Daiki Yoshikawa,Takashi Matsubara*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PHyCLIP employs a novel metric combining hyperbolic geometry and Boolean algebra to improve multi-modal semantic representation in vision-language models, excelling in hierarchy and compositionality tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of current vision-language models in representing both hierarchical and compositional semantic structures effectively.

Method: Developed the PHyCLIP framework utilizing an $\ell_1$-Product metric in a Cartesian product of hyperbolic factors for efficient representation of hierarchical and compositional semantics.

Result: PHyCLIP surpasses prior methods in tasks like zero-shot classification, retrieval, hierarchical classification, and compositional understanding, with improved interpretability.

Conclusion: The innovative use of hyperbolic factors and Boolean algebra principles in PHyCLIP resolves critical representation challenges, providing a robust alternative to single-space approaches.

Abstract: Vision-language models have achieved remarkable success in multi-modal
representation learning from large-scale pairs of visual scenes and linguistic
descriptions. However, they still struggle to simultaneously express two
distinct types of semantic structures: the hierarchy within a concept family
(e.g., dog $\preceq$ mammal $\preceq$ animal) and the compositionality across
different concept families (e.g., "a dog in a car" $\preceq$ dog, car). Recent
works have addressed this challenge by employing hyperbolic space, which
efficiently captures tree-like hierarchy, yet its suitability for representing
compositionality remains unclear. To resolve this dilemma, we propose PHyCLIP,
which employs an $\ell_1$-Product metric on a Cartesian product of Hyperbolic
factors. With our design, intra-family hierarchies emerge within individual
hyperbolic factors, and cross-family composition is captured by the
$\ell_1$-product metric, analogous to a Boolean algebra. Experiments on
zero-shot classification, retrieval, hierarchical classification, and
compositional understanding tasks demonstrate that PHyCLIP outperforms existing
single-space approaches and offers more interpretable structures in the
embedding space.

*Yufei Song,Ziqi Zhou,Qi Lu,Hangtao Zhang,Yifan Hu,Lulu Xue,Shengshan Hu,Minghui Li,Leo Yu Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces SegTrans, a transfer attack framework for segmentation models that enhances adversarial example transferability by re-mapping local regions' semantics instead of relying on global information. It significantly improves transfer success rates and computational efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing adversarial attack methods for segmentation models have poor transferability due to contextual dependencies and feature distribution gaps between surrogate and target models.

Method: The proposed SegTrans framework divides input samples into local regions, remaps their semantics to create enhanced samples used for perturbation optimization, which improves transferability.

Result: Experiments on benchmark datasets (PASCAL VOC, Cityscapes), models, and networks indicate SegTrans increases transfer success rates by 8.55% on average and doubles computational efficiency compared to prior methods.

Conclusion: SegTrans is an effective and computationally efficient solution to improve adversarial example transferability for segmentation models, addressing limitations of current transfer attack approaches.

Abstract: Segmentation models exhibit significant vulnerability to adversarial examples
in white-box settings, but existing adversarial attack methods often show poor
transferability across different segmentation models. While some researchers
have explored transfer-based adversarial attack (i.e., transfer attack) methods
for segmentation models, the complex contextual dependencies within these
models and the feature distribution gaps between surrogate and target models
result in unsatisfactory transfer success rates. To address these issues, we
propose SegTrans, a novel transfer attack framework that divides the input
sample into multiple local regions and remaps their semantic information to
generate diverse enhanced samples. These enhanced samples replace the original
ones for perturbation optimization, thereby improving the transferability of
adversarial examples across different segmentation models. Unlike existing
methods, SegTrans only retains local semantic information from the original
input, rather than using global semantic information to optimize perturbations.
Extensive experiments on two benchmark datasets, PASCAL VOC and Cityscapes,
four different segmentation models, and three backbone networks show that
SegTrans significantly improves adversarial transfer success rates without
introducing additional computational overhead. Compared to the current
state-of-the-art methods, SegTrans achieves an average increase of 8.55% in
transfer attack success rate and improves computational efficiency by more than
100%.

*Han Hu,Zhuoran Zheng,Chen Lyu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces Adaptive Singular Value Perturbation (ASVP), a defense mechanism against knowledge distillation attacks targeting image restoration models, by leveraging singular value decomposition to disrupt student learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the vulnerability of image restoration models to knowledge distillation attacks, which compromise deep model intellectual property.

Method: ASVP perturbs singular values in internal feature maps using singular value decomposition to inject structured, high-frequency disturbances while maintaining the teacher model's output quality.

Result: ASVP reduces student network performance (PSNR by up to 4 dB and SSIM by 60-75%) across five restoration tasks without significantly affecting the teacher model.

Conclusion: ASVP effectively safeguards image restoration models from unauthorized knowledge distillation, outperforming previous defenses while maintaining restoration quality.

Abstract: Knowledge distillation (KD) attacks pose a significant threat to deep model
intellectual property by enabling adversaries to train student networks using a
teacher model's outputs. While recent defenses in image classification have
successfully disrupted KD by perturbing output probabilities, extending these
methods to image restoration is difficult. Unlike classification, restoration
is a generative task with continuous, high-dimensional outputs that depend on
spatial coherence and fine details. Minor perturbations are often insufficient,
as students can still learn the underlying mapping.To address this, we propose
Adaptive Singular Value Perturbation (ASVP), a runtime defense tailored for
image restoration models. ASVP operates on internal feature maps of the teacher
using singular value decomposition (SVD). It amplifies the topk singular values
to inject structured, high-frequency perturbations, disrupting the alignment
needed for distillation. This hinders student learning while preserving the
teacher's output quality.We evaluate ASVP across five image restoration tasks:
super-resolution, low-light enhancement, underwater enhancement, dehazing, and
deraining. Experiments show ASVP reduces student PSNR by up to 4 dB and SSIM by
60-75%, with negligible impact on the teacher's performance. Compared to prior
methods, ASVP offers a stronger and more consistent defense.Our approach
provides a practical solution to protect open-source restoration models from
unauthorized knowledge distillation.

*Zixi Yang,Jiapeng Li,Muxi Diao,Yinuo Jing,Kongming Liang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Ro-Bench, a benchmark for testing the robustness of multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) against manipulated video content. It finds that MLLMs suffer significant performance drops under such conditions, but robustness can be improved through fine-tuning with counterfactual data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the gap in understanding the robustness of multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) when dealing with manipulated video content.

Method: The authors designed Ro-Bench, a benchmark comprising dynamic out-of-distribution counterfactual video test sets with variations in style, object, background, and their compositions. Eight MLLMs were evaluated for their performance on this benchmark, and experiments were conducted to fine-tune the models using counterfactual data.

Result: Current MLLMs showed substantial performance degradation on Ro-Bench when exposed to manipulated videos. Fine-tuning with counterfactual data improved robustness, leading to a 21.73% performance gain on Ro-Bench and a 12.78% improvement on MVBench across 20 tasks.

Conclusion: Counterfactual data can significantly enhance the robustness and video understanding capabilities of MLLMs, as evidenced by substantial improvements in benchmark scores after fine-tuning.

Abstract: Recently, Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated
significant performance across various video understanding tasks. However,
their robustness, particularly when faced with manipulated video content,
remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we introduce Ro-Bench, the first
benchmark for evaluating MLLMs on dynamic out-of-distribution (OOD)
counterfactual video test sets. Ro-Bench incorporates high-quality, diverse and
temporally relevant video data, by editing Style, Object, Background and their
compositions. We evaluated eight recent video MLLMs and found that current
models exhibit substantial performance degradation on Ro-Bench when exposed to
counterfactual video content. Furthermore, we demonstrate that fine-tuning
MLLMs with counterfactual data enhances robustness, achieving a 21.73%
performance increase on Ro-Bench and a 12.78% improvement across 20 tasks in
the MVBench dataset. These findings underscore the effectiveness of
counterfactual data in enhancing the video understanding ability of MLLMs. The
code and data will be released shortly.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper focuses on a data augmentation framework for drone-based animal health monitoring, addressing data scarcity issues in specific farm conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The researchers aimed to solve the problem of limited data availability in drone-based animal health monitoring, especially given unique farm-specific challenges like different breeds, environments, and animal visibility issues.

Method: An object-focused data augmentation framework that segments animals from their environments and uses transformations and diffusion-based synthesis to create diverse, realistic training data.

Result: Experiments demonstrated that their augmented datasets led to better performance in animal detection tasks compared to baseline models.

Conclusion: The proposed data augmentation framework effectively bridges the gap between limited domain-specific data and real-world applications, enabling better animal health monitoring in constrained scenarios.

Abstract: Modern agricultural operations increasingly rely on integrated monitoring
systems that combine multiple data sources for farm optimization. Aerial
drone-based animal health monitoring serves as a key component but faces
limited data availability, compounded by scene-specific issues such as small,
occluded, or partially visible animals. Transfer learning approaches often fail
to address this limitation due to the unavailability of large datasets that
reflect specific farm conditions, including variations in animal breeds,
environments, and behaviors. Therefore, there is a need for developing a
problem-specific, animal-focused data augmentation strategy tailored to these
unique challenges. To address this gap, we propose an object-focused data
augmentation framework designed explicitly for animal health monitoring in
constrained data settings. Our approach segments animals from backgrounds and
augments them through transformations and diffusion-based synthesis to create
realistic, diverse scenes that enhance animal detection and monitoring
performance. Our initial experiments demonstrate that our augmented dataset
yields superior performance compared to our baseline models on the animal
detection task. By generating domain-specific data, our method empowers
real-time animal health monitoring solutions even in data-scarce scenarios,
bridging the gap between limited data and practical applicability.

*Yifan Li,Zhenghao Chen,Ziheng Wu,Kun Zhou,Ruipu Luo,Can Zhang,Zhentao He,Yufei Zhan,Wayne Xin Zhao,Minghui Qiu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Perception-Time Scaling (PTS) to improve the visual estimation capacities of Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs), significantly boosting precision from 8.0% to 64.7% through synthetic data and reinforcement learning techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Although inference-time scaling has enhanced reasoning in LVLMs, its impact on visual perception remains unclear, creating a need to explore this gap.

Method: The authors propose Perception-Time Scaling (PTS), which includes token-rich perception, decomposition of complex tasks into sub-problems, and reinforcement learning. They also introduce the DisTANCE benchmark to assess LVLM performance in perception.

Result: PTS improves high-precision performance on the DisTANCE benchmark from 8.0% to 64.7% and generalizes well to both out-of-domain and real-world tasks.

Conclusion: Integrating PTS with synthetic data and reinforcement learning not only enhances perception precision but also improves other reasoning capabilities in LVLMs, demonstrating scalable benefits.

Abstract: Recent advances in inference-time scaling, particularly those leveraging
reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards, have substantially enhanced the
reasoning capabilities of Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs). Inspired by
this success, similar strategies have been applied to multimodal reasoning, yet
their impact on visual perception remains unclear. To investigate this gap, we
introduce DisTANCE, a perception-centric benchmark for visual estimation tasks.
Evaluation results show that LVLMs exhibit limited estimation precision, and
inference-time scaling offers only marginal gains. We attribute this to the
fast perception paradigm of current LVLMs, where visual understanding is
treated as a one-shot output without modeling the underlying perceptual
process. To address this, we propose Perception-Time Scaling (PTS), a novel
paradigm that encourages token-rich perception and decomposes complex
perception problems into intermediate tractable sub-problems, thereby enabling
perception to align with and benefit from inference-time scaling. Combined with
reinforcement learning techniques, PTS significantly improves perception
accuracy, raising high-precision performance on DisTANCE from 8.0% to 64.7%,
and generalizes well to out-of-domain tasks. Surprisingly, even though PTS data
are purely synthetic, combining them with math reasoning data yields consistent
gains in both reasoning and real-world perception benchmarks. Further analysis
reveals that PTS introduces more perception-related tokens and increases the
model's attention to image tokens. Our code and data will be publicly released.

*Zhenyu Wang,Mahathir Monjur,Shahriar Nirjon*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper presents mmJoints, a framework to enhance mmWave-based pose estimation by introducing descriptors for joint likelihood and reliability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address limitations of mmWave pose estimation where models rely too heavily on statistical priors instead of sensor data.

Method: Develop a framework (mmJoints) that augments existing mmWave-based pose estimators' outputs with new joint descriptors regarding likelihood and location reliability.

Result: mmJoints estimates descriptors with below 4.2% error rate, improves joint position accuracy by up to 12.5%, and boosts activity recognition by up to 16%.

Conclusion: mmJoints enhances interpretability and downstream task performance, compared to state-of-the-art systems in mmWave signals-based pose estimation.

Abstract: In mmWave-based pose estimation, sparse signals and weak reflections often
cause models to infer body joints from statistical priors rather than sensor
data. While prior knowledge helps in learning meaningful representations,
over-reliance on it degrades performance in downstream tasks like gesture and
activity recognition. In this paper, we introduce mmJoints, a framework that
augments a pre-trained, black-box mmWave-based 3D pose estimator's output with
additional joint descriptors. Rather than mitigating bias, mmJoints makes it
explicit by estimating the likelihood of a joint being sensed and the
reliability of its predicted location. These descriptors enhance
interpretability and improve downstream task accuracy. Through extensive
evaluations using over 115,000 signal frames across 13 pose estimation
settings, we show that mmJoints estimates descriptors with an error rate below
4.2%. mmJoints also improves joint position accuracy by up to 12.5% and boosts
activity recognition by up to 16% over state-of-the-art methods.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Hamba, a graph-guided framework for 3D hand reconstruction from a single RGB image, improving accuracy and robustness with reduced computational tokens.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current state-of-the-art techniques for 3D hand reconstruction struggle with accuracy due to inefficiencies in modeling spatial relationships between joints.

Method: Proposed the Hamba framework with a Graph-guided State Space (GSS) block to learn graph-structured spatial relations between joints using fewer tokens. The design includes a fusion module for integrating local and global features.

Result: Hamba achieved state-of-the-art performance metrics with a PA-MPVPE of 5.3mm and F@15mm of 0.992 on the FreiHAND benchmark, outperforming previous methods.

Conclusion: Hamba provides a significant advancement in 3D hand reconstruction with efficient modeling of spatial relationships, fewer computational tokens, and superior benchmark performance, securing Rank 1 in multiple leaderboards at the time of acceptance.

Abstract: 3D Hand reconstruction from a single RGB image is challenging due to the
articulated motion, self-occlusion, and interaction with objects. Existing SOTA
methods employ attention-based transformers to learn the 3D hand pose and
shape, yet they do not fully achieve robust and accurate performance, primarily
due to inefficiently modeling spatial relations between joints. To address this
problem, we propose a novel graph-guided Mamba framework, named Hamba, which
bridges graph learning and state space modeling. Our core idea is to
reformulate Mamba's scanning into graph-guided bidirectional scanning for 3D
reconstruction using a few effective tokens. This enables us to efficiently
learn the spatial relationships between joints for improving reconstruction
performance. Specifically, we design a Graph-guided State Space (GSS) block
that learns the graph-structured relations and spatial sequences of joints and
uses 88.5% fewer tokens than attention-based methods. Additionally, we
integrate the state space features and the global features using a fusion
module. By utilizing the GSS block and the fusion module, Hamba effectively
leverages the graph-guided state space features and jointly considers global
and local features to improve performance. Experiments on several benchmarks
and in-the-wild tests demonstrate that Hamba significantly outperforms existing
SOTAs, achieving the PA-MPVPE of 5.3mm and F@15mm of 0.992 on FreiHAND. At the
time of this paper's acceptance, Hamba holds the top position, Rank 1 in two
Competition Leaderboards on 3D hand reconstruction. Project Website:

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper addresses the issue of poor quality in generated human hand regions from text-to-image (T2I) models by introducing a quality assessment model, HandEval, supported by a novel HandPair dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current T2I models fail at generating realistic details for human hands, causing structural distortions and limiting applications.

Method: The authors created the HandPair dataset consisting of paired high- and low-quality hand images and developed HandEval, a quality assessment model leveraging Multimodal LLMs and hand keypoint knowledge.

Result: HandEval demonstrates better alignment with human judgments compared to SOTA methods, and it improves both hand realism in image generation pipelines and detection accuracy in AIGC applications.

Conclusion: HandEval is effective for assessing generated hand quality, enabling its integration into various downstream tasks, enhancing T2I model outputs and detection systems.

Abstract: Although recent text-to-image (T2I) models have significantly improved the
overall visual quality of generated images, they still struggle in the
generation of accurate details in complex local regions, especially human
hands. Generated hands often exhibit structural distortions and unrealistic
textures, which can be very noticeable even when the rest of the body is
well-generated. However, the quality assessment of hand regions remains largely
neglected, limiting downstream task performance like human-centric generation
quality optimization and AIGC detection. To address this, we propose the first
quality assessment task targeting generated hand regions and showcase its
abundant downstream applications. We first introduce the HandPair dataset for
training hand quality assessment models. It consists of 48k images formed by
high- and low-quality hand pairs, enabling low-cost, efficient supervision
without manual annotation. Based on it, we develop HandEval, a carefully
designed hand-specific quality assessment model. It leverages the powerful
visual understanding capability of Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) and
incorporates prior knowledge of hand keypoints, gaining strong perception of
hand quality. We further construct a human-annotated test set with hand images
from various state-of-the-art (SOTA) T2I models to validate its quality
evaluation capability. Results show that HandEval aligns better with human
judgments than existing SOTA methods. Furthermore, we integrate HandEval into
image generation and AIGC detection pipelines, prominently enhancing generated
hand realism and detection accuracy, respectively, confirming its universal
effectiveness in downstream applications. Code and dataset will be available.

TL;DR: The paper presents "Uncolorable Examples," a method inserting imperceptible perturbations into grayscale images to block unauthorized AI-based colorization, ensuring protection against copyright misuse.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address risks of copyright infringement stemming from unauthorized AI-based colorization of grayscale visual content, such as monochrome manga or films.

Method: The proposed method, PAChroma, incorporates imperceptible perturbations optimized using a Laplacian filter to preserve perceptual quality. It utilizes diverse input transformations during the optimization process to ensure transferability across AI models and robustness against post-processing attacks.

Result: PAChroma successfully degrades the quality of AI colorization while maintaining the grayscale image's visual appearance, as demonstrated on datasets like ImageNet and Danbooru.

Conclusion: The study introduces a novel defensive paradigm against unauthorized AI-based colorization, offering a solution that meets real-world criteria and safeguards copyright concerns, marking a significant step in generative media protections.

Abstract: AI-based colorization has shown remarkable capability in generating realistic
color images from grayscale inputs. However, it poses risks of copyright
infringement -- for example, the unauthorized colorization and resale of
monochrome manga and films. Despite these concerns, no effective method
currently exists to prevent such misuse. To address this, we introduce the
first defensive paradigm, Uncolorable Examples, which embed imperceptible
perturbations into grayscale images to invalidate unauthorized colorization. To
ensure real-world applicability, we establish four criteria: effectiveness,
imperceptibility, transferability, and robustness. Our method, Perception-Aware
Chroma-Restrictive Perturbation (PAChroma), generates Uncolorable Examples that
meet these four criteria by optimizing imperceptible perturbations with a
Laplacian filter to preserve perceptual quality, and applying diverse input
transformations during optimization to enhance transferability across models
and robustness against common post-processing (e.g., compression). Experiments
on ImageNet and Danbooru datasets demonstrate that PAChroma effectively
degrades colorization quality while maintaining the visual appearance. This
work marks the first step toward protecting visual content from illegitimate AI
colorization, paving the way for copyright-aware defenses in generative media.

*Yao Teng,Fuyun Wang,Xian Liu,Zhekai Chen,Han Shi,Yu Wang,Zhenguo Li,Weiyang Liu,Difan Zou,Xihui Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper presents Speculative Jacobi-Denoising Decoding (SJD2), a method to speed up autoregressive text-to-image models by enabling parallel token generation during inference, reducing the number of forward passes while maintaining image quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Autoregressive text-to-image models face inefficiencies due to the sequential nature of their token-by-token generation process, requiring thousands of forward passes for a single image.

Method: The authors propose SJD2, a framework merging denoising and Jacobi iterations. The technique predicts next-clean-tokens via low-cost fine-tuning of pre-trained models, allowing for parallel token generation. Token sequences are initialized with Gaussian noise, and multiple tokens are verified and refined iteratively.

Result: The proposed method demonstrated accelerated image generation by reducing the required model forward passes without compromising the visual quality of the generated images.

Conclusion: SJD2 successfully addresses inference inefficiencies in autoregressive text-to-image models, offering faster image generation with quality preservation.

Abstract: As a new paradigm of visual content generation, autoregressive text-to-image
models suffer from slow inference due to their sequential token-by-token
decoding process, often requiring thousands of model forward passes to generate
a single image. To address this inefficiency, we propose Speculative
Jacobi-Denoising Decoding (SJD2), a framework that incorporates the denoising
process into Jacobi iterations to enable parallel token generation in
autoregressive models. Our method introduces a next-clean-token prediction
paradigm that enables the pre-trained autoregressive models to accept
noise-perturbed token embeddings and predict the next clean tokens through
low-cost fine-tuning. This denoising paradigm guides the model towards more
stable Jacobi trajectories. During inference, our method initializes token
sequences with Gaussian noise and performs iterative
next-clean-token-prediction in the embedding space. We employ a probabilistic
criterion to verify and accept multiple tokens in parallel, and refine the
unaccepted tokens for the next iteration with the denoising trajectory.
Experiments show that our method can accelerate generation by reducing model
forward passes while maintaining the visual quality of generated images.

### [187] [On Epistemic Uncertainty of Visual Tokens for Object Hallucinations in Large Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09008)
*Hoigi Seo,Dong Un Kang,Hyunjin Cho,Joohoon Lee,Se Young Chun*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper addresses object hallucination in Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs), linking it to uncertain visual tokens in the vision encoder, and proposes a method to identify and mitigate these uncertainties to reduce hallucinations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to tackle the issue of object hallucination in LVLMs, where the model generates descriptions of objects not present in the input image. This problem is attributed to uncertain visual tokens in the vision encoder.

Method: The proposed method uses a proxy approach with adversarial perturbations to efficiently identify uncertain visual tokens and subsequently masks these tokens during the self-attention process in the middle layers of the vision encoder to reduce their impact.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate the proposed method significantly reduces object hallucinations in LVLMs, and it complements other existing techniques.

Conclusion: The study provides a novel and effective strategy to address object hallucination in LVLMs by focusing on uncertain visual tokens in the vision encoder, offering both theoretical and practical improvements.

Abstract: Large vision-language models (LVLMs), which integrate a vision encoder (VE)
with a large language model, have achieved remarkable success across various
tasks. However, there are still crucial challenges in LVLMs such as object
hallucination, generating descriptions of objects that are not in the input
image. Here, we argue that uncertain visual tokens within the VE is a key
factor that contributes to object hallucination. Our statistical analysis found
that there are positive correlations between visual tokens with high epistemic
uncertainty and the occurrence of hallucinations. Furthermore, we show
theoretically and empirically that visual tokens in early VE layers that
exhibit large representation deviations under small adversarial perturbations
indicate high epistemic uncertainty. Based on these findings, we propose a
simple yet effective strategy to mitigate object hallucination by modifying the
VE only. Our method comprises a proxy method with adversarial perturbations for
identifying uncertain visual tokens efficiently and a method to mask these
uncertain visual tokens during the self-attention process in the middle layers
of the VE, suppressing their influence on visual encoding and thus alleviating
hallucinations. Extensive experiments show that our method significantly
reduces object hallucinations in LVLMs and can synergistically work with other
prior arts.

### [188] [Exploring Single Domain Generalization of LiDAR-based Semantic Segmentation under Imperfect Labels](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09035)
*Weitong Kong,Zichao Zeng,Di Wen,Jiale Wei,Kunyu Peng,June Moh Goo,Jan Boehm,Rainer Stiefelhagen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper focuses on domain generalization for LiDAR-based 3D semantic segmentation under noisy label conditions, introducing a novel task (DGLSS-NL), proposing an approach (DuNe), and demonstrating its strong performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the lack of robust generalization methods for LiDAR-based 3D semantic segmentation under noisy label conditions, which are critical due to annotation imperfections and domain shifts.

Method: Introduce DuNe, a dual-view framework with strong and weak branches, enforcing feature-level consistency and employing cross-entropy loss filtered by confidence-aware predictions.

Result: Achieved state-of-the-art performance with notable mIoU scores on datasets like SemanticKITTI (56.86%), nuScenes (42.28%), and SemanticPOSS (52.58%) under 10% label noise.

Conclusion: The proposed DuNe framework effectively addresses noisy-label domain generalization challenges in LiDAR segmentation, improving performance and system reliability.

Abstract: Accurate perception is critical for vehicle safety, with LiDAR as a key
enabler in autonomous driving. To ensure robust performance across
environments, sensor types, and weather conditions without costly
re-annotation, domain generalization in LiDAR-based 3D semantic segmentation is
essential. However, LiDAR annotations are often noisy due to sensor
imperfections, occlusions, and human errors. Such noise degrades segmentation
accuracy and is further amplified under domain shifts, threatening system
reliability. While noisy-label learning is well-studied in images, its
extension to 3D LiDAR segmentation under domain generalization remains largely
unexplored, as the sparse and irregular structure of point clouds limits direct
use of 2D methods. To address this gap, we introduce the novel task Domain
Generalization for LiDAR Semantic Segmentation under Noisy Labels (DGLSS-NL)
and establish the first benchmark by adapting three representative noisy-label
learning strategies from image classification to 3D segmentation. However, we
find that existing noisy-label learning approaches adapt poorly to LiDAR data.
We therefore propose DuNe, a dual-view framework with strong and weak branches
that enforce feature-level consistency and apply cross-entropy loss based on
confidence-aware filtering of predictions. Our approach shows state-of-the-art
performance by achieving 56.86% mIoU on SemanticKITTI, 42.28% on nuScenes, and
52.58% on SemanticPOSS under 10% symmetric label noise, with an overall
Arithmetic Mean (AM) of 49.57% and Harmonic Mean (HM) of 48.50%, thereby
demonstrating robust domain generalization in DGLSS-NL tasks. The code is
available on our project page.

*Xiaoxiao Ma,Feng Zhao,Pengyang Ling,Haibo Qiu,Zhixiang Wei,Hu Yu,Jie Huang,Zhixiong Zeng,Lin Ma*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper addresses sampling issues in autoregressive image generation by introducing an entropy-informed decoding strategy, improving generation quality and synthesis speed.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current autoregressive models face challenges due to low information density and uneven spatial token distribution in images, unlike text tokens.

Method: The paper proposes dynamic temperature control based on spatial token entropy and entropy-aware acceptance rules in speculative decoding to optimize generation quality and speed.

Result: Experiments show improved image generation quality and 85% faster synthesis compared to traditional methods, maintaining near-lossless generation.

Conclusion: The proposed approach effectively addresses sampling problems, demonstrating enhanced image generation quality and efficiency across multiple benchmarks.

Abstract: In this work, we first revisit the sampling issues in current autoregressive
(AR) image generation models and identify that image tokens, unlike text
tokens, exhibit lower information density and non-uniform spatial distribution.
Accordingly, we present an entropy-informed decoding strategy that facilitates
higher autoregressive generation quality with faster synthesis speed.
Specifically, the proposed method introduces two main innovations: 1) dynamic
temperature control guided by spatial entropy of token distributions, enhancing
the balance between content diversity, alignment accuracy, and structural
coherence in both mask-based and scale-wise models, without extra computational
overhead, and 2) entropy-aware acceptance rules in speculative decoding,
achieving near-lossless generation at about 85\% of the inference cost of
conventional acceleration methods. Extensive experiments across multiple
benchmarks using diverse AR image generation models demonstrate the
effectiveness and generalizability of our approach in enhancing both generation
quality and sampling speed.

*Yitong Chen,Xinyao Xu,Ping Zhu,Xinyong Han,Fangbo Qin,Shan Yu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes an image-based anomaly detection framework for monitoring flexible microelectrode (FME) implantation in brain cortex using robotic systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Ensuring reliability and safety during the delicate FME implantation process, which involves interaction with critical brain tissue.

Method: Anomaly detection framework using microscopic cameras with pretrained Vision Transformer (ViT) models, progressive granularity feature sampling, and feature channel selection.

Result: The methods were validated on datasets collected from the authors' implantation system, demonstrating effectiveness.

Conclusion: The framework improves monitoring precision for FME implantation, addressing safety and reliability concerns in a critical neuro-surgical process.

Abstract: Flexible microelectrode (FME) implantation into brain cortex is challenging
due to the deformable fiber-like structure of FME probe and the interaction
with critical bio-tissue. To ensure reliability and safety, the implantation
process should be monitored carefully. This paper develops an image-based
anomaly detection framework based on the microscopic cameras of the robotic FME
implantation system. The unified framework is utilized at four checkpoints to
check the micro-needle, FME probe, hooking result, and implantation point,
respectively. Exploiting the existing object localization results, the aligned
regions of interest (ROIs) are extracted from raw image and input to a
pretrained vision transformer (ViT). Considering the task specifications, we
propose a progressive granularity patch feature sampling method to address the
sensitivity-tolerance trade-off issue at different locations. Moreover, we
select a part of feature channels with higher signal-to-noise ratios from the
raw general ViT features, to provide better descriptors for each specific
scene. The effectiveness of the proposed methods is validated with the image
datasets collected from our implantation system.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces a new post-training framework for latent diffusion models (LDMs) to enhance medical image-to-image translation by improving lesion reconstruction and overall image quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the trade-off in latent diffusion models, which lose pixel-level details critical for medical imaging, particularly for small but clinically significant structures like lesions.

Method: The authors propose a post-training framework for LDMs, incorporating lesion-aware pixel space objectives tailored to improve lesion delineation and image quality.

Result: The framework demonstrated improved synthesis of DWI and ADC images from CT scans in acute ischemic stroke diagnosis using data from 817 patients, outperforming existing translation models.

Conclusion: The introduced framework enhances medical image fidelity and lesion reconstruction in LDMs, and it is adaptable for various medical image tasks, offering significant clinical and operational benefits.

Abstract: Image-to-Image translation models can help mitigate various challenges
inherent to medical image acquisition. Latent diffusion models (LDMs) leverage
efficient learning in compressed latent space and constitute the core of
state-of-the-art generative image models. However, this efficiency comes with a
trade-off, potentially compromising crucial pixel-level detail essential for
high-fidelity medical images. This limitation becomes particularly critical
when generating clinically significant structures, such as lesions, which often
occupy only a small portion of the image. Failure to accurately reconstruct
these regions can severely impact diagnostic reliability and clinical
decision-making. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel post-training
framework for LDMs in medical image-to-image translation by incorporating
lesion-aware medical pixel space objectives. This approach is essential, as it
not only enhances overall image quality but also improves the precision of
lesion delineation. We evaluate our framework on brain CT-to-MRI translation in
acute ischemic stroke patients, where early and accurate diagnosis is critical
for optimal treatment selection and improved patient outcomes. While diffusion
MRI is the gold standard for stroke diagnosis, its clinical utility is often
constrained by high costs and low accessibility. Using a dataset of 817
patients, we demonstrate that our framework improves overall image quality and
enhances lesion delineation when synthesizing DWI and ADC images from CT
perfusion scans, outperforming existing image-to-image translation models.
Furthermore, our post-training strategy is easily adaptable to pre-trained LDMs
and exhibits substantial potential for broader applications across diverse
medical image translation tasks.

### [192] [Improving the Performance of Unimodal Dynamic Hand-Gesture Recognition with Multimodal Training](https://arxiv.org/abs/1812.06145)
*Mahdi Abavisani,Hamid Reza Vaezi Joze,Vishal M. Patel*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces a unique way to improve unimodal 3D-CNNs for dynamic hand gesture recognition by embedding multimodal knowledge, rather than combining data explicitly.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance the performance of unimodal 3D convolutional neural networks for recognizing dynamic hand gestures using insights from multimodal data.

Method: The authors propose using multiple separate networks for each modality, embedding common semantics and better representations by employing a 'spatiotemporal semantic alignment' (SSA) loss alongside a focal regularization parameter to mitigate negative knowledge transfer.

Result: The approach improved test-time recognition accuracy of unimodal networks and achieved state-of-the-art results on various dynamic hand gesture datasets.

Conclusion: Embedding multimodal knowledge into individual unimodal networks through collaboration yields enhanced performance and advances the capabilities of dynamic hand gesture recognition systems.

Abstract: We present an efficient approach for leveraging the knowledge from multiple
modalities in training unimodal 3D convolutional neural networks (3D-CNNs) for
the task of dynamic hand gesture recognition. Instead of explicitly combining
multimodal information, which is commonplace in many state-of-the-art methods,
we propose a different framework in which we embed the knowledge of multiple
modalities in individual networks so that each unimodal network can achieve an
improved performance. In particular, we dedicate separate networks per
available modality and enforce them to collaborate and learn to develop
networks with common semantics and better representations. We introduce a
"spatiotemporal semantic alignment" loss (SSA) to align the content of the
features from different networks. In addition, we regularize this loss with our
proposed "focal regularization parameter" to avoid negative knowledge transfer.
Experimental results show that our framework improves the test time recognition
accuracy of unimodal networks, and provides the state-of-the-art performance on
various dynamic hand gesture recognition datasets.

TL;DR: The paper introduces SilvaScenes, a dataset aimed at improving tree detection and species classification in under-canopy forest environments, highlighting the need for robust perception systems in forestry robotics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of existing datasets for tree perception in forest environments and improve automation and monitoring tasks in forestry.

Method: The authors developed SilvaScenes, a tree species instance segmentation dataset gathered across five bioclimatic regions with detailed annotations by experts, and benchmarked deep learning methods on the dataset.

Result: Tree segmentation achieved a high mean average precision (mAP) of 67.65%, whereas species classification remains challenging with a mAP of 35.69%.

Conclusion: SilvaScenes provides a valuable, challenging benchmark for advancing machine perception capabilities in forestry, targeting underexplored and complex forest environments.

Abstract: Interest in robotics for forest management is growing, but perception in
complex, natural environments remains a significant hurdle. Conditions such as
heavy occlusion, variable lighting, and dense vegetation pose challenges to
automated systems, which are essential for precision forestry, biodiversity
monitoring, and the automation of forestry equipment. These tasks rely on
advanced perceptual capabilities, such as detection and fine-grained species
classification of individual trees. Yet, existing datasets are inadequate to
develop such perception systems, as they often focus on urban settings or a
limited number of species. To address this, we present SilvaScenes, a new
dataset for instance segmentation of tree species from under-canopy images.
Collected across five bioclimatic domains in Quebec, Canada, SilvaScenes
features 1476 trees from 24 species with annotations from forestry experts. We
demonstrate the relevance and challenging nature of our dataset by benchmarking
modern deep learning approaches for instance segmentation. Our results show
that, while tree segmentation is easy, with a top mean average precision (mAP)
of 67.65%, species classification remains a significant challenge with an mAP
of only 35.69%. Our dataset and source code will be available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to improve the robustness and accuracy of SRC methods for classification tasks by incorporating transductive learning and deep features.

Method: The method combines a convolutional autoencoder for extracting deep features with a fully-connected layer for finding sparse representations. Sparse codes are then utilized for classification.

Result: Experiments conducted on three datasets demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms existing state-of-the-art SRC techniques in classification accuracy.

Conclusion: The proposed network, integrating deep feature learning and sparse representation, shows superior performance in classification, emphasizing its potential as a state-of-the-art alternative for SRC methods.

Abstract: We present a transductive deep learning-based formulation for the sparse
representation-based classification (SRC) method. The proposed network consists
of a convolutional autoencoder along with a fully-connected layer. The role of
the autoencoder network is to learn robust deep features for classification. On
the other hand, the fully-connected layer, which is placed in between the
encoder and the decoder networks, is responsible for finding the sparse
representation. The estimated sparse codes are then used for classification.
Various experiments on three different datasets show that the proposed network
leads to sparse representations that give better classification results than
state-of-the-art SRC methods. The source code is available at:

TL;DR: The paper introduces MambaH-Fit, a state space modelling framework for precise point cloud normal estimation, improving upon limitations in fine-grained geometric structure modelling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for point cloud normal estimation inadequately model fine-grained geometric details, reducing accuracy. Inspired by state space models' ability to model long-range dependencies, this work aims to address these limitations.

Method: The authors propose an Attention-driven Hierarchical Feature Fusion (AHFF) to fuse multi-scale patch features and a Patch-wise State Space Model (PSSM) to model point cloud patches as hyper-surfaces, enhancing fine-grained geometric understanding.

Result: Experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate the method's superior accuracy, robustness, and flexibility over existing approaches. Ablation studies confirm the effectiveness of the proposed components.

Conclusion: MambaH-Fit successfully improves the accuracy of point cloud normal estimation by integrating advanced modelling techniques like AHFF and PSSM, fostering better local geometric understanding.

Abstract: We present MambaH-Fit, a state space modelling framework tailored for
hyper-surface fitting-based point cloud normal estimation. Existing normal
estimation methods often fall short in modelling fine-grained geometric
structures, thereby limiting the accuracy of the predicted normals. Recently,
state space models (SSMs), particularly Mamba, have demonstrated strong
modelling capability by capturing long-range dependencies with linear
complexity and inspired adaptations to point cloud processing. However,
existing Mamba-based approaches primarily focus on understanding global shape
structures, leaving the modelling of local, fine-grained geometric details
largely under-explored. To address the issues above, we first introduce an
Attention-driven Hierarchical Feature Fusion (AHFF) scheme to adaptively fuse
multi-scale point cloud patch features, significantly enhancing geometric
context learning in local point cloud neighbourhoods. Building upon this, we
further propose Patch-wise State Space Model (PSSM) that models point cloud
patches as implicit hyper-surfaces via state dynamics, enabling effective
fine-grained geometric understanding for normal prediction. Extensive
experiments on benchmark datasets show that our method outperforms existing
ones in terms of accuracy, robustness, and flexibility. Ablation studies
further validate the contribution of the proposed components.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper seeks to evaluate the extent to which contemporary MLLMs understand the physical tools that are essential for human intelligence and interaction in the physical world.

Method: PhysToolBench benchmark includes over 1,000 image-text pairs to test MLLMs across three levels: tool recognition, tool understanding, and tool creation.

Result: An evaluation on 32 different MLLMs showcased notable deficiencies in their ability to comprehend and reason about physical tools.

Conclusion: MLLMs struggle with tool-related comprehension, and the PhysToolBench dataset initiates efforts to address this gap while offering public access to their code and data for further research.

Abstract: The ability to use, understand, and create tools is a hallmark of human
intelligence, enabling sophisticated interaction with the physical world. For
any general-purpose intelligent agent to achieve true versatility, it must also
master these fundamental skills. While modern Multimodal Large Language Models
(MLLMs) leverage their extensive common knowledge for high-level planning in
embodied AI and in downstream Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models, the extent
of their true understanding of physical tools remains unquantified. To bridge
this gap, we present PhysToolBench, the first benchmark dedicated to evaluating
the comprehension of physical tools by MLLMs. Our benchmark is structured as a
Visual Question Answering (VQA) dataset comprising over 1,000 image-text pairs.
It assesses capabilities across three distinct difficulty levels: (1) Tool
Recognition: Requiring the recognition of a tool's primary function. (2) Tool
Understanding: Testing the ability to grasp the underlying principles of a
tool's operation. (3) Tool Creation: Challenging the model to fashion a new
tool from surrounding objects when conventional options are unavailable. Our
comprehensive evaluation of 32 MLLMs-spanning proprietary, open-source,
specialized embodied, and backbones in VLAs-reveals a significant deficiency in
tool understanding. Furthermore, we provide an in-depth analysis and propose
preliminary solutions. Code and dataset are publicly available.

Additionally, the JPTrack algorithm is designed to address ID switches and trajectory fragmentation.

Result: The experimental findings reveal that the presented approach enhances MOT continuity, stability, and real-time applicability, particularly for small-target detection.

Conclusion: The integration of GL-DT and JPTrack showcases advanced MOT capabilities, beneficial for UAV situational awareness and applications requiring stable and efficient tracking systems.

Abstract: The extensive application of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in military
reconnaissance, environmental monitoring, and related domains has created an
urgent need for accurate and efficient multi-object tracking (MOT)
technologies, which are also essential for UAV situational awareness. However,
complex backgrounds, small-scale targets, and frequent occlusions and

proposes the Global-Local Detection and Tracking (GL-DT) framework. It employs
a Spatio-Temporal Feature Fusion (STFF) module to jointly model motion and
appearance features, combined with a global-local collaborative detection
strategy, effectively enhancing small-target detection. Building upon this, the
JPTrack tracking algorithm is introduced to mitigate common issues such as ID
switches and trajectory fragmentation. Experimental results demonstrate that

MOT while maintaining real-time performance, providing strong support for the
advancement of UAV detection and tracking technologies.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The research aims to address the inefficiency caused by the large parameter size of Diffusion Transformers, particularly the inference overhead, while avoiding performance loss seen in aggressive pruning methods.

Method: The authors propose replacing Feed-Forward Networks in DiT blocks with MoE layers to reduce activated parameters by 62.5%, and introduce Mixture of Blocks (MoB) for selectively activating blocks. They implement a multi-step distillation pipeline with expert initialization, knowledge distillation, and group feature loss to ensure effective dense-to-MoE transformation.

Result: The proposed Dense2MoE method reduces activated parameters in Diffusion Transformers by 60%, retaining original performance. It outperforms traditional pruning-based approaches.

Conclusion: Dense2MoE establishes an efficient, structured sparsification method for Diffusion Transformers, maintaining model capacity and offering a new paradigm for text-to-image generation.

Abstract: Diffusion Transformer (DiT) has demonstrated remarkable performance in
text-to-image generation; however, its large parameter size results in
substantial inference overhead. Existing parameter compression methods
primarily focus on pruning, but aggressive pruning often leads to severe
performance degradation due to reduced model capacity. To address this
limitation, we pioneer the transformation of a dense DiT into a Mixture of
Experts (MoE) for structured sparsification, reducing the number of activated
parameters while preserving model capacity. Specifically, we replace the
Feed-Forward Networks (FFNs) in DiT Blocks with MoE layers, reducing the number
of activated parameters in the FFNs by 62.5\%. Furthermore, we propose the
Mixture of Blocks (MoB) to selectively activate DiT blocks, thereby further
enhancing sparsity. To ensure an effective dense-to-MoE conversion, we design a
multi-step distillation pipeline, incorporating Taylor metric-based expert
initialization, knowledge distillation with load balancing, and group feature
loss for MoB optimization. We transform large diffusion transformers (e.g.,
FLUX.1 [dev]) into an MoE structure, reducing activated parameters by 60\%
while maintaining original performance and surpassing pruning-based approaches
in extensive experiments. Overall, Dense2MoE establishes a new paradigm for
efficient text-to-image generation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces SOS, a synthetic data pipeline that enhances visual grouping tasks by outperforming models trained on larger real datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current solutions for visual grouping rely heavily on large annotated datasets, which are expensive and limited in scalability. Synthetic data offers an alternative but lacks flexibility and compositional diversity.

Method: SOS utilizes object-centric composition to create synthetic datasets. This involves pasting synthetic object segments into images using structured layout priors and generative relighting to produce diverse and accurate annotations.

Result: Models trained with 100,000 synthetic images generated by SOS surpass those trained on larger real-image datasets, achieving higher performance in detection and grounding tasks. Additionally, SOS enables targeted dataset augmentation and improved performance under low-data scenarios.

Conclusion: SOS demonstrates the potential of synthetic data for controllable dataset construction, improving accuracy and generalization in visual grouping tasks, especially in scenarios with limited real data.

Abstract: Visual grouping -- operationalized via instance segmentation, visual
grounding, and object detection -- underpins applications from robotic
perception to photo editing. Large annotated datasets are costly, biased in
coverage, and hard to scale. Synthetic data are promising but often lack
flexibility, accuracy, and compositional diversity.
  We present SOS, a simple and scalable data synthesis pipeline based on an
object-centric composition strategy. It pastes high-quality synthetic object
segments into new images using structured layout priors and generative
relighting, producing accurate and diverse masks, boxes, and referring
expressions. Models trained on 100000 synthetic images from SOS outperform
those trained on larger real-image datasets such as GRIT (20M) and V3Det (200K)
on detection and grounding tasks, achieving +10.9 AP on LVIS detection and +8.4
$N_{\text{Acc}}$ on gRefCOCO grounding. SOS enables controllable dataset
construction and improves generalization in both low-data and closed-vocabulary
settings. Augmenting LVIS and COCO with synthetic object segments yields strong
performance across real-data scales and even larger gains under extremely
limited real data (for example, +3.83 $AP_{\text{rare}}$ on LVIS instance
segmentation and +6.59 AP with a 1 percent COCO setup). This controllability
also supports targeted data generation for challenging intra-class referring in
visual grounding.

### [201] [MSDM: Generating Task-Specific Pathology Images with a Multimodal Conditioned Diffusion Model for Cell and Nuclei Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09121)
*Dominik Winter,Mai Bui,Monica Azqueta Gavaldon,Nicolas Triltsch,Marco Rosati,Nicolas Brieu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a Multimodal Semantic Diffusion Model (MSDM) to generate high-quality synthetic data for cell and nuclei segmentation, addressing the scarcity of annotated data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: A lack of sufficient annotated data, especially for rare cellular and nuclear morphologies, poses challenges for segmentation tasks in computational pathology.

Method: The proposed MSDM leverages a multimodal approach by conditioning the generative model on cellular/nuclear morphologies, RGB features, and metadata encoded via BERT. Multi-head cross-attention is used to integrate these modalities.

Result: The synthetic images generated showed low Wasserstein distances compared to real data under matching biological conditions, and their incorporation significantly improved segmentation accuracy for specific morphologies, such as columnar cells.

Conclusion: The multimodal diffusion-based augmentation enhances segmentation model robustness and generalizability, suggesting potential for broader applications of generative models in computational pathology.

Abstract: Scarcity of annotated data, particularly for rare or atypical morphologies,
present significant challenges for cell and nuclei segmentation in
computational pathology. While manual annotation is labor-intensive and costly,
synthetic data offers a cost-effective alternative. We introduce a Multimodal
Semantic Diffusion Model (MSDM) for generating realistic pixel-precise
image-mask pairs for cell and nuclei segmentation. By conditioning the
generative process with cellular/nuclear morphologies (using horizontal and
vertical maps), RGB color characteristics, and BERT-encoded assay/indication
metadata, MSDM generates datasests with desired morphological properties. These
heterogeneous modalities are integrated via multi-head cross-attention,
enabling fine-grained control over the generated images. Quantitative analysis
demonstrates that synthetic images closely match real data, with low
Wasserstein distances between embeddings of generated and real images under
matching biological conditions. The incorporation of these synthetic samples,
exemplified by columnar cells, significantly improves segmentation model
accuracy on columnar cells. This strategy systematically enriches data sets,
directly targeting model deficiencies. We highlight the effectiveness of
multimodal diffusion-based augmentation for advancing the robustness and
generalizability of cell and nuclei segmentation models. Thereby, we pave the
way for broader application of generative models in computational pathology.

### [202] [Polar Separable Transform for Efficient Orthogonal Rotation-Invariant Image Representation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09125)
*Satya P. Singh,Rashmi Chaudhry,Anand Srivastava,Jagath C. Rajapakse*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The authors introduce PSepT, a computationally efficient and numerically stable separable orthogonal transform for image representation, improving over traditional methods like Zernike moments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Classical orthogonal moment-based representations for images suffer from high computational demands and numerical instability at large orders, limiting their practical applications.

Method: PSepT employs a separable orthogonal transform using tensor-product construction of Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) radial bases and Fourier harmonic angular bases, overcoming non-separability issues in polar coordinates.

Result: PSepT achieves exponential computational improvements, reduces memory requirements, improves numerical stability, and delivers better classification performance on structured datasets.

Conclusion: PSepT enables high-order moment analysis previously infeasible with classical approaches, offering a robust solution for advanced image analysis tasks.

Abstract: Orthogonal moment-based image representations are fundamental in computer
vision, but classical methods suffer from high computational complexity and
numerical instability at large orders. Zernike and pseudo-Zernike moments, for
instance, require coupled radial-angular processing that precludes efficient
factorization, resulting in $\mathcal{O}(n^3N^2)$ to $\mathcal{O}(n^6N^2)$
complexity and $\mathcal{O}(N^4)$ condition number scaling for the $n$th-order
moments on an $N\times N$ image. We introduce \textbf{PSepT} (Polar Separable
Transform), a separable orthogonal transform that overcomes the
non-separability barrier in polar coordinates. PSepT achieves complete kernel
factorization via tensor-product construction of Discrete Cosine Transform
(DCT) radial bases and Fourier harmonic angular bases, enabling independent
radial and angular processing. This separable design reduces computational
complexity to $\mathcal{O}(N^2 \log N)$, memory requirements to
$\mathcal{O}(N^2)$, and condition number scaling to $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{N})$,
representing exponential improvements over polynomial approaches. PSepT
exhibits orthogonality, completeness, energy conservation, and
rotation-covariance properties. Experimental results demonstrate better
numerical stability, computational efficiency, and competitive classification
performance on structured datasets, while preserving exact reconstruction. The
separable framework enables high-order moment analysis previously infeasible
with classical methods, opening new possibilities for robust image analysis
applications.

### [203] [Training Feature Attribution for Vision Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09135)
*Aziz Bacha,Thomas George*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes training feature attribution, combining input and training data analysis to enhance explainability in deep neural networks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep neural networks are seen as complex and opaque systems, necessitating better explainability methods for trust and accountability.

Method: The paper introduces training feature attribution, linking test predictions to specific regions of training images to analyze harmful examples and spurious correlations.

Result: Experiments demonstrate fine-grained explanations that reveal misclassifications and hidden shortcuts, outperforming conventional attribution methods.

Conclusion: Training feature attribution provides improved insights into deep models, advancing explainability and transparency compared to prior techniques.

Abstract: Deep neural networks are often considered opaque systems, prompting the need
for explainability methods to improve trust and accountability. Existing
approaches typically attribute test-time predictions either to input features
(e.g., pixels in an image) or to influential training examples. We argue that
both perspectives should be studied jointly. This work explores *training
feature attribution*, which links test predictions to specific regions of
specific training images and thereby provides new insights into the inner
workings of deep models. Our experiments on vision datasets show that training
feature attribution yields fine-grained, test-specific explanations: it
identifies harmful examples that drive misclassifications and reveals spurious
correlations, such as patch-based shortcuts, that conventional attribution
methods fail to expose.

### [204] [Online Topological Localization for Navigation Assistance in Bronchoscopy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09144)
*Clara Tomasini,Luis Riazuelo,Ana C. Murillo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes an image-based pipeline for bronchoscopy navigation assistance that eliminates the need for patient-specific CT scans, focusing on topological localization rather than metric localization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Determining the precise location of a bronchoscope in the complex bronchial tree is challenging due to variations in anatomy and surgeon experience, and existing methods for navigation require costly setups and additional training.

Method: An image-based localization pipeline was developed, trained on phantom data instead of real patient data, to provide topological navigation assistance without relying on patient CT scans.

Result: The pipeline demonstrates strong generalization capabilities and surpasses existing methods, particularly in tests using real data sequences.

Conclusion: The approach offers a cost-effective and efficient alternative to existing bronchoscopy navigation techniques, which can improve procedural outcomes without requiring additional scans or setups.

Abstract: Video bronchoscopy is a fundamental procedure in respiratory medicine, where
medical experts navigate through the bronchial tree of a patient to diagnose or
operate the patient. Surgeons need to determine the position of the scope as
they go through the airway until they reach the area of interest. This task is
very challenging for practitioners due to the complex bronchial tree structure
and varying doctor experience and training. Navigation assistance to locate the
bronchoscope during the procedure can improve its outcome. Currently used
techniques for navigational guidance commonly rely on previous CT scans of the
patient to obtain a 3D model of the airway, followed by tracking of the scope
with additional sensors or image registration. These methods obtain accurate
locations but imply additional setup, scans and training. Accurate metric
localization is not always required, and a topological localization with regard
to a generic airway model can often suffice to assist the surgeon with
navigation. We present an image-based bronchoscopy topological localization
pipeline to provide navigation assistance during the procedure, with no need of
patient CT scan. Our approach is trained only on phantom data, eliminating the
high cost of real data labeling, and presents good generalization capabilities.
The results obtained surpass existing methods, particularly on real data test
sequences.

*Yankun Wu,Zakaria Laskar,Giorgos Kordopatis-Zilos,Noa Garcia,Giorgos Tolias*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a synthetic method to generate diverse object instances for Instance-Level Recognition (ILR), improving model performance without relying on real images.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenges posed by the creation of large-scale annotated datasets for ILR, which limits its practical applications.

Method: A synthetic data generation process to create large-scale datasets from multiple domains and conditions without real images, enabling fine-tuning of foundation vision models.

Result: The method improved retrieval performance across seven ILR benchmarks from multiple domains.

Conclusion: The approach provides an efficient alternative to traditional data collection methods, paving the way for broader ILR-based real-world applications with only domain names as input.

Abstract: Instance-level recognition (ILR) focuses on identifying individual objects
rather than broad categories, offering the highest granularity in image
classification. However, this fine-grained nature makes creating large-scale
annotated datasets challenging, limiting ILR's real-world applicability across
domains. To overcome this, we introduce a novel approach that synthetically
generates diverse object instances from multiple domains under varied
conditions and backgrounds, forming a large-scale training set. Unlike prior
work on automatic data synthesis, our method is the first to address
ILR-specific challenges without relying on any real images. Fine-tuning
foundation vision models on the generated data significantly improves retrieval
performance across seven ILR benchmarks spanning multiple domains. Our approach
offers a new, efficient, and effective alternative to extensive data collection
and curation, introducing a new ILR paradigm where the only input is the names
of the target domains, unlocking a wide range of real-world applications.

### [206] [TARO: Toward Semantically Rich Open-World Object Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09173)
*Yuchen Zhang,Yao Lu,Johannes Betz*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces TARO, a novel detection framework for categorizing unknown objects into meaningful hierarchical classes, enhancing decision-making in safety-critical tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current object detection systems assume a predefined set of classes, which limits their usability in real-world scenarios with unknown objects. Simply labeling unknown objects as 'Unknown' is inadequate, especially in safety-critical applications such as autonomous driving, where more descriptive categorization can improve decision-making.

Method: TARO uses a sparsemax-based head for objectness modeling, a hierarchy-guided relabeling mechanism for auxiliary supervision, and a classification module that learns hierarchical relationships to classify unknown objects into coarse parent categories.

Result: TARO achieves the ability to categorize up to 29.9% of unknown objects into meaningful categories, improves differentiation between known and unknown classes, and delivers competitive performance in both unknown recall and known mAP.

Conclusion: The proposed TARO framework addresses the limitation of traditional object detection by introducing hierarchical classification of unknown objects, offering a significant advantage in practical applications like safety-critical systems. Code will be made available for further research.

Abstract: Modern object detectors are largely confined to a "closed-world" assumption,
limiting them to a predefined set of classes and posing risks when encountering
novel objects in real-world scenarios. While open-set detection methods aim to
address this by identifying such instances as 'Unknown', this is often
insufficient. Rather than treating all unknowns as a single class, assigning
them more descriptive subcategories can enhance decision-making in
safety-critical contexts. For example, identifying an object as an 'Unknown
Animal' (requiring an urgent stop) versus 'Unknown Debris' (requiring a safe
lane change) is far more useful than just 'Unknown' in autonomous driving. To
bridge this gap, we introduce TARO, a novel detection framework that not only
identifies unknown objects but also classifies them into coarse parent
categories within a semantic hierarchy. TARO employs a unique architecture with
a sparsemax-based head for modeling objectness, a hierarchy-guided relabeling
component that provides auxiliary supervision, and a classification module that
learns hierarchical relationships. Experiments show TARO can categorize up to
29.9% of unknowns into meaningful coarse classes, significantly reduce
confusion between unknown and known classes, and achieve competitive
performance in both unknown recall and known mAP. Code will be made available.

*Johann-Friedrich Feiden,Tim K√ºchler,Denis Zavadski,Bogdan Savchynskyy,Carsten Rother*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces online VDA (oVDA), a depth estimation method from monocular video that works in real-time by leveraging techniques like latent feature caching and masked frame training. It surpasses competitors in accuracy and VRAM efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to enable real-time, online depth estimation from monocular videos for practical applications, avoiding the limitations of batch processing in existing systems like Video Depth Anything.

Method: The method uses innovations from Large Language Models, including caching latent features for faster inference and using masked frames during training to improve performance.

Result: oVDA achieves state-of-the-art results in both accuracy and resource efficiency, running at 42 FPS on NVIDIA A100 and 20 FPS on NVIDIA Jetson while consuming low VRAM.

Conclusion: oVDA is a highly efficient, deployable online video depth estimation method, emphasizing adaptability for edge devices with low power requirements.

Abstract: Depth estimation from monocular video has become a key component of many
real-world computer vision systems. Recently, Video Depth Anything (VDA) has
demonstrated strong performance on long video sequences. However, it relies on
batch-processing which prohibits its use in an online setting. In this work, we
overcome this limitation and introduce online VDA (oVDA). The key innovation is
to employ techniques from Large Language Models (LLMs), namely, caching latent
features during inference and masking frames at training. Our oVDA method
outperforms all competing online video depth estimation methods in both
accuracy and VRAM usage. Low VRAM usage is particularly important for
deployment on edge devices. We demonstrate that oVDA runs at 42 FPS on an
NVIDIA A100 and at 20 FPS on an NVIDIA Jetson edge device. We will release
both, code and compilation scripts, making oVDA easy to deploy on low-power
hardware.

*Sungwoo Kang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper evaluates seven deep learning approaches for cricket shot classification, finding discrepancies between prior claims and actual implementation results. A modern EfficientNet-GRU model achieves 92.25% accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address the lack of standardized evaluation protocols and identify discrepancies between reported accuracies and practical results in cricket shot classification.

Method: The authors systematically compare traditional CNN-LSTMs, attention-based models, vision transformers, transfer learning methods, and EfficientNet-GRU combinations using unified benchmarks and modern MLOps practices.

Result: While prior studies reported high accuracies up to 99.2%, their re-implementations achieved much lower accuracies (46.0%-57.7%). Their EfficientNet-GRU model significantly improved results, attaining 92.25% accuracy.

Conclusion: The paper underscores the importance of modern architectures and systematic evaluation protocols in achieving reproducible and accurate results for sports video analysis research.

Abstract: Cricket shot classification from video sequences remains a challenging
problem in sports video analysis, requiring effective modeling of both spatial
and temporal features. This paper presents the first comprehensive baseline
study comparing seven different deep learning approaches across four distinct
research paradigms for cricket shot classification. We implement and
systematically evaluate traditional CNN-LSTM architectures, attention-based
models, vision transformers, transfer learning approaches, and modern
EfficientNet-GRU combinations on a unified benchmark. A critical finding of our
study is the significant performance gap between claims in academic literature
and practical implementation results. While previous papers reported accuracies
of 96\% (Balaji LRCN), 99.2\% (IJERCSE), and 93\% (Sensors), our standardized
re-implementations achieve 46.0\%, 55.6\%, and 57.7\% respectively. Our modern
SOTA approach, combining EfficientNet-B0 with a GRU-based temporal model,
achieves 92.25\% accuracy, demonstrating that substantial improvements are
possible with modern architectures and systematic optimization. All
implementations follow modern MLOps practices with PyTorch Lightning, providing
a reproducible research platform that exposes the critical importance of
standardized evaluation protocols in sports video analysis research.

### [209] [Towards Safer and Understandable Driver Intention Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09200)
*Mukilan Karuppasamy,Shankar Gangisetty,Shyam Nandan Rai,Carlo Masone,C V Jawahar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper focuses on addressing the challenge of interpretability in autonomous driving systems by introducing driver intent prediction (DIP), a new dataset, and a framework called Video Concept Bottleneck Model (VCBM) to provide coherent explanations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Recent advances in AI make autonomous driving systems increasingly competent, but their lack of interpretability hampers safe human-machine interaction. This paper aims to address this by focusing on predicting and explaining driver intentions during driving tasks.

Method: The authors present the DAAD-X dataset, a multimodal dataset offering high-level textual explanations for driver decisions, and propose the Video Concept Bottleneck Model (VCBM), a framework that generates spatio-temporally coherent explanations inherently, without requiring post-hoc methods.

Result: Extensive evaluations on the DAAD-X dataset show that transformer-based models are more interpretable than traditional CNNs. The paper also introduces a multilabel t-SNE visualization to illustrate how explanations are disentangled and causally correlated.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that VCBM and the DAAD-X dataset facilitate improved interpretability in autonomous driving systems, paving the way for safer and more transparent human-machine interaction.

Abstract: Autonomous driving (AD) systems are becoming increasingly capable of handling
complex tasks, mainly due to recent advances in deep learning and AI. As
interactions between autonomous systems and humans increase, the
interpretability of decision-making processes in driving systems becomes
increasingly crucial for ensuring safe driving operations. Successful
human-machine interaction requires understanding the underlying representations
of the environment and the driving task, which remains a significant challenge
in deep learning-based systems. To address this, we introduce the task of
interpretability in maneuver prediction before they occur for driver safety,
i.e., driver intent prediction (DIP), which plays a critical role in AD
systems. To foster research in interpretable DIP, we curate the eXplainable
Driving Action Anticipation Dataset (DAAD-X), a new multimodal, ego-centric
video dataset to provide hierarchical, high-level textual explanations as
causal reasoning for the driver's decisions. These explanations are derived
from both the driver's eye-gaze and the ego-vehicle's perspective. Next, we
propose Video Concept Bottleneck Model (VCBM), a framework that generates
spatio-temporally coherent explanations inherently, without relying on post-hoc
techniques. Finally, through extensive evaluations of the proposed VCBM on the
DAAD-X dataset, we demonstrate that transformer-based models exhibit greater
interpretability than conventional CNN-based models. Additionally, we introduce
a multilabel t-SNE visualization technique to illustrate the disentanglement
and causal correlation among multiple explanations. Our data, code and models
are available at: https://mukil07.github.io/VCBM.github.io/

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Cattle-CLIP, a multimodal deep learning framework, achieving high accuracy in cattle behavior recognition through visual and semantic cues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve cattle health monitoring through accurate behavior recognition in data-scarce environments.

Method: A modified CLIP framework integrates video-based visual features with semantic text prompts, using tailored data augmentations on surveillance footage.

Result: Cattle-CLIP achieves 96.1% accuracy across behaviors and robust performance in few-shot learning scenarios.

Conclusion: Multimodal learning, as demonstrated by Cattle-CLIP, holds promise for advancing animal behavior analysis in agriculture.

Abstract: Cattle behaviour is a crucial indicator of an individual animal health,
productivity and overall well-being. Video-based monitoring, combined with deep
learning techniques, has become a mainstream approach in animal biometrics, and
it can offer high accuracy in some behaviour recognition tasks. We present
Cattle-CLIP, a multimodal deep learning framework for cattle behaviour
recognition, using semantic cues to improve the performance of video-based
visual feature recognition. It is adapted from the large-scale image-language
model CLIP by adding a temporal integration module. To address the domain gap
between web data used for the pre-trained model and real-world cattle
surveillance footage, we introduce tailored data augmentation strategies and
specialised text prompts. Cattle-CLIP is evaluated under both fully-supervised
and few-shot learning scenarios, with a particular focus on data-scarce
behaviour recognition - an important yet under-explored goal in livestock
monitoring. To evaluate the proposed method, we release the CattleBehaviours6
dataset, which comprises six types of indoor behaviours: feeding, drinking,
standing-self-grooming, standing-ruminating, lying-self-grooming and
lying-ruminating. The dataset consists of 1905 clips collected from our John
Oldacre Centre dairy farm research platform housing 200 Holstein-Friesian cows.
Experiments show that Cattle-CLIP achieves 96.1% overall accuracy across six
behaviours in a supervised setting, with nearly 100% recall for feeding,
drinking and standing-ruminating behaviours, and demonstrates robust
generalisation with limited data in few-shot scenarios, highlighting the
potential of multimodal learning in agricultural and animal behaviour analysis.

*Yue Li,Shida Sun,Yu Hong,Feihu Xu,Zhiwei Xiong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a Time-Resolved Transformer (TRT) architecture tailored for LOS and NLOS photon-efficient 3D imaging, achieving higher performance and robustness in noisy, low-efficiency scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Photon-efficient 3D imaging in LOS and NLOS contexts faces challenges due to sensor inefficiencies and high noise levels, especially in complex or long-range scenes.

Method: The authors propose a TRT architecture with spatio-temporal self-attention encoders and cross-attention decoders to handle transient measurement data, optimizing local and global feature correlations across scales.

Result: TRT-LOS and TRT-NLOS outperform existing methods in 3D reconstruction tasks using synthetic and real-world datasets, proving its robustness and effectiveness.

Conclusion: TRT improves photon-efficient imaging of 3D scenes through innovative attention mechanisms and task-specific implementations, validated by experiments and datasets shared for public use.

Abstract: Transient measurements, captured by the timeresolved systems, are widely
employed in photon-efficient reconstruction tasks, including line-of-sight
(LOS) and non-line-of-sight (NLOS) imaging. However, challenges persist in
their 3D reconstruction due to the low quantum efficiency of sensors and the
high noise levels, particularly for long-range or complex scenes. To boost the
3D reconstruction performance in photon-efficient imaging, we propose a generic
Time-Resolved Transformer (TRT) architecture. Different from existing
transformers designed for high-dimensional data, TRT has two elaborate
attention designs tailored for the spatio-temporal transient measurements.
Specifically, the spatio-temporal self-attention encoders explore both local
and global correlations within transient data by splitting or downsampling
input features into different scales. Then, the spatio-temporal cross attention
decoders integrate the local and global features in the token space, resulting
in deep features with high representation capabilities. Building on TRT, we
develop two task-specific embodiments: TRT-LOS for LOS imaging and TRT-NLOS for
NLOS imaging. Extensive experiments demonstrate that both embodiments
significantly outperform existing methods on synthetic data and real-world data
captured by different imaging systems. In addition, we contribute a
large-scale, high-resolution synthetic LOS dataset with various noise levels
and capture a set of real-world NLOS measurements using a custom-built imaging
system, enhancing the data diversity in this field. Code and datasets are
available at https://github.com/Depth2World/TRT.

*Wuyang Li,Wentao Pan,Po-Chien Luan,Yang Gao,Alexandre Alahi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Stable Video Infinity (SVI), a method for generating infinitely long, temporally consistent, and diverse videos, addressing both accumulated error and training/testing mismatch issues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing video generation methods struggle with error accumulation and discrepancies between training conditions (error-free inputs) and real-generation scenarios (error-prone outputs), leading to repetitive scenes and inconsistent transitions.

Method: SVI introduces Error-Recycling Fine-Tuning, where the model reuses its own past errors as training feedback, simulating real-generation conditions through error injection, bidirectional prediction approximation, and replay memory banking.

Result: SVI scales videos to infinite durations with no added inference cost, maintaining adaptability to diverse input conditions. It demonstrates state-of-the-art performance in benchmarks across consistency, creativity, and condition-based scenarios.

Conclusion: SVI bridges the training/testing gap in video generation by teaching models to self-correct errors, achieving infinite-length, temporally coherent, and narratively diverse video production.

Abstract: We propose Stable Video Infinity (SVI) that is able to generate
infinite-length videos with high temporal consistency, plausible scene
transitions, and controllable streaming storylines. While existing long-video
methods attempt to mitigate accumulated errors via handcrafted anti-drifting
(e.g., modified noise scheduler, frame anchoring), they remain limited to
single-prompt extrapolation, producing homogeneous scenes with repetitive
motions. We identify that the fundamental challenge extends beyond error
accumulation to a critical discrepancy between the training assumption (seeing
clean data) and the test-time autoregressive reality (conditioning on
self-generated, error-prone outputs). To bridge this hypothesis gap, SVI
incorporates Error-Recycling Fine-Tuning, a new type of efficient training that
recycles the Diffusion Transformer (DiT)'s self-generated errors into
supervisory prompts, thereby encouraging DiT to actively identify and correct
its own errors. This is achieved by injecting, collecting, and banking errors
through closed-loop recycling, autoregressively learning from error-injected
feedback. Specifically, we (i) inject historical errors made by DiT to
intervene on clean inputs, simulating error-accumulated trajectories in flow
matching; (ii) efficiently approximate predictions with one-step bidirectional
integration and calculate errors with residuals; (iii) dynamically bank errors
into replay memory across discretized timesteps, which are resampled for new
input. SVI is able to scale videos from seconds to infinite durations with no
additional inference cost, while remaining compatible with diverse conditions
(e.g., audio, skeleton, and text streams). We evaluate SVI on three benchmarks,
including consistent, creative, and conditional settings, thoroughly verifying
its versatility and state-of-the-art role.

TL;DR: TEMA-LLM enhances cross-domain recommendation systems by utilizing Large Language Models (LLMs) for semantic tag generation and multi-attention mechanisms, yielding superior performance across multiple datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the challenge of providing personalized and seamless consumer experiences across diverse domains by capturing both domain-specific and cross-domain behavioral patterns.

Method: TEMA-LLM employs LLMs to generate semantic tags from item titles and descriptions, integrates those tags with multi-modal features, and models user preferences using a Tag-Enriched Multi-Attention mechanism.

Result: Experiments across four large-scale e-commerce datasets show TEMA-LLM outperforming state-of-the-art baselines in recommendation accuracy.

Conclusion: LLM-based semantic tagging and multi-attention mechanisms significantly improve the effectiveness of cross-domain sequential recommendation systems, paving the way for smarter consumer-facing platforms.

Abstract: Cross-Domain Sequential Recommendation (CDSR) plays a crucial role in modern
consumer electronics and e-commerce platforms, where users interact with
diverse services such as books, movies, and online retail products. These
systems must accurately capture both domain-specific and cross-domain
behavioral patterns to provide personalized and seamless consumer experiences.
To address this challenge, we propose \textbf{TEMA-LLM} (\textit{Tag-Enriched
Multi-Attention with Large Language Models}), a practical and effective
framework that integrates \textit{Large Language Models (LLMs)} for semantic
tag generation and enrichment. Specifically, TEMA-LLM employs LLMs to assign
domain-aware prompts and generate descriptive tags from item titles and
descriptions. The resulting tag embeddings are fused with item identifiers as
well as textual and visual features to construct enhanced item representations.
A \textit{Tag-Enriched Multi-Attention} mechanism is then introduced to jointly
model user preferences within and across domains, enabling the system to
capture complex and evolving consumer interests. Extensive experiments on four
large-scale e-commerce datasets demonstrate that TEMA-LLM consistently
outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, underscoring the benefits of LLM-based
semantic tagging and multi-attention integration for consumer-facing
recommendation systems. The proposed approach highlights the potential of LLMs
to advance intelligent, user-centric services in the field of consumer
electronics.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a low-cost diagnostic framework using Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) for shoulder disorders, achieving significant accuracy improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address the challenge of diagnosing shoulder disorders, especially in regions with scarce medical resources, by developing cost-effective and scalable solutions.

Method: The paper proposes the Hybrid Motion Video Diagnosis framework (HMVDx), leveraging videos captured by consumer-grade devices and utilizing MLLMs for action understanding and disease diagnosis.

Result: Experimental results indicate a 79.6% increase in diagnostic accuracy for shoulder joint injuries using HMVDx compared to direct video diagnosis approaches.

Conclusion: HMVDx demonstrates the potential for applying low-cost MLLMs in medical diagnostics, advancing video understanding and its usability in the medical field.

Abstract: Shoulder disorders, such as frozen shoulder (a.k.a., adhesive capsulitis),
are common conditions affecting the health of people worldwide, and have a high
incidence rate among the elderly and workers engaged in repetitive shoulder
tasks. In regions with scarce medical resources, achieving early and accurate
diagnosis poses significant challenges, and there is an urgent need for
low-cost and easily scalable auxiliary diagnostic solutions. This research
introduces videos captured by consumer-grade devices as the basis for
diagnosis, reducing the cost for users. We focus on the innovative application
of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) in the preliminary diagnosis of
shoulder disorders and propose a Hybrid Motion Video Diagnosis framework
(HMVDx). This framework divides the two tasks of action understanding and
disease diagnosis, which are respectively completed by two MLLMs. In addition
to traditional evaluation indicators, this work proposes a novel metric called
Usability Index by the logical process of medical decision-making (action
recognition, movement diagnosis, and final diagnosis). This index evaluates the
effectiveness of MLLMs in the medical field from the perspective of the entire
medical diagnostic pathway, revealing the potential value of low-cost MLLMs in
medical applications for medical practitioners. In experimental comparisons,
the accuracy of HMVDx in diagnosing shoulder joint injuries has increased by
79.6\% compared with direct video diagnosis, a significant technical
contribution to future research on the application of MLLMs for video
understanding in the medical field.

### [216] [Zero-shot image privacy classification with Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09253)
*Alina Elena Baia,Alessio Xompero,Andrea Cavallaro*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper evaluates image privacy prediction using advanced Vision-Language Models (VLMs) and compares their performance and efficiency against specialized models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Specialized models for image privacy prediction are increasingly being replaced by general-purpose Vision-Language Models (VLMs), risking the neglect of the performance superiority of purpose-built models.

Method: The authors create a zero-shot benchmark for image privacy classification and compare the top-3 open-source VLMs against specialized vision-only and multi-modal models using task-aligned prompts.

Result: Findings reveal that VLMs, while more resource-intensive, offer lower accuracy but greater robustness against image perturbations when compared to specialized models.

Conclusion: Despite their versatility, Vision-Language Models lack accuracy in privacy prediction tasks compared to specialized models, albeit being more robust to variations.

Abstract: While specialized learning-based models have historically dominated image
privacy prediction, the current literature increasingly favours adopting large
Vision-Language Models (VLMs) designed for generic tasks. This trend risks
overlooking the performance ceiling set by purpose-built models due to a lack
of systematic evaluation. To address this problem, we establish a zero-shot
benchmark for image privacy classification, enabling a fair comparison. We
evaluate the top-3 open-source VLMs, according to a privacy benchmark, using
task-aligned prompts and we contrast their performance, efficiency, and
robustness against established vision-only and multi-modal methods.
Counter-intuitively, our results show that VLMs, despite their
resource-intensive nature in terms of high parameter count and slower
inference, currently lag behind specialized, smaller models in privacy
prediction accuracy. We also find that VLMs exhibit higher robustness to image
perturbations.

### [217] [Hallucination Filtering in Radiology Vision-Language Models Using Discrete Semantic Entropy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09256)
*Patrick Wienholt,Sophie Caselitz,Robert Siepmann,Philipp Bruners,Keno Bressem,Christiane Kuhl,Jakob Nikolas Kather,Sven Nebelung,Daniel Truhn*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper explores using Discrete Semantic Entropy (DSE) to filter out questions likely to cause errors in vision-language models for radiologic visual question answering (VQA), improving their accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address hallucinations and inaccuracies in black-box vision-language models when answering clinical questions based on radiologic images.

Method: DSE was computed by grouping semantically equivalent responses. Questions with high entropy were filtered out, and accuracy improvements were assessed using bootstrap resampling and statistical tests.

Result: Filtering questions with DSE > 0.3 increased accuracy significantly for GPT-4o (76.3%) and GPT-4.1 (63.8%), compared to their baseline accuracy of 51.7% and 54.8%. Results were statistically significant.

Conclusion: DSE can reliably detect hallucinations and improve diagnostic accuracy in vision-language models by filtering semantically inconsistent questions. This presents a valuable strategy for clinical VLM applications.

Abstract: To determine whether using discrete semantic entropy (DSE) to reject
questions likely to generate hallucinations can improve the accuracy of
black-box vision-language models (VLMs) in radiologic image based visual
question answering (VQA). This retrospective study evaluated DSE using two
publicly available, de-identified datasets: (i) the VQA-Med 2019 benchmark (500
images with clinical questions and short-text answers) and (ii) a diagnostic
radiology dataset (206 cases: 60 computed tomography scans, 60 magnetic
resonance images, 60 radiographs, 26 angiograms) with corresponding
ground-truth diagnoses. GPT-4o and GPT-4.1 answered each question 15 times
using a temperature of 1.0. Baseline accuracy was determined using
low-temperature answers (temperature 0.1). Meaning-equivalent responses were
grouped using bidirectional entailment checks, and DSE was computed from the
relative frequencies of the resulting semantic clusters. Accuracy was
recalculated after excluding questions with DSE > 0.6 or > 0.3. p-values and
95% confidence intervals were obtained using bootstrap resampling and a
Bonferroni-corrected threshold of p < .004 for statistical significance. Across
706 image-question pairs, baseline accuracy was 51.7% for GPT-4o and 54.8% for
GPT-4.1. After filtering out high-entropy questions (DSE > 0.3), accuracy on
the remaining questions was 76.3% (retained questions: 334/706) for GPT-4o and
63.8% (retained questions: 499/706) for GPT-4.1 (both p < .001). Accuracy gains
were observed across both datasets and largely remained statistically
significant after Bonferroni correction. DSE enables reliable hallucination
detection in black-box VLMs by quantifying semantic inconsistency. This method
significantly improves diagnostic answer accuracy and offers a filtering
strategy for clinical VLM applications.

### [218] [MomentSeg: Moment-Centric Sampling for Enhanced Video Pixel Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09274)
*Ming Dai,Sen Yang,Boqiang Duan,Wankou Yang,Jingdong Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a unified framework for Referring Video Object Segmentation (RefVOS) that jointly optimizes Temporal Sentence Grounding (TSG) and RefVOS while avoiding external timestamp encodings and introducing effective strategies such as Moment-Centric Sampling (MCS) and Bidirectional Anchor-updated Propagation (BAP).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for RefVOS rely on handcrafted heuristics or external models, but these approaches fail to fully capture temporal cues or add system complexity. This research aims to streamline sampling strategies, leveraging temporal reasoning without external encodings.

Method: The study employs a novel [FIND] token-based TSG paradigm for training, enabling temporal token similarity matching. For inference, the Moment-Centric Sampling (MCS) strategy efficiently handles frame sampling, and the Bidirectional Anchor-updated Propagation (BAP) strategy enhances mask initialization and tracking stability.

Result: The proposed framework demonstrates the ability to ground key moments and effectively address motion details and global context while mitigating accumulated errors during segmentation.

Conclusion: The introduced unified framework simplifies RefVOS sampling strategies by combining TSG and RefVOS optimization while improving tracking accuracy and temporal reasoning via novel training and inference approaches.

Abstract: Referring Video Object Segmentation (RefVOS) seeks to segment target objects
in videos guided by natural language descriptions, demanding both temporal
reasoning and fine-grained visual comprehension. Existing sampling strategies
for LLM-based approaches typically rely on either handcrafted heuristics or
external keyframe models. The former often overlooks essential temporal cues,
while the latter increases system complexity. To address this, we propose a
unified framework that jointly optimizes Temporal Sentence Grounding (TSG) and
RefVOS, naturally incorporating key moment grounding capability. During
training, we introduce a novel TSG paradigm that employs a dedicated
\texttt{[FIND]} token for key moment identification through temporal token
similarity matching, thereby avoiding the need for external timestamp
encodings. For inference, we design a Moment-Centric Sampling (MCS) strategy
that densely samples informative moments while sparsely sampling non-essential
frames, preserving both motion details and global context. To further enhance
tracking stability, we develop Bidirectional Anchor-updated Propagation (BAP),
which leverages the most relevant moment as start point for high-quality mask
initialization and dynamically updates at sampled points to mitigate
accumulated errors. Code and model will be available at:

### [219] [Spotlight on Token Perception for Multimodal Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09285)
*Siyuan Huang,Xiaoye Qu,Yafu Li,Yun Luo,Zefeng He,Daizong Liu,Yu Cheng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper explores the role of visual perception in Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) for large vision-language models (LVLMs) and proposes a novel token-based optimization strategy called Visually-Perceptive Policy Optimization (VPPO), achieving significant improvements in multimodal reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multimodal reasoning methods overlook the importance of visual perception during RLVR optimization in LVLMs.

Method: VPPO enhances RLVR by incorporating token perception into its optimization process through reweighting trajectory advantages based on visual dependency and focusing updates on visually pivotal tokens.

Result: The proposed VPPO achieves substantial performance gains over other RL-tuned models in various perception and reasoning benchmarks, and its effectiveness is validated on both 7B and 32B model scales.

Conclusion: The study provides a novel token-level perceptual framework for analyzing multimodal RLVR and demonstrates an effective strategy to significantly improve LVLMs' multimodal reasoning capabilities.

Abstract: While Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has advanced the
reasoning capabilities of Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs), most existing
methods in multimodal reasoning neglect the critical role of visual perception
within the RLVR optimization process. In this paper, we undertake a pioneering
exploration of multimodal RLVR through the novel perspective of token
perception, which measures the visual dependency of each generated token. With
a granular analysis of Chain-of-Thought (CoT) processes, we uncover two key
insights: first, token perception in a rollout trajectory is sparsely
distributed, where only a small fraction of tokens have high visual dependency
for visually-grounded reasoning; second, different trajectories exhibit
significant divergence in their overall visual dependency. Based on these
observations, we propose Visually-Perceptive Policy Optimization (VPPO), a
novel policy gradient algorithm that explicitly leverages token perception to
refine the learning signal. Specifically, VPPO achieves this through a dual
mechanism: it reweights a trajectory's advantage by its overall visual
dependency, and focuses policy updates exclusively on perceptually pivotal
tokens. On a comprehensive suite of eight perception and reasoning benchmarks,
VPPO demonstrates substantial gains over leading open-source RL-tuned models,
with its effectiveness consistently validated across 7B and 32B model scales.
Our findings not only establish a new token-level perceptual perspective for
analyzing multimodal RLVR but also present a novel and effective optimization
strategy to significantly enhance the multimodal reasoning capabilities of
LVLMs.

*Tejaswi V. Panchagnula*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper demonstrates that human gaze dynamics during image viewing resemble Levy walks, similar to animal foraging, and explores gaze modeling using CNNs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the underlying spatiotemporal statistics of human eye movements while exploring images, and its relation to optimal foraging patterns.

Method: Conducted experiments with 40 participants viewing 50 images under unconstrained conditions. High-speed eye tracking was used for data collection, and CNN models were trained to predict fixation heatmaps.

Result: Human gaze trajectories follow Levy walk patterns. The CNN model accurately predicted salient fixation zones from image data.

Conclusion: Human visual exploration is analogous to natural foraging behavior and this behavior can be modeled predictively using CNN frameworks.

Abstract: Animals often forage via Levy walks stochastic trajectories with heavy tailed
step lengths optimized for sparse resource environments. We show that human
visual gaze follows similar dynamics when scanning images. While traditional
models emphasize image based saliency, the underlying spatiotemporal statistics
of eye movements remain underexplored. Understanding these dynamics has broad
applications in attention modeling and vision-based interfaces. In this study,
we conducted a large scale human subject experiment involving 40 participants
viewing 50 diverse images under unconstrained conditions, recording over 4
million gaze points using a high speed eye tracker. Analysis of these data
shows that the gaze trajectory of the human eye also follows a Levy walk akin
to animal foraging. This suggests that the human eye forages for visual
information in an optimally efficient manner. Further, we trained a
convolutional neural network (CNN) to predict fixation heatmaps from image
input alone. The model accurately reproduced salient fixation regions across
novel images, demonstrating that key components of gaze behavior are learnable
from visual structure alone. Our findings present new evidence that human
visual exploration obeys statistical laws analogous to natural foraging and
open avenues for modeling gaze through generative and predictive frameworks.

*Yuying Li,Siyi Qian,Hao Liang,Leqi Zheng,Ruichuan An,Yongzhen Guo,Wentao Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces CapGeo, a framework that enhances geometric reasoning in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) by leveraging captions, showing significant performance improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) struggle with geometric problems due to difficulty in understanding diagrams, highlighting the need for improved visual to textual conversion methods.

Method: The authors introduce CapGeo, a caption-assisted reasoning framework, and propose CapGeo-Bench‚Äîa dataset with 4,641 figure-caption pairs and a keypoint-based evaluation metric.

Result: With CapGeo, Qwen2.5-VL-72B's performance improved from 8.6% to 59.0%, and Claude-Opus-4's accuracy rose from 44.8% to 73.0%.

Conclusion: CapGeo and CapGeo-Bench significantly enhance geometric reasoning in MLLMs and provide a new pathway for connecting visual and textual understanding.

Abstract: Geometric reasoning remains a core challenge for Multimodal Large Language
Models (MLLMs). Even the most advanced closed-source systems, such as GPT-O3
and Gemini-2.5-Pro, still struggle to solve geometry problems reliably, despite
exhibiting strong textual reasoning abilities on tasks like the International
Mathematical Olympiad (IMO). This gap suggests that the bottleneck lies in
understanding geometric diagrams rather than reasoning itself. Since geometric
figures can often be faithfully described in concise textual form, converting
visual content into captions offers a promising direction. Motivated by this
insight, we introduce CapGeo, a caption-assisted reasoning framework that
bridges visual and textual modalities. Experiments show substantial
improvements when models are equipped with captions: Qwen2.5-VL-72B improves
from 8.6% (vision-only) to 59.0%, while Claude-Opus-4 rises from 44.8% to
73.0%. To systematically evaluate and identify high-quality geometric
captioning models, we further propose CapGeo-Bench, a dataset of 4,641 curated
figure-caption pairs. Crucially, CapGeo-Bench incorporates a keypoint-based
evaluation metric that correlates strongly with downstream CapGeo performance,
enabling reliable assessment of geometric captioning ability. Together, our
framework and benchmark highlight a new pathway toward advancing geometric
reasoning in MLLMs.

TL;DR: This paper introduces RadioFlow, a generative framework with faster and more efficient radio map generation compared to diffusion models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for accurate and real-time radio map generation with reduced latency and energy consumption in next-generation wireless systems.

Method: RadioFlow leverages flow-matching-based generative modeling for single-step sampling and accelerates both training and inference processes.

Result: RadioFlow outperformed diffusion-based models by achieving up to 8x fewer parameters and over 4x faster inference speeds.

Conclusion: RadioFlow offers a scalable and energy-efficient solution for real-time electromagnetic digital twins in 6G networks.

Abstract: Accurate and real-time radio map (RM) generation is crucial for
next-generation wireless systems, yet diffusion-based approaches often suffer
from large model sizes, slow iterative denoising, and high inference latency,
which hinder practical deployment. To overcome these limitations, we propose
\textbf{RadioFlow}, a novel flow-matching-based generative framework that
achieves high-fidelity RM generation through single-step efficient sampling.
Unlike conventional diffusion models, RadioFlow learns continuous transport
trajectories between noise and data, enabling both training and inference to be
significantly accelerated while preserving reconstruction accuracy.
Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that RadioFlow achieves state-of-the-art
performance with \textbf{up to 8$\times$ fewer parameters} and \textbf{over
4$\times$ faster inference} compared to the leading diffusion-based baseline
(RadioDiff). This advancement provides a promising pathway toward scalable,
energy-efficient, and real-time electromagnetic digital twins for future 6G
networks. We release the code at

*Wenyao Zhang,Hongsi Liu,Bohan Li,Jiawei He,Zekun Qi,Yunnan Wang,Shengyang Zhao,Xinqiang Yu,Wenjun Zeng,Xin Jin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Hybrid-depth leverages foundation models to improve monocular depth estimation, enhancing contextual knowledge extraction and achieving state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current self-supervised monocular depth estimation methods struggle due to insufficient semantic and spatial knowledge extraction.

Method: The framework integrates foundation models CLIP and DINO to extract semantic and spatial visual priors and employs a coarse-to-fine progressive learning approach with contrastive language guidance.

Result: Extensive experiments on the KITTI benchmark show significant performance improvements over state-of-the-art methods for depth estimation and downstream tasks.

Conclusion: Hybrid-depth systematically enhances depth predictions by addressing feature granularity mismatches, providing a plug-and-play depth encoder for existing pipelines.

Abstract: Current self-supervised monocular depth estimation (MDE) approaches encounter
performance limitations due to insufficient semantic-spatial knowledge
extraction. To address this challenge, we propose Hybrid-depth, a novel
framework that systematically integrates foundation models (e.g., CLIP and
DINO) to extract visual priors and acquire sufficient contextual information
for MDE. Our approach introduces a coarse-to-fine progressive learning
framework: 1) Firstly, we aggregate multi-grained features from CLIP (global
semantics) and DINO (local spatial details) under contrastive language
guidance. A proxy task comparing close-distant image patches is designed to
enforce depth-aware feature alignment using text prompts; 2) Next, building on
the coarse features, we integrate camera pose information and pixel-wise
language alignment to refine depth predictions. This module seamlessly
integrates with existing self-supervised MDE pipelines (e.g., Monodepth2,
ManyDepth) as a plug-and-play depth encoder, enhancing continuous depth
estimation. By aggregating CLIP's semantic context and DINO's spatial details
through language guidance, our method effectively addresses feature granularity
mismatches. Extensive experiments on the KITTI benchmark demonstrate that our
method significantly outperforms SOTA methods across all metrics, which also
indeed benefits downstream tasks like BEV perception. Code is available at

*Zenan Lin,Wei Li,Jintao Chen,Zihao Wu,Wenxiong Kang,Changxin Gao,Liansheng Wang,Jin-Gang Yu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper presents IRCR-Net, a semi-supervised framework tackling nuclei instance segmentation with enhanced robustness and accuracy using prior knowledge and refined pseudo-label handling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate nuclei segmentation in pathological images is fundamental for tasks like tumor microenvironment analysis, but limited annotated data and noisy pseudo-labels hinder both fully and semi-supervised approaches.

Method: IRCR-Net introduces two consistency mechanisms (MIAC and PIAC) using morphological prior knowledge, refines pseudo-labels, dismisses low-quality labels, and optimizes training for overlapping nuclei scenarios.

Result: IRCR-Net outperforms existing semi-supervised methods and even achieves better results than fully supervised methods in some cases across multiple datasets.

Conclusion: The method innovatively integrates instance-aware consistency mechanisms and morphological priors to set a new benchmark for semi-supervised nuclei segmentation techniques.

Abstract: Nuclei instance segmentation in pathological images is crucial for downstream
tasks such as tumor microenvironment analysis. However, the high cost and
scarcity of annotated data limit the applicability of fully supervised methods,
while existing semi-supervised methods fail to adequately regularize
consistency at the instance level, lack leverage of the inherent prior
knowledge of pathological structures, and are prone to introducing noisy
pseudo-labels during training. In this paper, we propose an Instance-Aware
Robust Consistency Regularization Network (IRCR-Net) for accurate
instance-level nuclei segmentation. Specifically, we introduce the
Matching-Driven Instance-Aware Consistency (MIAC) and Prior-Driven
Instance-Aware Consistency (PIAC) mechanisms to refine the nuclei instance
segmentation result of the teacher and student subnetwork, particularly for
densely distributed and overlapping nuclei. We incorporate morphological prior
knowledge of nuclei in pathological images and utilize these priors to assess
the quality of pseudo-labels generated from unlabeled data. Low-quality
pseudo-labels are discarded, while high-quality predictions are enhanced to
reduce pseudo-label noise and benefit the network's robust training.
Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method significantly
enhances semi-supervised nuclei instance segmentation performance across
multiple public datasets compared to existing approaches, even surpassing fully
supervised methods in some scenarios.

*Jinyuan Liu,Zihang Chen,Zhu Liu,Zhiying Jiang,Long Ma,Xin Fan,Risheng Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper focuses on enhancing thermal infrared images, tackling multiple degradations simultaneously using a Progressive Prompt Fusion Network (PPFN) and selective training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for enhancing infrared images inadequately handle coupled degradations and translating RGB image enhancement methods is ineffective due to differing imaging models.

Method: The paper introduces the Progressive Prompt Fusion Network (PPFN) which uses degradation-specific prompts and selective progressive training (SPT) to refine composite enhancement processes.

Result: The approach achieves an 8.76% improvement in handling complex degradation scenarios and delivers high-quality enhancements in varied scenarios.

Conclusion: PPFN and SPT provide improved adaptability and effectiveness in enhancing thermal infrared images under both isolated and coupled degradation conditions.

Abstract: We engage in the relatively underexplored task named thermal infrared image
enhancement. Existing infrared image enhancement methods primarily focus on
tackling individual degradations, such as noise, contrast, and blurring, making
it difficult to handle coupled degradations. Meanwhile, all-in-one enhancement
methods, commonly applied to RGB sensors, often demonstrate limited
effectiveness due to the significant differences in imaging models. In sight of
this, we first revisit the imaging mechanism and introduce a Progressive Prompt
Fusion Network (PPFN). Specifically, the PPFN initially establishes prompt
pairs based on the thermal imaging process. For each type of degradation, we
fuse the corresponding prompt pairs to modulate the model's features, providing
adaptive guidance that enables the model to better address specific
degradations under single or multiple conditions. In addition, a Selective
Progressive Training (SPT) mechanism is introduced to gradually refine the
model's handling of composite cases to align the enhancement process, which not
only allows the model to remove camera noise and retain key structural details,
but also enhancing the overall contrast of the thermal image. Furthermore, we
introduce the most high-quality, multi-scenarios infrared benchmark covering a
wide range of scenarios. Extensive experiments substantiate that our approach
not only delivers promising visual results under specific degradation but also
significantly improves performance on complex degradation scenes, achieving a
notable 8.76\% improvement. Code is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes using vision-language models (VLMs) for multi-modal keyphrase prediction (MMKP), addressing issues like absence/unseen scenarios and overtraining overlaps, and suggests methods like Fine-tune-CoT and dynamic CoT for improved reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional multi-modal approaches to MMKP face significant limitations, including challenges with absence and unseen scenarios and overestimated performance in current benchmarks due to data overlaps.

Method: The authors employ vision-language models (VLMs) using zero-shot, supervised fine-tuning, Fine-tune-CoT (leveraging teacher-generated reasoning data), and dynamic CoT (adaptive reasoning data injection).

Result: The experimental evaluation on various datasets shows that the proposed methods enhance the performance and reasoning capabilities of VLMs.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates that the Fine-tune-CoT and dynamic CoT strategies effectively handle complex reasoning and overthinking issues in MMKP tasks, marking a notable advancement in the field.

Abstract: Multi-modal keyphrase prediction (MMKP) aims to advance beyond text-only
methods by incorporating multiple modalities of input information to produce a
set of conclusive phrases. Traditional multi-modal approaches have been proven
to have significant limitations in handling the challenging absence and unseen
scenarios. Additionally, we identify shortcomings in existing benchmarks that
overestimate model capability due to significant overlap in training tests. In
this work, we propose leveraging vision-language models (VLMs) for the MMKP
task. Firstly, we use two widely-used strategies, e.g., zero-shot and
supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to assess the lower bound performance of VLMs.
Next, to improve the complex reasoning capabilities of VLMs, we adopt
Fine-tune-CoT, which leverages high-quality CoT reasoning data generated by a
teacher model to finetune smaller models. Finally, to address the
"overthinking" phenomenon, we propose a dynamic CoT strategy which adaptively
injects CoT data during training, allowing the model to flexibly leverage its
reasoning capabilities during the inference stage. We evaluate the proposed
strategies on various datasets and the experimental results demonstrate the
effectiveness of the proposed approaches. The code is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces BLINK-Twice, a vision-centric reasoning benchmark focusing solely on image-grounded reasoning, challenging existing multimodal large language models (MLLMs).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks often assess reasoning in a language context, treating visual input as supplementary. This paper aims to create a benchmark that emphasizes reasoning grounded exclusively in visual content.

Method: The benchmark includes seven types of visual challenges, adversarial image pairs enforcing reliance on visual elements, and annotated reasoning chains for evaluating the reasoning process. Twenty leading MLLMs are evaluated on this dataset.

Result: Models face significant challenges with BLINK-Twice, revealing that current reasoning strategies like chain-of-thought lead to unstable results. Repeated image observation enhances performance, and interactive visual reasoning shows promise.

Conclusion: BLINK-Twice exposes deficiencies in current MLLM reasoning approaches and demonstrates the need for novel reasoning paradigms that deeply integrate visual interaction and observation.

Abstract: Recently, Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have made rapid progress,
particularly in enhancing their reasoning capabilities. However, existing
reasoning benchmarks still primarily assess language-based reasoning, often
treating visual input as replaceable context. To address this gap, we introduce
BLINK-Twice, a vision-centric reasoning benchmark grounded in challenging
perceptual tasks. Instead of relying on external knowledge, our tasks require
models to reason from visual content alone, shifting the focus from
language-based to image-grounded reasoning. Compared to prior perception
benchmarks, it moves beyond shallow perception ("see") and requires
fine-grained observation and analytical reasoning ("observe"). BLINK-Twice
integrates three core components: seven types of visual challenges for testing
visual reasoning, natural adversarial image pairs that enforce reliance on
visual content, and annotated reasoning chains for fine-grained evaluation of
the reasoning process rather than final answers alone. We evaluate 20 leading
MLLMs, including 12 foundation models and 8 reasoning-enhanced models.
BLINK-Twice poses a significant challenge to current models. While existing
reasoning strategies in the language space-such as chain-of-thought or
self-criticism can improve performance, they often result in unstable and
redundant reasoning. We observe that repeated image observation improves
performance across models, and active visual interaction, as demonstrated by
models like o3, highlights the need for a new paradigm for vision reasoning.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 3D Gaussian splatting performs well in novel view synthesis but depends on high-quality point clouds, which are difficult to achieve in dynamic urban scenarios. VAD-GS addresses this by enhancing geometry recovery with novel techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Overcoming the limitations of 3D Gaussian splatting in unbounded urban environments, where incomplete point clouds lead to artifacts and distortions during synthesis.

Method: The method leverages voxel-based visibility reasoning, diversity-aware view selection, and patch matching-based multi-view stereo reconstruction to improve geometric reliability and recover missing structures.

Result: VAD-GS delivers superior performance compared to current 3DGS methods, as shown by improved geometry quality on Waymo and nuScenes datasets for both static and dynamic objects.

Conclusion: The proposed framework, VAD-GS, successfully enhances geometry recovery in challenging urban scenes, offering significant advantages over state-of-the-art methods in 3D Gaussian splatting.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian splatting (3DGS) has demonstrated impressive performance in
synthesizing high-fidelity novel views. Nonetheless, its effectiveness
critically depends on the quality of the initialized point cloud. Specifically,
achieving uniform and complete point coverage over the underlying scene
structure requires overlapping observation frustums, an assumption that is
often violated in unbounded, dynamic urban environments. Training Gaussian
models with partially initialized point clouds often leads to distortions and
artifacts, as camera rays may fail to intersect valid surfaces, resulting in
incorrect gradient propagation to Gaussian primitives associated with occluded
or invisible geometry. Additionally, existing densification strategies simply
clone and split Gaussian primitives from existing ones, incapable of
reconstructing missing structures. To address these limitations, we propose
VAD-GS, a 3DGS framework tailored for geometry recovery in challenging urban
scenes. Our method identifies unreliable geometry structures via voxel-based
visibility reasoning, selects informative supporting views through
diversity-aware view selection, and recovers missing structures via patch
matching-based multi-view stereo reconstruction. This design enables the
generation of new Gaussian primitives guided by reliable geometric priors, even
in regions lacking initial points. Extensive experiments on the Waymo and
nuScenes datasets demonstrate that VAD-GS outperforms state-of-the-art 3DGS
approaches and significantly improves the quality of reconstructed geometry for
both static and dynamic objects. Source code will be released upon publication.

### [229] [Minkowski-MambaNet: A Point Cloud Framework with Selective State Space Models for Forest Biomass Quantification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09367)
*Jinxiang Tu,Dayong Ren,Fei Shi,Zhenhong Jia,Yahong Ren,Jiwei Qin,Fang He*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Minkowski-MambaNet, a deep learning model for directly estimating forest biomass and volume from raw LiDAR data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of differentiating trees and modeling long-range dependencies in forest biomass estimation using airborne LiDAR.

Method: Proposes Minkowski-MambaNet, a framework combining a Minkowski network and Selective State Space Model (SSM) for global context and improved accuracy.

Result: Minkowski-MambaNet outperforms current methods on Danish LiDAR data, offering robust and accurate estimates without requiring a Digital Terrain Model (DTM).

Conclusion: Minkowski-MambaNet is a significant advancement for LiDAR-based forest inventories, improving efficiency and accuracy in large-scale forest biomass analysis.

Abstract: Accurate forest biomass quantification is vital for carbon cycle monitoring.
While airborne LiDAR excels at capturing 3D forest structure, directly
estimating woody volume and Aboveground Biomass (AGB) from point clouds is
challenging due to difficulties in modeling long-range dependencies needed to
distinguish trees.We propose Minkowski-MambaNet, a novel deep learning
framework that directly estimates volume and AGB from raw LiDAR. Its key
innovation is integrating the Mamba model's Selective State Space Model (SSM)
into a Minkowski network, enabling effective encoding of global context and
long-range dependencies for improved tree differentiation. Skip connections are
incorporated to enhance features and accelerate convergence.Evaluated on Danish
National Forest Inventory LiDAR data, Minkowski-MambaNet significantly
outperforms state-of-the-art methods, providing more accurate and robust
estimates. Crucially, it requires no Digital Terrain Model (DTM) and is robust
to boundary artifacts. This work offers a powerful tool for large-scale forest
biomass analysis, advancing LiDAR-based forest inventories.

### [230] [Utilizing dynamic sparsity on pretrained DETR](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09380)
*Reza Sedghi,Anand Subramoney,David Kappel*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper addresses inefficiencies in transformer models like DETR by leveraging neuron sparsity. They propose two sparsification methods, including a novel Micro-Gated Sparsification (MGS), achieving high computational efficiency without retraining the model, while retaining or improving performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer-based models, particularly in vision tasks like DETR for object detection, demand high computational resources. Identifying and exploiting inherent sparsity in such models can significantly enhance efficiency without sacrificing performance.

Method: The authors introduce two sparsification methods: (1) Static Indicator-Based Sparsification (SIBS), a heuristic method for predicting fixed activation patterns, and (2) Micro-Gated Sparsification (MGS), a dynamic, lightweight, input-adaptive gating mechanism trained atop pretrained DETR models.

Result: Micro-Gated Sparsification achieves 85-95% sparsity in neuron activation and cuts computational costs, while either maintaining or improving performance on object detection tasks (tested on the COCO dataset).

Conclusion: MGS provides a practical, effective, and input-adaptive method for deploying pretrained vision transformer models efficiently without the need for full-scale retraining, marking significant computational savings and maintaining model effectiveness.

Abstract: Efficient inference with transformer-based models remains a challenge,
especially in vision tasks like object detection. We analyze the inherent
sparsity in the MLP layers of DETR and introduce two methods to exploit it
without retraining. First, we propose Static Indicator-Based Sparsification
(SIBS), a heuristic method that predicts neuron inactivity based on fixed
activation patterns. While simple, SIBS offers limited gains due to the
input-dependent nature of sparsity. To address this, we introduce Micro-Gated
Sparsification (MGS), a lightweight gating mechanism trained on top of a
pretrained DETR. MGS predicts dynamic sparsity using a small linear layer and
achieves up to 85 to 95% activation sparsity. Experiments on the COCO dataset
show that MGS maintains or even improves performance while significantly
reducing computation. Our method offers a practical, input-adaptive approach to
sparsification, enabling efficient deployment of pretrained vision transformers
without full model retraining.

### [231] [Mono4DEditor: Text-Driven 4D Scene Editing from Monocular Video via Point-Level Localization of Language-Embedded Gaussians](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09438)
*Jin-Chuan Shi,Chengye Su,Jiajun Wang,Ariel Shamir,Miao Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Mono4DEditor, a framework for editing 4D scenes from monocular videos using text prompts. It ensures accurate, localized, and semantically precise edits while retaining unedited content integrity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to solve the challenge of semantically precise and localized scene edits in complex, dynamic 4D environments reconstructed from monocular videos, which is difficult but vital for content creation and virtual applications.

Method: Mono4DEditor employs a dynamic representation augmented with quantized CLIP features for semantic querying, a two-stage point-level localization strategy for improved accuracy, and a diffusion-based video editing model with flow and scribble guidance for coherence.

Result: Experiments show that Mono4DEditor performs high-quality text-driven edits with better flexibility, visual fidelity, and preservation of unedited areas' integrity than prior methods.

Conclusion: Mono4DEditor sets a new standard in text-driven 4D scene editing by achieving localized, high-quality edits while maintaining spatial fidelity and temporal coherence, outperforming existing methods.

Abstract: Editing 4D scenes reconstructed from monocular videos based on text prompts
is a valuable yet challenging task with broad applications in content creation
and virtual environments. The key difficulty lies in achieving semantically
precise edits in localized regions of complex, dynamic scenes, while preserving
the integrity of unedited content. To address this, we introduce Mono4DEditor,
a novel framework for flexible and accurate text-driven 4D scene editing. Our
method augments 3D Gaussians with quantized CLIP features to form a
language-embedded dynamic representation, enabling efficient semantic querying
of arbitrary spatial regions. We further propose a two-stage point-level
localization strategy that first selects candidate Gaussians via CLIP
similarity and then refines their spatial extent to improve accuracy. Finally,
targeted edits are performed on localized regions using a diffusion-based video
editing model, with flow and scribble guidance ensuring spatial fidelity and
temporal coherence. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Mono4DEditor enables
high-quality, text-driven edits across diverse scenes and object types, while
preserving the appearance and geometry of unedited areas and surpassing prior
approaches in both flexibility and visual fidelity.

### [232] [Dynamic Weight-based Temporal Aggregation for Low-light Video Enhancement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09450)
*Ruirui Lin,Guoxi Huang,Nantheera Anantrasirichai*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces DWTA-Net, a two-stage framework for enhancing low-light videos by leveraging short- and long-term temporal information. It effectively reduces noise and improves visual quality compared to current methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods struggle to address heavy noise in real low-light video scenarios due to a lack of effective utilization of temporal information during enhancement.

Method: DWTA-Net consists of two stages: Stage I employs Visual State-Space blocks for multi-frame alignment and recovery of brightness and structure. Stage II uses a recurrent refinement module with dynamic weight-based temporal aggregation to balance static and dynamic regions, guided by optical flow.

Result: The DWTA-Net framework demonstrated significantly improved suppression of noise and artifacts, revealing superior visual quality in low-light video enhancement experiments.

Conclusion: DWTA-Net enhances low-light videos by effectively leveraging both short- and long-term temporal cues, outperforming state-of-the-art methods in terms of reducing noise and improving video fidelity.

Abstract: Low-light video enhancement (LLVE) is challenging due to noise, low contrast,
and color degradations. Learning-based approaches offer fast inference but
still struggle with heavy noise in real low-light scenes, primarily due to
limitations in effectively leveraging temporal information. In this paper, we
address this issue with DWTA-Net, a novel two-stage framework that jointly
exploits short- and long-term temporal cues. Stage I employs Visual State-Space
blocks for multi-frame alignment, recovering brightness, color, and structure
with local consistency. Stage II introduces a recurrent refinement module with
dynamic weight-based temporal aggregation guided by optical flow, adaptively
balancing static and dynamic regions. A texture-adaptive loss further preserves
fine details while promoting smoothness in flat areas. Experiments on
real-world low-light videos show that DWTA-Net effectively suppresses noise and
artifacts, delivering superior visual quality compared with state-of-the-art
methods.

### [233] [D-TPT: Dimensional Entropy Maximization for Calibrating Test-Time Prompt Tuning in Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09473)
*Jisu Han,Wonjun Hwang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a method to improve the test-time adaptability and reliability of vision-language models (VLMs) by addressing the modality gap and dominant feature dimensions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance the performance and adaptability of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) under domain shifts and improve their calibration error, especially in real-world scenarios.

Method: The authors propose a dimensional entropy maximization technique that regularizes textual feature distributions to mitigate the influence of dominant dimensions, improving calibration during test-time prompt tuning.

Result: The proposed method, dimensional entropy maximization, successfully reduces the calibration errors and enhances the test-time prompt-tuning reliability of VLMs.

Conclusion: Mitigating the impact of dominant dimensions in vision and text modalities strengthens the adaptability and reliability of VLMs, enabling better real-world performance.

Abstract: Test-time adaptation paradigm provides flexibility towards domain shifts by
performing immediate adaptation on unlabeled target data from the source model.
Vision-Language Models (VLMs) leverage their generalization capabilities for
diverse downstream tasks, and test-time prompt tuning has emerged as a
prominent solution for adapting VLMs. In this work, we explore contrastive VLMs
and identify the modality gap caused by a single dominant feature dimension
across modalities. We observe that the dominant dimensions in both text and
image modalities exhibit high predictive sensitivity, and that constraining
their influence can improve calibration error. Building on this insight, we
propose dimensional entropy maximization that regularizes the distribution of
textual features toward uniformity to mitigate the dependency of dominant
dimensions. Our method alleviates the degradation of calibration performance in
test-time prompt tuning, offering a simple yet effective solution to enhance
the reliability of VLMs in real-world deployment scenarios.

*Ruben Pascual,Mikel Sesma-Sara,Aranzazu Jurio,Daniel Paternain,Mikel Galar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper presents a method to generate unlimited novel characters in animation and gaming while preserving artistic style using AI.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the limitation of automated generation of diverse characters in creative industries without losing artistic consistency.

Method: The authors use DreamBooth's fine-tuning applied with a multi-token strategy, clustering, LoRA-based techniques, and random tokens to enhance character style creation.

Result: The method is tested on five datasets and shows effectiveness in creating visually diverse yet aesthetically consistent characters validated by human evaluation studies.

Conclusion: The proposed method demonstrates potential in advancing creativity in audiovisual domains by enabling diverse character creation that retains artistic traits.

Abstract: The audiovisual industry is undergoing a profound transformation as it is
integrating AI developments not only to automate routine tasks but also to
inspire new forms of art. This paper addresses the problem of producing a
virtually unlimited number of novel characters that preserve the artistic style
and shared visual traits of a small set of human-designed reference characters,
thus broadening creative possibilities in animation, gaming, and related
domains. Our solution builds upon DreamBooth, a well-established fine-tuning
technique for text-to-image diffusion models, and adapts it to tackle two core
challenges: capturing intricate character details beyond textual prompts and
the few-shot nature of the training data. To achieve this, we propose a
multi-token strategy, using clustering to assign separate tokens to individual
characters and their collective style, combined with LoRA-based
parameter-efficient fine-tuning. By removing the class-specific regularization
set and introducing random tokens and embeddings during generation, our
approach allows for unlimited character creation while preserving the learned
style. We evaluate our method on five small specialized datasets, comparing it
to relevant baselines using both quantitative metrics and a human evaluation
study. Our results demonstrate that our approach produces high-quality, diverse
characters while preserving the distinctive aesthetic features of the reference
characters, with human evaluation further reinforcing its effectiveness and
highlighting the potential of our method.

### [235] [A methodology for clinically driven interactive segmentation evaluation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09499)
*Parhom Esmaeili,Virginia Fernandez,Pedro Borges,Eli Gibson,Sebastien Ourselin,M. Jorge Cardoso*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper addresses the lack of robust evaluation standards in interactive segmentation for volumetric medical imaging and proposes a clinically grounded framework for defining tasks and metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To establish fair comparison and realistic real-world performance evaluation in the domain of interactive segmentation for medical imaging, which currently suffers from inconsistent and clinically unrealistic standards.

Method: Proposed a clinically grounded evaluation methodology and developed a software framework to create standardized evaluation pipelines. Used this to conduct experiments on state-of-the-art algorithms for various complex segmentation tasks.

Result: Identified that minimizing information loss in user interactions, adaptive zooming, and alignment between training and validation prompting improve robustness. Also, 2D methods are suited for simpler tasks while 3D methods handle complex targets better. Non-medical models struggle with low contrast and complex shapes.

Conclusion: Adopting clinically relevant evaluation methodologies can better reflect real-world performance and improve algorithm design for interactive segmentation in medical imaging.

Abstract: Interactive segmentation is a promising strategy for building robust,
generalisable algorithms for volumetric medical image segmentation. However,
inconsistent and clinically unrealistic evaluation hinders fair comparison and
misrepresents real-world performance. We propose a clinically grounded
methodology for defining evaluation tasks and metrics, and built a software
framework for constructing standardised evaluation pipelines. We evaluate
state-of-the-art algorithms across heterogeneous and complex tasks and observe
that (i) minimising information loss when processing user interactions is
critical for model robustness, (ii) adaptive-zooming mechanisms boost
robustness and speed convergence, (iii) performance drops if validation
prompting behaviour/budgets differ from training, (iv) 2D methods perform well
with slab-like images and coarse targets, but 3D context helps with large or
irregularly shaped targets, (v) performance of non-medical-domain models (e.g.
SAM2) degrades with poor contrast and complex shapes.

*David V√°zquez-Pad√≠n,Fernando P√©rez-Gonz√°lez,Alejandro Mart√≠n-Del-R√≠o*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper explores diagonal artifacts in images from Samsung smartphones and their effects on PRNU-based camera source verification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges posed by fingerprint collisions in PRNU verification due to diagonal artifacts present in images captured by Samsung smartphones.

Method: The study involves analyzing images from Galaxy S and A series, investigating the artifacts' impact, and assessing feasibility of using raw PRO mode images for PRNU verification.

Result: The paper finds that certain Galaxy S models share a common artifact pattern, which also affects some Galaxy A models. However, using raw image capture in PRO mode allows reliable PRNU verification, but this is not an option for mid-range models without access to raw images.

Conclusion: Diagonal artifacts pose challenges for PRNU verification but offer potential forensic applications like reducing misdetections in HDR images and identifying synthetic edits in portrait-mode images.

Abstract: We investigate diagonal artifacts present in images captured by several
Samsung smartphones and their impact on PRNU-based camera source verification.
We first show that certain Galaxy S series models share a common pattern
causing fingerprint collisions, with a similar issue also found in some Galaxy
A models. Next, we demonstrate that reliable PRNU verification remains feasible
for devices supporting PRO mode with raw capture, since raw images bypass the
processing pipeline that introduces artifacts. This option, however, is not
available for the mid-range A series models or in forensic cases without access
to raw images. Finally, we outline potential forensic applications of the
diagonal artifacts, such as reducing misdetections in HDR images and localizing
regions affected by synthetic bokeh in portrait-mode images.

### [237] [PRNet: Original Information Is All You Have](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09531)
*PeiHuang Zheng,Yunlong Zhao,Zheng Cui,Yang Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PRNet is a real-time framework for improved small object detection in aerial images, addressing severe information loss in current FPN-based methods by preserving shallow spatial features and enhancing spatial-semantic alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the problem of severe information degradation in small object detection within aerial images, particularly the limitations in spatial-semantic alignment and feature preservation.

Method: Introduce PRNet, which includes the Progressive Refinement Neck (PRN) for spatial-semantic alignment and Enhanced SliceSamp (ESSamp) for optimized downsampling and feature preservation.

Result: PRNet outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods on VisDrone, AI-TOD, and UAVDT datasets, achieving enhanced accuracy while maintaining computational efficiency.

Conclusion: PRNet successfully prioritizes and leverages shallow spatial features to significantly improve small object detection in aerial imagery, offering a better trade-off between accuracy and efficiency.

Abstract: Small object detection in aerial images suffers from severe information
degradation during feature extraction due to limited pixel representations,
where shallow spatial details fail to align effectively with semantic
information, leading to frequent misses and false positives. Existing FPN-based
methods attempt to mitigate these losses through post-processing enhancements,
but the reconstructed details often deviate from the original image
information, impeding their fusion with semantic content. To address this
limitation, we propose PRNet, a real-time detection framework that prioritizes
the preservation and efficient utilization of primitive shallow spatial
features to enhance small object representations. PRNet achieves this via two
modules:the Progressive Refinement Neck (PRN) for spatial-semantic alignment
through backbone reuse and iterative refinement, and the Enhanced SliceSamp
(ESSamp) for preserving shallow information during downsampling via optimized
rearrangement and convolution. Extensive experiments on the VisDrone, AI-TOD,
and UAVDT datasets demonstrate that PRNet outperforms state-of-the-art methods
under comparable computational constraints, achieving superior
accuracy-efficiency trade-offs.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FLOWING proposes a new framework for morphing tasks using differential vector flow encoded into neural network architectures, enabling stable and structure-preserving transformations in both 2D and 3D applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard MLPs struggle with extracting coherent and accurate morphings due to costly regularizations, unstable training, and ineffective feature alignment.

Method: They introduce FLOWING, which constructs differential vector flows for morphing by encoding structural flow properties within the network architectures, ensuring continuity, invertibility, and temporal coherence.

Result: The framework delivers state-of-the-art morphing quality across multiple applications, achieves faster convergence, and demonstrates accurate and structure-preserving transformations.

Conclusion: FLOWING effectively addresses morphing challenges, providing a stable and scalable solution for diverse applications like image and shape morphing, supported by its open-source code and pretrained models.

Abstract: Morphing is a long-standing problem in vision and computer graphics,
requiring a time-dependent warping for feature alignment and a blending for
smooth interpolation. Recently, multilayer perceptrons (MLPs) have been
explored as implicit neural representations (INRs) for modeling such
deformations, due to their meshlessness and differentiability; however,
extracting coherent and accurate morphings from standard MLPs typically relies
on costly regularizations, which often lead to unstable training and prevent
effective feature alignment. To overcome these limitations, we propose FLOWING
(FLOW morphING), a framework that recasts warping as the construction of a
differential vector flow, naturally ensuring continuity, invertibility, and
temporal coherence by encoding structural flow properties directly into the
network architectures. This flow-centric approach yields principled and stable
transformations, enabling accurate and structure-preserving morphing of both 2D
images and 3D shapes. Extensive experiments across a range of applications -
including face and image morphing, as well as Gaussian Splatting morphing -
show that FLOWING achieves state-of-the-art morphing quality with faster
convergence. Code and pretrained models are available at

*Minkyoung Cho,Ruben Ohana,Christian Jacobsen,Adityan Jothi,Min-Hung Chen,Z. Morley Mao,Ethem Can*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TC-LoRA introduces a new way to improve controllable diffusion models by dynamically adjusting model weights during the generation process, enhancing fidelity and adherence to conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current diffusion models use static conditioning strategies, limiting the ability to adapt to the dynamic generations from rough structures to finer details.

Method: TC-LoRA employs a hypernetwork to dynamically create LoRA adapters that modify the model‚Äôs weights at each diffusion step based on time and user conditions.

Result: Experiments show that TC-LoRA improves generative fidelity and better adheres to spatial conditions compared to traditional static methods.

Conclusion: Dynamic, weight-based conditional strategies like TC-LoRA provide a promising alternative to static methods, enabling more effective and adaptable generative processes.

Abstract: Current controllable diffusion models typically rely on fixed architectures
that modify intermediate activations to inject guidance conditioned on a new
modality. This approach uses a static conditioning strategy for a dynamic,
multi-stage denoising process, limiting the model's ability to adapt its
response as the generation evolves from coarse structure to fine detail. We
introduce TC-LoRA (Temporally Modulated Conditional LoRA), a new paradigm that
enables dynamic, context-aware control by conditioning the model's weights
directly. Our framework uses a hypernetwork to generate LoRA adapters
on-the-fly, tailoring weight modifications for the frozen backbone at each
diffusion step based on time and the user's condition. This mechanism enables
the model to learn and execute an explicit, adaptive strategy for applying
conditional guidance throughout the entire generation process. Through
experiments on various data domains, we demonstrate that this dynamic,
parametric control significantly enhances generative fidelity and adherence to
spatial conditions compared to static, activation-based methods. TC-LoRA
establishes an alternative approach in which the model's conditioning strategy
is modified through a deeper functional adaptation of its weights, allowing
control to align with the dynamic demands of the task and generative stage.

*Shubham Trehan,Udhav Ramachandran,Akash Rao,Ruth Scimeca,Sathyanarayanan N. Aakur*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces FSP-DETR, a unified framework for robust few-shot and open-set object detection in biomedical settings using a class-agnostic backbone and prototype-based embedding space.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The scarcity of labeled data and emergence of novel categories hinder object detection performance in biomedical applications.

Method: FSP-DETR uses a class-agnostic DETR backbone, image-based class prototypes, and a transformer decoder, optimized through prototype matching, separation loss, and KL divergence regularization.

Result: Compared to previous methods, FSP-DETR achieves better performance in few-shot and open-set scenarios across multiple biomedical detection tasks.

Conclusion: FSP-DETR emerges as a flexible and effective framework for improving object detection under scarce supervision and supports novel class recognition without retraining.

Abstract: Object detection in biomedical settings is fundamentally constrained by the
scarcity of labeled data and the frequent emergence of novel or rare
categories. We present FSP-DETR, a unified detection framework that enables
robust few-shot detection, open-set recognition, and generalization to unseen
biomedical tasks within a single model. Built upon a class-agnostic DETR
backbone, our approach constructs class prototypes from original support images
and learns an embedding space using augmented views and a lightweight
transformer decoder. Training jointly optimizes a prototype matching loss, an
alignment-based separation loss, and a KL divergence regularization to improve
discriminative feature learning and calibration under scarce supervision.
Unlike prior work that tackles these tasks in isolation, FSP-DETR enables
inference-time flexibility to support unseen class recognition, background
rejection, and cross-task adaptation without retraining. We also introduce a
new ova species detection benchmark with 20 parasite classes and establish
standardized evaluation protocols. Extensive experiments across ova, blood
cell, and malaria detection tasks demonstrate that FSP-DETR significantly
outperforms prior few-shot and prototype-based detectors, especially in
low-shot and open-set scenarios.

TL;DR: The study analyzes research trends across 26,104 papers from major AI conferences (CVPR, ICLR, NeurIPS, 2023‚Äì2025) using topical labels and abstracts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide a transparent and reproducible method for analyzing research trends in AI and computer vision over time.

Method: Titles and abstracts were normalized, phrase-protected, matched to a handcrafted lexicon, assigned labels, and analyzed for fine-grained trends.

Result: Three macro trends identified: rise of multimodal vision-language-LLM work, growth of generative methods, and 3D/video activity focus; training approaches shifting towards instruction tuning and finetuning; venue comparisons reveal varying focus areas.

Conclusion: The work provides a longitudinal overview of evolving research themes and offers tools for auditing and extending analysis despite noted limitations in lexicon recall and abstract-only scope.

Abstract: We present a transparent, reproducible measurement of research trends across
26,104 accepted papers from CVPR, ICLR, and NeurIPS spanning 2023-2025. Titles
and abstracts are normalized, phrase-protected, and matched against a
hand-crafted lexicon to assign up to 35 topical labels and mine fine-grained
cues about tasks, architectures, training regimes, objectives, datasets, and
co-mentioned modalities. The analysis quantifies three macro shifts: (1) a
sharp rise of multimodal vision-language-LLM work, which increasingly reframes
classic perception as instruction following and multi-step reasoning; (2)
steady expansion of generative methods, with diffusion research consolidating
around controllability, distillation, and speed; and (3) resilient 3D and video
activity, with composition moving from NeRFs to Gaussian splatting and a
growing emphasis on human- and agent-centric understanding. Within VLMs,
parameter-efficient adaptation like prompting/adapters/LoRA and lightweight
vision-language bridges dominate; training practice shifts from building
encoders from scratch to instruction tuning and finetuning strong backbones;
contrastive objectives recede relative to cross-entropy/ranking and
distillation. Cross-venue comparisons show CVPR has a stronger 3D footprint and
ICLR the highest VLM share, while reliability themes such as efficiency or
robustness diffuse across areas. We release the lexicon and methodology to
enable auditing and extension. Limitations include lexicon recall and
abstract-only scope, but the longitudinal signals are consistent across venues
and years.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces SpaceVista-1M, a large-scale spatial reasoning dataset with over 1M QA pairs, and SpaceVista-7B, a model tailored for all-scale spatial reasoning. It addresses challenges in spatial reasoning for diverse applications and demonstrates strong generalization across benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is the need for advanced spatial reasoning that overcomes reliance on indoor 3D scans and manual annotations, and addresses the lack of effective all-scale scene modeling for applications like robotics and autonomous driving.

Method: The authors use a structured spatial reasoning knowledge system, scale-aware modeling, and progressive training to build the SpaceVista-7B model. They create SpaceVista-1M, a dataset of 1M spatial QA pairs using an automated pipeline, and construct an all-scale benchmark with manual annotations.

Result: The approach successfully demonstrated competitive results across five benchmarks, including SpaceVista-Bench, showing strong generalization capabilities across different scales and scenarios.

Conclusion: The paper provides a holistic solution to spatial reasoning by integrating innovative datasets, specialized models, and benchmarks, significantly advancing all-scale spatial intelligence. The contributions will be made publicly available for future research.

Abstract: With the current surge in spatial reasoning explorations, researchers have
made significant progress in understanding indoor scenes, but still struggle
with diverse applications such as robotics and autonomous driving. This paper
aims to advance all-scale spatial reasoning across diverse scenarios by
tackling two key challenges: 1) the heavy reliance on indoor 3D scans and
labor-intensive manual annotations for dataset curation; 2) the absence of
effective all-scale scene modeling, which often leads to overfitting to
individual scenes. In this paper, we introduce a holistic solution that
integrates a structured spatial reasoning knowledge system, scale-aware
modeling, and a progressive training paradigm, as the first attempt to broaden
the all-scale spatial intelligence of MLLMs to the best of our knowledge. Using
a task-specific, specialist-driven automated pipeline, we curate over 38K video
scenes across 5 spatial scales to create SpaceVista-1M, a dataset comprising
approximately 1M spatial QA pairs spanning 19 diverse task types. While
specialist models can inject useful domain knowledge, they are not reliable for
evaluation. We then build an all-scale benchmark with precise annotations by
manually recording, retrieving, and assembling video-based data. However, naive
training with SpaceVista-1M often yields suboptimal results due to the
potential knowledge conflict. Accordingly, we introduce SpaceVista-7B, a
spatial reasoning model that accepts dense inputs beyond semantics and uses
scale as an anchor for scale-aware experts and progressive rewards. Finally,
extensive evaluations across 5 benchmarks, including our SpaceVista-Bench,
demonstrate competitive performance, showcasing strong generalization across
all scales and scenarios. Our dataset, model, and benchmark will be released on

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a distillation-based framework to equip vision-language models (VLMs) with action-execution abilities efficiently, outperforming state-of-the-art methods and reducing training costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The costliness of training Vision-Language Action (VLA) models from scratch motivated the need for a more efficient approach to use pretrained vision-language models for robotic manipulation.

Method: A distillation framework with two stages: lightweight alignment of VLM hidden states with pretrained action models' action space, followed by fine-tuning of select components (language model, state encoder, and action modules). The architecture integrates a state encoder and an action token into the original VLM structure.

Result: The method achieved significantly higher success rates in benchmarks (97.3% on LIBERO and 93.5% on LIBERO-LONG) and improved real-world manipulation task performance with an 82.0% success rate, outperforming teacher models and saving training costs.

Conclusion: Action distillation effectively equips VLMs with precise action generation capability and enhances their manipulation performance, offering substantial efficiency and accuracy gains compared to previous methods.

Abstract: Vision-Language Action (VLA) models significantly advance robotic
manipulation by leveraging the strong perception capabilities of pretrained
vision-language models (VLMs). By integrating action modules into these
pretrained models, VLA methods exhibit improved generalization. However,
training them from scratch is costly. In this work, we propose a simple yet
effective distillation-based framework that equips VLMs with action-execution
capability by transferring knowledge from pretrained small action models. Our
architecture retains the original VLM structure, adding only an action token
and a state encoder to incorporate physical inputs. To distill action
knowledge, we adopt a two-stage training strategy. First, we perform
lightweight alignment by mapping VLM hidden states into the action space of the
small action model, enabling effective reuse of its pretrained action decoder
and avoiding expensive pretraining. Second, we selectively fine-tune the
language model, state encoder, and action modules, enabling the system to
integrate multimodal inputs with precise action generation. Specifically, the
action token provides the VLM with a direct handle for predicting future
actions, while the state encoder allows the model to incorporate robot dynamics
not captured by vision alone. This design yields substantial efficiency gains
over training large VLA models from scratch. Compared with previous
state-of-the-art methods, our method achieves 97.3% average success rate on
LIBERO (11.8% improvement) and 93.5% on LIBERO-LONG (24.5% improvement). In
real-world experiments across five manipulation tasks, our method consistently
outperforms the teacher model, achieving 82.0% success rate (17% improvement),
which demonstrate that action distillation effectively enables VLMs to generate
precise actions while substantially reducing training costs.

*Ruyi Xu,Guangxuan Xiao,Yukang Chen,Liuning He,Kelly Peng,Yao Lu,Song Han*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: StreamingVLM addresses real-time understanding challenges in infinite video streams using a compact inference framework, outperforming baseline models in both performance and latency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper tackles the issue of real-time visual-linguistic understanding in infinite video streams, aiming to overcome computational inefficiencies and latency problems.

Method: StreamingVLM employs a supervised fine-tuning strategy to replicate inference-time attention patterns, with an efficient KV cache system storing attention sinks, vision tokens, and text tokens.

Result: StreamingVLM demonstrated 66.18% win rate against GPT-4O mini on Inf-Streams-Eval, maintained stable performance at up to 8 FPS on NVIDIA H100, and improved general VQA metrics.

Conclusion: The framework shows significant promise for real-time visual-linguistic applications by aligning training with streaming inference, ensuring efficiency and broad applicability.

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) could power real-time assistants and autonomous
agents, but they face a critical challenge: understanding near-infinite video
streams without escalating latency and memory usage. Processing entire videos
with full attention leads to quadratic computational costs and poor performance
on long videos. Meanwhile, simple sliding window methods are also flawed, as
they either break coherence or suffer from high latency due to redundant
recomputation. In this paper, we introduce StreamingVLM, a model designed for
real-time, stable understanding of infinite visual input. Our approach is a
unified framework that aligns training with streaming inference. During
inference, we maintain a compact KV cache by reusing states of attention sinks,
a short window of recent vision tokens, and a long window of recent text
tokens. This streaming ability is instilled via a simple supervised fine-tuning
(SFT) strategy that applies full attention on short, overlapped video chunks,
which effectively mimics the inference-time attention pattern without training
on prohibitively long contexts. For evaluation, we build Inf-Streams-Eval, a
new benchmark with videos averaging over two hours that requires dense,
per-second alignment between frames and text. On Inf-Streams-Eval, StreamingVLM
achieves a 66.18% win rate against GPT-4O mini and maintains stable, real-time
performance at up to 8 FPS on a single NVIDIA H100. Notably, our SFT strategy
also enhances general VQA abilities without any VQA-specific fine-tuning,
improving performance on LongVideoBench by +4.30 and OVOBench Realtime by
+5.96. Code is available at https://github.com/mit-han-lab/streaming-vlm.

*Molang Wu,Zhao Zhang*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: Maple is a multi-agent system crafted to generate error-free DL command lines using natural language inputs, addressing challenges in heterogeneous GPU cluster environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Researchers face difficulties composing error-free DL command lines due to heterogeneous launchers, schedulers, and GPU affinity options, which impacts productivity and resource utilization.

Method: Maple utilizes four agents for information extraction, template retrieval, command line verification, and error correction, relying on multiple language models with a combined size of 10B parameters.

Result: Maple achieves 92% accuracy in generating command lines across 567 test cases, evaluated on nine GPU clusters, diverse DL models, and varied schedulers like SLURM and PBS.

Conclusion: Maple demonstrates practical value in facilitating distributed DL training across heterogeneous HPC systems, comparable to state-of-the-art NLP models GPT-5, Claude, and Gemini.

Abstract: Training deep learning (DL) models across Graphics Processing Unit (GPU)
clusters is technically challenging. One aspect is that users have to compose
command lines to adapt to the heterogeneous launchers, schedulers, affinity
options, DL framework arguments, and environment variables. Composing correct
command lines is error-prone and can easily frustrate users, impeding research
or wasting resources. In this work, we present Maple, a multi-agent system that
generates correct DL command lines with users' natural language input. Maple
consists of four agents with the functionalities of information extraction,
template retrieval, command line verification, and error correction. We
evaluate Maple on nine GPU clusters across national computing centers in the
U.S., five representative deep learning model families, and four commonly used
parallel DL training paradigms. Our experiments also cover schedulers of SLURM
and PBS and heterogeneous architectures, such as NVIDIA A100/H200 GPUs and
Intel Max series GPUs. Maple achieves 92.0% accuracy in generating command
lines across the 567 test cases. Leverage multiple language models with an
aggregated size of 10B parameters, Maple delivers comparable performance to the
state-of-the-art models of GPT-5, Claude, and Gemini. Together, these results
highlight Maple's practical value in enabling portable and scalable distributed
DL across heterogeneous HPC environments.

*Benjamin Brock,Renato Golin*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: This paper introduces a universal one-sided algorithm for distributed matrix multiplication, addressing the limitations of current algorithms concerning partitioning availability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing matrix multiplication algorithms often require specific partitionings, and the absence of suitable implementations can lead to increased communication costs.

Method: The algorithm utilizes slicing (index arithmetic) to compute overlapping tiles for multiplication, which can then be reordered and optimized using a C++ PGAS framework with GPU-to-GPU communication.

Result: The algorithm performs competitively compared to PyTorch DTensor across various partitioning and replication factors.

Conclusion: A universal approach to distributed matrix multiplication is feasible, covering all partitioning and replication combinations, while delivering competitive performance with optimized existing libraries.

Abstract: Many important applications across science, data analytics, and AI workloads
depend on distributed matrix multiplication. Prior work has developed a large
array of algorithms suitable for different problem sizes and partitionings
including 1D, 2D, 1.5D, and 2.5D algorithms. A limitation of current work is
that existing algorithms are limited to a subset of partitionings. Multiple
algorithm implementations are required to support the full space of possible
partitionings. If no algorithm implementation is available for a particular set
of partitionings, one or more operands must be redistributed, increasing
communication costs. This paper presents a universal one-sided algorithm for
distributed matrix multiplication that supports all combinations of
partitionings and replication factors. Our algorithm uses slicing (index
arithmetic) to compute the sets of overlapping tiles that must be multiplied
together. This list of local matrix multiplies can then either be executed
directly, or reordered and lowered to an optimized IR to maximize overlap. We
implement our algorithm using a high-level C++-based PGAS programming framework
that performs direct GPU-to-GPU communication using intra-node interconnects.
We evaluate performance for a wide variety of partitionings and replication
factors, finding that our work is competitive with PyTorch DTensor, a highly
optimized distributed tensor library targeting AI models.

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: The paper introduces a hardware-software codesigned lightweight MPC controller that reduces latency and energy use for controlling many-core HPC processors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Managing energy and thermal profiles in modern HPC processors with hundreds of application-class processing elements is complex, particularly when considering computational and memory demands for real-time control.

Method: The paper proposes a lightweight MPC controller implemented via hardware-software codesign, utilizing an operator-splitting quadratic programming solver and a multi-core RISC-V controller, complemented with thermal coupling pruning and ahead-of-time parallel scheduling optimization techniques.

Result: The controller achieved sub-millisecond latency for 144 processing elements at 500 MHz, delivering 33 times lower latency and 7.9 times higher energy efficiency compared to baseline setups, while consuming <1 MiB memory and 325 mW area overhead.

Conclusion: This work demonstrates that lightweight hardware-software codesigned MPC controllers can significantly enhance both performance and energy efficiency in many-core HPC processors without a substantial hardware footprint.

Abstract: Managing energy and thermal profiles is critical for many-core HPC processors
with hundreds of application-class processing elements (PEs). Advanced model
predictive control (MPC) delivers state-of-the-art performance but requires
solving an online optimization problem over a thousand times per second (1 kHz
control bandwidth), with computational and memory demands scaling with PE
count. Traditional MPC approaches execute the controller on the PEs, but
operating system overheads create jitter and limit control bandwidth. Running
MPC on dedicated on-chip controllers enables fast, deterministic control but
raises concerns about area and power overhead. In this work, we tackle these
challenges by proposing a hardware-software codesign of a lightweight MPC
controller, based on an operator-splitting quadratic programming solver and an
embedded multi-core RISC-V controller. Key innovations include pruning weak
thermal couplings to reduce model memory and ahead-of-time scheduling for
efficient parallel execution of sparse triangular systems arising from the
optimization problem. The proposed controller achieves sub-millisecond latency
when controlling 144 PEs at 500 MHz, delivering 33x lower latency and 7.9x
higher energy efficiency than a single-core baseline. Operating within a
compact less than 1 MiB memory footprint, it consumes as little as 325 mW while
occupying less than 1.5% of a typical HPC processor's die area.

### [248] [Energy-Driven Steering: Reducing False Refusals in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08646)
*Eric Hanchen Jiang,Weixuan Ou,Run Liu,Shengyuan Pang,Guancheng Wan,Ranjie Duan,Wei Dong,Kai-Wei Chang,XiaoFeng Wang,Ying Nian Wu,Xinfeng Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes Energy-Driven Steering (EDS), a novel technique to reduce over-cautiousness in large language models, balancing safety and false refusal rates using a lightweight Energy-Based Model without modifying the LLM‚Äôs core weights.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the issue where current alignment methods make LLMs over-cautious, causing them to reject benign prompts unnecessarily, while aiming to improve both safety and compliance simultaneously.

Method: The paper introduces EDS, which employs an external Energy-Based Model trained to classify energy levels of states (desirable vs. undesirable). During inference, it dynamically steers the LLM's hidden states to desirable energy regions by using gradients, avoiding the need for model fine-tuning.

Result: Experiments across various benchmarks demonstrate EDS significantly reduces false refusal rates while maintaining safety standards, such as improving compliance rates on ORB-H benchmark from 57.3% to 82.6%.

Conclusion: EDS provides an effective paradigm to dynamically steer LLMs for improved safety without compromising their ability to respond to benign prompts, creating balanced and practical alignment methods for real-world applications.

Abstract: Safety alignment of large language models (LLMs) faces a key challenge:
current alignment techniques often only focus on improving safety against
harmful prompts, causing LLMs to become over-cautious and refuse to respond to
benign prompts. Therefore, a key objective of safe alignment is to enhance
safety while simultaneously reducing false refusals. In this paper, we
introduce Energy-Driven Steering (EDS), a novel, fine-tuning free framework
designed to resolve this challenge through dynamic, inference-time
intervention. We trained a lightweight, external Energy-Based Model (EBM) to
assign high energy to undesirable (false refusal or jailbreak) states and low
energy to desirable (helpful response or safe reject) ones. During inference,
EBM maps the LLM's internal activations to an "energy landscape". We use the
gradient of the energy function to dynamically steer the LLM's hidden states to
low energy regions, correcting the model to generate a desirable response in
real-time without modifying its weights. This method decouples behavioral
control from the model's core knowledge, offering a flexible solution with
minimal computational overhead. Extensive experiments across a wide range of
models show our method successfully achieves this objective: it substantially
lowers false refusal rates. For example, raising compliance on the ORB-H
benchmark from 57.3% to 82.6% while maintaining the baseline safety
performance. Our work presents an effective paradigm for building LLMs that
achieve both low false refusal rates and high safety.

*Edward Y. Chang,Ethan Y. Chang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces WILSON, a post-hoc diagnostic suite designed to detect and address failures in large language models (LLMs) caused by sensitivity to reordering or small perturbations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs exhibit sensitivity to harmless changes, such as reordering of passages, which can lead to undesired variances in their behavior, affecting safety, reliability, and efficiency.

Method: WILSON uses a minimal diagnostic approach combining an inverse-free curvature map and activation-level commutators to detect susceptibility to reordering effects. It outputs model-agnostic metrics for decision-making.

Result: WILSON effectively identifies and signals potential reliability issues related to order effects, fine-tuning regressions, multi-turn context stability, and deployment configurations without modifying model architecture or training processes.

Conclusion: WILSON allows teams to anticipate and mitigate model failures, enabling improved reliability and throughput without compromising safety or requiring extensive retraining.

Abstract: Large language models can change answers under harmless edits that matter in
practice: RAG outputs flip when passages are reordered, fine-tuning erodes
invariances learned at pretraining, debate or chain-of-thought prompts take
path-dependent routes, and compiler fusion or reordering perturbs logits near
decision boundaries. These failures violate intended invariances, break
continuous integration, and force teams to trade safety for speed. The effects
are small yet distributed across layers and positions, sensitive to context
length and evaluation order, and costly to repair with retraining or formal
verification. We present WILSON, a minimal post-hoc diagnostic suite that
converts simple loop and reordering checks on internal representations into
system signals. WILSON combines an inverse-free curvature map over positions
and layers, computed with JVPs and Hutchinson probes, with activation-level
commutators that flag reorder risk. Signals are cheap to compute,
model-agnostic for standard Transformers, and exported as thresholds and CSV
artifacts for orchestrators. This enables concrete actions: guard RAG against
order effects, catch fine-tuning regressions, stabilize debate pathways and
long multi-turn contexts, and gate fusions or reorders in deployment. In short,
WILSON helps anticipate failures and approve safe optimizations so reliability
and throughput can improve together without changing model architecture or
training.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: RareNet, a Graph Neural Network, uses patient phenotypes alone to predict causal genes for rare genetic diseases, offering enhanced diagnostic capability and accessibility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for diagnosing rare genetic diseases face challenges like limited data, lack of genome sequencing, and numerous causative genes, especially affecting resource-limited settings.

Method: RareNet employs subgraph-based Graph Neural Networks to analyze phenotypic data, predicting causal genes and providing subgraphs for clinical investigation. It integrates with other prioritization methods for improved results.

Result: RareNet demonstrated competitive causal gene prediction and improved the performance of other frameworks across two biomedical datasets.

Conclusion: By leveraging only phenotypic data, RareNet democratizes rare disease diagnostics, especially aiding populations without genomic infrastructure.

Abstract: Rare genetic disease diagnosis faces critical challenges: insufficient
patient data, inaccessible full genome sequencing, and the immense number of
possible causative genes. These limitations cause prolonged diagnostic
journeys, inappropriate treatments, and critical delays, disproportionately
affecting patients in resource-limited settings where diagnostic tools are
scarce. We propose RareNet, a subgraph-based Graph Neural Network that requires
only patient phenotypes to identify the most likely causal gene and retrieve
focused patient subgraphs for targeted clinical investigation. RareNet can
function as a standalone method or serve as a pre-processing or post-processing
filter for other candidate gene prioritization methods, consistently enhancing
their performance while potentially enabling explainable insights. Through
comprehensive evaluation on two biomedical datasets, we demonstrate competitive
and robust causal gene prediction and significant performance gains when
integrated with other frameworks. By requiring only phenotypic data, which is
readily available in any clinical setting, RareNet democratizes access to
sophisticated genetic analysis, offering particular value for underserved
populations lacking advanced genomic infrastructure.

*Zipo Jibao,Yingyi Fu,Xinyang Chen,Guoting Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces two novel methods‚ÄîLearning Distribution (LD) and Learning Conditional Distribution (LCD)‚Äîto address inner-instance distribution shifts in non-stationary time series data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Non-stationarity in time series leads to distribution shifts, negatively affecting forecasting model performance. Existing normalization methods fail to address shifts within individual instances.

Method: LD fits internal distributions of input/output at different time steps using separate parameters, and LCD employs neural networks to predict scaling coefficients dynamically.

Result: Empirical evaluation with various backbone models on benchmark datasets indicates the proposed methods outperform existing techniques for time series forecasting.

Conclusion: The point-level paradigm provides an effective approach to address inner-instance distribution shifts, enhancing forecasting performance in non-stationary environments.

Abstract: Real-world time series are influenced by numerous factors and exhibit complex
non-stationary characteristics. Non-stationarity can lead to distribution
shifts, where the statistical properties of time series change over time,
negatively impacting model performance. Several instance normalization
techniques have been proposed to address distribution shifts in time series
forecasting. However, existing methods fail to account for shifts within
individual instances, leading to suboptimal performance. To tackle
inner-instance distribution shifts, we propose two novel point-level methods:
Learning Distribution (LD) and Learning Conditional Distribution (LCD). LD
eliminates internal discrepancies by fitting the internal distribution of input
and output with different parameters at different time steps, while LCD
utilizes neural networks to predict scaling coefficients of the output. We
evaluate the performance of the two methods with various backbone models across
public benchmarks and demonstrate the effectiveness of the point-level paradigm
through comparative experiments.

TL;DR: This paper introduces LeFCert, the first provably robust few-shot classifier tailored for language-empowered foundation models (LeFMs), ensuring robustness against poisoning attacks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the vulnerability of language-empowered foundation models (LeFMs) to poisoning attacks during few-shot learning and the lack of formal defenses with provable guarantees.

Method: LeFCert employs a novel adaptive blending of textual and feature embeddings, a twofold trimmed mean prototype, and variants using randomized smoothing and collective certification under dual attack budget constraints.

Result: LeFCert significantly outperforms existing baselines with higher clean and certified accuracy, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance against poisoning attacks.

Conclusion: LeFCert provides practical, computationally efficient, and provably robust defenses for few-shot classifiers based on LeFMs, offering reliability in adversarial environments.

Abstract: Language-empowered foundation models (LeFMs), such as CLIP and GraphCLIP,
have transformed multimodal learning by aligning visual (or graph) features
with textual representations, enabling powerful downstream capabilities like
few-shot learning. However, the reliance on small, task-specific support
datasets collected in open environments exposes these models to poisoning
attacks, where adversaries manipulate the support samples to degrade
performance. Existing defenses rely on empirical strategies, which lack formal
guarantees and remain vulnerable to unseen and adaptive attacks. Certified
robustness offers provable guarantees but has been largely unexplored for
few-shot classifiers based on LeFMs. This study seeks to fill these critical
gaps by proposing the first provably robust few-shot classifier that is
tailored for LeFMs. We term our model Language-empowered Few-shot Certification
(\textbf{LeFCert}). It integrates both textual and feature embeddings with an
adaptive blending mechanism. To achieve provable robustness, we propose a
twofold trimmed mean prototype and derive provable upper and lower bounds for
classification scores, enabling certification under worst-case poisoning
scenarios. To further enhance the performance, we extend LeFCert with two
variants by considering a more realistic and tighter attack budget: LeFCert-L
incorporates randomized smoothing to provide Lipschitz continuity and derive
robustness under dual budget constraints, and LeFCert-C provides collective
certification for scenarios where attackers distribute a shared poisoning
budget across multiple samples. Experiments demonstrate that LeFCert achieves
state-of-the-art performance, significantly improving both clean and certified
accuracy compared to existing baselines. Despite its advanced robustness
mechanisms, LeFCert is computationally efficient, making it practical for
real-world applications.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a reinforcement learning-based framework for reliable real-time 3D reconstruction in edge environments while addressing disruptions in resources.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Ensure timely and accurate 3D modeling for critical applications like fire rescue, despite challenges in dynamic edge resource availability.

Method: Introduced two cooperative Q-learning agents for camera and server selection, operating online within a distributed testbed emulating smart city disruptions.

Result: The reinforcement learning framework improved reliability by balancing latency and reconstruction quality in dynamic edge scenarios.

Conclusion: The framework is effective for real-time 3D reconstruction by mitigating disruptions, ensuring high-quality modeling within constrained environments.

Abstract: Real-time multi-view 3D reconstruction is a mission-critical application for
key edge-native use cases, such as fire rescue, where timely and accurate 3D
scene modeling enables situational awareness and informed decision-making.
However, the dynamic and unpredictable nature of edge resource availability
introduces disruptions, such as degraded image quality, unstable network links,
and fluctuating server loads, which challenge the reliability of the
reconstruction pipeline. In this work, we present a reinforcement learning
(RL)-based edge resource management framework for reliable 3D reconstruction to
ensure high quality reconstruction within a reasonable amount of time, despite
the system operating under a resource-constrained and disruption-prone
environment. In particular, the framework adopts two cooperative Q-learning
agents, one for camera selection and one for server selection, both of which
operate entirely online, learning policies through interactions with the edge
environment. To support learning under realistic constraints and evaluate
system performance, we implement a distributed testbed comprising lab-hosted
end devices and FABRIC infrastructure-hosted edge servers to emulate smart city
edge infrastructure under realistic disruption scenarios. Results show that the
proposed framework improves application reliability by effectively balancing
end-to-end latency and reconstruction quality in dynamic environments.

*Kiran Smelser,Kaviru Gunaratne,Jacob Miller,Stephen Kobourov*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper addresses the scale sensitivity of normalized stress and KL divergence metrics used in dimensionality reduction techniques, proposing a new scale-invariant approach.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the issue that commonly used visualization metrics (normalized stress and KL divergence) are sensitive to uniform scaling, which can distort evaluations of data projection accuracy.

Method: The paper analytically and empirically investigates the impact of uniform scaling on these metrics and proposes a simple method to make the metrics scale-invariant.

Result: The proposed scale-invariant metrics correctly capture expected behavior on a small benchmark, demonstrating improved robustness.

Conclusion: Scaling sensitivity in quality metrics misrepresents projection accuracy; introducing scale-invariant metrics improves the assessment of dimensionality reduction techniques.

Abstract: Complex, high-dimensional data is ubiquitous across many scientific
disciplines, including machine learning, biology, and the social sciences. One
of the primary methods of visualizing these datasets is with two-dimensional
scatter plots that visually capture some properties of the data. Because
visually determining the accuracy of these plots is challenging, researchers
often use quality metrics to measure the projection's accuracy and faithfulness
to the original data. One of the most commonly employed metrics, normalized
stress, is sensitive to uniform scaling (stretching, shrinking) of the
projection, despite this act not meaningfully changing anything about the
projection. Another quality metric, the Kullback--Leibler (KL) divergence used
in the popular t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE) technique,
is also susceptible to this scale sensitivity. We investigate the effect of
scaling on stress and KL divergence analytically and empirically by showing
just how much the values change and how this affects dimension reduction
technique evaluations. We introduce a simple technique to make both metrics
scale-invariant and show that it accurately captures expected behavior on a
small benchmark.

TL;DR: The paper introduces FedL2T, a personalized federated learning framework for seizure prediction using EEG data, which addresses inter-patient variability and privacy concerns through a novel knowledge distillation approach.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to improve seizure prediction models while addressing challenges like limited labeled EEG data, privacy constraints, and performance variability across clients in federated learning.

Method: FedL2T introduces a personalized federated learning framework that incorporates a two-teacher knowledge distillation strategy to learn from both global and peer models. It uses an adaptive multi-level distillation aligning predictions and feature representations, along with proximal regularization for stability.

Result: FedL2T outperforms existing federated learning methods on two EEG datasets, achieves robust performance under heterogeneous client settings, and requires fewer communication rounds.

Conclusion: The results highlight FedL2T's effectiveness as a privacy-preserving and personalized solution for seizure prediction, offering enhanced model performance and efficiency in healthcare applications.

Abstract: The training of deep learning models in seizure prediction requires large
amounts of Electroencephalogram (EEG) data. However, acquiring sufficient
labeled EEG data is difficult due to annotation costs and privacy constraints.
Federated Learning (FL) enables privacy-preserving collaborative training by
sharing model updates instead of raw data. However, due to the inherent
inter-patient variability in real-world scenarios, existing FL-based seizure
prediction methods struggle to achieve robust performance under heterogeneous
client settings. To address this challenge, we propose FedL2T, a personalized
federated learning framework that leverages a novel two-teacher knowledge
distillation strategy to generate superior personalized models for each client.
Specifically, each client simultaneously learns from a globally aggregated
model and a dynamically assigned peer model, promoting more direct and enriched
knowledge exchange. To ensure reliable knowledge transfer, FedL2T employs an
adaptive multi-level distillation strategy that aligns both prediction outputs
and intermediate feature representations based on task confidence. In addition,
a proximal regularization term is introduced to constrain personalized model
updates, thereby enhancing training stability. Extensive experiments on two EEG
datasets demonstrate that FedL2T consistently outperforms state-of-the-art FL
methods, particularly under low-label conditions. Moreover, FedL2T exhibits
rapid and stable convergence toward optimal performance, thereby reducing the
number of communication rounds and associated overhead. These results
underscore the potential of FedL2T as a reliable and personalized solution for
seizure prediction in privacy-sensitive healthcare scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to improve the performance of linear forecasting models, which have demonstrated competitive results versus complex architectures, by addressing the underexplored area of enhancing these models.

Method: The method involves CATS-Linear, which uses the Classification Auxiliary Channel-Independence (CACI) to dynamically route instances to specific predictors. It also incorporates a redesigned trend-seasonal decomposition architecture with a decoupling-linear mapping-recoupling framework and complex-domain linear projections for handling different components.

Result: CATS-Linear with fixed hyperparameters achieves state-of-the-art accuracy, both in comparison to hyperparameter-tuned baselines and fixed-hyperparameter counterparts, as validated through extensive experiments.

Conclusion: The study concludes that by dynamically routing instances and redesigning decomposition architectures, CATS-Linear significantly enhances the accuracy of linear forecasting models, maintaining competitiveness with complex models.

Abstract: Recent research demonstrates that linear models achieve forecasting
performance competitive with complex architectures, yet methodologies for
enhancing linear models remain underexplored. Motivated by the hypothesis that
distinct time series instances may follow heterogeneous linear mappings, we
propose the Classification Auxiliary Trend-Seasonal Decoupling Linear Model
CATS-Linear, employing Classification Auxiliary Channel-Independence (CACI).
CACI dynamically routes instances to dedicated predictors via classification,
enabling supervised channel design. We further analyze the theoretical expected
risks of different channel settings. Additionally, we redesign the
trend-seasonal decomposition architecture by adding a decoupling -- linear
mapping -- recoupling framework for trend components and complex-domain linear
projections for seasonal components. Extensive experiments validate that
CATS-Linear with fixed hyperparameters achieves state-of-the-art accuracy
comparable to hyperparameter-tuned baselines while delivering SOTA accuracy
against fixed-hyperparameter counterparts.

TL;DR: The paper introduces BioCodec, a representation learning framework for processing biosignals, effectively tokenizing noisy neurophysiological data like EEG for various healthcare and diagnostic tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the challenges of high-dimensional, noisy biosignal data requiring extensive pre-processing and handcrafted feature extraction, and to leverage the power of foundation models for decoding and interpreting these signals.

Method: BioCodec draws inspiration from neural codecs to tokenize biosignal data into discrete, meaningful units, pre-training on thousands of EEG hours and evaluating its performance across multiple downstream tasks like diagnostics and signal decoding.

Result: BioCodec demonstrates efficacy in tasks like clinical diagnosis, sleep physiology, and speech/motor imagery decoding, particularly in resource-limited settings, while showing versatility in processing other biosignals like EMG.

Conclusion: BioCodec provides a competitive and versatile approach for biosignal tokenization, with open-source code and checkpoints, advancing both foundational understanding and practical applications of biosignal processing.

Abstract: Neurophysiological recordings such as electroencephalography (EEG) offer
accessible and minimally invasive means of estimating physiological activity
for applications in healthcare, diagnostic screening, and even immersive
entertainment. However, these recordings yield high-dimensional, noisy
time-series data that typically require extensive pre-processing and
handcrafted feature extraction to reveal meaningful information. Recently,
there has been a surge of interest in applying representation learning
techniques from large pre-trained (foundation) models to effectively decode and
interpret biosignals. We discuss the challenges posed for incorporating such
methods and introduce BioCodec, an alternative representation learning
framework inspired by neural codecs to capture low-level signal characteristics
in the form of discrete tokens. Pre-trained on thousands of EEG hours, BioCodec
shows efficacy across multiple downstream tasks, ranging from clinical
diagnostic tasks and sleep physiology to decoding speech and motor imagery,
particularly in low-resource settings. Additionally, we provide a qualitative
analysis of codebook usage and estimate the spatial coherence of codebook
embeddings from EEG connectivity. Notably, we also document the suitability of
our method to other biosignal data, i.e., electromyographic (EMG) signals.
Overall, the proposed approach provides a versatile solution for biosignal
tokenization that performs competitively with state-of-the-art models. The
source code and model checkpoints are shared.

TL;DR: The paper presents DPCformer, a deep learning model utilizing convolutional networks and self-attention for genomic selection, significantly improving prediction accuracy in multiple crops compared to traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional genomic selection techniques struggle with prediction accuracy, particularly for complex traits and large datasets, necessitating a novel approach to improve robustness and performance.

Method: The DPCformer model combines convolutional neural networks (CNNs) with self-attention mechanisms. It utilizes an 8-dimensional one-hot encoding for SNP data and employs the PMF algorithm for feature selection. The model was applied to datasets of 13 traits across five major crops.

Result: DPCformer demonstrated significant performance improvements in prediction accuracies, such as 2.92% gains for maize, 8.37% for cotton, and a 57.35% increase in the Pearson correlation coefficient for tomato traits. It also showed a 16.62% improvement for chickpea yield predictions.

Conclusion: DPCformer surpasses existing genomic selection methods by offering improved accuracy, robustness with small datasets, and better interpretability, making it a valuable tool for precision breeding and combating food security challenges.

Abstract: Genomic Selection (GS) uses whole-genome information to predict crop
phenotypes and accelerate breeding. Traditional GS methods, however, struggle
with prediction accuracy for complex traits and large datasets. We propose
DPCformer, a deep learning model integrating convolutional neural networks with
a self-attention mechanism to model complex genotype-phenotype relationships.
We applied DPCformer to 13 traits across five crops (maize, cotton, tomato,
rice, chickpea). Our approach uses an 8-dimensional one-hot encoding for SNP
data, ordered by chromosome, and employs the PMF algorithm for feature
selection. Evaluations show DPCformer outperforms existing methods. In maize
datasets, accuracy for traits like days to tasseling and plant height improved
by up to 2.92%. For cotton, accuracy gains for fiber traits reached 8.37%. On
small-sample tomato data, the Pearson Correlation Coefficient for a key trait
increased by up to 57.35%. In chickpea, the yield correlation was boosted by
16.62%. DPCformer demonstrates superior accuracy, robustness in small-sample
scenarios, and enhanced interpretability, providing a powerful tool for

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper investigates feature caching in diffusion transformers to address high inference costs in such models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study is driven by the inefficiency of current feature caching methods, which assume high feature similarity or continuity between timesteps‚Äîa condition that does not universally apply.

Method: Frequency-aware Caching (FreqCa) is proposed, involving low-frequency feature reuse and high-frequency component prediction using a second-order Hermite interpolator. Cumulative Residual Feature (CRF) caching is also introduced to reduce memory usage significantly.

Result: FreqCa demonstrates effective performance in both image generation and editing tasks, showcasing its potential with reduced computational and memory demands across several benchmarks.

Conclusion: The proposed caching and frequency methods enhance diffusion transformer models by making them more efficient and applicable to a range of tasks, paving the way for reduced computational costs.

Abstract: The application of diffusion transformers is suffering from their significant
inference costs. Recently, feature caching has been proposed to solve this
problem by reusing features from previous timesteps, thereby skipping
computation in future timesteps. However, previous feature caching assumes that
features in adjacent timesteps are similar or continuous, which does not always
hold in all settings. To investigate this, this paper begins with an analysis
from the frequency domain, which reveal that different frequency bands in the
features of diffusion models exhibit different dynamics across timesteps.
Concretely, low-frequency components, which decide the structure of images,
exhibit higher similarity but poor continuity. In contrast, the high-frequency
bands, which decode the details of images, show significant continuity but poor
similarity. These interesting observations motivate us to propose
Frequency-aware Caching (FreqCa)
  which directly reuses features of low-frequency components based on their
similarity, while using a second-order Hermite interpolator to predict the
volatile high-frequency ones based on its continuity.
  Besides, we further propose to cache Cumulative Residual Feature (CRF)
instead of the features in all the layers, which reduces the memory footprint
of feature caching by 99%.
  Extensive experiments on FLUX.1-dev, FLUX.1-Kontext-dev, Qwen-Image, and
Qwen-Image-Edit demonstrate its effectiveness in both generation and editing.
Codes are available in the supplementary materials and will be released on

*Yunzhen Feng,Parag Jain,Anthony Hartshorn,Yaqi Duan,Julia Kempe*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces LENS, a method to improve RLVR by utilizing incorrect responses in training, leading to better efficiency and performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RLVR methods like GRPO waste computational resources on negative groups, where sampled responses are incorrect and provide no gradient for improvement.

Method: The paper proposes LENS, which modifies the GRPO framework by incorporating a confidence-weighted penalty for incorrect responses, effectively converting them into informative gradient updates.

Result: On the MATH benchmark with Llama-3.1-8B and Qwen-2.5-3B, LENS significantly outperformed the GRPO baseline, particularly on difficult tasks.

Conclusion: LENS provides a principled, efficient, and practical solution for leveraging negative groups in RLVR, enhancing both performance and training efficiency.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) has become a standard
recipe for improving large language models (LLMs) on reasoning tasks, with
Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) widely used in practice. Yet GRPO
wastes substantial compute on negative groups: groups in which no sampled
response is correct yield zero advantage and thus no gradient. We ask whether
negative groups can be leveraged without extra supervision. Starting from a
maximum-likelihood (MLE) objective in reward modeling, we show that the MLE
gradient is equivalent to a policy gradient for a modified value function. This
value function adds a confidence-weighted penalty on incorrect responses,
imposing larger penalties on more confident mistakes. We refer to this as
\textbf{L}ikelihood \textbf{E}stimation with \textbf{N}egative \textbf{S}amples
(\textbf{LENS}). LENS modifies GRPO to assign non-zero, confidence-dependent
rewards to incorrect generations, making negative groups informative and
converting previously wasted samples into useful gradient updates. On the MATH
benchmark with Llama-3.1-8B and Qwen-2.5-3B, the proposed variant consistently
outperforms GRPO baseline, with significant gains on harder items. These
results demonstrate a principled and practical way to "rescue" negative groups,
improving efficiency and performance in RLVR.

*Jiachen Jiang,Zhen Qin,Zhihui Zhu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper explores how in-context learning (ICL) can be applied to time-varying channel equalization tasks, enhancing adaptability and performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the challenge of non-stationary channel problems, where traditional channel equalization methods follow a supervised learning approach but struggle with adapting swiftly to dynamic environments.

Method: The researchers design efficient attention mechanisms inspired by adaptive signal processing algorithms, such as Least Mean Square (LMS) and Least Root Mean Square (LRMS), for better adaptability in non-stationary tasks.

Result: Experimental results confirm that ICL shows strong potential for non-stationary MIMO equalization, with attention mechanisms significantly boosting adaptive performance in dynamic environments.

Conclusion: In-context learning, combined with attention mechanisms derived from classical adaptive algorithms, can offer improved adaptability and robustness for next-generation wireless foundation models.

Abstract: Channel equalization is fundamental for mitigating distortions such as
frequency-selective fading and inter-symbol interference. Unlike standard
supervised learning approaches that require costly retraining or fine-tuning
for each new task, in-context learning (ICL) adapts to new channels at
inference time with only a few examples. However, existing ICL-based equalizers
are primarily developed for and evaluated on static channels within the context
window. Indeed, to our knowledge, prior principled analyses and theoretical
studies of ICL focus exclusively on the stationary setting, where the function
remains fixed within the context. In this paper, we investigate the ability of
ICL to address non-stationary problems through the lens of time-varying channel
equalization. We employ a principled framework for designing efficient
attention mechanisms with improved adaptivity in non-stationary tasks,
leveraging algorithms from adaptive signal processing to guide better designs.
For example, new attention variants can be derived from the Least Mean Square
(LMS) adaptive algorithm, a Least Root Mean Square (LRMS) formulation for
enhanced robustness, or multi-step gradient updates for improved long-term
tracking. Experimental results demonstrate that ICL holds strong promise for
non-stationary MIMO equalization, and that attention mechanisms inspired by
classical adaptive algorithms can substantially enhance adaptability and
performance in dynamic environments. Our findings may provide critical insights
for developing next-generation wireless foundation models with stronger
adaptability and robustness.

TL;DR: The paper investigates instance discrimination as a self-supervised representation learning approach by treating individual instances as their own classes using stochastic transformations to create invariant representations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: This study aims to explore self-supervised learning paradigms where a model is trained to distinguish instances without relying on labeled data, enhancing representation learning efficiency.

Method: The methodology involves treating each instance as a separate class and applying stochastic transformations to generate two views of that instance, enabling the model to learn invariant representations.

Result: The research demonstrates that instance discrimination enables models to effectively generate invariant representations of objects from different transformations.

Conclusion: Instance discrimination proves to be a promising approach for self-supervised representation learning, showing strong potential in enabling invariant feature representation across transformations.

Abstract: Instance discrimination is a self-supervised representation learning paradigm
wherein individual instances within a dataset are treated as distinct classes.
This is typically achieved by generating two disparate views of each instance
by applying stochastic transformations, which encourages the model to learn
representations that are invariant to the common underlying object across these
views.

TL;DR: The paper discusses using SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) values for enhancing explainability in AI models, clustering predictions to understand pathways, and introducing a novel visualization method.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the untrustworthiness of black-box AI models in high-stakes scenarios by improving their explainability with SHAP analysis.

Method: It utilizes SHAP values to quantify feature contributions, clusters data samples based on similar prediction reasons, and introduces a generalized waterfall plot for multi-class classification.

Result: The methodology is demonstrated through a simulated experiment and a case study in Alzheimer's disease using data from the ADNI database.

Conclusion: Clustering SHAP values is a powerful tool for understanding AI model predictions, providing greater trust and interpretability in application areas like Alzheimer's disease diagnosis.

Abstract: In this growing age of data and technology, large black-box models are
becoming the norm due to their ability to handle vast amounts of data and learn
incredibly complex input-output relationships. The deficiency of these methods,
however, is their inability to explain the prediction process, making them
untrustworthy and their use precarious in high-stakes situations. SHapley
Additive exPlanations (SHAP) analysis is an explainable AI method growing in
popularity for its ability to explain model predictions in terms of the
original features. For each sample and feature in the data set, we associate a
SHAP value that quantifies the contribution of that feature to the prediction
of that sample. Clustering these SHAP values can provide insight into the data
by grouping samples that not only received the same prediction, but received
the same prediction for similar reasons. In doing so, we map the various
pathways through which distinct samples arrive at the same prediction. To
showcase this methodology, we present a simulated experiment in addition to a
case study in Alzheimer's disease using data from the Alzheimer's Disease
Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database. We also present a novel generalization
of the waterfall plot for multi-classification.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes Counterfactually Fair Conformal Prediction (CF-CP), an approach that ensures counterfactual fairness in prediction sets while preserving the marginal coverage property.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address the lack of counterfactual fairness in prediction sets generated by conformal prediction methods, which are widely used for uncertainty quantification.

Method: The proposed method, CF-CP, symmetrizes conformity scores across protected attribute interventions, ensuring fairness while maintaining the statistical property of marginal coverage.

Result: CF-CP was evaluated on both synthetic and real-world datasets. It achieved counterfactual fairness, met target coverage rates, and only introduced minimal increases in the size of prediction sets.

Conclusion: CF-CP offers an efficient, training-free method to generate counterfactually fair prediction sets, making it valuable for fair decision-making under uncertainty.

Abstract: While counterfactual fairness of point predictors is well studied, its
extension to prediction sets--central to fair decision-making under
uncertainty--remains underexplored. On the other hand, conformal prediction
(CP) provides efficient, distribution-free, finite-sample valid prediction
sets, yet does not ensure counterfactual fairness. We close this gap by
developing Counterfactually Fair Conformal Prediction (CF-CP) that produces
counterfactually fair prediction sets. Through symmetrization of conformity
scores across protected-attribute interventions, we prove that CF-CP results in
counterfactually fair prediction sets while maintaining the marginal coverage
property. Furthermore, we empirically demonstrate that on both synthetic and
real datasets, across regression and classification tasks, CF-CP achieves the
desired counterfactual fairness and meets the target coverage rate with minimal
increase in prediction set size. CF-CP offers a simple, training-free route to
counterfactually fair uncertainty quantification.

TL;DR: The paper establishes a theoretical foundation for controlling large language models by modifying their internal states through weight updates and vector additions, linking these techniques to the transformer architecture's computations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to provide a theoretical basis for intervention techniques in large language models, which are currently based on empirical heuristics, thereby improving their reliability and understanding.

Method: The authors generalize recent findings by mapping prompt influence to implicit weight updates in deep, multi-block transformers and derive methods to transform textual input into thought vectors and matrices.

Result: They provide a theoretical explanation for existing model editing techniques and introduce a principled approach to create token-independent weight updates from textual input.

Conclusion: This work bridges the gap between empirical techniques and theoretical understanding, offering a computationally-grounded framework for model interventions in language models.

Abstract: A growing body of research has demonstrated that the behavior of large
language models can be effectively controlled at inference time by directly
modifying their internal states, either through vector additions to their
activations or through updates to their weight matrices. These techniques,
while powerful, are often guided by empirical heuristics, such as deriving
steering vectors from the average activations of contrastive prompts. This work
provides a theoretical foundation for these interventions, explaining how they
emerge from the fundamental computations of the transformer architecture.
Building on the recent finding that a prompt's influence can be mathematically
mapped to implicit weight updates (Dherin et al., 2025), we generalize this
theory to deep, multi-block transformers. We show how the information contained
in any chunk of a user prompt is represented and composed internally through
weight vectors and weight matrices. We then derive a principled method for
condensing this information into token-independent thought vectors and thought
matrices. These constructs provide a theoretical explanation for existing
vector- and matrix-based model editing techniques and offer a direct,
computationally-grounded method for transmuting textual input into reusable
weight updates.

*Ayush Khot,Miruna Oprescu,Maresa Schr√∂der,Ai Kagawa,Xihaier Luo*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Spatial Deconfounder, a method to address unmeasured spatial confounders and treatment interference in causal inference by leveraging Conditional Variational Autoencoders (CVAE).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Causal inference in spatial domains often struggles with unmeasured confounders, like environmental factors, and interference from nearby treatments. Existing methods tend to focus on one issue while neglecting the other. This paper aims to bridge these challenges.

Method: The Spatial Deconfounder reconstructs a substitute confounder using a Conditional Variational Autoencoder (CVAE) with a spatial prior, followed by causal effect estimation through a flexible outcome model. It leverages interference as a structural signal.

Result: The method enables nonparametric identification of direct and spillover causal effects under weak assumptions. Through experiments on real-world datasets in environmental health and social sciences, it shows significant improvements in effect estimation.

Conclusion: The framework advances robust causal inference by integrating spatial-interference insights with deconfounding techniques, bridging gaps between spatial and causal inference methods.

Abstract: Causal inference in spatial domains faces two intertwined challenges: (1)
unmeasured spatial factors, such as weather, air pollution, or mobility, that
confound treatment and outcome, and (2) interference from nearby treatments
that violate standard no-interference assumptions. While existing methods
typically address one by assuming away the other, we show they are deeply
connected: interference reveals structure in the latent confounder. Leveraging
this insight, we propose the Spatial Deconfounder, a two-stage method that
reconstructs a substitute confounder from local treatment vectors using a
conditional variational autoencoder (CVAE) with a spatial prior, then estimates
causal effects via a flexible outcome model. We show that this approach enables
nonparametric identification of both direct and spillover effects under weak
assumptions--without requiring multiple treatment types or a known model of the
latent field. Empirically, we extend SpaCE, a benchmark suite for spatial
confounding, to include treatment interference, and show that the Spatial
Deconfounder consistently improves effect estimation across real-world datasets
in environmental health and social science. By turning interference into a
multi-cause signal, our framework bridges spatial and deconfounding literatures
to advance robust causal inference in structured data.

*Di Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a frequency-domain analysis framework to reinterpret the stochastic multi-armed bandit problem, offering fresh insights into exploration and exploitation using signal processing concepts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing analyses of MAB algorithms focus on time-domain and cumulative regret metrics, lacking tools to capture the dynamic nature of the learning process.

Method: The authors propose a Frequency-Domain Bandit Model, viewing reward estimates as spectral components and analyzing UCB via adaptive filtering principles in the frequency domain.

Result: They demonstrate that the UCB algorithm's confidence bounds correspond to time-varying gains applied to spectral components, inversely proportional to visit counts, while deriving dynamic bounds for exploration rate decay.

Conclusion: This frequency-domain approach provides a novel interpretation of classic MAB algorithms and enables the development of next-generation adaptive algorithms grounded in rigorous theoretical foundations.

Abstract: The stochastic multi-armed bandit (MAB) problem is one of the most
fundamental models in sequential decision-making, with the core challenge being
the trade-off between exploration and exploitation. Although algorithms such as
Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) and Thompson Sampling, along with their regret
theories, are well-established, existing analyses primarily operate from a
time-domain and cumulative regret perspective, struggling to characterize the
dynamic nature of the learning process. This paper proposes a novel
frequency-domain analysis framework, reformulating the bandit process as a
signal processing problem. Within this framework, the reward estimate of each
arm is viewed as a spectral component, with its uncertainty corresponding to
the component's frequency, and the bandit algorithm is interpreted as an
adaptive filter. We construct a formal Frequency-Domain Bandit Model and prove
the main theorem: the confidence bound term in the UCB algorithm is equivalent
in the frequency domain to a time-varying gain applied to uncertain spectral
components, a gain inversely proportional to the square root of the visit
count. Based on this, we further derive finite-time dynamic bounds concerning
the exploration rate decay. This theory not only provides a novel and intuitive
physical interpretation for classical algorithms but also lays a rigorous
theoretical foundation for designing next-generation algorithms with adaptive
parameter adjustment.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a dual-approach framework for explaining and assessing forecastability in complex time series ensemble models using AutoML systems like AutoGluon. It uses surrogate models for interpretability and spectral analysis for forecastability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Automated Machine Learning (AutoML) systems generate high-accuracy time series ensemble models, but these models often lack transparency and interpretability, posing challenges for users seeking explainable AI tools.

Method: The authors developed a surrogate model (LightGBM) for faithful mimicry to apply SHAP-based feature attributions and used spectral predictability analysis to objectively evaluate forecastability compared to noise benchmarks.

Result: The framework demonstrated high faithfulness to ground truth effects in SHAP values, improved forecast accuracy correlates with spectral predictability, and effective normalization for heterogeneous time series explanations.

Conclusion: The framework offers interpretable, instance-level explanations for ensemble forecasts and reliable forecastability metrics, empowering users to trust predictions and their explanations more confidently.

Abstract: Modern time series forecasting increasingly relies on complex ensemble models
generated by AutoML systems like AutoGluon, delivering superior accuracy but
with significant costs to transparency and interpretability. This paper
introduces a comprehensive, dual-approach framework that addresses both the
explainability and forecastability challenges in complex time series ensembles.
First, we develop a surrogate-based explanation methodology that bridges the
accuracy-interpretability gap by training a LightGBM model to faithfully mimic
AutoGluon's time series forecasts, enabling stable SHAP-based feature
attributions. We rigorously validated this approach through feature injection
experiments, demonstrating remarkably high faithfulness between extracted SHAP
values and known ground truth effects. Second, we integrated spectral
predictability analysis to quantify each series' inherent forecastability. By
comparing each time series' spectral predictability to its pure noise
benchmarks, we established an objective mechanism to gauge confidence in
forecasts and their explanations. Our empirical evaluation on the M5 dataset
found that higher spectral predictability strongly correlates not only with
improved forecast accuracy but also with higher fidelity between the surrogate
and the original forecasting model. These forecastability metrics serve as
effective filtering mechanisms and confidence scores, enabling users to
calibrate their trust in both the forecasts and their explanations. We further
demonstrated that per-item normalization is essential for generating meaningful
SHAP explanations across heterogeneous time series with varying scales. The
resulting framework delivers interpretable, instance-level explanations for
state-of-the-art ensemble forecasts, while equipping users with forecastability
metrics that serve as reliability indicators for both predictions and their
explanations.

TL;DR: This paper introduces DemoDiff, a novel demonstration-conditioned diffusion model for molecular design, outperforming existing models and achieving scalable pretraining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: In-context learning has limited success in molecular design due to scarce labeled data for molecular properties in extensive databases like ChEMBL.

Method: DemoDiff uses molecule-score examples as task context and develops a new molecular tokenizer with Node Pair Encoding for scalable representation and pretraining.

Result: DemoDiff matches or surpasses significantly larger language models and outperforms domain-specific approaches across 33 design tasks in six categories.

Conclusion: DemoDiff establishes itself as a molecular foundation model, advancing in-context molecular design and enabling efficient molecular generation targeting specific properties.

Abstract: In-context learning allows large models to adapt to new tasks from a few
demonstrations, but it has shown limited success in molecular design. Existing
databases such as ChEMBL contain molecular properties spanning millions of
biological assays, yet labeled data for each property remain scarce. To address
this limitation, we introduce demonstration-conditioned diffusion models
(DemoDiff), which define task contexts using a small set of molecule-score
examples instead of text descriptions. These demonstrations guide a denoising
Transformer to generate molecules aligned with target properties. For scalable
pretraining, we develop a new molecular tokenizer with Node Pair Encoding that
represents molecules at the motif level, requiring 5.5$\times$ fewer nodes. We
curate a dataset containing millions of context tasks from multiple sources
covering both drugs and materials, and pretrain a 0.7-billion-parameter model
on it. Across 33 design tasks in six categories, DemoDiff matches or surpasses
language models 100-1000$\times$ larger and achieves an average rank of 3.63
compared to 5.25-10.20 for domain-specific approaches. These results position
DemoDiff as a molecular foundation model for in-context molecular design. Our

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing outlier detection methods struggle with mixed-type tabular data, losing semantic information during encoding, and often lack interpretability in high-stakes domains like cybersecurity and healthcare.

Method: RFOD uses a feature-wise conditional reconstruction with random forests for each feature, combines Adjusted Gower‚Äôs Distance for cell-level scoring, and incorporates Uncertainty-Weighted Averaging to aggregate anomaly scores at row levels.

Result: RFOD outperforms state-of-the-art methods in anomaly detection accuracy across 15 datasets while providing superior robustness and interpretability, especially for mixed-type tabular data.

Conclusion: RFOD effectively addresses challenges in mixed-type tabular data anomaly detection by improving accuracy, interpretability, and scalability, making it a promising method for high-stakes domains.

Abstract: Outlier detection in tabular data is crucial for safeguarding data integrity
in high-stakes domains such as cybersecurity, financial fraud detection, and
healthcare, where anomalies can cause serious operational and economic impacts.
Despite advances in both data mining and deep learning, many existing methods
struggle with mixed-type tabular data, often relying on encoding schemes that
lose important semantic information. Moreover, they frequently lack
interpretability, offering little insight into which specific values cause
anomalies. To overcome these challenges, we introduce \textsf{\textbf{RFOD}}, a
novel \textsf{\textbf{R}}andom \textsf{\textbf{F}}orest-based
\textsf{\textbf{O}}utlier \textsf{\textbf{D}}etection framework tailored for
tabular data. Rather than modeling a global joint distribution, \textsf{RFOD}
reframes anomaly detection as a feature-wise conditional reconstruction
problem, training dedicated random forests for each feature conditioned on the
others. This design robustly handles heterogeneous data types while preserving
the semantic integrity of categorical features. To further enable precise and
interpretable detection, \textsf{RFOD} combines Adjusted Gower's Distance (AGD)
for cell-level scoring, which adapts to skewed numerical data and accounts for
categorical confidence, with Uncertainty-Weighted Averaging (UWA) to aggregate
cell-level scores into robust row-level anomaly scores. Extensive experiments
on 15 real-world datasets demonstrate that \textsf{RFOD} consistently
outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in detection accuracy while offering
superior robustness, scalability, and interpretability for mixed-type tabular
data.

### [271] [Conformal Risk Training: End-to-End Optimization of Conformal Risk Control](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08748)
*Christopher Yeh,Nicolas Christianson,Adam Wierman,Yisong Yue*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper addresses the lack of risk guarantees in deep learning predictions by introducing methods for tail-risk control and improving average-case performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep learning models lack provable risk or reliability guarantees, which are crucial for high-stakes applications sensitive to tail risks.

Method: The authors develop a method for controlling Optimized Certainty-Equivalent (OCE) risks and propose 'conformal risk training,' an approach that integrates risk control during model training.

Result: The methods provide provable risk guarantees and demonstrate superior average-case performance compared to post-hoc methods in tasks such as controlling classifiers' false negatives and financial risks.

Conclusion: Integrating risk control into training improves reliability for sensitive applications, achieving both provable guarantees and enhanced performance.

Abstract: While deep learning models often achieve high predictive accuracy, their
predictions typically do not come with any provable guarantees on risk or
reliability, which are critical for deployment in high-stakes applications. The
framework of conformal risk control (CRC) provides a distribution-free,
finite-sample method for controlling the expected value of any bounded monotone
loss function and can be conveniently applied post-hoc to any pre-trained deep
learning model. However, many real-world applications are sensitive to tail
risks, as opposed to just expected loss. In this work, we develop a method for
controlling the general class of Optimized Certainty-Equivalent (OCE) risks, a
broad class of risk measures which includes as special cases the expected loss
(generalizing the original CRC method) and common tail risks like the
conditional value-at-risk (CVaR). Furthermore, standard post-hoc CRC can
degrade average-case performance due to its lack of feedback to the model. To
address this, we introduce "conformal risk training," an end-to-end approach
that differentiates through conformal OCE risk control during model training or
fine-tuning. Our method achieves provable risk guarantees while demonstrating
significantly improved average-case performance over post-hoc approaches on
applications to controlling classifiers' false negative rate and controlling
financial risk in battery storage operation.

### [272] [Exploring Cross-Client Memorization of Training Data in Large Language Models for Federated Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08750)
*Tinnakit Udsa,Can Udomcharoenchaikit,Patomporn Payoungkhamdee,Sarana Nutanong,Norrathep Rattanavipanon*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a framework for measuring memorization risks in Federated Learning (FL) systems, addressing shortcomings in previous methods focused on single-sample analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address the limitations of current FL memorization-detection techniques, which focus solely on individual samples, ignoring broader cross-sample risks.

Method: A novel framework is developed to quantify intra- and inter-client memorization using cross-sample memorization measurements. Two specific studies are conducted: measuring memorization across clients and exploring influencing factors like decoding strategies and FL algorithms.

Result: Findings show that FL models memorize intra-client data more significantly than inter-client data. Training and inferencing factors play a critical role in the extent of memorization.

Conclusion: The proposed framework reveals subtle memorization patterns in FL models, helping researchers mitigate potential privacy risks associated with data sharing and training techniques.

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) enables collaborative training without raw data
sharing, but still risks training data memorization. Existing FL memorization
detection techniques focus on one sample at a time, underestimating more subtle
risks of cross-sample memorization. In contrast, recent work on centralized
learning (CL) has introduced fine-grained methods to assess memorization across
all samples in training data, but these assume centralized access to data and
cannot be applied directly to FL. We bridge this gap by proposing a framework
that quantifies both intra- and inter-client memorization in FL using
fine-grained cross-sample memorization measurement across all clients. Based on
this framework, we conduct two studies: (1) measuring subtle memorization
across clients and (2) examining key factors that influence memorization,
including decoding strategies, prefix length, and FL algorithms. Our findings
reveal that FL models do memorize client data, particularly intra-client data,
more than inter-client data, with memorization influenced by training and
inferencing factors.

### [273] [LOTION: Smoothing the Optimization Landscape for Quantized Training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08757)
*Mujin Kwun,Depen Morwani,Chloe Huangyuan Su,Stephanie Gil,Nikhil Anand,Sham Kakade*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces LOTION, a smoothing framework to optimize neural networks for quantized objectives, overcoming limitations of existing methods by replacing the piece-wise constant quantized loss with a smoothed version.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Quantized objectives in neural networks poses challenges due to zero gradients and undefined derivatives, limiting convergence guarantees with existing methods.

Method: The method uses Nesterov-inspired smoothing with stochastic-noise smoothing, replacing quantized loss with its expectation under unbiased randomized-rounding noise.

Result: The proposed method ensures convergence to local minima, preserves the global minima of quantized loss, and achieves improved performance on synthetic tasks and large language models.

Conclusion: LOTION provides a principled approach to optimizing quantized objectives, outperforming conventional methods and ensuring convergence guarantees.

Abstract: Optimizing neural networks for quantized objectives is fundamentally
challenging because the quantizer is piece-wise constant, yielding zero
gradients everywhere except at quantization thresholds where the derivative is
undefined. Most existing methods deal with this issue by relaxing gradient
computations with techniques like Straight Through Estimators (STE) and do not
provide any guarantees of convergence. In this work, taking inspiration from
Nesterov smoothing, we approximate the quantized loss surface with a continuous
loss surface. In particular, we introduce LOTION, \textbf{L}ow-precision
\textbf{O}ptimization via s\textbf{T}ochastic-no\textbf{I}se
sm\textbf{O}othi\textbf{N}g, a principled smoothing framework that replaces the
raw quantized loss with its expectation under unbiased randomized-rounding
noise. In this framework, standard optimizers are guaranteed to converge to a
local minimum of the loss surface. Moreover, when using noise derived from
stochastic rounding, we show that the global minima of the original quantized
loss are preserved. We empirically demonstrate that this method outperforms
standard QAT on synthetic testbeds and on 150M- and 300M- parameter language
models.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The study proposes a reinforcement learning framework for optimizing CT protocols, achieving high image quality efficiently while reducing radiation dose and computational effort.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional methods for optimizing CT protocols require exhaustive testing of various parameter combinations, which is impractical due to their complexity. A more efficient and automated approach is necessary.

Method: The paper introduces a method that uses virtual imaging tools and a Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) reinforcement learning agent to optimize CT parameters. Human models with liver lesions were imaged using a simulator and evaluated for their image quality index.

Result: The reinforcement learning approach achieved the global maximum of the detectability index (d') for liver lesions while requiring 79.7% fewer steps compared to traditional exhaustive search, proving its accuracy and efficiency.

Conclusion: Integrating virtual imaging tools with reinforcement learning is a promising and efficient alternative for managing CT protocol optimization, offering flexibility and improved computational performance.

Abstract: Protocol optimization is critical in Computed Tomography (CT) to achieve high
diagnostic image quality while minimizing radiation dose. However, due to the
complex interdependencies among CT acquisition and reconstruction parameters,
traditional optimization methods rely on exhaustive testing of combinations of
these parameters, which is often impractical. This study introduces a novel
methodology that combines virtual imaging tools with reinforcement learning to
optimize CT protocols more efficiently. Human models with liver lesions were
imaged using a validated CT simulator and reconstructed with a novel CT
reconstruction toolkit. The optimization parameter space included tube voltage,
tube current, reconstruction kernel, slice thickness, and pixel size. The
optimization process was performed using a Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)
agent, which was trained to maximize an image quality objective, specifically
the detectability index (d') of liver lesions in the reconstructed images.
Optimization performance was compared against an exhaustive search performed on
a supercomputer. The proposed reinforcement learning approach achieved the
global maximum d' across test cases while requiring 79.7% fewer steps than the
exhaustive search, demonstrating both accuracy and computational efficiency.
The proposed framework is flexible and can accommodate various image quality
objectives. The findings highlight the potential of integrating virtual imaging
tools with reinforcement learning for CT protocol management.

*Francisco Pascoa,Ian Lalonde,Alexandre Girard*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces a novel zero-shot transfer method using Buckingham's Pi Theorem to improve RL policy generalization to varied physical contexts without retraining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reinforcement learning policies often struggle to adapt to different robots, tasks, or environmental conditions, hindering their real-world usefulness.

Method: The approach scales pre-trained RL policies by transforming inputs and outputs into a dimensionless space, adhering to physical similarity principles, and eliminates the need for retraining.

Result: Experiments show that the scaled method maintains performance on dynamically similar contexts and outperforms naive transfer in non-similar contexts across various simulated and real-world environments.

Conclusion: Dimensional analysis enhances RL policies' robustness and applicability across diverse contexts, making them more practical for real-world scenarios.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) policies often fail to generalize to new robots,
tasks, or environments with different physical parameters, a challenge that
limits their real-world applicability. This paper presents a simple, zero-shot
transfer method based on Buckingham's Pi Theorem to address this limitation.
The method adapts a pre-trained policy to new system contexts by scaling its
inputs (observations) and outputs (actions) through a dimensionless space,
requiring no retraining. The approach is evaluated against a naive transfer
baseline across three environments of increasing complexity: a simulated
pendulum, a physical pendulum for sim-to-real validation, and the
high-dimensional HalfCheetah. Results demonstrate that the scaled transfer
exhibits no loss of performance on dynamically similar contexts. Furthermore,
on non-similar contexts, the scaled policy consistently outperforms the naive
transfer, significantly expanding the volume of contexts where the original
policy remains effective. These findings demonstrate that dimensional analysis
provides a powerful and practical tool to enhance the robustness and
generalization of RL policies.

*Shikun Liu,Haoyu Wang,Mufei Li,Pan Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper develops a new approach to creating structure-aware text embeddings by integrating structural information (e.g., hyperlinks, citations) directly into LLMs, leading to better performance across multiple tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the limitation of Large Language Models (LLMs) relying solely on raw text and neglecting structural information crucial for many real-world datasets.

Method: The paper proposes two in-process encoding methods‚Äîsequential concatenation and parallel caching‚Äîto directly incorporate structural relations into LLM embeddings. It also introduces techniques like Context Distillation and Semantic Balancing to handle noisy structural data.

Result: Extensive zero-shot experiments reveal these structure-aware methods outperform text-only and post-hoc baselines across tasks such as retrieval, clustering, classification, and recommendation. Sequential concatenation works best in noisy, moderate-length contexts, while parallel caching excels with long, high-signal scenarios.

Conclusion: The study provides a comprehensive evaluation of structure-aware encoding methodologies, showing that in-process integration of structural information can create more powerful and contextually intelligent LLM embeddings.

Abstract: Text embeddings from Large Language Models (LLMs) have become foundational
for numerous applications. However, these models typically operate on raw text,
overlooking the rich structural information, such as hyperlinks or citations,
that provides crucial context in many real-world datasets. This paper
introduces and systematically evaluates a new paradigm for generating
structure-aware text embeddings by integrating these structural relations
directly into the LLM's internal encoding process, rather than relying on
traditional post-hoc aggregation. We investigate two primary in-process
methods: sequential concatenation and parallel caching. Through extensive
zero-shot experiments across retrieval, clustering, classification, and
recommendation tasks, we demonstrate that our structure-aware approaches
consistently outperform both text-only and post-hoc baselines. Our analysis
reveals critical trade-offs: sequential concatenation excels with noisy,
moderate-length contexts, while parallel caching scales more effectively to
long, high-signal contexts but is more susceptible to distractors. To address
the challenge of noisy structural data, we also introduce and validate two
effective techniques: Context Distillation and Semantic Balancing. This work
provides the first comprehensive analysis of in-process structure-aware
encoding, offering a blueprint for building more powerful and contextually
aware embedding models.

*Vaibhav Jain,Gerrit Grossmann*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a method where RL agents utilize action recommendations from LLMs via augmented observation spaces, enabling flexibility in following or ignoring guidance, and reports significant performance and efficiency gains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RL agents often struggle in sparse-reward environments due to ineffective traditional exploration strategies, prompting the need for external guidance like procedural knowledge from LLMs.

Method: LLM-guided action recommendations are provided through augmented observation spaces in RL settings, allowing agents to flexibly decide when to utilize these insights while preserving soft constraints.

Result: The method yields a 71% improvement in success rates in challenging environments, increases sample efficiency, and achieves performance thresholds up to 9 times faster, without altering existing RL algorithms.

Conclusion: Leveraging LLM planning capabilities can significantly accelerate RL training in difficult tasks, offering a scalable and effective solution to sparse-reward challenges.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) agents often struggle in sparse-reward
environments where traditional exploration strategies fail to discover
effective action sequences. Large Language Models (LLMs) possess procedural
knowledge and reasoning capabilities from text pretraining that could guide RL
exploration, but existing approaches create rigid dependencies where RL
policies must follow LLM suggestions or incorporate them directly into reward
functions. We propose a framework that provides LLM-generated action
recommendations through augmented observation spaces, allowing RL agents to
learn when to follow or ignore this guidance. Our method leverages LLMs' world
knowledge and reasoning abilities while maintaining flexibility through soft
constraints. We evaluate our approach on three BabyAI environments of
increasing complexity and show that the benefits of LLM guidance scale with
task difficulty. In the most challenging environment, we achieve 71% relative
improvement in final success rates over baseline. The approach provides
substantial sample efficiency gains, with agents reaching performance
thresholds up to 9 times faster, and requires no modifications to existing RL
algorithms. Our results demonstrate an effective method for leveraging LLM
planning capabilities to accelerate RL training in challenging environments.

*Xinwen Hu,Yunqing Huang,Nianyu Yi,Peimeng Yin*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a reusable initialization method using pretraining on basis functions for neural networks, aimed at improving training efficiency, generalization, and transferability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Challenges in neural network function approximation include the need to retrain models for each target function, sensitivity to architecture/hyperparameters, and poor generalization beyond training domains.

Method: Basis neural networks are pretrained to approximate polynomial families on a reference domain. Domain mapping ensures adaptability by transforming inputs to align with the reference domain.

Result: Numerical experiments in 1D and 2D settings show improved efficiency, generalization, and transferability of models.

Conclusion: Initialization-based strategies rooted in pretraining can enhance scalability and modularity in neural function approximation.

Abstract: Neural network-based function approximation plays a pivotal role in the
advancement of scientific computing and machine learning. Yet, training such
models faces several challenges: (i) each target function often requires
training a new model from scratch; (ii) performance is highly sensitive to
architectural and hyperparameter choices; and (iii) models frequently
generalize poorly beyond the training domain. To overcome these challenges, we
propose a reusable initialization framework based on basis function
pretraining. In this approach, basis neural networks are first trained to
approximate families of polynomials on a reference domain. Their learned
parameters are then used to initialize networks for more complex target
functions. To enhance adaptability across arbitrary domains, we further
introduce a domain mapping mechanism that transforms inputs into the reference
domain, thereby preserving structural correspondence with the pretrained
models. Extensive numerical experiments in one- and two-dimensional settings
demonstrate substantial improvements in training efficiency, generalization,
and model transferability, highlighting the promise of initialization-based
strategies for scalable and modular neural function approximation. The full
code is made publicly available on Gitee.

*I. Arda Vurankaya,Mustafa O. Karabag,Wesley A. Suttle,Jesse Milzman,David Fridovich-Keil,Ufuk Topcu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper studies a multi-armed bandit problem where a deceptive agent tries to exploit private rewards without being detected by an observer.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore how a deceptive agent can identify optimal private rewards while staying undetected by an observer expecting public-arm behavior.

Method: The authors formalize detectability using Kullback-Leibler divergence constraints and propose a maximin problem approach for optimal arm pulling strategies.

Result: The analysis concludes that public suboptimal arm pulling rates are bounded to a $
Theta (\sqrt{T} )$ rate and describes an algorithm for effective exploration.

Conclusion: The paper provides insights into deceptive strategies for multi-armed bandits, offering constraints-based optimization and illustrating their behavior numerically.

Abstract: We consider a multi-armed bandit setting in which each arm has a public and a
private reward distribution. An observer expects an agent to follow Thompson
Sampling according to the public rewards, however, the deceptive agent aims to
quickly identify the best private arm without being noticed. The observer can
observe the public rewards and the pulled arms, but not the private rewards.
The agent, on the other hand, observes both the public and private rewards. We
formalize detectability as a stepwise Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence
constraint between the actual pull probabilities used by the agent and the
anticipated pull probabilities by the observer. We model successful pulling of
public suboptimal arms as a % Bernoulli process where the success probability
decreases with each successful pull, and show these pulls can happen at most at
a $\Theta(\sqrt{T}) $ rate under the KL constraint. We then formulate a maximin
problem based on public and private means, whose solution characterizes the
optimal error exponent for best private arm identification. We finally propose
an algorithm inspired by top-two algorithms. This algorithm naturally adapts
its exploration according to the hardness of pulling arms based on the public
suboptimality gaps. We provide numerical examples illustrating the
$\Theta(\sqrt{T}) $ rate and the behavior of the proposed algorithm.

TL;DR: PO-CKAN is a physics-informed deep learning framework aimed at efficiently solving parameterized time-dependent PDEs. It builds on the DeepONet architecture by integrating rational Kolmogorov-Arnold (CKAN) networks and PINN principles.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the need for an efficient operator-learning framework capable of solving complex partial differential equations with physical consistency and handling varying inputs and parameters.

Method: PO-CKAN combines a DeepONet architecture with CKAN sub-networks for enhanced approximation and integrates PINN-style PDE residual loss for physical consistency.

Result: PO-CKAN demonstrates superior accuracy in benchmark problems, reducing errors significantly compared to alternatives, such as improving accuracy by 48% on Burgers' equation relative to PI-DeepONet.

Conclusion: PO-CKAN offers a promising avenue for solving complex PDEs efficiently and accurately, combining operator learning, advanced function approximation, and physics-based enforcement techniques.

Abstract: We propose PO-CKAN, a physics-informed deep operator framework based on
Chunkwise Rational Kolmogorov--Arnold Networks (KANs), for approximating the
solution operators of partial differential equations. This framework leverages
a Deep Operator Network (DeepONet) architecture that incorporates Chunkwise
Rational Kolmogorov--Arnold Network (CKAN) sub-networks for enhanced function
approximation. The principles of Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) are
integrated into the operator learning framework to enforce physical
consistency. This design enables the efficient learning of physically
consistent spatio-temporal solution operators and allows for rapid prediction
for parametric time-dependent PDEs with varying inputs (e.g., parameters,
initial/boundary conditions) after training. Validated on challenging benchmark
problems, PO-CKAN demonstrates accurate operator learning with results closely
matching high-fidelity solutions. PO-CKAN adopts a DeepONet-style branch--trunk
architecture with its sub-networks instantiated as rational KAN modules, and
enforces physical consistency via a PDE residual (PINN-style) loss. On Burgers'
equation with $\nu=0.01$, PO-CKAN reduces the mean relative $L^2$ error by
approximately 48\% compared to PI-DeepONet, and achieves competitive accuracy
on the Eikonal and diffusion--reaction benchmarks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI-driven methods have shown promise in outperforming classical attacks on the LWE problem, but the progress in this area is hindered by the lack of readily accessible and usable data for researchers.

Method: The authors created the TAPAS datasets, encompassing several LWE settings, to provide an off-the-shelf resource for AI practitioners to prototype and improve their approaches.

Result: The TAPAS datasets enabled the establishment of performance baselines for AI-based attacks on LWE. These datasets also allow faster prototyping for new attack strategies.

Conclusion: The TAPAS datasets fill a critical gap by providing accessible resources for AI-based cryptographic research, accelerating innovation in cracking LWE while laying pathways for future exploration.

Abstract: AI-powered attacks on Learning with Errors (LWE), an important hard math
problem in post-quantum cryptography, rival or outperform "classical" attacks
on LWE under certain parameter settings. Despite the promise of this approach,
a dearth of accessible data limits AI practitioners' ability to study and
improve these attacks. Creating LWE data for AI model training is time- and
compute-intensive and requires significant domain expertise. To fill this gap
and accelerate AI research on LWE attacks, we propose the TAPAS datasets, a
Toolkit for Analysis of Post-quantum cryptography using AI Systems. These
datasets cover several LWE settings and can be used off-the-shelf by AI
practitioners to prototype new approaches to cracking LWE. This work documents
TAPAS dataset creation, establishes attack performance baselines, and lays out
directions for future work.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to tackle the challenges of inconsistent results in deep learning caused by random number generation and floating-point computation issues.

Method: The authors developed RepDL, a library that enforces correct rounding and order invariance in floating-point computations to ensure reproducibility.

Result: RepDL provides deterministic and bitwise-reproducible deep learning training and inference across various computing environments.

Conclusion: RepDL demonstrates the feasibility of achieving consistent and reproducible deep learning results, solving a persistent problem in the field.

Abstract: Non-determinism and non-reproducibility present significant challenges in
deep learning, leading to inconsistent results across runs and platforms. These
issues stem from two origins: random number generation and floating-point
computation. While randomness can be controlled through deterministic
configurations, floating-point inconsistencies remain largely unresolved. To
address this, we introduce RepDL, an open-source library that ensures

TL;DR: Edu-EmotionNet is a framework designed to improve emotion recognition in online education by addressing challenges in multimodal fusion and temporal modeling using novel components like CMAA, MIE, and TFL.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To tackle challenges in recognizing learner emotions robustly in online settings, where modalities may be inconsistent or unreliable.

Method: Edu-EmotionNet integrates three components: CMAA for cross-modal context sharing, MIE for assigning confidence-based weights to modalities dynamically, and TFL for maintaining temporal emotional consistency across predictions.

Result: The framework achieved state-of-the-art performance on educational subsets of IEMOCAP and MOSEI datasets, excelling in recognizing emotions like confusion, curiosity, boredom, and frustration under noisy or missing modalities.

Conclusion: Edu-EmotionNet is effective for capturing emotional transitions and prioritizing reliable data, making it suitable for real-time applications in personalized online education systems.

Abstract: Understanding learner emotions in online education is critical for improving
engagement and personalized instruction. While prior work in emotion
recognition has explored multimodal fusion and temporal modeling, existing
methods often rely on static fusion strategies and assume that modality inputs
are consistently reliable, which is rarely the case in real-world learning
environments. We introduce Edu-EmotionNet, a novel framework that jointly
models temporal emotion evolution and modality reliability for robust affect
recognition. Our model incorporates three key components: a Cross-Modality
Attention Alignment (CMAA) module for dynamic cross-modal context sharing, a
Modality Importance Estimator (MIE) that assigns confidence-based weights to
each modality at every time step, and a Temporal Feedback Loop (TFL) that
leverages previous predictions to enforce temporal consistency. Evaluated on
educational subsets of IEMOCAP and MOSEI, re-annotated for confusion,
curiosity, boredom, and frustration, Edu-EmotionNet achieves state-of-the-art
performance and demonstrates strong robustness to missing or noisy modalities.
Visualizations confirm its ability to capture emotional transitions and
adaptively prioritize reliable signals, making it well suited for deployment in
real-time learning systems

TL;DR: This paper explores whether small transformer-based language models can infer graph properties from textual descriptions and presents a novel dataset to evaluate this capability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate if smaller and more resource-efficient language models can effectively perform structural inference on graphs, in contrast to large, resource-intensive models.

Method: The study introduces the TinyGraphEstimator dataset with annotated graphs and applies fine-tuning of smaller language models using the Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) technique.

Result: Small language models demonstrated the ability to predict graph parameters like density and chromatic number, with performance improving through fine-tuning.

Conclusion: Compact transformer-based language models have non-trivial reasoning capabilities for graph data and can be adapted for such tasks using efficient fine-tuning methods.

Abstract: Graphs provide a universal framework for representing complex relational
systems, and inferring their structural properties is a core challenge in graph
analysis and reasoning. While large language models have recently demonstrated
emerging abilities to perform symbolic and numerical reasoning, the potential
of smaller, resource-efficient models in this context remains largely
unexplored. This paper investigates whether compact transformer-based language
models can infer graph-theoretic parameters directly from textual graph
representations. To enable systematic evaluation, we introduce the
TinyGraphEstimator dataset - a balanced collection of connected graphs
generated from multiple random graph models and annotated with detailed
structural metadata. We evaluate several small open models on their ability to
predict key graph parameters such as density, clustering, and chromatic number.
Furthermore, we apply lightweight fine-tuning using the Low-Rank Adaptation
(LoRA) technique, achieving consistent improvements across all evaluated
metrics. The results demonstrate that small language models possess non-trivial
reasoning capacity over graph-structured data and can be effectively adapted
for structural inference tasks through efficient parameter tuning.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a two-stage learning method to address class imbalance in datasets, focusing on improving deep classification models' performance for underrepresented classes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address the bias in deep classification models caused by imbalanced data distributions that negatively affect tail class performance.

Method: The approach consists of two stages: (1) representation learning using information theory to minimize intra-class distance for better-separated features, and (2) a sampling strategy to rectify biased boundaries by selecting mathematically informative instances.

Result: The proposed method exhibits state-of-the-art performance on multiple long-tailed benchmark datasets, substantiated by extensive experimental validation.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates that the approach effectively mitigates the bias in deep classification models without sacrificing overall model performance, benefiting from the balanced utilization of dataset information.

Abstract: The imbalance (or long-tail) is the nature of many real-world data
distributions, which often induces the undesirable bias of deep classification
models toward frequent classes, resulting in poor performance for tail classes.
In this paper, we propose a novel two-stage learning approach to mitigate such
a majority-biased tendency while preserving valuable information within
datasets. Specifically, the first stage proposes a new representation learning
technique from the information theory perspective. This approach is
theoretically equivalent to minimizing intra-class distance, yielding an
effective and well-separated feature space. The second stage develops a novel
sampling strategy that selects mathematically informative instances, able to
rectify majority-biased decision boundaries without compromising a model's
overall performance. As a result, our approach achieves the state-of-the-art
performance across various long-tailed benchmark datasets, validated via
extensive experiments. Our code is available at

TL;DR: The paper reimplements Google's Titans neural memory model, evaluates it on diverse tasks, and finds that while Neural Memory enhances performance, the model has limitations like chunking.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Clarify ambiguities in Google's Titans model and evaluate its reproducibility and performance on various tasks.

Method: Reimplemented the Titans model and evaluated it on Masked Language Modeling, Time Series Forecasting, and Recommendation tasks.

Result: Titans' Neural Memory improved performance over attention-only models, but the model didn't consistently outperform established baselines due to chunking.

Conclusion: The reimplementation confirms the potential of Neural Memory while exposing the model's practical limitations and open research questions.

Abstract: By the end of 2024, Google researchers introduced Titans: Learning at Test
Time, a neural memory model achieving strong empirical results across multiple
tasks. However, the lack of publicly available code and ambiguities in the
original description hinder reproducibility. In this work, we present a
lightweight reimplementation of Titans and conduct a comprehensive evaluation
on Masked Language Modeling, Time Series Forecasting, and Recommendation tasks.
Our results reveal that Titans does not always outperform established baselines
due to chunking. However, its Neural Memory component consistently improves
performance compared to attention-only models. These findings confirm the
model's innovative potential while highlighting its practical limitations and
raising questions for future research.

### [287] [The Boundaries of Fair AI in Medical Image Prognosis: A Causal Perspective](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08840)
*Thai-Hoang Pham,Jiayuan Chen,Seungyeon Lee,Yuanlong Wang,Sayoko Moroi,Xueru Zhang,Ping Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces FairTTE, a framework to assess and address fairness issues in time-to-event (TTE) prediction for medical imaging, highlighting the prevalence of biases and limitations of current methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Concerns have arisen about biases in machine learning (ML) models used for medical imaging, especially regarding fairness in prognosis tasks, which are widely overlooked.

Method: FairTTE utilizes cutting-edge TTE prediction and fairness algorithms integrated with causal analysis techniques to identify and quantify biases in medical imaging datasets.

Result: Large-scale evaluations using FairTTE show pervasive bias across imaging modalities and reveal limited efficacy of current fairness mitigation methods under distribution shifts.

Conclusion: FairTTE highlights the need for robust, holistic solutions to maintain fairness in medical prognosis models, particularly under shifting data distributions.

Abstract: As machine learning (ML) algorithms are increasingly used in medical image
analysis, concerns have emerged about their potential biases against certain
social groups. Although many approaches have been proposed to ensure the
fairness of ML models, most existing works focus only on medical image
diagnosis tasks, such as image classification and segmentation, and overlooked
prognosis scenarios, which involve predicting the likely outcome or progression
of a medical condition over time. To address this gap, we introduce FairTTE,
the first comprehensive framework for assessing fairness in time-to-event (TTE)
prediction in medical imaging. FairTTE encompasses a diverse range of imaging
modalities and TTE outcomes, integrating cutting-edge TTE prediction and
fairness algorithms to enable systematic and fine-grained analysis of fairness
in medical image prognosis. Leveraging causal analysis techniques, FairTTE
uncovers and quantifies distinct sources of bias embedded within medical
imaging datasets. Our large-scale evaluation reveals that bias is pervasive
across different imaging modalities and that current fairness methods offer
limited mitigation. We further demonstrate a strong association between
underlying bias sources and model disparities, emphasizing the need for
holistic approaches that target all forms of bias. Notably, we find that
fairness becomes increasingly difficult to maintain under distribution shifts,
underscoring the limitations of existing solutions and the pressing need for
more robust, equitable prognostic models.

### [288] [On the Alignment Between Supervised and Self-Supervised Contrastive Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08852)
*Achleshwar Luthra,Priyadarsi Mishra,Tomer Galanti*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper investigates the alignment between self-supervised contrastive learning (CL) and Negatives-Only Supervised Contrastive Learning (NSCL) at the representation level and finds strong alignment under certain conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Though CL approximates NSCL at the loss level, it is unclear whether this similarity persists at the representation level throughout training. This paper seeks to bridge that gap.

Method: The authors analyze training alignment between CL and NSCL under shared randomness by studying representation similarity through metrics like centered kernel alignment (CKA) and representational similarity analysis (RSA). Empirical and theoretical evaluations accompany this study.

Result: It is shown mathematically and empirically that CL and NSCL maintain strong representation alignment under realistic settings, improved by larger class numbers, higher training scale, and elevated temperatures.

Conclusion: The representation alignment validates that NSCL can effectively serve as a conceptual bridge between self-supervised (CL) and supervised learning paradigms, offering insights into their connection.

Abstract: Self-supervised contrastive learning (CL) has achieved remarkable empirical
success, often producing representations that rival supervised pre-training on
downstream tasks. Recent theory explains this by showing that the CL loss
closely approximates a supervised surrogate, Negatives-Only Supervised
Contrastive Learning (NSCL) loss, as the number of classes grows. Yet this
loss-level similarity leaves an open question: {\em Do CL and NSCL also remain
aligned at the representation level throughout training, not just in their
objectives?}
  We address this by analyzing the representation alignment of CL and NSCL
models trained under shared randomness (same initialization, batches, and
augmentations). First, we show that their induced representations remain
similar: specifically, we prove that the similarity matrices of CL and NSCL
stay close under realistic conditions. Our bounds provide high-probability
guarantees on alignment metrics such as centered kernel alignment (CKA) and
representational similarity analysis (RSA), and they clarify how alignment
improves with more classes, higher temperatures, and its dependence on batch
size. In contrast, we demonstrate that parameter-space coupling is inherently
unstable: divergence between CL and NSCL weights can grow exponentially with
training time.
  Finally, we validate these predictions empirically, showing that CL-NSCL
alignment strengthens with scale and temperature, and that NSCL tracks CL more
closely than other supervised objectives. This positions NSCL as a principled
bridge between self-supervised and supervised learning. Our code and project

### [289] [Time-Aware Feature Selection: Adaptive Temporal Masking for Stable Sparse Autoencoder Training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08855)
*T. Ed Li,Junyu Ren*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Adaptive Temporal Masking (ATM), a novel sparse autoencoder training approach to reduce feature absorption and enhance interpretability of large language models, showing superior performance compared to existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current sparse autoencoder methods struggle with feature absorption, complicating the reliable identification and analysis of model behaviors.

Method: ATM dynamically tracks feature importance using activation magnitudes, frequencies, and reconstruction contributions. It applies probabilistic masking based on statistical thresholds to improve feature selection.

Result: Extensive tests on the Gemma-2-2b model reveal ATM achieves lower feature absorption scores and maintains excellent reconstruction quality compared to existing methods like TopK and JumpReLU SAEs.

Conclusion: ATM is a robust approach for learning interpretable and reliable features in neural networks, enhancing model analysis and interpretability.

Abstract: Understanding the internal representations of large language models is
crucial for ensuring their reliability and safety, with sparse autoencoders
(SAEs) emerging as a promising interpretability approach. However, current SAE
training methods face feature absorption, where features (or neurons) are
absorbed into each other to minimize $L_1$ penalty, making it difficult to
consistently identify and analyze model behaviors. We introduce Adaptive
Temporal Masking (ATM), a novel training approach that dynamically adjusts
feature selection by tracking activation magnitudes, frequencies, and
reconstruction contributions to compute importance scores that evolve over
time. ATM applies a probabilistic masking mechanism based on statistical
thresholding of these importance scores, creating a more natural feature
selection process. Through extensive experiments on the Gemma-2-2b model, we
demonstrate that ATM achieves substantially lower absorption scores compared to
existing methods like TopK and JumpReLU SAEs, while maintaining excellent
reconstruction quality. These results establish ATM as a principled solution
for learning stable, interpretable features in neural networks, providing a
foundation for more reliable model analysis.

### [290] [Sparse components distinguish visual pathways & their alignment to neural networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08858)
*Ammar I Marvi,Nancy G Kanwisher,Meenakshi Khosla*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper studies high-level visual cortex pathways in the brain and uses a sparse decomposition approach to analyze their distinct and shared representations, introducing Sparse Component Alignment (SCA) for machine-to-brain comparison.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the apparent inconsistency where neural pathways in the human visual cortex are specialized, but deep neural networks trained on single tasks can replicate aspects of this system well, suggesting some shared computation principles.

Method: Applied a sparse decomposition approach to characterize visual-response components in each brain stream (ventral, dorsal, lateral) and developed SCA to evaluate representational overlap between neural data and artificial networks.

Result: Identification of distinct response profiles (faces, places, motion, social actions, etc.) in the three visual streams and showing DNNs align more with ventral representations compared to dorsal or lateral using SCA.

Conclusion: The proposed sparse decomposition and SCA methods provide finer insights into the neural tuning and computational alignment between artificial and biological visual systems, especially revealing DNNs' close affinity to ventral pathways.

Abstract: The ventral, dorsal, and lateral streams in high-level human visual cortex
are implicated in distinct functional processes. Yet, deep neural networks
(DNNs) trained on a single task model the entire visual system surprisingly
well, hinting at common computational principles across these pathways. To
explore this inconsistency, we applied a novel sparse decomposition approach to
identify the dominant components of visual representations within each stream.
Consistent with traditional neuroscience research, we find a clear difference
in component response profiles across the three visual streams -- identifying
components selective for faces, places, bodies, text, and food in the ventral
stream; social interactions, implied motion, and hand actions in the lateral
stream; and some less interpretable components in the dorsal stream. Building
on this, we introduce Sparse Component Alignment (SCA), a new method for
measuring representational alignment between brains and machines that better
captures the latent neural tuning of these two visual systems. Using SCA, we
find that standard visual DNNs are more aligned with the ventral than either
dorsal or lateral representations. SCA reveals these distinctions with greater
resolution than conventional population-level geometry, offering a measure of
representational alignment that is sensitive to a system's underlying axes of
neural tuning.

### [291] [Deep Multimodal Subspace Clustering Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/1804.06498)
*Mahdi Abavisani,Vishal M. Patel*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper develops CNN-based techniques for unsupervised multimodal subspace clustering using a framework with multimodal encoders, self-expressive layers, and decoders. Various fusion strategies are explored, yielding superior performance over existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a need for effective clustering methods that can handle multimodal data while preserving their inherent relationships and characteristics.

Method: A CNN framework is designed with three stages: (1) multimodal encoder for latent space representation, (2) self-expressive layer for affinity matrix computation, and (3) decoder for data reconstruction. Multiple fusion strategies are proposed for spatial and affinity processing.

Result: Experiments across three datasets demonstrate significant performance improvements in clustering accuracy compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: The proposed CNN-based multimodal clustering framework with innovative fusion techniques proves to be highly effective and outperforms existing solutions.

Abstract: We present convolutional neural network (CNN) based approaches for
unsupervised multimodal subspace clustering. The proposed framework consists of
three main stages - multimodal encoder, self-expressive layer, and multimodal
decoder. The encoder takes multimodal data as input and fuses them to a latent
space representation. The self-expressive layer is responsible for enforcing
the self-expressiveness property and acquiring an affinity matrix corresponding
to the data points. The decoder reconstructs the original input data. The
network uses the distance between the decoder's reconstruction and the original
input in its training. We investigate early, late and intermediate fusion
techniques and propose three different encoders corresponding to them for
spatial fusion. The self-expressive layers and multimodal decoders are
essentially the same for different spatial fusion-based approaches. In addition
to various spatial fusion-based methods, an affinity fusion-based network is
also proposed in which the self-expressive layer corresponding to different
modalities is enforced to be the same. Extensive experiments on three datasets
show that the proposed methods significantly outperform the state-of-the-art
multimodal subspace clustering methods.

*Murray Cutforth,Yiming Yang,Tiffany Fan,Serge Guillas,Eric Darve*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes Bernoulli Parameter Mutual Information (BPMI), a batch active learning algorithm leveraging multi-fidelity Gaussian Process classifiers for binary simulation outputs, showing superior predictive accuracy under computational budget constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address the challenge of efficient simulation budget allocation in binary simulation output scenarios, especially for problems requiring expensive computational simulations.

Method: They introduce BPMI, a batch active learning algorithm that utilizes a Gaussian Process model and approximates mutual information using a first-order Taylor expansion of the link function to avoid computational intractability.

Result: BPMI outperforms baseline methodologies on synthetic test cases and a real-world rocket combustor simulation application. It delivers higher predictive accuracy within fixed computational budgets.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that BPMI is an effective tool for achieving efficient allocation of computational resources in simulation-based studies, promising improved accuracy for real-world engineering problems.

Abstract: Many science and engineering problems rely on expensive computational
simulations, where a multi-fidelity approach can accelerate the exploration of
a parameter space. We study efficient allocation of a simulation budget using a
Gaussian Process (GP) model in the binary simulation output case. This paper
introduces Bernoulli Parameter Mutual Information (BPMI), a batch active
learning algorithm for multi-fidelity GP classifiers. BPMI circumvents the
intractability of calculating mutual information in the probability space by
employing a first-order Taylor expansion of the link function. We evaluate BPMI
against several baselines on two synthetic test cases and a complex, real-world
application involving the simulation of a laser-ignited rocket combustor. In
all experiments, BPMI demonstrates superior performance, achieving higher
predictive accuracy for a fixed computational budget.

### [293] [An Improved Model-Free Decision-Estimation Coefficient with Applications in Adversarial MDPs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08882)
*Haolin Liu,Chen-Yu Wei,Julian Zimmert*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The study introduces Dig-DEC, a model-free framework improving decision-making with structured observation by using information gain for exploration instead of optimism, achieving regret bounds for hybrid MDPs in adversarial settings and refining estimation error minimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous approaches could not fully close the gap between regret bounds or handle adversarial scenarios effectively, leaving unresolved challenges in hybrid MDPs.

Method: The paper develops Dig-DEC, which uses information gain for exploration and eliminates optimism, enabling effective analysis of hybrid MDPs with adversarial rewards and stochastic transitions.

Result: Dig-DEC achieves the first model-free regret bounds for hybrid MDPs under bandit feedback and improves regret bounds for estimation procedures compared to prior methods.

Conclusion: Dig-DEC provides a significant advancement in regret bounds and model-free learning, making it viable for adversarial environments and hybrid MDPs while expanding the understanding of structured decision-making.

Abstract: We study decision making with structured observation (DMSO). Previous work
(Foster et al., 2021b, 2023a) has characterized the complexity of DMSO via the
decision-estimation coefficient (DEC), but left a gap between the regret upper
and lower bounds that scales with the size of the model class. To tighten this
gap, Foster et al. (2023b) introduced optimistic DEC, achieving a bound that
scales only with the size of the value-function class. However, their
optimism-based exploration is only known to handle the stochastic setting, and
it remains unclear whether it extends to the adversarial setting.
  We introduce Dig-DEC, a model-free DEC that removes optimism and drives
exploration purely by information gain. Dig-DEC is always no larger than
optimistic DEC and can be much smaller in special cases. Importantly, the
removal of optimism allows it to handle adversarial environments without
explicit reward estimators. By applying Dig-DEC to hybrid MDPs with stochastic
transitions and adversarial rewards, we obtain the first model-free regret
bounds for hybrid MDPs with bandit feedback under several general transition
structures, resolving the main open problem left by Liu et al. (2025).
  We also improve the online function-estimation procedure in model-free
learning: For average estimation error minimization, we refine the estimator in
Foster et al. (2023b) to achieve sharper concentration, improving their regret
bounds from $T^{3/4}$ to $T^{2/3}$ (on-policy) and from $T^{5/6}$ to $T^{7/9}$
(off-policy). For squared error minimization in Bellman-complete MDPs, we
redesign their two-timescale procedure, improving the regret bound from
$T^{2/3}$ to $\sqrt{T}$. This is the first time a DEC-based method achieves
performance matching that of optimism-based approaches (Jin et al., 2021; Xie
et al., 2023) in Bellman-complete MDPs.

*Junxi Yin,Haisen Luo,Zhenyu Li,Yihua Liu,Dan Liu,Zequn Li,Xiaohang Xu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper presents ACPO, a framework to enhance RLVR methods by addressing exploration-exploitation challenges, using techniques like semantic segmentation and hierarchical credit assignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current RLVR methods for LLMs suffer from inaccurate intermediate credit assignment and premature entropy collapse, hindering performance.

Method: ACPO employs trajectory semantic segmentation and an attribution-based representation to regulate policy entropy dynamically, alongside a factorized reward system for accurate credit assignment.

Result: ACPO showed superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods across various benchmarks such as AIME, MATH, and AMC.

Conclusion: This framework effectively resolves key exploration-exploitation trade-offs in RLVR, advancing reasoning capabilities in LLMs.

Abstract: While Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) enhances complex
reasoning in LLMs, current methods struggle to balance exploration and
exploitation. This leads to critical issues like inaccurate credit assignment
for intermediate steps and premature entropy collapse, limiting model
performance. To address this, we introduce Attribution-based Contribution to
Policy Optimization (ACPO), a phased framework that incorporates a
difficulty-aware curriculum. ACPO improves exploration by using trajectory
semantic segmentation and an attribution-based representation to dynamically
regulate policy entropy, thus mitigating its collapse. Concurrently, it
enhances exploitation with a factorized reward system that precisely quantifies
the hierarchical contribution of each reasoning step, ensuring accurate credit
assignment. Extensive experiments on challenging benchmarks, including AIME,
MATH, and AMC, demonstrate that ACPO significantly outperforms existing
state-of-the-art approaches.

### [295] [Velocity and Density-Aware RRI Analysis and Optimization for AoI Minimization in IoV SPS](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08911)
*Maoxin Ji,Tong Wang,Qiong Wu,Pingyi Fan,Nan Cheng,Wen Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper explores optimizing Age of Information (AoI) in Semi-Persistent Scheduling (SPS) for Internet of Vehicles (IoV) through a dual approach combining Large Language Models (LLM) and Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Age of Information (AoI) is crucial for timely communication in IoV, but packet collisions and speed-related channel uncertainties degrade AoI in SPS. Hence, optimizing these parameters is vital.

Method: The researchers developed an AoI model influenced by vehicle speed, density, and Resource Reservation Interval (RRI), coupled with a dual-path optimization framework. DDPG uses state space and reward functions, while LLM generates optimal configurations via contextual learning.

Result: Experimental results show that LLM reduces AoI effectively with minimal exemplars and no specific training required, while DDPG achieves stable performance post-training.

Conclusion: Combining LLM's learning capability with DDPG's stable execution creates an effective strategy for tackling AoI challenges in IoV.

Abstract: Addressing the problem of Age of Information (AoI) deterioration caused by
packet collisions and vehicle speed-related channel uncertainties in
Semi-Persistent Scheduling (SPS) for the Internet of Vehicles (IoV), this
letter proposes an optimization approach based on Large Language Models (LLM)
and Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG). First, an AoI calculation model
influenced by vehicle speed, vehicle density, and Resource Reservation Interval
(RRI) is established, followed by the design of a dual-path optimization
scheme. The DDPG is guided by the state space and reward function, while the
LLM leverages contextual learning to generate optimal parameter configurations.
Experimental results demonstrate that LLM can significantly reduce AoI after
accumulating a small number of exemplars without requiring model training,
whereas the DDPG method achieves more stable performance after training.

*Yuting Yang,Gang Mei,Zhengjing Ma,Nengxiong Xu,Jianbing Peng*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces a simple and robust method for forecasting spatiotemporal patterns in small Earth data, outperforming conventional graph deep learning and tabular foundation models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation lies in addressing the challenge of forecasting spatiotemporally correlated small Earth data, which has sparse, meaningful measurements, using methods that can generalize across various scenarios without task-specific training.

Method: The approach involves characterizing and quantifying spatiotemporal patterns in small Earth data and leveraging tabular foundation models for enhanced forecasting accuracy.

Result: Comparative tests show the proposed approach surpasses the performance of both the graph deep learning model (T-GCN) and tabular foundation model (TabPFN) in accuracy and robustness across three typical scenarios.

Conclusion: The proposed method provides a reliable solution for forecasting small Earth data, enhancing precision and showcasing adaptability across diverse geoscientific scenarios.

Abstract: Small Earth data are geoscience observations with limited short-term
monitoring variability, providing sparse but meaningful measurements, typically
exhibiting spatiotemporal correlations. Spatiotemporal forecasting on such data
is crucial for understanding geoscientific processes despite their small scale.
However, conventional deep learning models for spatiotemporal forecasting
requires task-specific training for different scenarios. Foundation models do
not need task-specific training, but they often exhibit forecasting bias toward
the global mean of the pretraining distribution. Here we propose a simple and
robust approach for spatiotemporally correlated small Earth data forecasting.
The essential idea is to characterize and quantify spatiotemporal patterns of
small Earth data and then utilize tabular foundation models for accurate
forecasting across different scenarios. Comparative results across three
typical scenarios demonstrate that our forecasting approach achieves superior
accuracy compared to the graph deep learning model (T-GCN) and tabular
foundation model (TabPFN) in the majority of instances, exhibiting stronger
robustness.

*Jonah Botvinick-Greenhouse,Wael H. Ali,Mouhacine Benosman,Saviz Mowlavi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces AB-PINNs, a dynamic domain decomposition approach for training physics-informed neural networks, adapting subdomains during training to enhance solution representation for multiscale PDEs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to improve physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) by addressing challenges in representing solutions of multiscale partial differential equations (PDEs) and tackling convergence issues with static domain decomposition.

Method: The method introduces adaptive-basis PINNs that dynamically adjust subdomains during training based on residual loss, similar to mesh refinement techniques. New subdomains are added in challenging areas to enhance expressiveness and prevent convergence to local minima.

Result: Numerical experiments show AB-PINNs effectively solve complex multiscale PDEs, demonstrating its improved ability to capture multiscale features compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: AB-PINNs are a flexible, adaptive approach for training PINNs, supporting multiscale solutions, reducing hyperparameter tuning, and overcoming static decomposition challenges.

Abstract: We introduce adaptive-basis physics-informed neural networks (AB-PINNs), a
novel approach to domain decomposition for training PINNs in which existing
subdomains dynamically adapt to the intrinsic features of the unknown solution.
Drawing inspiration from classical mesh refinement techniques, we also modify
the domain decomposition on-the-fly throughout training by introducing new
subdomains in regions of high residual loss, thereby providing additional
expressive power where the solution of the differential equation is challenging
to represent. Our flexible approach to domain decomposition is well-suited for
multiscale problems, as different subdomains can learn to capture different
scales of the underlying solution. Moreover, the ability to introduce new
subdomains during training helps prevent convergence to unwanted local minima
and can reduce the need for extensive hyperparameter tuning compared to static
domain decomposition approaches. Throughout, we present comprehensive numerical
results which demonstrate the effectiveness of AB-PINNs at solving a variety of
complex multiscale partial differential equations.

### [298] [MATT-CTR: Unleashing a Model-Agnostic Test-Time Paradigm for CTR Prediction with Confidence-Guided Inference Paths](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08932)
*Moyu Zhang,Yun Chen,Yujun Jin,Jinxin Hu,Yu Zhang,Xiaoyi Zeng*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces MATT, a test-time approach for CTR models focusing on inference optimization using feature confidence scores. Extensive experiments show its effectiveness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to overcome the inefficiencies during CTR model inference, specifically addressing the negative impact of infrequent feature combinations on predictive confidence.

Method: The authors use hierarchical probabilistic hashing to quantify confidence in feature combinations and employ iterative sampling to generate diverse inference paths. Predictions from these paths are aggregated for robustness.

Result: MATT demonstrated enhanced performance in offline experiments and online A/B tests, showing compatibility with various CTR models.

Conclusion: The proposed MATT paradigm effectively optimizes inference phases of CTR models, improving robustness and compatibility without modifying model architectures.

Abstract: Recently, a growing body of research has focused on either optimizing CTR
model architectures to better model feature interactions or refining training
objectives to aid parameter learning, thereby achieving better predictive
performance. However, previous efforts have primarily focused on the training
phase, largely neglecting opportunities for optimization during the inference
phase. Infrequently occurring feature combinations, in particular, can degrade
prediction performance, leading to unreliable or low-confidence outputs. To
unlock the predictive potential of trained CTR models, we propose a
Model-Agnostic Test-Time paradigm (MATT), which leverages the confidence scores
of feature combinations to guide the generation of multiple inference paths,
thereby mitigating the influence of low-confidence features on the final
prediction. Specifically, to quantify the confidence of feature combinations,
we introduce a hierarchical probabilistic hashing method to estimate the
occurrence frequencies of feature combinations at various orders, which serve
as their corresponding confidence scores. Then, using the confidence scores as
sampling probabilities, we generate multiple instance-specific inference paths
through iterative sampling and subsequently aggregate the prediction scores
from multiple paths to conduct robust predictions. Finally, extensive offline
experiments and online A/B tests strongly validate the compatibility and
effectiveness of MATT across existing CTR models.

*Zhen Yang,Yansong Ma,Lei Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Traditional EDL methods use fixed hyperparameters for uncertainty calibration, but MPC introduces dynamic meta-learning to adapt these parameters, improving calibration and generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Static hyperparameters in EDL limit adaptability in dynamic data distributions, leading to poor calibration and high-risk decision-making challenges.

Method: MPC uses bi-level optimization: an inner loop dynamically adapts loss functions, and an outer loop adjusts KL divergence coefficients and Dirichlet prior strengths based on objectives.

Result: MPC significantly improves model reliability and calibration across tasks, along with better uncertainty calibration, prediction accuracy, and sample rejection performance.

Conclusion: The proposed MPC framework enhances adaptability in uncertainty modeling, transforming EDL with dynamic calibration for better outcomes in decision-making tasks.

Abstract: Traditional Evidence Deep Learning (EDL) methods rely on static
hyperparameter for uncertainty calibration, limiting their adaptability in
dynamic data distributions, which results in poor calibration and
generalization in high-risk decision-making tasks. To address this limitation,
we propose the Meta-Policy Controller (MPC), a dynamic meta-learning framework
that adjusts the KL divergence coefficient and Dirichlet prior strengths for
optimal uncertainty modeling. Specifically, MPC employs a bi-level optimization
approach: in the inner loop, model parameters are updated through a dynamically
configured loss function that adapts to the current training state; in the
outer loop, a policy network optimizes the KL divergence coefficient and
class-specific Dirichlet prior strengths based on multi-objective rewards
balancing prediction accuracy and uncertainty quality. Unlike previous methods
with fixed priors, our learnable Dirichlet prior enables flexible adaptation to
class distributions and training dynamics. Extensive experimental results show
that MPC significantly enhances the reliability and calibration of model
predictions across various tasks, improving uncertainty calibration, prediction
accuracy, and performance retention after confidence-based sample rejection.

TL;DR: This paper introduces VARNN, a novel time-series regression model that leverages prediction residuals to improve forecasting in non-stationary environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address challenges in time-series data, including non-stationarity, regime shifts, and heteroscedastic noise that degrade the reliability of standard regression models.

Method: Proposes the Variability-Aware Recursive Neural Network (VARNN) which recalibrates predictions using an error-memory state updated with recent residuals from a short context.

Result: Experiments across diverse datasets demonstrate that VARNN achieves improved performance and lower test mean squared error compared to static, dynamic, and recurrent models.

Conclusion: VARNN provides robust predictions in volatile and drift-prone environments, proving its effectiveness for various time-series applications.

Abstract: Real-world time series data exhibit non-stationary behavior, regime shifts,
and temporally varying noise (heteroscedastic) that degrade the robustness of
standard regression models. We introduce the Variability-Aware Recursive Neural
Network (VARNN), a novel residual-aware architecture for supervised time-series
regression that learns an explicit error memory from recent prediction
residuals and uses it to recalibrate subsequent predictions. VARNN augments a
feed-forward predictor with a learned error-memory state that is updated from
residuals over a short context steps as a signal of variability and drift, and
then conditions the final prediction at the current time step. Across diverse
dataset domains, appliance energy, healthcare, and environmental monitoring,
experimental results demonstrate VARNN achieves superior performance and
attains lower test MSE with minimal computational overhead over static,
dynamic, and recurrent baselines. Our findings show that the VARNN model offers
robust predictions under a drift and volatility environment, highlighting its
potential as a promising framework for time-series learning.

Motivation: The study identifies graph quality as a critical bottleneck for robust performance of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) on TAGs and calls for systematic improvements in the data itself, rather than just model architecture.

Method: The paper proposes LAGA, a framework with four agents (detection, planning, action, evaluation) working in an automated closed loop. It uses a dual-encoder and tri-objective design to enhance graph quality holistically across modalities.

Result: LAGA improves graph quality and achieves state-of-the-art results across nine diverse scenarios involving sparsity, noise, and imbalance, showing its efficacy for various tasks and backbones.

Conclusion: The framework validates the significance of data-centric quality optimization for improving TAG reliability and robust graph learning.

Abstract: Text-attributed graphs (TAGs) have emerged as a powerful representation that
combines structural connections with fine-grained semantics, supporting a wide
range of data-centric applications. However, the performance of graph neural
networks (GNNs) on TAGs is highly sensitive to input quality. Our empirical
study shows that both traditional GNNs and LLM-enhanced GNNs suffer significant
degradation across nine representative scenarios of sparsity, noise, and
imbalance, highlighting graph quality as a critical bottleneck. Existing
approaches mainly focus on improving model architectures, while neglecting
systematic optimization of TAG data itself, leading to limited effectiveness in
practice. To address this gap, we propose LAGA (Large Language and Graph
Agent), a unified multi-agent framework that treats graph quality control as a
first-class, data-centric problem. LAGA integrates four collaborative
agents-detection, planning, action, and evaluation-into an automated closed
loop. At its core, the action agent employs a dual-encoder and tri-objective
design to capture complementary information across modalities and perform
holistic graph quality enhancement. Experiments across nine scenarios show that
LAGA improves graph quality and achieves state-of-the-art performance across
various tasks and backbones, validating data-centric quality optimization as
key to reliable TAGs and robust graph learning.

Abstract: Learning with high-resource data has demonstrated substantial success in
artificial intelligence (AI); however, the costs associated with data
annotation and model training remain significant. A fundamental objective of AI
research is to achieve robust generalization with limited-resource data. This
survey employs agnostic active sampling theory within the Probably
Approximately Correct (PAC) framework to analyze the generalization error and
label complexity associated with learning from low-resource data in both
model-agnostic supervised and unsupervised settings. Based on this analysis, we
investigate a suite of optimization strategies tailored for low-resource data
learning, including gradient-informed optimization, meta-iteration
optimization, geometry-aware optimization, and LLMs-powered optimization.
Furthermore, we provide a comprehensive overview of multiple learning paradigms
that can benefit from low-resource data, including domain transfer,
reinforcement feedback, and hierarchical structure modeling. Finally, we
conclude our analysis and investigation by summarizing the key findings and
highlighting their implications for learning with low-resource data.

*Junyu Xuan,Wenlong Chen,Yingzhen Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Bayesian Optimization (BO) struggles in high-dimensional spaces due to sparse data and poor scalability of surrogate models. This paper introduces HiBBO, a novel framework using HiPPO in VAE to address distribution mismatches and enhance optimization performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: BO is effective for black-box functions but struggles in high-dimensional cases. This necessitates overcoming sparse data and distribution mismatches in latent representations for better optimization.

Method: The paper proposes HiBBO, which incorporates HiPPO mechanisms into Variational Autoencoder construction to achieve consistency between latent and original spaces, improving accuracy in high-dimensional optimization.

Result: Experiments show HiBBO achieves better convergence speeds and solution quality compared to existing VAEBO methods on high-dimensional tasks.

Conclusion: HiBBO bridges gaps between sequence learning and Bayesian optimization, expanding its applicability in neural architecture search, materials science, and broader fields of interest.

Abstract: Bayesian Optimisation (BO) is a powerful tool for optimising expensive
blackbox functions but its effectiveness diminishes in highdimensional spaces
due to sparse data and poor surrogate model scalability While Variational
Autoencoder (VAE) based approaches address this by learning low-dimensional
latent representations the reconstructionbased objective function often brings
the functional distribution mismatch between the latent space and original
space leading to suboptimal optimisation performance In this paper we first
analyse the reason why reconstructiononly loss may lead to distribution
mismatch and then propose HiBBO a novel BO framework that introduces the space
consistency into the latent space construction in VAE using HiPPO - a method
for longterm sequence modelling - to reduce the functional distribution
mismatch between the latent space and original space Experiments on
highdimensional benchmark tasks demonstrate that HiBBO outperforms existing
VAEBO methods in convergence speed and solution quality Our work bridges the
gap between high-dimensional sequence representation learning and efficient
Bayesian Optimisation enabling broader applications in neural architecture
search materials science and beyond.

*Suraj Kumar Sahoo,Narayanan C Krishnan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper explores whether Learned Optimizers (LOs) can learn traditional regularization techniques without explicit application, and shows that regularized LOs outperform unregularized ones in accuracy, generalization, and task transfer.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether Learned Optimizers (LOs) can internalize traditional regularization effects without explicitly incorporating them.

Method: The authors train and compare Learned Optimizers with and without explicit regularizers on standard benchmarks and models, assessing their performance on metrics like accuracy and generalization.

Result: Regularized Learned Optimizers outperform their unregularized counterparts in test accuracy, generalization, and transferability of learned regularization effects.

Conclusion: Learned Optimizers can internalize and replicate regularization strategies without explicit application, challenging the need for optimizee loss regularization in traditional methods.

Abstract: Learned Optimizers (LOs), a type of Meta-learning, have gained traction due
to their ability to be parameterized and trained for efficient optimization.
Traditional gradient-based methods incorporate explicit regularization
techniques such as Sharpness-Aware Minimization (SAM), Gradient-norm Aware
Minimization (GAM), and Gap-guided Sharpness-Aware Minimization (GSAM) to
enhance generalization and convergence. In this work, we explore a fundamental
question: \textbf{Can regularizers be learned?} We empirically demonstrate that
LOs can be trained to learn and internalize the effects of traditional
regularization techniques without explicitly applying them to the objective
function. We validate this through extensive experiments on standard benchmarks
(including MNIST, FMNIST, CIFAR and Neural Networks such as MLP, MLP-Relu and
CNN), comparing LOs trained with and without access to explicit regularizers.
Regularized LOs consistently outperform their unregularized counterparts in
terms of test accuracy and generalization. Furthermore, we show that LOs retain
and transfer these regularization effects to new optimization tasks by
inherently seeking minima similar to those targeted by these regularizers. Our
results suggest that LOs can inherently learn regularization properties,
\textit{challenging the conventional necessity of explicit optimizee loss
regularization.

*Chuyi Tan,Peiwen Yuan,Xinglin Wang,Yiwei Li,Shaoxiong Feng,Yueqi Zhang,Jiayi Shi,Ji Zhang,Boyuan Pan,Yao Hu,Kan Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes Reinforcement Learning with Ensembled Rewards (RLER) to enhance the stability and performance of reinforcement learning with intrinsic rewards, closing the gap between intrinsic and verifiable rewards methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of reinforcement learning with intrinsic rewards (RLIR), particularly the instability caused by biased reward estimation, while scaling the capabilities of large language models in unlabeled settings.

Method: The authors propose RLER, which uses diverse model ensembles and adapts reward interpolation and rollout selection to mitigate reward bias. They define metrics such as $\rho_{\text{noise}}$, $\rho_{\text{selfbias}}$, and $\rho_{\text{symbias}}$ to characterize and address bias.

Result: RLER demonstrated a +13.6% performance improvement over RLIR and performs within 3.6% of reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) in experiments, achieving stable scaling with unlabeled samples.

Conclusion: RLER effectively mitigates instability in RLIR, providing a sustainable and scalable solution for training large language models in unlabeled environments, bridging the performance gap with RLVR.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) scales the reasoning
ability of large language models (LLMs) but remains bottlenecked by limited
labeled samples for continued data scaling. Reinforcement learning with
intrinsic rewards (RLIR), where the policy model assigns rewards to its own
rollouts, enables sustainable scaling in unlabeled settings, yet its
performance and stability lag behind RLVR. We trace this gap to a system bias:
the model tends to overestimate its high-confidence rollouts, leading to biased
and unstable reward estimation. This bias accumulates as training progresses,
with deviations from the oracle drifting toward over-reward, causing unstable
training. We characterize this bias using three metrics: $\rho_{\text{noise}}$,
$\rho_{\text{selfbias}}$, and $\rho_{\text{symbias}}$. We find that
$\rho_{\text{noise}}$ and $\rho_{\text{symbias}}$ impact convergence, while
$\rho_{\text{selfbias}}$ amplifies both correct and incorrect updates, leading
to instability. To mitigate this, we propose reinforcement learning with
ensembled rewards (RLER), which aggregates diverse models and adapts reward
interpolation and rollout selection. Extensive experiments show that RLER
improves by +13.6% over RLIR and is only 3.6% below RLVR, achieving stable
scaling on unlabeled samples, making it highly applicable.

*Kamel Alrashedy,Vriksha Srihari,Zulfiqar Zaidi,Ridam Srivastava,Pradyumna Tambwekar,Matthew Gombolay*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces 'Constraints-of-Thought' (Const-o-T), a framework enhancing Large Language Models' (LLMs) multi-step planning by integrating intent-constraint pairs to focus search and ensure alignment with user intent and constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable LLMs to plan multi-step tasks effectively while aligning with user intent and satisfying symbolic constraints, tackling the limitations of existing reasoning approaches that often produce infeasible or hallucinated steps.

Method: The proposed Const-o-T framework uses (intent, constraint) pairs to structure reasoning steps and integrates them into Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS), pruning infeasible paths and guiding exploration towards semantically valid actions.

Result: Const-o-T demonstrated superior performance compared to baselines across three domains ‚Äì Risk game, CAD code generation, and arithmetic reasoning ‚Äì achieving higher accuracy and better structural alignment.

Conclusion: Const-o-T provides a generalizable method for constraint-guided reasoning in LLMs, improving efficiency, domain adaptability, and alignment with constraints and user intent.

Abstract: While researchers have made significant progress in enabling large language
models (LLMs) to perform multi-step planning, LLMs struggle to ensure that
those plans align with high-level user intent and satisfy symbolic constraints,
especially in complex, multi-step domains. Existing reasoning approaches such
as Chain-of-Thought (CoT), Tree-of-Thought (ToT), and verifier-augmented
methods, expand the search space but often yield infeasible actions or
hallucinated steps. To overcome these limitations, we propose
Constraints-of-Thought (Const-o-T), a framework that provides a structured
prior that enables Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) focus search on semantically
meaningful paths. Each reasoning step is represented as an (intent, constraint)
pair, which serves both to compress the search space and enforce validity.
Unlike prior methods that merely generate reasoning traces or validate outputs
post hoc, Const-o-T uses (intent, constraint)pairs to actively focus the search
toward feasible and meaningful plans. We integrate Const-o-T into MCTS using a
structured representation of intent-constraint pairs constraints prune
infeasible branches and guide exploration toward semantically valid actions,
improving planning efficiency and verifiable decision-making. We demonstrate
across three domains Risk game, CAD code generation, and arithmetic reasoning
that our approach outperforms baselines, yielding higher accuracy and stronger
structural alignment. Our contribution is to demonstrate that Const-of-T offers
a generalizable foundation for constraint-guided reasoning, enabling more
efficient, constraint-aligned, and domain-adaptable planning with LLMs.

*Xiaolong Tu,Dawei Chen,Kyungtae Han,Onur Altintas,Haoxin Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PlatformX introduces a state-of-the-art HW-NAS framework combining energy efficiency, versatility, and automation for real-world edge device applications, outperforming existing methods in terms of both accuracy and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current HW-NAS methods are impractical for deployment due to high time costs, dependency on manual profiling, and lack of scalability across diverse hardware platforms with unique energy behaviors.

Method: PlatformX employs an energy-driven search space, a transferable energy predictor, a Pareto-based search algorithm, and a runtime energy profiling system for automated real-world hardware-aware NAS.

Result: PlatformX demonstrates reduced search overhead while achieving 0.94 accuracy or as low as 0.16 mJ per inference, outperforming MobileNet-V2 in both accuracy and energy efficiency.

Conclusion: PlatformX offers a scalable, automated, and efficient HW-NAS framework for designing DNNs optimized for diverse edge devices, bridging gaps in applicability and practicality for real-world deployment.

Abstract: Hardware-Aware Neural Architecture Search (HW-NAS) has emerged as a powerful
tool for designing efficient deep neural networks (DNNs) tailored to edge
devices. However, existing methods remain largely impractical for real-world
deployment due to their high time cost, extensive manual profiling, and poor
scalability across diverse hardware platforms with complex, device-specific
energy behavior. In this paper, we present PlatformX, a fully automated and
transferable HW-NAS framework designed to overcome these limitations. PlatformX
integrates four key components: (i) an energy-driven search space that expands
conventional NAS design by incorporating energy-critical configurations,
enabling exploration of high-efficiency architectures; (ii) a transferable
kernel-level energy predictor across devices and incrementally refined with
minimal on-device samples; (iii) a Pareto-based multi-objective search
algorithm that balances energy and accuracy to identify optimal trade-offs; and
(iv) a high-resolution runtime energy profiling system that automates on-device
power measurement using external monitors without human intervention. We
evaluate PlatformX across multiple mobile platforms, showing that it
significantly reduces search overhead while preserving accuracy and energy
fidelity. It identifies models with up to 0.94 accuracy or as little as 0.16 mJ
per inference, both outperforming MobileNet-V2 in accuracy and efficiency. Code

*Ziyi Wang,Nan Jiang,Guang Lin,Qifan Song*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a simultaneous pruning and low-bit quantization framework using Bayesian variational learning for higher compression rates with minimal performance drops.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current approaches to neural network compression (pruning and quantization) are often done separately, leading to suboptimal compression rates while retaining performance.

Method: The paper employs a spike-and-slab prior for inducing sparsity and Gaussian Mixture Models to model quantized weights under a Bayesian variational learning framework (SQS).

Result: Their approach outperforms previous methods, achieving higher compression rates on models like ResNet, BERT-base, Llama3, and Qwen2.5 with similar performance.

Conclusion: The proposed unified framework effectively compresses large-scale neural networks, making them more deployable on resource-constrained devices while maintaining performance.

Abstract: Compressing large-scale neural networks is essential for deploying models on
resource-constrained devices. Most existing methods adopt weight pruning or
low-bit quantization individually, often resulting in suboptimal compression
rates to preserve acceptable performance drops. We introduce a unified
framework for simultaneous pruning and low-bit quantization via Bayesian
variational learning (SQS), which achieves higher compression rates than prior
baselines while maintaining comparable performance. The key idea is to employ a
spike-and-slab prior to inducing sparsity and model quantized weights using
Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs) to enable low-bit precision. In theory, we
provide the consistent result of our proposed variational approach to a sparse
and quantized deep neural network. Extensive experiments on compressing ResNet,
BERT-base, Llama3, and Qwen2.5 models show that our method achieves higher
compression rates than a line of existing methods with comparable performance
drops.

*Changsheng Wang,Yihua Zhang,Dennis Wei,Jinghan Jia,Pin-Yu Chen,Sijia Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper explores the issue of unlearning in large language models (LLMs) when undesirable knowledge needs to be removed, focusing on scenarios with noisy and low-quality forget data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address ethical and security concerns such as memorization of sensitive data, biases, and harmful content by investigating LLM unlearning under realistic conditions where forget data is noisy or perturbed.

Method: Benchmarking state-of-the-art LLM unlearning methods, RMU and NPO, on noisy forget sets and proposing a saliency-based interpretation to explain robustness.

Result: Finds that unlearning is surprisingly robust to perturbations in forget data as long as core semantic signals are preserved.

Conclusion: Unlearning algorithms rely on deep semantic cues and retain effectiveness despite substantial variations in data quality and surface forms.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) exhibit remarkable generative capabilities but
raise ethical and security concerns by memorizing sensitive data, reinforcing
biases, and producing harmful content. These risks have spurred interest in LLM
unlearning, the task of removing knowledge associated with undesirable data
from pre-trained models. However, most existing methods assume access to clean,
well-defined forget data samples, whereas real-world forget data could often be
low-quality, synthetically rewritten, or watermarked, casting doubt on the
reliability of unlearning. This work presents the first study of unlearning
under perturbed or low-fidelity forget data, referred to as noisy forget sets.
By systematically benchmarking state-of-the-art LLM unlearning methods, RMU and
NPO, on such noisy forget sets, we find that unlearning remains surprisingly
robust to perturbations, provided that core semantic signals are preserved. To
explain this robustness, we propose a saliency-based interpretation: key
semantic components that drive forgetting remain consistently influential
despite substantial variation in surface form. This suggests that unlearning
algorithms are primarily guided by deep semantic cues rather than shallow
lexical patterns.

*Rui Bu,Haofeng Zhong,Wenzheng Chen,Yangyan Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Transformer-based large models suffer from inefficiencies due to extreme-token phenomena. The paper proposes Value-State Gated Attention (VGA) to address these issues and enhance model performance and stability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper is motivated by problems in Transformer models, such as attention sinks and value-state drains, which lead to performance degradation and inefficient mechanisms.

Method: A novel mechanism called Value-State Gated Attention (VGA) is introduced. VGA uses a learnable gate derived from value vectors to regulate interactions between attention and value states.

Result: Experiments show VGA effectively mitigates attention sinks, stabilizes value-state norms, improves model performance, enhances quantization fidelity, and boosts interpretability.

Conclusion: VGA is a stable and efficient architectural enhancement for Transformer models, successfully breaking problematic reinforcement cycles and improving overall model efficiency.

Abstract: Large models based on the Transformer architecture are susceptible to
extreme-token phenomena, such as attention sinks and value-state drains. These
issues, which degrade model performance, quantization fidelity, and
interpretability, arise from a problematic mutual reinforcement mechanism where
the model learns an inefficient 'no-op' behavior by focusing attention on
tokens with near-zero value states. In this paper, we propose Value-State Gated
Attention (VGA), a simple, dedicated, and stable architectural mechanism for
performing 'no-op' attention efficiently by directly breaking this cycle. VGA
introduces a learnable, data-dependent gate, computed directly from the value
vectors (V), to modulate the output. Through a theoretical analysis of the
underlying gradients, we show that gating the value-state with a function of
itself is more effective at decoupling value and attention score updates than
prior methods that gate on input embeddings. This creates a direct regulatory
pathway that allows the model to suppress a token's contribution based on its
emergent value representation. Our experiments demonstrate that VGA
significantly mitigates the formation of attention sinks and stabilizes
value-state norms, leading to improved performance, robust quantization
fidelity, and enhanced model interpretability.

*Ian Harshbarger,Calvin Chidambaram*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Slim Scheduler, a framework combining reinforcement learning and algorithmic schedulers to optimize distributed inference for neural networks, achieving significant latency and energy reductions while balancing accuracy and throughput.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the inefficiency in neural network scheduling, particularly adapting static models to heterogeneous hardware and runtime conditions.

Method: Integrates PPO reinforcement learning with greedy schedulers in a hierarchical design, using local batching and scaling combined with global routing policies.

Result: Slim Scheduler achieved up to 96.45% latency reduction and 97.31% energy savings with specific accuracy trade-offs, and optimized throughput with controlled accuracy and variability.

Conclusion: Slim Scheduler provides a dynamic, hardware-adaptive solution for neural network scheduling, balancing trade-offs between efficiency, energy usage, and accuracy.

Abstract: Most neural network scheduling research focuses on optimizing static,
end-to-end models of fixed width, overlooking dynamic approaches that adapt to
heterogeneous hardware and fluctuating runtime conditions. We present Slim
Scheduler, a hybrid scheduling framework that integrates a Proximal Policy
Optimization (PPO) reinforcement learning policy with algorithmic, greedy
schedulers to coordinate distributed inference for slimmable models. Each
server runs a local greedy scheduler that batches compatible requests and
manages instance scaling based on VRAM and utilization constraints, while the
PPO router learns global routing policies for device selection, width ratio,
and batch configuration. This hierarchical design reduces search space
complexity, mitigates overfitting to specific hardware, and balances efficiency
and throughput. Compared to a purely randomized task distribution baseline,
Slim Scheduler can achieve various accuracy and latency trade-offs such as: A
96.45% reduction in mean latency and a 97.31% reduction in energy usage
dropping accuracy to the slimmest model available (70.3%). It can then
accomplish an overall reduction in average latency plus energy consumption with
an increase in accuracy at the cost of higher standard deviations of said
latency and energy, effecting overall task throughput.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MagicDock is a novel framework for de novo ligand design using a combination of gradient inversion and differentiable surface modeling, achieving superior docking validity and flexibility in ligand generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to tackle limitations in current ligand design methods, especially in terms of pseudo-de novo approaches, constrained docking models, and lack of flexibility in handling diverse ligand types, to achieve broader biomedical relevance.

Method: The method employs a gradient inversion framework for integrating docking knowledge into ligand generation processes and uses differentiable surface modeling to capture spatial details via 3D point-clouds. Customized ligand designs enhance flexibility within a unified framework.

Result: Experiments on 9 scenarios reveal MagicDock outperforms state-of-the-art baselines with average improvements of 27.1% for proteins and 11.7% for molecule ligand design.

Conclusion: MagicDock ensures higher efficiency and broader applicability in de novo ligand design, supported by rigorous theoretical guarantees and experimentally validated improvements.

Abstract: De novo ligand design is a fundamental task that seeks to generate protein or
molecule candidates that can effectively dock with protein receptors and
achieve strong binding affinity entirely from scratch. It holds paramount
significance for a wide spectrum of biomedical applications. However, most
existing studies are constrained by the \textbf{Pseudo De Novo},
\textbf{Limited Docking Modeling}, and \textbf{Inflexible Ligand Type}. To
address these issues, we propose MagicDock, a forward-looking framework
grounded in the progressive pipeline and differentiable surface modeling. (1)
We adopt a well-designed gradient inversion framework. To begin with, general
docking knowledge of receptors and ligands is incorporated into the backbone
model. Subsequently, the docking knowledge is instantiated as reverse gradient
flows by binding prediction, which iteratively guide the de novo generation of
ligands. (2) We emphasize differentiable surface modeling in the docking
process, leveraging learnable 3D point-cloud representations to precisely
capture binding details, thereby ensuring that the generated ligands preserve
docking validity through direct and interpretable spatial fingerprints. (3) We
introduce customized designs for different ligand types and integrate them into
a unified gradient inversion framework with flexible triggers, thereby ensuring
broad applicability. Moreover, we provide rigorous theoretical guarantees for
each component of MagicDock. Extensive experiments across 9 scenarios
demonstrate that MagicDock achieves average improvements of 27.1\% and 11.7\%
over SOTA baselines specialized for protein or molecule ligand design,
respectively.

*Cl√©ment Morand,Anne-Laure Ligozat,Aur√©lie N√©v√©ol*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper investigates the increasing environmental impacts of ML model training, particularly focusing on hardware lifecycle and proposes questioning current scaling trends.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to explore the growing computational and environmental costs of training ML models and assess whether current optimization strategies make ML training sustainable.

Method: The study analyzes the environmental effects of training AI systems over the last decade, with particular emphasis on life cycle assessments of graphics card production.

Result: It finds that hardware production impacts have consistently risen, and energy consumption during ML model training has grown exponentially despite optimization efforts, which may induce a rebound effect.

Conclusion: Efficiency optimization alone is insufficient for sustainability; reducing the scale and frequency of heavy-duty AI model training is necessary to mitigate environmental impacts.

Abstract: Recent Machine Learning (ML) approaches have shown increased performance on
benchmarks but at the cost of escalating computational demands. Hardware,
algorithmic and carbon optimizations have been proposed to curb energy
consumption and environmental impacts. Can these strategies lead to sustainable
ML model training? Here, we estimate the environmental impacts associated with
training notable AI systems over the last decade, including Large Language
Models, with a focus on the life cycle of graphics cards. Our analysis reveals
two critical trends: First, the impacts of graphics cards production have
increased steadily over this period; Second, energy consumption and
environmental impacts associated with training ML models have increased
exponentially, even when considering reduction strategies such as location
shifting to places with less carbon intensive electricity mixes. Optimization
strategies do not mitigate the impacts induced by model training, evidencing
rebound effect. We show that the impacts of hardware must be considered over
the entire life cycle rather than the sole use phase in order to avoid impact
shifting. Our study demonstrates that increasing efficiency alone cannot ensure
sustainability in ML. Mitigating the environmental impact of AI also requires
reducing AI activities and questioning the scale and frequency of
resource-intensive training.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper critiques the current evaluation methods of language model defenses, advocating for testing against adaptive, resourceful attackers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors want to improve the evaluation methods for robustness in defenses against jailbreaks and prompt injections, as current methods are inadequate.

Method: They systematically enhanced general optimization techniques like gradient descent, reinforcement learning, random search, and human-guided exploration to simulate adaptive attackers.

Result: They demonstrated over 90% attack success rates on 12 recent defenses, which previously reported near-zero attack success rates.

Conclusion: Future defense research should account for adaptive, stronger attackers to ensure credible robustness claims.

Abstract: How should we evaluate the robustness of language model defenses? Current
defenses against jailbreaks and prompt injections (which aim to prevent an
attacker from eliciting harmful knowledge or remotely triggering malicious
actions, respectively) are typically evaluated either against a static set of
harmful attack strings, or against computationally weak optimization methods
that were not designed with the defense in mind. We argue that this evaluation
process is flawed.
  Instead, we should evaluate defenses against adaptive attackers who
explicitly modify their attack strategy to counter a defense's design while
spending considerable resources to optimize their objective. By systematically
tuning and scaling general optimization techniques-gradient descent,
reinforcement learning, random search, and human-guided exploration-we bypass
12 recent defenses (based on a diverse set of techniques) with attack success
rate above 90% for most; importantly, the majority of defenses originally
reported near-zero attack success rates. We believe that future defense work
must consider stronger attacks, such as the ones we describe, in order to make
reliable and convincing claims of robustness.

### [315] [Convergence of optimizers implies eigenvalues filtering at equilibrium](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09034)
*Jerome Bolte,Quoc-Tung Le,Edouard Pauwels*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper examines the role of optimizers in deep neural network training by reinterpreting them as eigenvalue filters that influence convergence to wider or narrower minima, proposing two new optimizers for promoting wide minima.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Recent evidence shows that certain optimizers tend to find near-global optima in deep learning, prompting the authors to explore the mechanisms behind this behavior and its implications.

Method: The authors analyze optimizer behavior using the edge-of-stability theory, propose two new algorithms for enhanced eigenvalue filtering, and validate their findings through theoretical analysis and numerical experiments on feed-forward neural networks.

Result: The proposed algorithms demonstrate better eigenvalue filtering abilities, promoting the discovery of wider minima in comparison to standard methods.

Conclusion: Optimizers act as eigenvalue filters, and certain approaches like Sharpness-Aware Minimization explicitly favor wide minima. The proposed methods further enhance this capability, potentially improving neural network training results.

Abstract: Ample empirical evidence in deep neural network training suggests that a
variety of optimizers tend to find nearly global optima. In this article, we
adopt the reversed perspective that convergence to an arbitrary point is
assumed rather than proven, focusing on the consequences of this assumption.
From this viewpoint, in line with recent advances on the edge-of-stability
phenomenon, we argue that different optimizers effectively act as eigenvalue
filters determined by their hyperparameters. Specifically, the standard
gradient descent method inherently avoids the sharpest minima, whereas
Sharpness-Aware Minimization (SAM) algorithms go even further by actively
favoring wider basins. Inspired by these insights, we propose two novel
algorithms that exhibit enhanced eigenvalue filtering, effectively promoting
wider minima. Our theoretical analysis leverages a generalized Hadamard--Perron
stable manifold theorem and applies to general semialgebraic $C^2$ functions,
without requiring additional non-degeneracy conditions or global Lipschitz
bound assumptions. We support our conclusions with numerical experiments on
feed-forward neural networks.

### [316] [Robust Driving Control for Autonomous Vehicles: An Intelligent General-sum Constrained Adversarial Reinforcement Learning Approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09041)
*Junchao Fan,Xiaolin Chang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper presents IGCARL, a novel robust DRL approach for autonomous driving that excels in handling strategic adversarial attacks and ensuring safety-critical event mitigation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address key vulnerabilities in current robust DRL for autonomous driving, including weaknesses against strategic adversarial attacks, inability to handle safety-critical events effectively, and instability caused by lack of robust constraints.

Method: The proposed IGCARL framework includes a strategic targeted adversary designed for multi-step attacks and a robust driving agent optimized under constrained formulations to mitigate policy drift and instability.

Result: IGCARL outperforms state-of-the-art methods by at least 27.9% in success rate, demonstrating improved robustness under adversarial conditions and enhancing the safety of DRL-based autonomous driving systems.

Conclusion: IGCARL is a significant advancement in robust DRL, addressing key issues in existing methods and ensuring enhanced reliability, safety, and effectiveness in autonomous driving under adversarial conditions.

Abstract: Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has demonstrated remarkable success in
developing autonomous driving policies. However, its vulnerability to
adversarial attacks remains a critical barrier to real-world deployment.
Although existing robust methods have achieved success, they still suffer from
three key issues: (i) these methods are trained against myopic adversarial
attacks, limiting their abilities to respond to more strategic threats, (ii)
they have trouble causing truly safety-critical events (e.g., collisions), but
instead often result in minor consequences, and (iii) these methods can
introduce learning instability and policy drift during training due to the lack
of robust constraints. To address these issues, we propose Intelligent
General-sum Constrained Adversarial Reinforcement Learning (IGCARL), a novel
robust autonomous driving approach that consists of a strategic targeted
adversary and a robust driving agent. The strategic targeted adversary is
designed to leverage the temporal decision-making capabilities of DRL to
execute strategically coordinated multi-step attacks. In addition, it
explicitly focuses on inducing safety-critical events by adopting a general-sum
objective. The robust driving agent learns by interacting with the adversary to
develop a robust autonomous driving policy against adversarial attacks. To
ensure stable learning in adversarial environments and to mitigate policy drift
caused by attacks, the agent is optimized under a constrained formulation.
Extensive experiments show that IGCARL improves the success rate by at least
27.9\% over state-of-the-art methods, demonstrating superior robustness to
adversarial attacks and enhancing the safety and reliability of DRL-based
autonomous driving.

*Jose Tupayachi,Mustafa C. Camur,Kevin Heaslip,Xueping Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper presents a spatio-temporal forecasting model (TW-GCN) to predict EV charging demand in Tennessee using real-world data and Graph Convolutional Networks combined with temporal architectures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address challenges in grid stability and investment planning caused by uneven spatial distribution and irregular utilization of EV charging infrastructure, which is critical for reducing greenhouse gas emissions in transportation.

Method: The study proposes the TW-GCN framework, which integrates Graph Convolutional Networks with temporal forecasting models, using data such as traffic flows, weather, and proprietary EV charging data to predict spatial and temporal charging demands.

Result: Experiments show that 3-hour forecasting achieves the best balance between responsiveness and stability. Additionally, 1DCNN outperforms other temporal models. Regional analysis reveals disparities in model accuracy due to factors like station density and population.

Conclusion: The TW-GCN framework offers a data-driven approach to enhance EV infrastructure planning, ensuring sustainable mobility and resilient power grid management.

Abstract: Transportation remains a major contributor to greenhouse gas emissions,
highlighting the urgency of transitioning toward sustainable alternatives such
as electric vehicles (EVs). Yet, uneven spatial distribution and irregular
utilization of charging infrastructure create challenges for both power grid
stability and investment planning. This study introduces TW-GCN, a
spatio-temporal forecasting framework that combines Graph Convolutional
Networks with temporal architectures to predict EV charging demand in
Tennessee, United States (U.S.). We utilize real-world traffic flows, weather
conditions, and proprietary data provided by one of the largest EV
infrastructure company in the U.S. to capture both spatial dependencies and
temporal dynamics. Extensive experiments across varying lag horizons,
clustering strategies, and sequence lengths reveal that mid-horizon (3-hour)
forecasts achieve the best balance between responsiveness and stability, with
1DCNN consistently outperforming other temporal models. Regional analysis shows
disparities in predictive accuracy across East, Middle, and West Tennessee,
reflecting how station density, population, and local demand variability shape
model performance. The proposed TW-GCN framework advances the integration of
data-driven intelligence into EV infrastructure planning, supporting both
sustainable mobility transitions and resilient grid management.

*Emilio Mastriani,Alessandro Costa,Federico Incardona,Kevin Munari,Sebastiano Spinello*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper investigates how using segmentation techniques as a preprocessing step can improve anomaly detection in industrial processes, enhancing AUC-ROC performance significantly.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve anomaly detection in multivariate industrial time series data by leveraging segmentation techniques that reduce temporal uncertainty and enhance algorithm learning.

Method: The authors applied segmentation techniques as a pre-processing step and combined them with a heterogeneous ensemble of supervised learning models (e.g., Random Forest, XGBoost) to detect anomalies.

Result: The segmentation approach improved the AUC-ROC metric from 0.8599 (PCA and LSTM ensemble) to 0.9760 (Random Forest and XGBoost ensemble), highlighting its effectiveness.

Conclusion: Including segmentation techniques not only reduces temporal ambiguity but also significantly enhances the performance of supervised anomaly detection models in complex industrial settings.

Abstract: Concerning machine learning, segmentation models can identify state changes
within time series, facilitating the detection of transitions between normal
and anomalous conditions. Specific techniques such as Change Point Detection
(CPD), particularly algorithms like ChangeFinder, have been successfully
applied to segment time series and improve anomaly detection by reducing
temporal uncertainty, especially in multivariate environments. In this work, we
explored how the integration of segmentation techniques, combined with a
heterogeneous ensemble, can enhance anomaly detection in an industrial
production context. The results show that applying segmentation as a
pre-processing step before selecting heterogeneous ensemble algorithms provided
a significant advantage in our case study, improving the AUC-ROC metric from
0.8599 (achieved with a PCA and LSTM ensemble) to 0.9760 (achieved with Random
Forest and XGBoost). This improvement is imputable to the ability of
segmentation to reduce temporal ambiguity and facilitate the learning process
of supervised algorithms. In our future work, we intend to assess the benefit
of introducing weighted features derived from the study of change points,
combined with segmentation and the use of heterogeneous ensembles, to further
optimize model performance in early anomaly detection.

*Atul Shree,Harshith Jupuru*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces FLToP CTC, an efficient decoding algorithm addressing compute and memory bottlenecks in CTC-based ASR systems by pruning low-probability tokens at the frame level, achieving faster runtime and reduced memory usage with negligible performance loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CTC-based ASR systems face significant inefficiencies in computational and memory usage during decoding, especially in resource-limited settings and real-time environments.

Method: The proposed FLToP CTC algorithm dynamically prunes low-probability tokens at each frame using a relative threshold probability to reduce computational demands without significantly affecting model performance.

Result: FLToP CTC demonstrates a 10.5x runtime speedup and a 2.78x memory reduction compared to traditional CTC decoders while achieving negligible WER degradation on LibriSpeech.

Conclusion: FLToP CTC substantially improves the scalability and efficiency of CTC-based ASR systems, making them more suitable for resource-constrained and real-time applications while maintaining high accuracy.

Abstract: CTC-based ASR systems face computational and memory bottlenecks in
resource-limited environments. Traditional CTC decoders, requiring up to 90% of
processing time in systems (e.g., wav2vec2-large on L4 GPUs), face
inefficiencies due to exhaustive token-level operations. This paper introduces
Frame Level Token Pruning for Connectionist Temporal Classification (FLToP
CTC), a novel decoding algorithm that employs frame-level token pruning guided
by a relative threshold probability. By dynamically eliminating low-probability
tokens per frame, FLToP CTC reduces compute and memory demands while
maintaining negligible WER degradation. On LibriSpeech, FLToP CTC achieves a
10.5x runtime speedup and 2.78x memory reduction versus standard CTC decoders.
Its simplicity enables seamless integration into CTC decoders across platforms
(CPUs, GPUs, etc.). FLToP CTC addresses CTC bottlenecks, offering scalability
for resource-limited environments and realtime applications, enhancing speech
recognition accessibility and efficiency.

*Yimu Zhang,Yuanshi Liu,Cong Fang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: AdaPM is a memory-efficient optimizer for training large language models by utilizing adaptive partial momentum and bias correction techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the memory constraints of storing momentum in training large language models.

Method: Developed AdaPM that applies non-uniform momentum design with bias correction to reduce memory while preserving optimization performance.

Result: Achieved over 90% memory reduction for momentum and up to 95% reduction in optimizer states, improving computational efficiency in model training.

Conclusion: AdaPM successfully optimizes memory usage in training large-scale language models without compromising training efficiency or model performance.

Abstract: In the training of large language models, momentum is widely used and often
demonstrated to achieve significant acceleration. However, storing momentum
typically presents memory challenges. In this paper, we propose AdaPM, an
adaptive training strategy that leverages partial momentum to implement a
memory-efficient optimizer. To this end, AdaPM utilizes a non-uniform momentum
design: for most blocks, full momentum is not necessary to preserve the
performance of the optimization. In the momentum design of AdaPM, to mitigate
the bias and performance loss caused by partial momentum, we enhance the
partial momentum by a bias correction technique. Empirically, we verify that
our approach reduces memory by over $90\%$ in momentum while maintaining both
efficiency and performance for pretraining various language models ranging from
60M to 1.5B, as well as for supervised fine-tuning and RLHF. AdaPM can further
reduce memory by up to $95\%$ in optimizer states by combining the
memory-efficient technique on the second-order statistic, saving over $30\%$
GPU hours for pretraining GPT-2 1.5B.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of achieving a balance between natural accuracy and adversarial robustness in machine learning models.

Method: MemLoss uses 'Memory Adversarial Examples,' which are retained adversarial examples from prior epochs, during training to improve both accuracy and robustness.

Result: Experimental results on datasets like CIFAR-10 show that MemLoss outperforms existing adversarial training methods in accuracy and robustness.

Conclusion: MemLoss provides a promising approach to adversarial training, enhancing defense against attacks while maintaining high model performance on clean data.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a new approach called MemLoss to improve the
adversarial training of machine learning models. MemLoss leverages previously
generated adversarial examples, referred to as 'Memory Adversarial Examples,'
to enhance model robustness and accuracy without compromising performance on
clean data. By using these examples across training epochs, MemLoss provides a
balanced improvement in both natural accuracy and adversarial robustness.
Experimental results on multiple datasets, including CIFAR-10, demonstrate that
our method achieves better accuracy compared to existing adversarial training
methods while maintaining strong robustness against attacks.

### [322] [On the Fairness of Privacy Protection: Measuring and Mitigating the Disparity of Group Privacy Risks for Differentially Private Machine Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09114)
*Zhi Yang,Changwu Huang,Ke Tang,Xin Yao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper examines disparities in group privacy protection in differentially private machine learning (DPML) and introduces a novel auditing method and an adapted DP-SGD algorithm for improved fairness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Group privacy risks in DPML remain insufficiently addressed, and existing evaluation methods are either average-based or impractical for worst-case scenarios.

Method: The authors propose a membership inference game for auditing worst-case privacy risks and introduce an adaptive group-specific gradient clipping strategy to modify the DP-SGD algorithm.

Result: The proposed auditing method succeeds in measuring disparities in group privacy risks, and the improved DP-SGD reduces these disparities effectively.

Conclusion: By implementing these approaches, fairness in privacy protection across groups in DPML can be enhanced, offering a reliable framework for addressing group privacy concerns.

Abstract: While significant progress has been made in conventional fairness-aware
machine learning (ML) and differentially private ML (DPML), the fairness of
privacy protection across groups remains underexplored. Existing studies have
proposed methods to assess group privacy risks, but these are based on the
average-case privacy risks of data records. Such approaches may underestimate
the group privacy risks, thereby potentially underestimating the disparity
across group privacy risks. Moreover, the current method for assessing the
worst-case privacy risks of data records is time-consuming, limiting their
practical applicability. To address these limitations, we introduce a novel
membership inference game that can efficiently audit the approximate worst-case
privacy risks of data records. Experimental results demonstrate that our method
provides a more stringent measurement of group privacy risks, yielding a
reliable assessment of the disparity in group privacy risks. Furthermore, to
promote privacy protection fairness in DPML, we enhance the standard DP-SGD
algorithm with an adaptive group-specific gradient clipping strategy, inspired
by the design of canaries in differential privacy auditing studies. Extensive
experiments confirm that our algorithm effectively reduces the disparity in
group privacy risks, thereby enhancing the fairness of privacy protection in
DPML.

### [323] [Regret Bounds for Adversarial Contextual Bandits with General Function Approximation and Delayed Feedback](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09127)
*Orin Levy,Liad Erez,Alon Cohen,Yishay Mansour*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces algorithms for contextual multi-armed bandit (CMAB) problems with delayed feedback, achieving optimal regret bounds in various settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenge of delayed feedback in CMAB problems where delays are adversarially chosen.

Method: Develop regret minimization algorithms leveraging policy classes and online least-square regression oracle for general function approximation.

Result: Achieved optimal regret bounds considering delays, with refinements including stability analysis of Hedge-based regression oracle.

Conclusion: Proposed algorithms significantly improve handling of delayed feedback in CMAB, approaching theoretical lower bounds.

Abstract: We present regret minimization algorithms for the contextual multi-armed
bandit (CMAB) problem over $K$ actions in the presence of delayed feedback, a
scenario where loss observations arrive with delays chosen by an adversary. As
a preliminary result, assuming direct access to a finite policy class $\Pi$ we
establish an optimal expected regret bound of $ O (\sqrt{KT \log |\Pi|} +
\sqrt{D \log |\Pi|)} $ where $D$ is the sum of delays. For our main
contribution, we study the general function approximation setting over a
(possibly infinite) contextual loss function class $ \mathcal{F} $ with access
to an online least-square regression oracle $\mathcal{O}$ over $\mathcal{F}$.
In this setting, we achieve an expected regret bound of
$O(\sqrt{KT\mathcal{R}_T(\mathcal{O})} + \sqrt{ d_{\max} D \beta})$ assuming
FIFO order, where $d_{\max}$ is the maximal delay, $\mathcal{R}_T(\mathcal{O})$
is an upper bound on the oracle's regret and $\beta$ is a stability parameter
associated with the oracle. We complement this general result by presenting a
novel stability analysis of a Hedge-based version of Vovk's aggregating
forecaster as an oracle implementation for least-square regression over a
finite function class $\mathcal{F}$ and show that its stability parameter
$\beta$ is bounded by $\log |\mathcal{F}|$, resulting in an expected regret
bound of $O(\sqrt{KT \log |\mathcal{F}|} + \sqrt{d_{\max} D \log
|\mathcal{F}|})$ which is a $\sqrt{d_{\max}}$ factor away from the lower bound
of $\Omega(\sqrt{KT \log |\mathcal{F}|} + \sqrt{D \log |\mathcal{F}|})$ that we
also present.

*Petrus Mikkola,Luigi Acerbi,Arto Klami*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper explores density estimation using pairwise comparisons, focusing on extracting target densities and belief systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to improve expert knowledge elicitation and learning from human feedback using pairwise comparisons.

Method: Score-matching is applied to learn the winner's score, followed by de-tempering techniques and diffusion models to analyze multivariate belief densities.

Result: The authors demonstrate complex belief density estimation with minimal data using score-scaled annealed Langevin dynamics under the Bradley-Terry model.

Conclusion: The research provides a viable approach to infer belief densities from limited pairwise comparison data, enhancing human feedback learning systems.

Abstract: We study density estimation from pairwise comparisons, motivated by expert
knowledge elicitation and learning from human feedback. We relate the
unobserved target density to a tempered winner density (marginal density of
preferred choices), learning the winner's score via score-matching. This allows
estimating the target by `de-tempering' the estimated winner density's score.
We prove that the score vectors of the belief and the winner density are
collinear, linked by a position-dependent tempering field. We give analytical
formulas for this field and propose an estimator for it under the Bradley-Terry
model. Using a diffusion model trained on tempered samples generated via
score-scaled annealed Langevin dynamics, we can learn complex multivariate
belief densities of simulated experts, from only hundreds to thousands of
pairwise comparisons.

*Suming Qiu,Jing Li,Zhicheng Zhou,Junjie Huang,Linyuan Qiu,Zhijie Sun*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper addresses the challenge of improving large language model (LLM) performance on specialized tasks without compromising general capabilities. It introduces a novel two-stage framework, Logits Replay + MoClip, for efficient and stable adaptation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation of this paper lies in addressing the trade-off faced by LLMs during post-training, where gains on specialized tasks often lead to degradation in general performance. Existing methods either require high computation resources, extensive data access, or fail to adapt flexibly. The paper explores efficient training signal compression to solve these challenges.

Method: The proposed method includes a two-stage approach: (1) Logits Replay, where compact subsets of top-K token logits are recorded and replayed with renormalized losses, and (2) MoClip, a custom optimizer that stabilizes optimization using gradient-momentum rotation caps and rescaling with arctan2.

Result: Empirical results show improvement in domain-specific tasks like Communication Technology (CT) and NL2SQL while preventing general performance degradation across benchmarks such as MMLU, BBH, GPQA, and MATH. Training costs are reduced by over 40%.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that their framework, Logits Replay + MoClip, provides a scalable and architecture-agnostic approach to domain adaptation of LLMs, enabling specialization without sacrificing generalization.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often face a trade-off in post-training:
improvements on specialized domains frequently come at the expense of general
capabilities. Existing solutions attempt to mitigate this tension via
regularization, selective parameter updates, or data-centric replay, but each
imposes significant costs in computation, data access, or adaptability. Recent
work has shown that training signals can be compressed to subsets of logits
without severe accuracy loss, suggesting a path toward efficient adaptation.
However, naive truncation destabilizes optimization and exacerbates forgetting.
  We introduce Logits Replay + MoClip, a two-stage framework that compresses
supervision in the logit space and stabilizes optimization at the update level.
In Stage 0, we record dynamic Top-K token subsets that cover a probability
threshold, always including the gold label. In Stage 1, we replay these compact
subsets to compute exact renormalized losses, avoiding full softmax computation
and implicitly regularizing. To ensure stability, we design MoClip, an
optimizer that caps gradient-momentum rotation and applies an arctan2-based
rescaling of updates. Empirically, our method improves domain performance on
Communication Technology (CT) and NL2SQL tasks while mitigating forgetting on
general benchmarks (MMLU, BBH, GPQA, MATH), and reduces training cost by over
40%. Together, these contributions offer a scalable, architecture-agnostic path
for domain adaptation of LLMs without sacrificing generalization.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Agentic-KGR is a framework that enhances LLMs by enabling mutual co-evolution with dynamic knowledge graphs through reinforcement learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLMs struggle to adapt to dynamic and changing information environments due to reliance on static knowledge bases.

Method: Agentic-KGR introduces three innovations: dynamic schema expansion, retrieval-augmented memory integration, and multi-scale prompt compression for efficient optimization.

Result: The framework significantly improves knowledge extraction and downstream QA task performance, surpassing supervised methods and single-round RL approaches.

Conclusion: Agentic-KGR provides a flexible and scalable solution to enhance accuracy and knowledge coverage in LLMs by enabling continuous adaptation and co-evolution with knowledge graphs.

Abstract: Current knowledge-enhanced large language models (LLMs) rely on static,
pre-constructed knowledge bases that suffer from coverage gaps and temporal
obsolescence, limiting their effectiveness in dynamic information environments.
We present Agentic-KGR, a novel framework enabling co-evolution between LLMs
and knowledge graphs (KGs) through multi-round reinforcement learning (RL). Our
approach introduces three key innovations: (1) a dynamic schema expansion
mechanism that systematically extends graph ontologies beyond pre-defined
boundaries during training; (2) a retrieval-augmented memory system enabling
synergistic co-evolution between model parameters and knowledge structures
through continuous optimization; (3) a learnable multi-scale prompt compression
approach that preserves critical information while reducing computational
complexity through adaptive sequence optimization. Experimental results
demonstrate substantial improvements over supervised baselines and single-round
RL approaches in knowledge extraction tasks. When integrated with GraphRAG, our
method achieves superior performance in downstream QA tasks, with significant
gains in both accuracy and knowledge coverage compared to existing methods.

*Tianyi Chen,Mingcheng Zhu,Zhiyao Luo,Tingting Zhu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper benchmarks methods for representing Electronic Health Records (EHRs) to enable consistent evaluation and provide guidance on method selection based on clinical settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of standardization in evaluating EHR representation methods, which hinders effective deployment of deep learning in clinical predictions.

Method: The paper introduces a unified benchmark that compares multivariate time-series, event streams, and textual event stream representations across two datasets (MIMIC-IV and EHRSHOT) and evaluates their performance under various clinical tasks and model families.

Result: Event stream models perform best overall, with pre-trained models like CLMBR excelling in few-shot scenarios and count-based models showing competitiveness with larger datasets. The impact of feature pruning differs based on the clinical context.

Conclusion: The study provides actionable insights into the selection of EHR representation methods, emphasizing the importance of adapting feature selection strategies to specific clinical needs and data availability.

Abstract: Electronic Health Records (EHRs) enable deep learning for clinical
predictions, but the optimal method for representing patient data remains
unclear due to inconsistent evaluation practices. We present the first
systematic benchmark to compare EHR representation methods, including
multivariate time-series, event streams, and textual event streams for LLMs.
This benchmark standardises data curation and evaluation across two distinct
clinical settings: the MIMIC-IV dataset for ICU tasks (mortality, phenotyping)
and the EHRSHOT dataset for longitudinal care (30-day readmission, 1-year
pancreatic cancer). For each paradigm, we evaluate appropriate modelling
families--including Transformers, MLP, LSTMs and Retain for time-series, CLMBR
and count-based models for event streams, 8-20B LLMs for textual streams--and
analyse the impact of feature pruning based on data missingness. Our
experiments reveal that event stream models consistently deliver the strongest
performance. Pre-trained models like CLMBR are highly sample-efficient in
few-shot settings, though simpler count-based models can be competitive given
sufficient data. Furthermore, we find that feature selection strategies must be
adapted to the clinical setting: pruning sparse features improves ICU
predictions, while retaining them is critical for longitudinal tasks. Our
results, enabled by a unified and reproducible pipeline, provide practical
guidance for selecting EHR representations based on the clinical context and
data regime.

TL;DR: The paper proposes WASI, a subspace-based training method for transformers, which reduces memory usage and computational cost while maintaining accuracy for on-device learning. It achieves faster training on devices like Raspberry Pi.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Modern neural networks are increasingly demanding in terms of computation and memory, posing a challenge for energy-efficient and privacy-centric on-device AI training.

Method: The study introduces Weight-Activation Subspace Iteration (WASI), focusing on subspace training to tackle memory and computational bottlenecks in transformer models.

Result: WASI reduces memory consumption by up to 62√ó, computational cost by up to 2√ó, and achieves 1.5√ó faster training and inference compared to standard training methods.

Conclusion: Subspace-based training like WASI enables efficient and accurate on-device learning, addressing critical issues of computational cost and memory demand for modern AI models.

Abstract: As AI increasingly shapes daily life, energy consumption and data privacy
have become pressing concerns. On-device learning trains models directly on
edge devices, cutting energy consumption and safeguarding data privacy.
However, the expanding scale of modern neural networks creates a major obstacle
for on-device training. Although prior work has concentrated on compact
convolutional architectures, we instead apply subspace-based training to
transformer models. Motivated by the idea that a model's essential information
lies in a fixed subspace, we introduce Weight-Activation Subspace Iteration
(WASI), a method that mitigates the memory bottleneck of backpropagation and
boosts inference efficiency in transformer models by restricting training to
this subspace. Our results demonstrate that WASI maintains accuracy comparable
to vanilla training while reducing memory usage by up to $62\times$ and
computational cost (FLOPs) by up to $2\times$. On a Raspberry Pi 5, WASI
achieves roughly $1.5\times$ faster training and inference than vanilla
training.

TL;DR: This paper introduces a hierarchical model merging scheme for Git Re-Basin, outperforming the standard MergeMany model merging algorithm. It also highlights robustness benefits but notes significant performance drops.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to improve the method for merging trained models using Git Re-Basin, addressing limitations of existing methods like MergeMany and examining robustness effects.

Method: They propose a hierarchical merging algorithm for Re-Basin and experiment to evaluate its effects on robustness and performance drops.

Result: Their algorithm improves merging quality and robustness but shows larger-than-reported performance drops in merged models.

Conclusion: While the hierarchical scheme enhances robustness and merging quality, it comes at the cost of significant performance degradation, which needs further evaluation.

Abstract: This paper takes a closer look at Git Re-Basin, an interesting new approach
to merge trained models. We propose a hierarchical model merging scheme that
significantly outperforms the standard MergeMany algorithm. With our new
algorithm, we find that Re-Basin induces adversarial and perturbation
robustness into the merged models, with the effect becoming stronger the more
models participate in the hierarchical merging scheme. However, in our
experiments Re-Basin induces a much bigger performance drop than reported by
the original authors.

*Ling Zhan,Junjie Huang,Xiaoyao Yu,Wenyu Chen,Tao Jia*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes GCM, a brain network learning framework that incorporates global constraints to improve accuracy and efficiency, achieving significant advancements over state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current approaches for functional brain network (FBN) modeling struggle to capture high-order dependencies and are computationally expensive, preventing effective end-to-end learning directly from data distributions.

Method: The authors introduce the Global Constraints oriented Multi-resolution (GCM) framework that embeds global constraints such as signal synchronization, identity, edge count, and data labels, enabling FBN structure learning at four levels of resolution (sample/subject/group/project).

Result: GCM demonstrates up to a 30.6% improvement in relative accuracy and a 96.3% reduction in computational time when compared to 9 baselines and 10 state-of-the-art methods across multiple datasets and task settings.

Conclusion: The research provides a new approach to FBN structure learning with fewer computational burdens and enhanced interpretability, opening new avenues for applications in cognitive neuroscience.

Abstract: Functional brain network (FBN) modeling often relies on local pairwise
interactions, whose limitation in capturing high-order dependencies is
theoretically analyzed in this paper. Meanwhile, the computational burden and
heuristic nature of current hypergraph modeling approaches hinder end-to-end
learning of FBN structures directly from data distributions. To address this,
we propose to extract high-order FBN structures under global constraints, and
implement this as a Global Constraints oriented Multi-resolution (GCM) FBN
structure learning framework. It incorporates 4 types of global constraint
(signal synchronization, subject identity, expected edge numbers, and data
labels) to enable learning FBN structures for 4 distinct levels
(sample/subject/group/project) of modeling resolution. Experimental results
demonstrate that GCM achieves up to a 30.6% improvement in relative accuracy

### [331] [On the Implicit Adversariality of Catastrophic Forgetting in Deep Continual Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09181)
*Ze Peng,Jian Zhang,Jintao Guo,Lei Qi,Yang Gao,Yinghuan Shi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper explores the reason behind catastrophic forgetting in continual learning, showing it as an adversarial alignment of new-task gradients with old-task loss landscape directions, and proposes a new method (backGP) to mitigate it.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to understand and address the problem of catastrophic forgetting in continual learning, which limits the ability of machine intelligence to retain old knowledge when acquiring new tasks.

Method: The authors analyze catastrophic forgetting by introducing adversarial alignment as a mechanism and validate it theoretically. They propose backGP, an improvement on gradient projection (GP) methods, to mitigate both forward and backward propagation-induced alignment.

Result: BackGP reduces forgetting by 10.8% and improves accuracy by 12.7% on average compared to existing GP methods.

Conclusion: The study reveals that catastrophic forgetting is an adversarial process driven by low-rank bias during training and provides an effective solution (backGP) to mitigate forgetting and improve continual learning performance.

Abstract: Continual learning seeks the human-like ability to accumulate new skills in
machine intelligence. Its central challenge is catastrophic forgetting, whose
underlying cause has not been fully understood for deep networks. In this
paper, we demystify catastrophic forgetting by revealing that the new-task
training is implicitly an adversarial attack against the old-task knowledge.
Specifically, the new-task gradients automatically and accurately align with
the sharp directions of the old-task loss landscape, rapidly increasing the
old-task loss. This adversarial alignment is intriguingly counter-intuitive
because the sharp directions are too sparsely distributed to align with by
chance. To understand it, we theoretically show that it arises from training's
low-rank bias, which, through forward and backward propagation, confines the
two directions into the same low-dimensional subspace, facilitating alignment.
Gradient projection (GP) methods, a representative family of
forgetting-mitigating methods, reduce adversarial alignment caused by forward
propagation, but cannot address the alignment due to backward propagation. We
propose backGP to address it, which reduces forgetting by 10.8% and improves
accuracy by 12.7% on average over GP methods.

### [332] [Multimodal Prompt Optimization: Why Not Leverage Multiple Modalities for MLLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09201)
*Yumin Choi,Dongki Kim,Jinheon Baek,Sung Ju Hwang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Multimodal Prompt Optimization (MPO), a framework addressing the joint optimization of multimodal prompts to enhance the effectiveness of Multimodal Language Models (MLLMs) across different types of data, outperforming text-only approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prompt optimization methods so far are limited to text, which restricts the full potential of multimodal language models (MLLMs). The paper seeks to address this limitation by expanding the scope of prompt optimization to multimodal prompts.

Method: The researchers propose the Multimodal Prompt Optimizer (MPO), a unified framework that performs joint optimization of multimodal prompts while maintaining alignment between modalities. Additionally, it employs a Bayesian-based strategy for selecting candidate prompts using earlier evaluations as priors.

Result: MPO demonstrated superior performance over leading text-only prompt optimization methods across diverse modalities, which include text, images, videos, and molecules.

Conclusion: Multimodal prompt optimization is critical to fully unlocking the potential of MLLMs, and the proposed MPO framework effectively achieves this goal by leveraging joint optimization and informed selection strategies.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable success, and their
multimodal expansions (MLLMs) further unlock capabilities spanning images,
videos, and other modalities beyond text. However, despite this shift, prompt
optimization approaches, designed to reduce the burden of manual prompt
crafting while maximizing performance, remain confined to text, ultimately
limiting the full potential of MLLMs. Motivated by this gap, we introduce the
new problem of multimodal prompt optimization, which expands the prior
definition of prompt optimization to the multimodal space defined by the pairs
of textual and non-textual prompts. To tackle this problem, we then propose the
Multimodal Prompt Optimizer (MPO), a unified framework that not only performs
the joint optimization of multimodal prompts through alignment-preserving
updates but also guides the selection process of candidate prompts by
leveraging earlier evaluations as priors in a Bayesian-based selection
strategy. Through extensive experiments across diverse modalities that go
beyond text, such as images, videos, and even molecules, we demonstrate that
MPO outperforms leading text-only optimization methods, establishing multimodal
prompt optimization as a crucial step to realizing the potential of MLLMs.

### [333] [FM-IRL: Flow-Matching for Reward Modeling and Policy Regularization in Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09222)
*Zhenglin Wan,Jingxuan Wu,Xingrui Yu,Chubin Zhang,Mingcong Lei,Bo An,Ivor Tsang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Flow Matching (FM) is effective for offline imitation learning but struggles with generalization due to lack of interaction and exploration. A student-teacher approach improves learning by enabling online policy updates while utilizing FM's expressiveness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: This paper aims to overcome the limitations of FM-based policies which lack environmental interaction, leading to poor generalization in unseen scenarios.

Method: A student policy with a simple MLP structure learns through online RL updates, guided by a reward model and regularized by a teacher FM model, which is based on expert data distribution.

Result: The proposed student-teacher framework improves learning efficiency, generalization, and robustness during policy training, especially when dealing with suboptimal expert data.

Conclusion: The integration of a student-teacher framework addresses FM's limitations, combining exploration and expressiveness to deliver more generalized and efficient policy learning.

Abstract: Flow Matching (FM) has shown remarkable ability in modeling complex
distributions and achieves strong performance in offline imitation learning for
cloning expert behaviors. However, despite its behavioral cloning
expressiveness, FM-based policies are inherently limited by their lack of
environmental interaction and exploration. This leads to poor generalization in
unseen scenarios beyond the expert demonstrations, underscoring the necessity
of online interaction with environment. Unfortunately, optimizing FM policies
via online interaction is challenging and inefficient due to instability in
gradient computation and high inference costs. To address these issues, we
propose to let a student policy with simple MLP structure explore the
environment and be online updated via RL algorithm with a reward model. This
reward model is associated with a teacher FM model, containing rich information
of expert data distribution. Furthermore, the same teacher FM model is utilized
to regularize the student policy's behavior to stabilize policy learning. Due
to the student's simple architecture, we avoid the gradient instability of FM
policies and enable efficient online exploration, while still leveraging the
expressiveness of the teacher FM model. Extensive experiments show that our
approach significantly enhances learning efficiency, generalization, and
robustness, especially when learning from suboptimal expert data.

*Klaus Weinbauer,Tieu-Long Phan,Peter F. Stadler,Thomas G√§rtner,Sagar Malhotra*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a method to provide interpretable explanations for machine learning models predicting chemical reaction feasibility, using prime implicant explanations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Despite the predictive success of machine learning models in chemical reaction feasibility tasks, there is a significant lack of interpretability and transparency in their decision-making processes.

Method: The authors develop and implement a novel formulation of prime implicant explanations tailored to reaction prediction. They propose an algorithm to compute these minimally sufficient explanations in small-scale tasks.

Result: Preliminary experiments show that the prime implicant explanations effectively capture the essential molecular attributes needed for prediction, though they may include redundant features.

Conclusion: Prime implicant explanations provide an interpretable and conservative methodology for understanding machine learning predictions in chemical reaction feasibility, addressing transparency concerns.

Abstract: Machine learning models that predict the feasibility of chemical reactions
have become central to automated synthesis planning. Despite their predictive
success, these models often lack transparency and interpretability. We
introduce a novel formulation of prime implicant explanations--also known as
minimally sufficient reasons--tailored to this domain, and propose an algorithm
for computing such explanations in small-scale reaction prediction tasks.
Preliminary experiments demonstrate that our notion of prime implicant
explanations conservatively captures the ground truth explanations. That is,
such explanations often contain redundant bonds and atoms but consistently
capture the molecular attributes that are essential for predicting reaction
feasibility.

*Jiangwei Chen,Kieu Thao Nguyen Pham,Rachael Hwee Ling Sim,Arun Verma,Zhaoxuan Wu,Chuan-Sheng Foo,Bryan Kian Hsiang Low*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a framework for time-aware rewards in collaborative data sharing, addressing fairness and incentives for parties joining at different times.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Incentivize early data sharing while addressing issues arising when parties join data collaborations at staggered times.

Method: Developed a framework with novel time-aware incentives and methods for assigning rewards based on contribution timing.

Result: Empirical demonstrations on synthetic and real-world datasets highlighting the framework's properties.

Conclusion: Early contributors are fairly rewarded, encouraging timely cooperation while ensuring fairness and reliability in data sharing.

Abstract: In collaborative data sharing and machine learning, multiple parties
aggregate their data resources to train a machine learning model with better
model performance. However, as the parties incur data collection costs, they
are only willing to do so when guaranteed incentives, such as fairness and
individual rationality. Existing frameworks assume that all parties join the
collaboration simultaneously, which does not hold in many real-world scenarios.
Due to the long processing time for data cleaning, difficulty in overcoming
legal barriers, or unawareness, the parties may join the collaboration at
different times. In this work, we propose the following perspective: As a party
who joins earlier incurs higher risk and encourages the contribution from other
wait-and-see parties, that party should receive a reward of higher value for
sharing data earlier. To this end, we propose a fair and time-aware data
sharing framework, including novel time-aware incentives. We develop new
methods for deciding reward values to satisfy these incentives. We further
illustrate how to generate model rewards that realize the reward values and
empirically demonstrate the properties of our methods on synthetic and
real-world datasets.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a hybrid mathematical and machine learning method for predicting missing data using distances between shifted linear subspaces.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenge of accurately imputing missing data in data science using novel approaches.

Method: The method employs principal components to represent data as subspaces, and calculates distances between these subspaces for imputation, particularly using Euclidean metrics.

Result: Solutions for missing data imputation utilizing Euclidean distance metrics are presented.

Conclusion: The paper provides an innovative approach combining mathematics and machine learning to improve missing data prediction.

Abstract: The problem of choosing appropriate values for missing data is often
encountered in the data science. We describe a novel method containing both
traditional mathematics and machine learning elements for prediction
(imputation) of missing data. This method is based on the notion of distance
between shifted linear subspaces representing the existing data and candidate
sets. The existing data set is represented by the subspace spanned by its first
principal components. Solutions for the case of the Euclidean metric are given.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper identifies and mitigates model drift in financial datasets from Central Asia and the Caucasus using synthetic outliers for improving predictive model stability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Financial machine learning models are sensitive to performance degradation due to data distribution shifts caused by macroeconomic shocks in developing economies such as Central Asia and the Caucasus.

Method: The study uses synthetic outliers and introduces a two-level framework to measure performance degradation and shock severity on macroeconomic datasets.

Result: Experiments show that adding synthetic outliers generally enhances stability, though the optimal quantity varies by dataset and model.

Conclusion: Synthetic outlier methods offer promise for mitigating model drift in unstable financial environments, varying outcomes suggest tailored approaches are needed for specific datasets and models.

Abstract: Machine Learning models in finance are highly susceptible to model drift,
where predictive performance declines as data distributions shift. This issue
is especially acute in developing economies such as those in Central Asia and
the Caucasus - including Tajikistan, Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan, and Azerbaijan -
where frequent and unpredictable macroeconomics shocks destabilize financial
data. To the best of our knowledge, this is among the first studies to examine
drift mitigation methods on financial datasets from these regions. We
investigate the use of synthetic outliers, a largely unexplored approach, to
improve model stability against unforeseen shocks. To evaluate effectiveness,
we introduce a two-level framework that measures both the extent of performance
degradation and the severity of shocks. Our experiments on macroeconomic
tabular datasets show that adding a small proportion of synthetic outliers
generally improves stability compared to baseline models, though the optimal
amount varies by dataset and model

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper examines diverse prompt datasets emerging for LLM applications, systematically analyzes representative datasets, and introduces a method for optimizing prompts using syntactic embeddings to improve output quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to study the diverse prompt datasets being generated for LLMs and develop methods for their systematic analysis and improvement.

Method: The method involves compiling a comprehensive set of prompt datasets, analyzing them systematically, and introducing a prompt optimization technique utilizing syntactic embeddings of part-of-speech and dependency structures.

Result: Key differences and commonalities across prompt datasets were revealed, and the proposed optimization strategy was shown to improve the meaningfulness of LLM outputs.

Conclusion: The research highlights the diversity of prompt datasets and demonstrates an effective optimization strategy for improving LLM prompt construction, suggesting it can enhance human-LLM interaction.

Abstract: A prompt is a natural language instruction that defines a specific task for a
large language model (LLM) and serves as the primary interface for human-LLM
interaction. With the growing deployment of LLMs, diverse prompt datasets are
emerging from platforms such as GitHub and social media. These datasets span a
wide array of applications and content types, facilitating both broader LLM
utilization and improved prompt engineering. In this work, we--for the first
time--have compiled an extensive list of prompt datasets sourced from various
channels, representing a spectrum of downstream tasks, languages, engineering
techniques, attributes, and modalities. We select key representative datasets
for systematic analysis, revealing commonalities and differences in prompt
construction across categories, distinguishing them from other text corpora
like literature and web. We further propose a prompt optimization approach that
leverages syntactic embeddings of part-of-speech and dependency structures. By
identifying a centroid representation of prompts and guiding LLMs to rewrite
prompts toward this centroid, our method improves the meaningfulness of model
outputs. We have made our datasets and code available.

TL;DR: This paper introduces a machine learning approach to replace algebraic loops in Modelica models using neural network surrogates, achieving faster simulations without losing accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The goal is to address computational inefficiencies and ambiguity in solutions caused by algebraic loops in equation-based simulations systems.

Method: The paper uses a feedforward neural network trained directly on the residual error of algebraic loops, removing the need for supervised datasets and ensuring consistent convergence.

Result: The approach reduces simulation time by 60% for large-scale systems like the IEEE 14-Bus system while maintaining accuracy with error control mechanisms.

Conclusion: Residual-informed neural networks can effectively replace algebraic loops in simulations, providing significant time savings without compromising accuracy.

Abstract: This paper presents a residual-informed machine learning approach for
replacing algebraic loops in equation-based Modelica models with neural network
surrogates. A feedforward neural network is trained using the residual (error)
of the algebraic loop directly in its loss function, eliminating the need for a
supervised dataset. This training strategy also resolves the issue of ambiguous
solutions, allowing the surrogate to converge to a consistent solution rather
than averaging multiple valid ones. Applied to the large-scale IEEE 14-Bus
system, our method achieves a 60% reduction in simulation time compared to
conventional simulations, while maintaining the same level of accuracy through
error control mechanisms.

TL;DR: This work addresses open gaps in Multi-Agent Imitation Learning (MAIL) by defining theoretical limits, introducing a near-optimal algorithm, and supporting results with numerical experiments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address theoretical shortcomings and inefficiencies in non-interactive and interactive Multi-Agent Imitation Learning.

Method: The paper presents theoretical analysis defining statistical bounds, proposes MAIL-WARM as an interactive learning algorithm, and contrasts it with Behavior Cloning.

Result: The theoretical and experimental findings demonstrate that MAIL-WARM achieves improved sample complexity, reducing it from $
\mathcal{O}(\varepsilon^{-8})$ to $
\mathcal{O}(\varepsilon^{-2})$.

Conclusion: The findings advance understanding and methodology in MAIL, showcasing MAIL-WARM's efficacy and limitations of Behavior Cloning in certain environments.

Abstract: We close open theoretical gaps in Multi-Agent Imitation Learning (MAIL) by
characterizing the limits of non-interactive MAIL and presenting the first
interactive algorithm with near-optimal sample complexity. In the
non-interactive setting, we prove a statistical lower bound that identifies the
all-policy deviation concentrability coefficient as the fundamental complexity
measure, and we show that Behavior Cloning (BC) is rate-optimal. For the
interactive setting, we introduce a framework that combines reward-free
reinforcement learning with interactive MAIL and instantiate it with an
algorithm, MAIL-WARM. It improves the best previously known sample complexity
from $\mathcal{O}(\varepsilon^{-8})$ to $\mathcal{O}(\varepsilon^{-2}),$
matching the dependence on $\varepsilon$ implied by our lower bound. Finally,
we provide numerical results that support our theory and illustrate, in
environments such as grid worlds, where Behavior Cloning fails to learn.

*Tuan Nguyen,Long Tran-Thanh*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a black-box framework for aligning the safety of large language models (LLMs) without retraining or needing access to model internals, using a game-theoretic optimization approach.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of existing LLM alignment methods that are costly, inflexible, and dependent on access to model internals, making them unsuitable for third-party stakeholders and evolving requirements.

Method: A black-box framework employing game theory, where a two-player zero-sum game is solved using a linear programming solver during inference time to optimize the trade-off between safety and helpfulness.

Result: The approach demonstrates the practicality of safety alignment in a black-box and model-independent setting, providing a scalable solution for diverse stakeholders.

Conclusion: The proposed method enables safe and accessible alignment of LLMs for third-party users and resource-constrained settings, even with rapidly evolving model technologies.

Abstract: Ensuring that large language models (LLMs) comply with safety requirements is
a central challenge in AI deployment. Existing alignment approaches primarily
operate during training, such as through fine-tuning or reinforcement learning
from human feedback, but these methods are costly and inflexible, requiring
retraining whenever new requirements arise. Recent efforts toward
inference-time alignment mitigate some of these limitations but still assume
access to model internals, which is impractical, and not suitable for third
party stakeholders who do not have access to the models. In this work, we
propose a model-independent, black-box framework for safety alignment that does
not require retraining or access to the underlying LLM architecture. As a proof
of concept, we address the problem of trading off between generating safe but
uninformative answers versus helpful yet potentially risky ones. We formulate
this dilemma as a two-player zero-sum game whose minimax equilibrium captures
the optimal balance between safety and helpfulness. LLM agents operationalize
this framework by leveraging a linear programming solver at inference time to
compute equilibrium strategies. Our results demonstrate the feasibility of
black-box safety alignment, offering a scalable and accessible pathway for
stakeholders, including smaller organizations and entities in
resource-constrained settings, to enforce safety across rapidly evolving LLM
ecosystems.

*Till Aczel,Lucas Theis,Wattenhofer Roger*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces BBQ, a Bayesian Bradley-Terry model variant, which accounts for rater variability for better aggregation of pairwise comparisons, ensuring more consistent human evaluation of generative models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard metrics fail to align with human preferences reliably, and human evaluations are inconsistent due to variability in rater reliability. A robust method is needed for human evaluation aggregation in generative models.

Method: BBQ employs a Bayesian Bradley-Terry model with Expectation-Maximization for monotonic likelihood convergence, incorporating rater quality to downweight unreliable participants in the evaluation process.

Result: BBQ demonstrates faster convergence, robust rankings, and well-calibrated uncertainty even in noisy or crowdsourced conditions, surpassing baseline models.

Conclusion: The proposed BBQ framework improves the reliability, robustness, and cost-effectiveness of human evaluation for generative models by addressing inherent challenges in rater variability and comparison aggregation.

Abstract: Evaluating generative models is challenging because standard metrics often
fail to reflect human preferences. Human evaluations are more reliable but
costly and noisy, as participants vary in expertise, attention, and diligence.
Pairwise comparisons improve consistency, yet aggregating them into overall
quality scores requires careful modeling. Bradley-Terry-based methods update
item scores from comparisons, but existing approaches either ignore rater
variability or lack convergence guarantees, limiting robustness and
interpretability. We introduce BBQ, a Bayesian Bradley-Terry variant that
explicitly models rater quality, downweighting or removing unreliable
participants, and provides guaranteed monotonic likelihood convergence through
an Expectation-Maximization algorithm. Empirical results show that BBQ achieves
faster convergence, well-calibrated uncertainty estimates, and more robust,
interpretable rankings compared to baseline Bradley-Terry models, even with
noisy or crowdsourced raters. This framework enables more reliable and
cost-effective human evaluation of generative models.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper presents a novel framework, XGeoAI, using a Graph Attention Network (GATv2) to improve multi-step train delay forecasting with interpretable results for real-time railway network management.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Train delays hinder railway network efficiency, necessitating effective forecasting methods to mitigate cascading effects for better traffic management.

Method: A two-stage autoregressive Graph Attention Network (GATv2) was trained on a real-world dataset, modeling spatio-temporal graphs of railway events with enriched features like congestion.

Result: GATv2 surpassed simpler models in delay event classification precision, though its error metrics (MAE) were challenged by the Persistence baseline.

Conclusion: The developed GATv2 model offers reliable decision support by improving precision in predicting delay events, advancing live, explainable forecasting for railway operations.

Abstract: The operational efficiency of railway networks, a cornerstone of modern
economies, is persistently undermined by the cascading effects of train delays.
Accurately forecasting this delay propagation is a critical challenge for
real-time traffic management. While recent research has leveraged Graph Neural
Networks (GNNs) to model the network structure of railways, a significant gap
remains in developing frameworks that provide multi-step autoregressive
forecasts at a network-wide scale, while simultaneously offering the live,
interpretable explanations needed for decision support. This paper addresses
this gap by developing and evaluating a novel XGeoAI framework for live,
explainable, multi-step train delay forecasting. The core of this work is a
two-stage, autoregressive Graph Attention Network (GAT) model, trained on a
real-world dataset covering over 40% of the Dutch railway network. The model
represents the system as a spatio-temporal graph of operational events
(arrivals and departures) and is enriched with granular features, including
platform and station congestion. To test its viability for live deployment, the
model is rigorously evaluated using a sequential, k-step-ahead forecasting
protocol that simulates real-world conditions where prediction errors can
compound. The results demonstrate that while the proposed GATv2 model is
challenged on pure error metrics (MAE) by a simpler Persistence baseline, it
achieves consistently higher precision in classifying delay events -- a crucial
advantage for a reliable decision support tool.

*Natalie Abreu,Nikhil Vyas,Sham Kakade,Depen Morwani*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper examines how full Gauss-Newton (GN) preconditioning can accelerate large language model (LLM) training, showing it drastically reduces iterations compared to standard optimizers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate the trade-offs in computational efficiency and performance when using approximate second-order methods for accelerating LLM pretraining.

Method: A study applying full Gauss-Newton preconditioning on transformers (up to 150M parameters) and comparing it with baselines like SOAP and Muon, as well as testing a layerwise GN preconditioner.

Result: Full GN updates achieved a 5.4x reduction in training iterations compared to baselines, and a layerwise GN preconditioner performed close to full GN while being computationally simpler.

Conclusion: The GN approximation is effective for preconditioning, layerwise Hessian structures are almost sufficient for gains, and there exists a considerable gap between these methods and current approaches.

Abstract: Recent efforts to accelerate LLM pretraining have focused on
computationally-efficient approximations that exploit second-order structure.
This raises a key question for large-scale training: how much performance is
forfeited by these approximations? To probe this question, we establish a
practical upper bound on iteration complexity by applying full Gauss-Newton
(GN) preconditioning to transformer models of up to 150M parameters. Our
experiments show that full GN updates yield substantial gains over existing
optimizers, achieving a 5.4x reduction in training iterations compared to
strong baselines like SOAP and Muon. Furthermore, we find that a precise
layerwise GN preconditioner, which ignores cross-layer information, nearly
matches the performance of the full GN method. Collectively, our results
suggest: (1) the GN approximation is highly effective for preconditioning,
implying higher-order loss terms may not be critical for convergence speed; (2)
the layerwise Hessian structure contains sufficient information to achieve most
of these potential gains; and (3) a significant performance gap exists between
current approximate methods and an idealized layerwise oracle.

TL;DR: The paper explores attention mechanisms and state space models (SSMs) in sequence models using eigenvalue spectra comparisons, highlighting their effects on performance and memory modeling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The key motivation is to address the challenges of quadratic complexity in softmax attention, which limits scalability, by analyzing and comparing with more efficient alternatives, such as SSMs.

Method: The authors use a dynamical systems framework to represent attention mechanisms and compare them with SSMs, focusing on eigenvalue spectra and their influence on model behavior and task performance.

Result: The study reveals that eigenvalue spectra align with task requirements and influence memory modeling and long-range dependencies. Architectural changes were shown to impact the spectra and performance effectively.

Conclusion: Eigenvalue analysis is validated as a robust metric for interpreting and enhancing sequence models, offering insights into designing models suited to specific tasks.

Abstract: Although softmax attention drives state-of-the-art performance for sequence
models, its quadratic complexity limits scalability, motivating linear
alternatives such as state space models (SSMs). While these alternatives
improve efficiency, their fundamental differences in information processing
remain poorly understood. In this work, we leverage the recently proposed
dynamical systems framework to represent softmax, norm and linear attention as
dynamical systems, enabling a structured comparison with SSMs by analyzing
their respective eigenvalue spectra. Since eigenvalues capture essential
aspects of dynamical system behavior, we conduct an extensive empirical
analysis across diverse sequence models and benchmarks. We first show that
eigenvalues influence essential aspects of memory and long-range dependency
modeling, revealing spectral signatures that align with task requirements.
Building on these insights, we then investigate how architectural modifications
in sequence models impact both eigenvalue spectra and task performance. This
correspondence further strengthens the position of eigenvalue analysis as a
principled metric for interpreting, understanding, and ultimately improving the
capabilities of sequence models.

TL;DR: This paper introduces CHUCKLE, a perception-driven curriculum learning framework for emotion recognition, which uses human annotator agreement to guide training from simple to complex samples.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitation in current curriculum learning approaches for emotion recognition, which neglect human perception while defining sample difficulty.

Method: CHUCKLE uses annotator agreement and alignment from crowd-sourced datasets to define sample difficulty, assuming that what is hard for humans is also difficult for machine learning models.

Result: CHUCKLE improves relative mean accuracy by 6.56% for LSTMs and 1.61% for Transformers compared to non-curriculum baselines. It also reduces the number of gradient updates.

Conclusion: CHUCKLE enhances training efficiency and model robustness, demonstrating the effectiveness of incorporating human perception into curriculum learning for emotion recognition.

Abstract: Curriculum learning (CL) structures training from simple to complex samples,
facilitating progressive learning. However, existing CL approaches for emotion
recognition often rely on heuristic, data-driven, or model-based definitions of
sample difficulty, neglecting the difficulty for human perception, a critical
factor in subjective tasks like emotion recognition. We propose CHUCKLE
(Crowdsourced Human Understanding Curriculum for Knowledge Led Emotion
Recognition), a perception-driven CL framework that leverages annotator
agreement and alignment in crowd-sourced datasets to define sample difficulty,
under the assumption that clips challenging for humans are similarly hard for
machine learning models. Empirical results suggest that CHUCKLE increases the
relative mean accuracy by 6.56% for LSTMs and 1.61% for Transformers over
non-curriculum baselines, while reducing the number of gradient updates,
thereby enhancing both training efficiency and model robustness.

Motivation: Large Language Models struggle with reward sparsity and inefficient training when tasks surpass their skill level, causing methods like GRPO to fail. Existing mitigations, like mixing RL with SFT, often lead to policy misguidance due to distributional mismatches.

Method: The authors diagnose a core issue called "low training affinity" caused by distribution shifts. They introduce Affinity, a metric for stability and exploration efficiency, and propose HINT, a framework providing heuristic hints to guide models towards solutions without overriding their autonomy.

Result: HINT demonstrates consistent improvement over existing methods in mathematical reasoning tasks, achieving state-of-the-art performance. Additionally, it ensures significantly more stable learning and higher data efficiency across models of different scales.

Conclusion: The proposed HINT framework and Affinity metric effectively address RL challenges for enhancing LLMs' reasoning abilities. This work highlights the importance of guiding models adaptively without hindering autonomous reasoning, setting a new standard for data efficiency and stability.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) has become a key driver for enhancing the long
chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs).
However, prevalent methods like GRPO often fail when task difficulty exceeds
the model's capacity, leading to reward sparsity and inefficient training.
While prior work attempts to mitigate this using off-policy data, such as
mixing RL with Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) or using hints, they often misguide
policy updates In this work, we identify a core issue underlying these
failures, which we term low training affinity. This condition arises from a
large distributional mismatch between external guidance and the model's policy.
To diagnose this, we introduce Affinity, the first quantitative metric for
monitoring exploration efficiency and training stability. To improve Affinity,
we propose HINT: Helping Ineffective rollouts Navigate Towards effectiveness,
an adaptive hinting framework. Instead of providing direct answers, HINT
supplies heuristic hints that guide the model to discover solutions on its own,
preserving its autonomous reasoning capabilities. Extensive experiments on
mathematical reasoning tasks show that HINT consistently outperforms existing
methods, achieving state-of-the-art results with models of various scales,
while also demonstrating significantly more stable learning and greater data
efficiency.Code is available on Github.

*Jerome Sieber,Antonio Orvieto,Melanie N. Zeilinger,Carmen Amo Alonso*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper develops a unified framework for deep sequence models, connecting a variety of architectures through the lens of linear dynamical systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To systematically compare sequence models and understand how their architectures influence model properties.

Method: The authors present a framework where linear combination coefficients in sequence models are viewed as outputs of autonomous linear dynamical systems driven by impulse inputs.

Result: The framework identifies trade-offs in sequence model designs, such as expressivity, efficiency, geometric constraints, and stability conditions.

Conclusion: This approach explains the successes of current models and offers principles for designing new architectures with improved insights.

Abstract: Deep sequence models, ranging from Transformers and State Space Models (SSMs)
to more recent approaches such as gated linear RNNs, fundamentally compute
outputs as linear combinations of past value vectors. To draw insights and
systematically compare such architectures, we develop a unified framework that
makes this output operation explicit, by casting the linear combination
coefficients as the outputs of autonomous linear dynamical systems driven by
impulse inputs. This viewpoint, in spirit substantially different from
approaches focusing on connecting linear RNNs with linear attention, reveals a
common mathematical theme across diverse architectures and crucially captures
softmax attention, on top of RNNs, SSMs, and related models. In contrast to new
model proposals that are commonly evaluated on benchmarks, we derive design
principles linking architectural choices to model properties. Thereby
identifying tradeoffs between expressivity and efficient implementation,
geometric constraints on input selectivity, and stability conditions for
numerically stable training and information retention. By connecting several
insights and observations from recent literature, the framework both explains
empirical successes of recent designs and provides guiding principles for
systematically designing new sequence model architectures.

### [349] [Cross-Receiver Generalization for RF Fingerprint Identification via Feature Disentanglement and Adversarial Training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09405)
*Yuhao Pan,Xiucheng Wang,Nan Cheng,Wenchao Xu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a robust framework for radio frequency fingerprint identification (RFFI) that addresses receiver-induced variability using adversarial training and style transfer.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current RFFI systems face performance degradation due to receiver-induced biases and variability, particularly during real-world deployment when different receivers are used.

Method: The proposed framework combines adversarial training and style transfer techniques to disentangle transmitter-specific features from receiver artifacts, enforcing domain-invariant representation learning.

Result: Extensive testing on multi-receiver datasets demonstrates up to a 10% improvement in average accuracy compared to state-of-the-art baselines, ensuring model robustness to receiver changes.

Conclusion: The study presents a significant advancement in RFFI by isolating hardware signatures from receiver noise, enhancing adaptability and reliability of models across diverse receiver environments.

Abstract: Radio frequency fingerprint identification (RFFI) is a critical technique for
wireless network security, leveraging intrinsic hardware-level imperfections
introduced during device manufacturing to enable precise transmitter
identification. While deep neural networks have shown remarkable capability in
extracting discriminative features, their real-world deployment is hindered by
receiver-induced variability. In practice, RF fingerprint signals comprise
transmitter-specific features as well as channel distortions and
receiver-induced biases. Although channel equalization can mitigate channel
noise, receiver-induced feature shifts remain largely unaddressed, causing the
RFFI models to overfit to receiver-specific patterns. This limitation is
particularly problematic when training and evaluation share the same receiver,
as replacing the receiver in deployment can cause substantial performance
degradation. To tackle this challenge, we propose an RFFI framework robust to
cross-receiver variability, integrating adversarial training and style transfer
to explicitly disentangle transmitter and receiver features. By enforcing
domain-invariant representation learning, our method isolates genuine hardware
signatures from receiver artifacts, ensuring robustness against receiver
changes. Extensive experiments on multi-receiver datasets demonstrate that our
approach consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving up to a
10% improvement in average accuracy across diverse receiver settings.

*Abigail J. Hayes,Tobias Schumacher,Markus Strohmaier*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper evaluates state-of-the-art models in temporal graph learning, revealing their mixed ability to capture fundamental graph attributes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address concerns about unreliable benchmarks and understand the properties models use for predictions on temporal graphs.

Method: Systematic evaluation of seven models on eight key graph attributes using synthetic and real-world datasets.

Result: Models show varied abilities: some capture certain attributes effectively while failing on others.

Conclusion: The study reveals limitations in temporal graph learning models and advocates for interpretability-focused evaluations in future research.

Abstract: Learning on temporal graphs has become a central topic in graph
representation learning, with numerous benchmarks indicating the strong
performance of state-of-the-art models. However, recent work has raised
concerns about the reliability of benchmark results, noting issues with
commonly used evaluation protocols and the surprising competitiveness of simple
heuristics. This contrast raises the question of which properties of the
underlying graphs temporal graph learning models actually use to form their
predictions. We address this by systematically evaluating seven models on their
ability to capture eight fundamental attributes related to the link structure
of temporal graphs. These include structural characteristics such as density,
temporal patterns such as recency, and edge formation mechanisms such as
homophily. Using both synthetic and real-world datasets, we analyze how well
models learn these attributes. Our findings reveal a mixed picture: models
capture some attributes well but fail to reproduce others. With this, we expose
important limitations. Overall, we believe that our results provide practical
insights for the application of temporal graph learning models, and motivate
more interpretability-driven evaluations in temporal graph learning research.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper explores weight initialization's impact on training with studies on ReLU MLPs and GPT-2 transformers, providing practical training insights.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how different weight initialization strategies impact learning stability and speed in modern neural networks.

Method: Analyzed initialization regimes on ReLU MLPs and GPT-2-style models, comparing different initialization schemes and weight variances across layers.

Result: Identified ideal initialization ranges (1e-2 to 1e-1), demonstrated that Kaiming initialization outperforms Xavier, and observed depth-dependent weight adjustments in transformers.

Conclusion: Weight initialization principles influence modern deep learning; practical recommendations for initialization enhance robust training.

Abstract: Weight initialization governs signal propagation and gradient flow at the
start of training. This paper offers a theory-grounded and empirically
validated study across two regimes: compact ReLU multilayer perceptrons and
GPT-2-style transformers. First, a logarithmic sweep of the initial standard
deviation maps vanishing and exploding regimes and identifies a broad stability
band with standard deviations between 1e-2 and 1e-1. Second, a controlled
comparison shows that Kaiming (fan-in) initialization converges faster and more
stably than Xavier under ReLU, consistent with variance-preserving theory.
Third, in a from-scratch 12-layer GPT-2-style model, this paper tracks
layerwise Q/K/V weight variance through pretraining and observe depth-dependent
equilibration into narrow bands: shallow layers expand rapidly while deeper
layers change more gradually. Together, these results connect classic
initialization principles with modern transformer behavior and yield simple,
practical recipes for robust training.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper addresses an NP-hard online stochastic matching problem under budget constraints using single-peaked preferences.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop efficient algorithms for online matching under budget constraints, overcoming the NP-hardness of finding optimal solutions in unstructured problems.

Method: Introduced a PQ tree-based order approximation method and developed UCB-like and regret-minimizing algorithms under single-peaked preference assumptions.

Result: Achieved efficient offline algorithms and online regret bounds of $\tilde O(UKT^{2/3})$ and $\tilde O(U\sqrt{TK})$ for known structures.

Conclusion: Single-peaked preferences significantly simplify computational challenges in online matching algorithms, yielding practical solutions with low regret bounds.

Abstract: We study an online stochastic matching problem in which an algorithm
sequentially matches $U$ users to $K$ arms, aiming to maximize cumulative
reward over $T$ rounds under budget constraints. Without structural
assumptions, computing the optimal matching is NP-hard, making online learning
computationally infeasible. To overcome this barrier, we focus on
\emph{single-peaked preferences} -- a well-established structure in social
choice theory, where users' preferences are unimodal with respect to a common
order over arms. We devise an efficient algorithm for the offline budgeted
matching problem, and leverage it into an efficient online algorithm with a
regret of $\tilde O(UKT^{2/3})$. Our approach relies on a novel PQ tree-based
order approximation method. If the single-peaked structure is known, we develop
an efficient UCB-like algorithm that achieves a regret bound of $\tilde
O(U\sqrt{TK})$.

### [353] [Cross-attention Secretly Performs Orthogonal Alignment in Recommendation Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09435)
*Hyunin Lee,Yong Zhang,Hoang Vu Nguyen,Xiaoyi Liu,Namyong Park,Christopher Jung,Rong Jin,Yang Wang,Zhigang Wang,Somayeh Sojoudi,Xue Feng*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Orthogonal Alignment in Cross-Domain Sequential Recommendation (CDSR) models, highlighting its role in improving model performance and scaling efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Researchers aim to improve the alignment of heterogeneous user behavior sequences across domains and explore the mechanisms behind cross-attention.

Method: The authors analyze over 300 experiments on cross-attention in CDSR models and investigate the natural emergence of Orthogonal Alignment due to its improvement in scaling laws.

Result: Orthogonal Alignment, which discovers novel information beyond the query input, naturally arises in cross-attention models and enhances their performance and parameter efficiency.

Conclusion: Orthogonal Alignment in cross-attention modules enables superior accuracy per model parameter, offering new pathways for efficient scaling in multi-modal systems.

Abstract: Cross-domain sequential recommendation (CDSR) aims to align heterogeneous
user behavior sequences collected from different domains. While cross-attention
is widely used to enhance alignment and improve recommendation performance, its
underlying mechanism is not fully understood. Most researchers interpret
cross-attention as residual alignment, where the output is generated by
removing redundant and preserving non-redundant information from the query
input by referencing another domain data which is input key and value. Beyond
the prevailing view, we introduce Orthogonal Alignment, a phenomenon in which
cross-attention discovers novel information that is not present in the query
input, and further argue that those two contrasting alignment mechanisms can
co-exist in recommendation models We find that when the query input and output
of cross-attention are orthogonal, model performance improves over 300
experiments. Notably, Orthogonal Alignment emerges naturally, without any
explicit orthogonality constraints. Our key insight is that Orthogonal
Alignment emerges naturally because it improves scaling law. We show that
baselines additionally incorporating cross-attention module outperform
parameter-matched baselines, achieving a superior accuracy-per-model parameter.
We hope these findings offer new directions for parameter-efficient scaling in
multi-modal research.

### [354] [On Uniformly Scaling Flows: A Density-Aligned Approach to Deep One-Class Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09452)
*Faried Abu Zaid,Tim Katzke,Emmanuel M√ºller,Daniel Neider*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces uniformly scaling flows (USFs), which bridge deep one-class classification (e.g., Deep SVDD) and density estimation (e.g., normalizing flows), unifying two key anomaly detection paradigms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To unify the two major anomaly detection paradigms ‚Äì deep one-class classification and normalizing flows ‚Äì and to address issues like representational collapse in existing methods.

Method: The authors define uniformly scaling flows (USFs) as normalizing flows with a constant Jacobian determinant and show theoretically that their training objective reduces to a Deep SVDD-like objective with a unique regularization term.

Result: USFs align the strengths of density-based and distance-based methods, demonstrate better alignment between negative log-likelihood and latent norm, and yield consistent performance improvements on anomaly detection benchmarks.

Conclusion: The results show that USFs effectively unify theoretical and practical aspects of anomaly detection, making them a strong contender for modern anomaly detection tasks.

Abstract: Unsupervised anomaly detection is often framed around two widely studied
paradigms. Deep one-class classification, exemplified by Deep SVDD, learns
compact latent representations of normality, while density estimators realized
by normalizing flows directly model the likelihood of nominal data. In this
work, we show that uniformly scaling flows (USFs), normalizing flows with a
constant Jacobian determinant, precisely connect these approaches.
Specifically, we prove how training a USF via maximum-likelihood reduces to a
Deep SVDD objective with a unique regularization that inherently prevents
representational collapse. This theoretical bridge implies that USFs inherit
both the density faithfulness of flows and the distance-based reasoning of
one-class methods. We further demonstrate that USFs induce a tighter alignment
between negative log-likelihood and latent norm than either Deep SVDD or
non-USFs, and how recent hybrid approaches combining one-class objectives with
VAEs can be naturally extended to USFs. Consequently, we advocate using USFs as
a drop-in replacement for non-USFs in modern anomaly detection architectures.
Empirically, this substitution yields consistent performance gains and
substantially improved training stability across multiple benchmarks and model
backbones for both image-level and pixel-level detection. These results unify
two major anomaly detection paradigms, advancing both theoretical understanding
and practical performance.

### [355] [Adaptive Attacks on Trusted Monitors Subvert AI Control Protocols](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09462)
*Mikhail Terekhov,Alexander Panfilov,Daniil Dzenhaliou,Caglar Gulcehre,Maksym Andriushchenko,Ameya Prabhu,Jonas Geiping*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper investigates adaptive attacks on AI control protocols relying on LLM monitors, showcasing their vulnerabilities to evasion techniques like prompt injections, and calling for better evaluation methodologies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study is motivated by the need to ensure AI control protocols can defend against attacks from untrusted large language models (LLMs), especially as current protocols relying on LLM monitors may serve as weak points.

Method: The authors created and tested an adaptive attack scenario where an adversarial model embeds known or zero-shot prompt injections into outputs, targeting benchmarks for AI control using existing monitor-reliant protocols.

Result: The proposed attack consistently bypassed various monitor-based control protocols, including recent ones like Defer-to-Resample, which paradoxically amplified the attack.

Conclusion: The research identifies adaptive attacks as a critical vulnerability in existing AI control systems and recommends incorporating such attacks into future protocol evaluations for robustness.

Abstract: AI control protocols serve as a defense mechanism to stop untrusted LLM
agents from causing harm in autonomous settings. Prior work treats this as a
security problem, stress testing with exploits that use the deployment context
to subtly complete harmful side tasks, such as backdoor insertion. In practice,
most AI control protocols are fundamentally based on LLM monitors, which can
become a central point of failure. We study adaptive attacks by an untrusted
model that knows the protocol and the monitor model, which is plausible if the
untrusted model was trained with a later knowledge cutoff or can search for
this information autonomously. We instantiate a simple adaptive attack vector
by which the attacker embeds publicly known or zero-shot prompt injections in
the model outputs. Using this tactic, frontier models consistently evade
diverse monitors and complete malicious tasks on two main AI control
benchmarks. The attack works universally against current protocols that rely on
a monitor. Furthermore, the recent Defer-to-Resample protocol even backfires,
as its resampling amplifies the prompt injection and effectively reframes it as
a best-of-$n$ attack. In general, adaptive attacks on monitor models represent
a major blind spot in current control protocols and should become a standard
component of evaluations for future AI control mechanisms.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Evaluate and improve forecasting methods to assist decision-making in innovation finance and startup management.

Method: A firm-quarter panel dataset from Crunchbase and USPTO (2010-2023) is preprocessed to avoid leakage, address class imbalance using inverse weights and SMOTE-NC, and apply logistic regression and tree ensemble algorithms.

Result: The predictive models achieved high AUROC scores for patent (0.921), funding (0.817), and exit (0.872), demonstrating effective forecasting performance.

Conclusion: The results highlight the utility of the framework in providing accurate and interpretable predictions, aiding stakeholders in startup decision-making.

Abstract: This study develops an interpretable machine learning framework to forecast
startup outcomes, including funding, patenting, and exit. A firm-quarter panel
for 2010-2023 is constructed from Crunchbase and matched to U.S. Patent and
Trademark Office (USPTO) data. Three horizons are evaluated: next funding
within 12 months, patent-stock growth within 24 months, and exit through an
initial public offering (IPO) or acquisition within 36 months. Preprocessing is
fit on a development window (2010-2019) and applied without change to later
cohorts to avoid leakage. Class imbalance is addressed using inverse-prevalence
weights and the Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique for Nominal and
Continuous features (SMOTE-NC). Logistic regression and tree ensembles,
including Random Forest, XGBoost, LightGBM, and CatBoost, are compared using
the area under the precision-recall curve (PR-AUC) and the area under the
receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC). Patent, funding, and exit
predictions achieve AUROC values of 0.921, 0.817, and 0.872, providing
transparent and reproducible rankings for innovation finance.

TL;DR: The paper presents tools for studying latent manifolds of autoencoders geometrically by defining them as implicit submanifolds and introducing robust Riemannian calculus methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the geometry of latent manifolds in autoencoders can enable better data representation and analysis.

Method: Defines latent manifolds as implicit submanifolds, introduces Riemannian calculus tools, and uses a denoising objective to learn an approximate projection on the manifolds.

Result: The framework can compute geodesic paths and exponential maps on latent manifolds and is validated on synthetic and real data.

Conclusion: The proposed framework is practical, robust, and supports various geometries across autoencoders, advancing the study of geometric structures in learned representations.

Abstract: Latent manifolds of autoencoders provide low-dimensional representations of
data, which can be studied from a geometric perspective. We propose to describe
these latent manifolds as implicit submanifolds of some ambient latent space.
Based on this, we develop tools for a discrete Riemannian calculus
approximating classical geometric operators. These tools are robust against
inaccuracies of the implicit representation often occurring in practical
examples. To obtain a suitable implicit representation, we propose to learn an
approximate projection onto the latent manifold by minimizing a denoising
objective. This approach is independent of the underlying autoencoder and
supports the use of different Riemannian geometries on the latent manifolds.
The framework in particular enables the computation of geodesic paths
connecting given end points and shooting geodesics via the Riemannian
exponential maps on latent manifolds. We evaluate our approach on various
autoencoders trained on synthetic and real data.

TL;DR: CRPS-LAM is a probabilistic regional weather forecasting model that is faster than diffusion-based methods while achieving comparable accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve computational efficiency of probabilistic weather forecasting for Limited-Area Modeling (LAM) while maintaining accuracy.

Method: The model uses a CRPS-based objective, injects a single latent noise vector, and generates ensemble members in a single forward pass.

Result: CRPS-LAM offers sampling speeds up to 39 times faster than diffusion models without compromising forecast quality on the MEPS dataset.

Conclusion: CRPS-LAM is an effective method combining high speed and accuracy for probabilistic regional weather forecasting.

Abstract: Machine learning for weather prediction increasingly relies on ensemble
methods to provide probabilistic forecasts. Diffusion-based models have shown
strong performance in Limited-Area Modeling (LAM) but remain computationally
expensive at sampling time. Building on the success of global weather
forecasting models trained based on Continuous Ranked Probability Score (CRPS),
we introduce CRPS-LAM, a probabilistic LAM forecasting model trained with a
CRPS-based objective. By sampling and injecting a single latent noise vector
into the model, CRPS-LAM generates ensemble members in a single forward pass,
achieving sampling speeds up to 39 times faster than a diffusion-based model.
We evaluate the model on the MEPS regional dataset, where CRPS-LAM matches the
low errors of diffusion models. By retaining also fine-scale forecast details,
the method stands out as an effective approach for probabilistic regional
weather forecasting

*Hrad Ghoukasian,Bonwoo Lee,Shahab Asoodeh*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores the problem of private sampling from distributions under local differential privacy (LDP) and introduces a local framework to achieve minimax-optimal samplers in a specific neighborhood of fixed distributions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of generating realistic-looking data under strong privacy guarantees (LDP) in a locally optimal manner, as prior work primarily focused on global optimization without neighborhood-specific precision.

Method: The authors extend the LDP framework to a functional setting and analyze the local minimax risk around a target distribution. They prove that globally optimal LDP samplers can be adapted to local settings and derive a closed-form expression for locally optimal samplers.

Result: The study finds that local minimax risk is directly related to global minimax risk when constrained to a local neighborhood. Empirical evaluations show that the locally optimal samplers outperform global methods when public data informs the private sampling process.

Conclusion: The proposed local framework is effective in achieving better performance in specific data settings and is particularly relevant for private sampling scenarios that utilize public data distributions, demonstrating significant advantages over globally optimized methods.

Abstract: We study the problem of sampling from a distribution under local differential
privacy (LDP). Given a private distribution $P \in \mathcal{P}$, the goal is to
generate a single sample from a distribution that remains close to $P$ in
$f$-divergence while satisfying the constraints of LDP. This task captures the
fundamental challenge of producing realistic-looking data under strong privacy
guarantees. While prior work by Park et al. (NeurIPS'24) focuses on global
minimax-optimality across a class of distributions, we take a local
perspective. Specifically, we examine the minimax risk in a neighborhood around
a fixed distribution $P_0$, and characterize its exact value, which depends on
both $P_0$ and the privacy level. Our main result shows that the local minimax
risk is determined by the global minimax risk when the distribution class
$\mathcal{P}$ is restricted to a neighborhood around $P_0$. To establish this,
we (1) extend previous work from pure LDP to the more general functional LDP
framework, and (2) prove that the globally optimal functional LDP sampler
yields the optimal local sampler when constrained to distributions near $P_0$.
Building on this, we also derive a simple closed-form expression for the
locally minimax-optimal samplers which does not depend on the choice of
$f$-divergence. We further argue that this local framework naturally models
private sampling with public data, where the public data distribution is
represented by $P_0$. In this setting, we empirically compare our locally
optimal sampler to existing global methods, and demonstrate that it
consistently outperforms global minimax samplers.

TL;DR: The paper studies the limitations of normalization in attention mechanisms. It identifies issues with the selective ability and token separation, showing these limitations empirically and theoretically, and suggests the need for improved strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore and address the limitations of softmax-based normalization in attention mechanisms, particularly in token selection and gradient sensitivity.

Method: A theoretical framework to analyze token selection and separation, along with empirical validation using the GPT-2 model, highlighting key behaviors of the attention mechanism.

Result: The paper found that softmax normalization weakens token distinction with increasing selections and poses challenges during training at lower temperature settings.

Conclusion: The paper highlights the necessity for advanced normalization and selection strategies to overcome the limitations identified in softmax-based attention models.

Abstract: This paper investigates the limitations of the normalization in attention
mechanisms. We begin with a theoretical framework that enables the
identification of the model's selective ability and the geometric separation
involved in token selection. Our analysis includes explicit bounds on distances
and separation criteria for token vectors under softmax scaling. Through
experiments with pre-trained GPT-2 model, we empirically validate our
theoretical results and analyze key behaviors of the attention mechanism.
Notably, we demonstrate that as the number of selected tokens increases, the
model's ability to distinguish informative tokens declines, often converging
toward a uniform selection pattern. We also show that gradient sensitivity
under softmax normalization presents challenges during training, especially at
low temperature settings. These findings advance current understanding of
softmax-based attention mechanism and motivate the need for more robust
normalization and selection strategies in future attention architectures.

*Shangzhe Li,Dongruo Zhou,Weitong Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper addresses online adversarial imitation learning (AIL), proposing a model-based approach (MB-AIL) with theoretical guarantees and competitive empirical performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AIL struggles with the unexplored potential of online interaction and the impact of stochasticity in expert demonstration and agent interaction.

Method: The authors propose MB-AIL, providing second-order, horizon-free sample-complexity bounds and proving minimax-optimal results in this framework (up to logarithmic terms).

Result: MB-AIL achieves minimax-optimal sample complexity with reduced dependence on expert demonstrations and performs resiliently under varying policy variances. Empirical results validate the benefits.

Conclusion: MB-AIL improves theoretical guarantees and practical sample efficiency, addressing key challenges in online AIL and leveraging stochastic scenarios effectively.

Abstract: We study online adversarial imitation learning (AIL), where an agent learns
from offline expert demonstrations and interacts with the environment online
without access to rewards. Despite strong empirical results, the benefits of
online interaction and the impact of stochasticity remain poorly understood. We
address these gaps by introducing a model-based AIL algorithm (MB-AIL) and
establish its horizon-free, second-order sample-complexity guarantees under
general function approximations for both expert data and reward-free
interactions. These second-order bounds provide an instance-dependent result
that can scale with the variance of returns under the relevant policies and
therefore tighten as the system approaches determinism. Together with
second-order, information-theoretic lower bounds on a newly constructed
hard-instance family, we show that MB-AIL attains minimax-optimal sample
complexity for online interaction (up to logarithmic factors) with limited
expert demonstrations and matches the lower bound for expert demonstrations in
terms of the dependence on horizon $H$, precision $\epsilon$ and the policy
variance $\sigma^2$. Experiments further validate our theoretical findings and
demonstrate that a practical implementation of MB-AIL matches or surpasses the
sample efficiency of existing methods.

TL;DR: This paper explores the use of machine learning (ML) techniques for diagnosing Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD), finding that Random Forest and Logistic Regression performed best with 99% accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation of this study is to improve the efficiency and accuracy of CKD diagnosis by leveraging machine learning models, thereby enabling better risk evaluation and disease monitoring.

Method: The study used CKD data from UCL‚Äôs machine learning repository. Missing values in the dataset were handled using 'mean-mode' and 'Random sampling method' strategies. Eight ML models (Random Forest, SVM, Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, KNN, XGBoost, Decision Tree, and AdaBoost) were applied and compared based on accuracy.

Result: Among the eight models tested, Random Forest and Logistic Regression achieved the highest accuracy of 99%, while KNN showed the lowest accuracy at 73%.

Conclusion: The results indicate that machine learning models, particularly Random Forest and Logistic Regression, are highly effective in diagnosing CKD, providing healthcare practitioners valuable tools to improve patient outcomes.

Abstract: Kidneys are the filter of the human body. About 10% of the global population
is thought to be affected by Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD), which causes kidney
function to decline. To protect in danger patients from additional kidney
damage, effective risk evaluation of CKD and appropriate CKD monitoring are
crucial. Due to quick and precise detection capabilities, Machine Learning
models can help practitioners accomplish this goal efficiently; therefore, an
enormous number of diagnosis systems and processes in the healthcare sector
nowadays are relying on machine learning due to its disease prediction
capability. In this study, we designed and suggested disease predictive
computer-aided designs for the diagnosis of CKD. The dataset for CKD is
attained from the repository of machine learning of UCL, with a few missing
values; those are filled in using "mean-mode" and "Random sampling method"
strategies. After successfully achieving the missing data, eight ML techniques
(Random Forest, SVM, Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, KNN, XGBoost, Decision
Tree, and AdaBoost) were used to establish models, and the performance
evaluation comparisons among the result accuracies are measured by the
techniques to find the machine learning models with the highest accuracy. Among
them, Random Forest as well as Logistic Regression showed an outstanding 99%
accuracy, followed by the Ada Boost, XGBoost, Naive Bayes, Decision Tree, and
SVM, whereas the KNN classifier model stands last with an accuracy of 73%.

### [363] [Geo-Aware Models for Stream Temperature Prediction across Different Spatial Regions and Scales](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09500)
*Shiyuan Luo,Runlong Yu,Shengyu Chen,Yingda Fan,Yiqun Xie,Yanhua Li,Xiaowei Jia*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Geo-STARS, a novel framework using geo-aware embedding and spatio-temporal graph neural networks to predict stream water temperature in diverse regions with limited observational data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing models struggle with generalizing predictions due to data heterogeneity and limited samples in environmental ecosystems.

Method: The method involves a geo-aware spatio-temporal modeling framework that integrates geographic information into a gated spatio-temporal graph neural network for learning complex patterns.

Result: Geo-STARS achieves superior generalization in predicting stream water temperatures using 37 years of real-world data from the eastern U.S., outperforming baseline methods.

Conclusion: Geo-STARS is effective for scalable, data-efficient environmental monitoring and decision-making, addressing spatial and scale variabilities in ecosystem modeling.

Abstract: Understanding environmental ecosystems is vital for the sustainable
management of our planet. However,existing physics-based and data-driven models
often fail to generalize to varying spatial regions and scales due to the
inherent data heterogeneity presented in real environmental ecosystems. This
generalization issue is further exacerbated by the limited observation samples
available for model training. To address these issues, we propose Geo-STARS, a
geo-aware spatio-temporal modeling framework for predicting stream water
temperature across different watersheds and spatial scales. The major
innovation of Geo-STARS is the introduction of geo-aware embedding, which
leverages geographic information to explicitly capture shared principles and
patterns across spatial regions and scales. We further integrate the geo-aware
embedding into a gated spatio-temporal graph neural network. This design
enables the model to learn complex spatial and temporal patterns guided by
geographic and hydrological context, even with sparse or no observational data.
We evaluate Geo-STARS's efficacy in predicting stream water temperature, which
is a master factor for water quality. Using real-world datasets spanning 37
years across multiple watersheds along the eastern coast of the United States,
Geo-STARS demonstrates its superior generalization performance across both
regions and scales, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines. These results
highlight the promise of Geo-STARS for scalable, data-efficient environmental
monitoring and decision-making.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study addresses the growing demand for scalable and resource-efficient neural models by tackling challenges in distributed computing, compression, and efficient training.

Method: PETRA combines evolutionary optimization with techniques such as pruning, quantization, and loss regularization to automate model architecture and training strategy.

Conclusion: PETRA demonstrates effective automation in improving neural network performance, scalability, and efficiency across diverse applications and benchmarks.

Abstract: There are many critical challenges in optimizing neural network models,
including distributed computing, compression techniques, and efficient
training, regardless of their application to specific tasks. Solving such
problems is crucial because the need for scalable and resource-efficient models
is increasing. To address these challenges, we have developed a new automated

Automation (PETRA). It applies evolutionary optimization to model architecture
and training strategy. PETRA includes pruning, quantization, and loss
regularization. Experimental studies on real-world data with financial event
sequences, as well as image and time-series -- benchmarks, demonstrate PETRA's
ability to improve neural model performance and scalability -- namely, a
significant decrease in model size (up to 75%) and latency (up to 33%), and an
increase in throughput (by 13%) without noticeable degradation in the target
metric.

### [365] [STaTS: Structure-Aware Temporal Sequence Summarization via Statistical Window Merging](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09593)
*Disharee Bhowmick,Ranjith Ramanathan,Sathyanarayanan N. Aakur*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: STaTS is an unsupervised framework for compressing time series data while preserving key temporal dynamics, achieving up to 30x compression and maintaining model performance, even under noise.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard time series models fail to leverage latent structures, leading to inefficiencies and poor scalability in long or noisy sequences.

Method: STaTS uses a BIC-based statistical criterion to detect change points and summarizes segments through functions like mean or generative models such as Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs).

Result: STaTS compresses sequences significantly while retaining temporal dynamics, achieves 85-90% of full-model performance, reduces computational cost, improves noise robustness, and outperforms compression baselines.

Conclusion: STaTS proves itself as a lightweight, efficient, and general-purpose preprocessor that enhances unsupervised time series modeling, making it robust and scalable.

Abstract: Time series data often contain latent temporal structure, transitions between
locally stationary regimes, repeated motifs, and bursts of variability, that
are rarely leveraged in standard representation learning pipelines. Existing
models typically operate on raw or fixed-window sequences, treating all time
steps as equally informative, which leads to inefficiencies, poor robustness,
and limited scalability in long or noisy sequences. We propose STaTS, a
lightweight, unsupervised framework for Structure-Aware Temporal Summarization
that adaptively compresses both univariate and multivariate time series into
compact, information-preserving token sequences. STaTS detects change points
across multiple temporal resolutions using a BIC-based statistical divergence
criterion, then summarizes each segment using simple functions like the mean or
generative models such as GMMs. This process achieves up to 30x sequence
compression while retaining core temporal dynamics. STaTS operates as a
model-agnostic preprocessor and can be integrated with existing unsupervised
time series encoders without retraining. Extensive experiments on 150+
datasets, including classification tasks on the UCR-85, UCR-128, and UEA-30
archives, and forecasting on ETTh1 and ETTh2, ETTm1, and Electricity,
demonstrate that STaTS enables 85-90\% of the full-model performance while
offering dramatic reductions in computational cost. Moreover, STaTS improves
robustness under noise and preserves discriminative structure, outperforming
uniform and clustering-based compression baselines. These results position
STaTS as a principled, general-purpose solution for efficient, structure-aware
time series modeling.

*Nathan Quiblier,Roy Friedman,Matthew Ricci*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces MODE, a graphical neural framework for analyzing complex and noisy dynamical systems, enabling regime discovery and forecasting in life sciences.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenge of modeling noisy transitions in complex life sciences dynamical systems where traditional flow-based methods fail.

Method: MODE uses a neural gating mechanism to decompose dynamics into sparse components for unsupervised regime discovery and accurate transitions forecasting.

Result: MODE demonstrated effectiveness in unsupervised classification of synthetic data, challenging forecasting tasks, and predicting cell fate with human single-cell RNA sequencing data.

Conclusion: The framework provides a novel and powerful tool for tackling noisy and irregular transitions in dynamical systems, showing promise in advancing computational biology applications.

Abstract: Dynamical systems in the life sciences are often composed of complex mixtures
of overlapping behavioral regimes. Cellular subpopulations may shift from
cycling to equilibrium dynamics or branch towards different developmental
fates. The transitions between these regimes can appear noisy and irregular,
posing a serious challenge to traditional, flow-based modeling techniques which
assume locally smooth dynamics. To address this challenge, we propose MODE
(Mixture Of Dynamical Experts), a graphical modeling framework whose neural
gating mechanism decomposes complex dynamics into sparse, interpretable
components, enabling both the unsupervised discovery of behavioral regimes and
accurate long-term forecasting across regime transitions. Crucially, because
agents in our framework can jump to different governing laws, MODE is
especially tailored to the aforementioned noisy transitions. We evaluate our
method on a battery of synthetic and real datasets from computational biology.
First, we systematically benchmark MODE on an unsupervised classification task
using synthetic dynamical snapshot data, including in noisy, few-sample
settings. Next, we show how MODE succeeds on challenging forecasting tasks
which simulate key cycling and branching processes in cell biology. Finally, we
deploy our method on human, single-cell RNA sequencing data and show that it
can not only distinguish proliferation from differentiation dynamics but also
predict when cells will commit to their ultimate fate, a key outstanding
challenge in computational biology.

### [367] [BaNEL: Exploration Posteriors for Generative Modeling Using Only Negative Rewards](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09596)
*Sangyun Lee,Brandon Amos,Giulia Fanti*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces BaNEL, a novel algorithm improving generative models in tasks with sparse rewards by learning from failures rather than relying on costly reward evaluations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Generative models struggle in sparse reward settings where the reward signal is near-zero and reward evaluations are expensive. This challenge calls for alternative approaches to improve the model's learning and performance.

Method: The proposed method, BaNEL (Bayesian Negative Evidence Learning), focuses on learning from failed generation attempts. It introduces an in-loop generative model to recognize failure patterns and steer the generation process away from previously seen failures, minimizing reward evaluations.

Result: BaNEL demonstrated significant improvements in success rates on sparse-reward tasks, outperforming existing approaches by several orders of magnitude. It achieves this while requiring fewer reward evaluations.

Conclusion: BaNEL effectively addresses challenges in sparse reward generative tasks by leveraging failures rather than successes, proving to be more efficient and impactful than traditional methods.

Abstract: Today's generative models thrive with large amounts of supervised data and
informative reward functions characterizing the quality of the generation. They
work under the assumptions that the supervised data provides knowledge to
pre-train the model, and the reward function provides dense information about
how to further improve the generation quality and correctness. However, in the
hardest instances of important problems, two problems arise: (1) the base
generative model attains a near-zero reward signal, and (2) calls to the reward
oracle are expensive. This setting poses a fundamentally different learning
challenge than standard reward-based post-training. To address this, we propose
BaNEL (Bayesian Negative Evidence Learning), an algorithm that post-trains the
model using failed attempts only, while minimizing the number of reward
evaluations (NREs). Our method is based on the idea that the problem of
learning regularities underlying failures can be cast as another, in-loop
generative modeling problem. We then leverage this model to assess whether new
data resembles previously seen failures and steer the generation away from
them. We show that BaNEL can improve model performance without observing a
single successful sample on several sparse-reward tasks, outperforming existing
novelty-bonus approaches by up to several orders of magnitude in success rate,
while using fewer reward evaluations.

*Arash Fath Lipaei,AmirHossein Ghaemi,Melika Sabzikari*

Main category: cs.NE

TL;DR: This paper develops a modular framework for faster and more stable wing designs, combining several optimization algorithms and aerodynamic assessments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable faster early-phase wing design while ensuring aerodynamic stability and performance.

Method: Optimization pipeline involving the generation and improvement of wing geometries, using Vortex Lattice Method (VLM) for performance assessment, surrogate neural network models for prediction, stability evaluation, and comparison of multiple optimization techniques like PSO, GA, Bayesian optimization, etc.

Result: Improved aerodynamic qualities and robust stability properties for wing designs with efficient algorithms.

Conclusion: The framework provides a rapid, precise, and reproducible approach for wing design optimization.

Abstract: This paper introduces a modular and scalable design optimization framework
for the wing design process that enables faster early-phase design while
ensuring aerodynamic stability. The pipeline starts with the generation of
initial wing geometries and then proceeds to optimize the wing using several
algorithms. Aerodynamic performance is assessed using a Vortex Lattice Method
(VLM) applied to a carefully selected dataset of wing configurations. These
results are employed to develop surrogate neural network models, which can
predict lift and drag rapidly and accurately. The stability evaluation is
implemented by setting the control surfaces and components to fixed positions
in order to have realistic flight dynamics. The approach unifies and compares
several optimization techniques, including Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO),
Genetic Algorithms (GA), gradient-based MultiStart methods, Bayesian
optimization, and Lipschitz optimization. Each method ensures constraint
management via adaptive strategies and penalty functions, where the targets for
lift and design feasibility are enforced. The progression of aerodynamic
characteristics and geometries over the optimization iterations will be
investigated in order to clarify each algorithm's convergence characteristics
and performance efficiency. Our results show improvement in aerodynamic
qualities and robust stability properties, offering a mechanism for wing design
at speed and precision. In the interest of reproducibility and community
development, the complete implementation is publicly available at

Main category: cs.NE

TL;DR: The paper connects Evolutionary Computation (EC) to Generative AI (GenAI), proposing EC as "Natural Generative AI" that enhances creativity and diversity in generative tasks through evolutionary principles.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While GenAI achieves success, its reliance on statistical models and constrained data limits creativity. The authors aim to expand generative capabilities by connecting GenAI with EC principles to enhance diversity and explore beyond existing datasets.

Method: The paper compares traditional EC operators to GenAI, emphasizing the integration of disruptive, structured evolutionary leaps, and multitasking techniques for cross-domain recombination and moderated selection processes.

Result: The study demonstrates how EC can generate out-of-distribution artifacts and foster sustained innovation through evolutionary multitasking and disruptive operators.

Conclusion: By redefining EC as NatGenAI, the paper highlights its importance in advancing exploratory design, innovation, scientific discovery, and open-ended generation, extending GenAI's capabilities beyond conventional boundaries.

Abstract: Generative AI (GenAI) has achieved remarkable success across a range of
domains, but its capabilities remain constrained to statistical models of
finite training sets and learning based on local gradient signals. This often
results in artifacts that are more derivative than genuinely generative. In
contrast, Evolutionary Computation (EC) offers a search-driven pathway to
greater diversity and creativity, expanding generative capabilities by
exploring uncharted solution spaces beyond the limits of available data. This
work establishes a fundamental connection between EC and GenAI, redefining EC
as Natural Generative AI (NatGenAI) -- a generative paradigm governed by
exploratory search under natural selection. We demonstrate that classical EC
with parent-centric operators mirrors conventional GenAI, while disruptive
operators enable structured evolutionary leaps, often within just a few
generations, to generate out-of-distribution artifacts. Moreover, the methods
of evolutionary multitasking provide an unparalleled means of integrating
disruptive EC (with cross-domain recombination of evolved features) and
moderated selection mechanisms (allowing novel solutions to survive), thereby
fostering sustained innovation. By reframing EC as NatGenAI, we emphasize
structured disruption and selection pressure moderation as essential drivers of
creativity. This perspective extends the generative paradigm beyond
conventional boundaries and positions EC as crucial to advancing exploratory
design, innovation, scientific discovery, and open-ended generation in the
GenAI era.

*Takehiro Ishikawa*

Main category: cs.NE

TL;DR: Recent advancements in quantum machine learning (QML) and spiking neural networks (SNNs) face significant practical limitations compared to the dominance of deep neural networks (DNNs).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: This paper evaluates the limitations and challenges faced by QML and SNNs and argues their unlikelihood of replacing DNNs in the near term.

Method: The paper reviews the technical hurdles in QML and SNNs, including their computational inefficiencies, training difficulties, and comparison against DNN innovations.

Result: DNNs demonstrate superior practicality through advancements like Grok-4 Heavy and GPT-OSS-120B, outperforming QML and SNNs in scalability, efficiency, and effectiveness.

Conclusion: QML and SNNs may find niche roles, but DNNs' robustness and scalability keep them as the most practical and dominant AI paradigm for the foreseeable future.

Abstract: Recent advancements in QML and SNNs have generated considerable excitement,
promising exponential speedups and brain-like energy efficiency to
revolutionize AI. However, this paper argues that they are unlikely to displace
DNNs in the near term. QML struggles with adapting backpropagation due to
unitary constraints, measurement-induced state collapse, barren plateaus, and
high measurement overheads, exacerbated by the limitations of current noisy
intermediate-scale quantum hardware, overfitting risks due to underdeveloped
regularization techniques, and a fundamental misalignment with machine
learning's generalization. SNNs face restricted representational bandwidth,
struggling with long-range dependencies and semantic encoding in language tasks
due to their discrete, spike-based processing. Furthermore, the goal of
faithfully emulating the brain might impose inherent inefficiencies like
cognitive biases, limited working memory, and slow learning speeds. Even their
touted energy-efficient advantages are overstated; optimized DNNs with
quantization can outperform SNNs in energy costs under realistic conditions.
Finally, SNN training incurs high computational overhead from temporal
unfolding. In contrast, DNNs leverage efficient backpropagation, robust
regularization, and innovations in LRMs that shift scaling to inference-time
compute, enabling self-improvement via RL and search algorithms like MCTS while
mitigating data scarcity. This superiority is evidenced by recent models such
as xAI's Grok-4 Heavy, which advances SOTA performance, and gpt-oss-120b, which
surpasses or approaches the performance of leading industry models despite its
modest 120-billion-parameter size deployable on a single 80GB GPU. Furthermore,
specialized ASICs amplify these efficiency gains. Ultimately, QML and SNNs may
serve niche hybrid roles, but DNNs remain the dominant, practical paradigm for
AI advancement.

TL;DR: The paper introduces DDEA, a framework combining denoising diffusion models (DDMs) with evolutionary algorithms (EAs), for improved combinatorial optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DDMs are powerful for generative tasks but lack the exploration efficiency of traditional metaheuristics such as EAs when applied to combinatorial optimization.

Method: A new framework, DDEA, integrates pre-trained DDMs for initializing diverse populations and uses a novel diffusion-based recombination operator trained via imitation learning.

Result: DDEA outperformed the leading DDM solver (DIFUSCO) and Gurobi in terms of solution quality within the same time budget, and showed remarkable performance in out-of-distribution settings.

Conclusion: Hybridizing DDMs with EAs enhances combinatorial optimization capabilities, offering a promising new paradigm for machine learning solvers in complex optimization problems.

Abstract: Denoising diffusion models (DDMs) offer a promising generative approach for
combinatorial optimization, yet they often lack the robust exploration
capabilities of traditional metaheuristics like evolutionary algorithms (EAs).
We propose a Denoising Diffusion-based Evolutionary Algorithm (DDEA) framework
that synergistically integrates these paradigms. It utilizes pre-trained DDMs
for both high-quality and diverse population initialization and a novel
diffusion-based recombination operator, trained via imitation learning against
an optimal demonstrator. Evaluating DDEA on the Maximum Independent Set problem
on Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi graphs, we demonstrate notable improvements over DIFUSCO,
a leading DDM solver. DDEA consistently outperforms it given the same time
budget, and surpasses Gurobi on larger graphs under the same time limit, with
DDEA's solution sizes being 3.9% and 7.5% larger on the ER-300-400 and
ER-700-800 datasets, respectively. In out-of-distribution experiments, DDEA
provides solutions of 11.6% higher quality than DIFUSCO under the same time
limit. Ablation studies confirm that both diffusion initialization and
recombination are crucial. Our work highlights the potential of hybridizing
DDMs and EAs, offering a promising direction for the development of powerful
machine learning solvers for complex combinatorial optimization problems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of evolutionary algorithms, specifically their slow convergence rates in late-stage learning, and provide a unified framework for both parametric and functional optimisation in complex engineering problems.

Method: The framework integrates evolutionary algorithms for global exploration with a two-stage strategy balancing exploration and exploitation using genetic algorithms and Dowhill Simplex Method (DSM) for parametric problems, and genetic programming with DSM for functional tasks.

Result: Validation shows HyGO outperforms standard genetic algorithms in parametric optimisation benchmarks and functional tasks like controlling a damped Landau oscillator. It achieves over 20% aerodynamic drag reduction in a Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes simulation case study.

Conclusion: HyGO proves to be a robust and versatile optimisation framework, capable of handling diverse scientific and engineering problems with faster and more reliable results than traditional approaches.

Abstract: The Hybrid Genetic Optimisation framework (HyGO) is introduced to meet the
pressing need for efficient and unified optimisation frameworks that support
both parametric and functional learning in complex engineering problems.
Evolutionary algorithms are widely employed as derivative-free global
optimisation methods but often suffer from slow convergence rates, especially
during late-stage learning. HyGO integrates the global exploration capabilities
of evolutionary algorithms with accelerated local search for robust solution
refinement. The key enabler is a two-stage strategy that balances exploration
and exploitation. For parametric problems, HyGO alternates between a genetic
algorithm and targeted improvement through a degradation-proof Dowhill Simplex
Method (DSM). For function optimisation tasks, HyGO rotates between genetic
programming and DSM. Validation is performed on (a) parametric optimisation
benchmarks, where HyGO demonstrates faster and more robust convergence than
standard genetic algorithms, and (b) function optimisation tasks, including
control of a damped Landau oscillator. Practical relevance is showcased through
aerodynamic drag reduction of an Ahmed body via Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes
simulations, achieving consistently interpretable results and reductions
exceeding 20% by controlled jet injection in the back of the body for flow
reattachment and separation bubble reduction. Overall, HyGO emerges as a
versatile hybrid optimisation framework suitable for a broad spectrum of
engineering and scientific problems involving parametric and functional
learning.

Result: In ten attention-based benchmarks across multiple GPU architectures, Neptune achieves an average speedup of 1.35√ó compared to the best alternative compilers.

Conclusion: Neptune proves effective for deep learning workloads by improving performance in attention mechanisms through its advanced operator fusion techniques.

Abstract: Operator fusion has become a key optimization for deep learning, which
combines multiple deep learning operators to improve data reuse and reduce
global memory transfers. However, existing tensor compilers struggle to fuse
complex reduction computations involving loop-carried dependencies, such as
attention mechanisms.
  The paper introduces Neptune, a tensor compiler for advanced operator fusion
for sequences of reduction operators. Neptune presents a new approach for
advanced operator fusion, which intentionally breaks some existing dependencies
and compensates by constructing algebraic correction expressions that allow the
kernel to produce the correct result.
  On ten attention-based benchmarks, Neptune, starting from simple attention
code and a high-level scheduling template, outperforms existing compilers like
Triton, TVM, and FlexAttention, including Triton-based implementations of
FlashAttention. Across four different GPU architectures from NVIDIA and AMD,
Neptune-generated kernels have average speedup of $1.35\times$ over the next

Main category: cs.PL

TL;DR: The paper proposes a unified approach to manage stateful resources safely and expressively in programming languages, combining flow-insensitive capabilities with flow-sensitive typestate tracking.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The challenge of safely and expressively managing stateful resources in programming languages is exacerbated by aliasing and limitations of scope-based constructs which hinder expressiveness and parallelism.

Method: The authors extend flow-insensitive capability mechanisms into flow-sensitive typestate tracking, decoupling capability lifetimes from lexical scopes. This is implemented as an extension to the Scala 3 compiler using path-dependent types and implicit resolution.

Result: The approach supports diverse stateful patterns like file operations, locking protocols, DOM construction, and session types. It provides expressive, safe, and ergonomic typestate programming in a statically safe manner.

Conclusion: Expressive and safe typestate management can be realized with minimal changes to existing capability-based programming languages, enhancing stateful programming's robustness and ergonomics.

Abstract: Managing stateful resources safely and expressively is a longstanding
challenge in programming languages, especially in the presence of aliasing.
While scope-based constructs such as Java's synchronized blocks offer ease of
reasoning, they restrict expressiveness and parallelism. Conversely,
imperative, flow-sensitive management enables fine-grained control but demands
sophisticated typestate analyses and often burdens programmers with explicit
state tracking.
  In this work, we present a novel approach that unifies the strengths of both
paradigms by extending flow-insensitive capability mechanisms into
flow-sensitive typestate tracking. Our system decouples capability lifetimes
from lexical scopes, allowing functions to provide, revoke, and return
capabilities in a flow-sensitive manner, based on the existing mechanisms
explored for the safety and ergonomics of scoped capability programming.
  We implement our approach as an extension to the Scala 3 compiler, leveraging
path-dependent types and implicit resolution to enable concise, statically
safe, and expressive typestate programming. Our prototype generically supports
a wide range of stateful patterns, including file operations, advanced locking
protocols, DOM construction, and session types. This work demonstrates that
expressive and safe typestate management can be achieved with minimal
extensions to existing capability-based languages, paving the way for more
robust and ergonomic stateful programming.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a flow-sensitive effect system for improved memory management in higher-order impure functional languages by refining reachability qualifiers to explicitly handle operations like reading, writing, transferring, and deallocating resources.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation behind the paper is to bridge the gap in safe and explicit manual memory management techniques for higher-order functional programming languages, enhancing safety and control without relying on regions or linearity.

Method: The authors propose a flow-sensitive effect system using use and kill effects, formalize calculus, and provide operational semantics for validating use-after-free safety, supported by mechanized proofs for metatheoretic properties like preservation, progress, and soundness.

Result: The system models operations like deallocation, move semantics, and reference swapping with safety guarantees, expanding expressiveness and control in memory management for functional languages.

Conclusion: The integration of reachability-based reasoning and explicit resource control enhances the capabilities of memory management in higher-order functional languages, achieving improved safety and programmability.

Abstract: We present a flow-sensitive effect system for reachability types that
supports explicit memory management, including Rust-style move semantics, in
higher-order impure functional languages. Our system refines the existing
reachability qualifier with polymorphic \emph{use} and \emph{kill} effects that
record how references are read, written, transferred, and deallocated. The
effect discipline tracks operations performed on each resource using
qualifiers, enabling the type system to express ownership transfer, contextual
freshness, and destructive updates without regions or linearity. We formalize
the calculus, its typing and effect rules, and a compositional operational
semantics that validates use-after-free safety. All metatheoretic results,
including preservation, progress, and effect soundness, are mechanized. The
system models idioms such as reference deallocation, move semantics, reference
swapping, while exposing precise safety guarantee. Together, these
contributions integrate reachability-based reasoning with explicit resource
control, advancing the state of the art in safe manual memory management for
higher-order functional languages.

TL;DR: The paper explores C++ generic programming using concepts to enhance type systems and constraints, and highlights key principles, without delving deep into C++'s full language capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To demonstrate the utility of C++ concepts in expressing constraints for generic code, improving type systems, and blending generic programming with general programming.

Method: Using examples, the paper introduces programming techniques centered on C++ concepts, emphasizing their utility for extending type systems and avoiding common issues like narrowing conversions.

Result: The paper highlights that concepts enhance generic programming by providing range checks without significant overhead and supports general programming with features like lambdas and static reflection.

Conclusion: C++ concepts serve as a powerful tool for extending generic programming capabilities, blending seamlessly with general programming, and offering effective notational and runtime solutions.

Abstract: We present programming techniques to illustrate the facilities and principles
of C++ generic programming using concepts. Concepts are C++'s way to express
constraints on generic code. As an initial example, we provide a simple type
system that eliminates narrowing conversions and provides range checking
without unnecessary notational or run-time overheads. Concepts are used
throughout to provide user-defined extensions to the type system. The aim is to
show their utility and the fundamental ideas behind them, rather than to
provide a detailed or complete explanation of C++'s language support for
generic programming or the extensive support provided by the standard library.
Generic programming is an integral part of C++, rather than an isolated
sub-language. In particular, key facilities support general programming as well
as generic programming (e.g., uniform notation for types, lambdas, variadic
templates, and C++26 static reflection). Finally, we give design rationales and
origins for key parts of the concept design, including use patterns, the
relationship to Object-Oriented Programming, value arguments, notation, concept
type-matching, and definition checking.

*Saad Ahmed Bazaz,Mirza Omer Beg*

Main category: cs.PL

TL;DR: The paper proposes UniversalPython, a Python transpiler enabling programming in various human languages, exemplified with Urdu, overcoming English language barriers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional programming languages rely heavily on English, creating accessibility challenges for non-English speakers who lack resources to learn the language.

Method: Authors developed UniversalPython, an open-source transpiler built on Python that translates human languages into Python code, starting with Urdu as a proof-of-concept.

Result: The sudy successfully demonstrated the ability to write Python code in the Urdu language through this transpiler, highlighting its utility and feasibility.

Conclusion: UniversalPython has the potential to democratize programming by allowing people to code in their native languages, promising broader accessibility and scalability in the future.

Abstract: All widely used and useful programming languages have a common problem. They
restrict entry on the basis of knowledge of the English language. The lack of
knowledge of English poses a major hurdle to many newcomers who do not have the
resources, in terms of time and money, to learn the English language. Studies
show that people learn better in their own language. Therefore, we propose a
language transpiler built on top of the Python programming language, called
UniversalPython, which allows one to write Python in their own human language.
We demonstrate the ability to create an "Urdu Python" with this transpiler. In
the future, we aim to scale the language to encapsulate more human languages to
increase the availability of programming. The source code for this transpiler
is open-source, and available at

### [378] [ConPoSe: LLM-Guided Contact Point Selection for Scalable Cooperative Object Pushing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08705)
*Noah Steinkr√ºger,Nisarga Nilavadi,Wolfram Burgard,Tanja Katharina Kaiser*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper addresses cooperative object transportation in cluttered environments using multiple robots. It introduces ConPoSe, a method that combines Large Language Models (LLM) with local search to effectively select robot-object contact points for pushing strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Cooperative object transportation faces challenges in scenarios requiring robots to move objects too large for one robot. Conventional analytical methods for selecting contact points are limited by scalability issues due to the combinatorial growth of solution space with more robots and larger objects.

Method: The proposed method, ConPoSe, integrates Large Language Models (LLM) for common-sense reasoning with local search techniques to determine effective contact points for robots to collaboratively push objects of various shapes.

Result: ConPoSe demonstrates the ability to scale better than analytical approaches and surpasses pure LLM-based methods in performance. It efficiently handles different object shapes such as cuboids, cylinders, and T-shaped objects.

Conclusion: This approach shows promise for improving the scalability and effectiveness of cooperative object transportation strategies, leveraging the capabilities of LLM and local search integration.

Abstract: Object transportation in cluttered environments is a fundamental task in
various domains, including domestic service and warehouse logistics. In
cooperative object transport, multiple robots must coordinate to move objects
that are too large for a single robot. One transport strategy is pushing, which
only requires simple robots. However, careful selection of robot-object contact
points is necessary to push the object along a preplanned path. Although this
selection can be solved analytically, the solution space grows combinatorially
with the number of robots and object size, limiting scalability. Inspired by
how humans rely on common-sense reasoning for cooperative transport, we propose
combining the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models with local search
to select suitable contact points. Our LLM-guided local search method for
contact point selection, ConPoSe, successfully selects contact points for a
variety of shapes, including cuboids, cylinders, and T-shapes. We demonstrate
that ConPoSe scales better with the number of robots and object size than the
analytical approach, and also outperforms pure LLM-based selection.

*A. Wang,C. Jiang,M. Przystupa,J. Valentine,M. Jagersand*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces 'Point and Go' mode switching for wheelchair-mounted robotic manipulators, reducing task completion time, pauses, and mode switches while being preferred by users.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in operating high degree of freedom robots, such as unintuitive controls, limited movements, and frequent mode switching.

Method: Developed a new mode switching approach using a sweeping motion to determine translation axes and refined rotation controls, followed by evaluations using experiments and a user study.

Result: 'Point and Go' mode switching improved performance metrics: reduced task completion time by 31%, pauses by 41%, and mode switches by 33%. User surveys showed strong favorability.

Conclusion: The 'Point and Go' method enhances usability and efficiency for robotic manipulators, enabling intuitive controls and improved user experience.

Abstract: Operating high degree of freedom robots can be difficult for users of
wheelchair mounted robotic manipulators. Mode switching in Cartesian space has
several drawbacks such as unintuitive control reference frames, separate
translation and orientation control, and limited movement capabilities that
hinder performance. We propose Point and Go mode switching, which reallocates
the Cartesian mode switching reference frames into a more intuitive action
space comprised of new translation and rotation modes. We use a novel sweeping
motion to point the gripper, which defines the new translation axis along the
robot base frame's horizontal plane. This creates an intuitive `point and go'
translation mode that allows the user to easily perform complex, human-like
movements without switching control modes. The system's rotation mode combines
position control with a refined end-effector oriented frame that provides
precise and consistent robot actions in various end-effector poses. We verified
its effectiveness through initial experiments, followed by a three-task user
study that compared our method to Cartesian mode switching and a state of the
art learning method. Results show that Point and Go mode switching reduced
completion times by 31\%, pauses by 41\%, and mode switches by 33\%, while
receiving significantly favorable responses in user surveys.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper introduces a system enabling quadrupedal robots to play dynamic table tennis through high-speed perception, trajectory prediction, and agile control. Demonstrations on a real quadruped robot (Spot) showcase abilities like accurate ball return and human-rallying.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enhancing quadrupedal table tennis robots to mirror human-like capabilities, addressing challenges in speed, accuracy, and handling ball spins.

Method: The system integrates external cameras for high-speed ball localization, combines physical models with learned residuals for trajectory prediction, and introduces a novel model predictive control (MPC) for agile full-body robot control.

Result: The developed system allows real-world demonstrations on Spot quadruped, achieving ball aiming and return across varied spin types, and successfully rallying with human players.

Conclusion: This approach advances robot sports capabilities, offering innovations in perception, prediction, and control that enable quadrupedal robots to perform dynamic tasks and interact effectively in real-world sports scenarios.

Abstract: Developing table tennis robots that mirror human speed, accuracy, and ability
to predict and respond to the full range of ball spins remains a significant
challenge for legged robots. To demonstrate these capabilities we present a
system to play dynamic table tennis for quadrupedal robots that integrates high
speed perception, trajectory prediction, and agile control. Our system uses
external cameras for high-speed ball localization, physical models with learned
residuals to infer spin and predict trajectories, and a novel model predictive
control (MPC) formulation for agile full-body control. Notably, a continuous
set of stroke strategies emerge automatically from different ball return
objectives using this control paradigm. We demonstrate our system in the real
world on a Spot quadruped, evaluate accuracy of each system component, and
exhibit coordination through the system's ability to aim and return balls with
varying spin types. As a further demonstration, the system is able to rally
with human players.

### [381] [Geometry-aware Policy Imitation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08787)
*Yiming Li,Nael Darwiche,Amirreza Razmjoo,Sichao Liu,Yilun Du,Auke Ijspeert,Sylvain Calinon*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces Geometry-aware Policy Imitation (GPI), which uses geometric curves, rather than state-action pairs, for imitation learning to improve robot behavior.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard imitation learning approaches often rely on collections of state-action samples, which can suffer from inefficiencies in adaptability, scalability, and interpretability. The paper aims to address these challenges by rethinking the geometric basis for imitation learning.

Method: GPI transforms demonstrations into geometric curves and constructs distance fields that generate two control primitives: progression flow (advancement along trajectories) and attraction flow (deviation correction). These are combined into a non-parametric vector field to guide robots.

Result: Experiments showed that GPI achieved higher success rates than diffusion-based policies, operated 20 times faster, used less memory, and maintained robustness against perturbations across diverse simulation and real-world tasks.

Conclusion: GPI emerges as an efficient, interpretable, and scalable solution for robotic imitation learning, offering advantages in speed, robustness, and multimodal task handling over traditional generative approaches.

Abstract: We propose a Geometry-aware Policy Imitation (GPI) approach that rethinks
imitation learning by treating demonstrations as geometric curves rather than
collections of state-action samples. From these curves, GPI derives distance
fields that give rise to two complementary control primitives: a progression
flow that advances along expert trajectories and an attraction flow that
corrects deviations. Their combination defines a controllable, non-parametric
vector field that directly guides robot behavior. This formulation decouples
metric learning from policy synthesis, enabling modular adaptation across
low-dimensional robot states and high-dimensional perceptual inputs. GPI
naturally supports multimodality by preserving distinct demonstrations as
separate models and allows efficient composition of new demonstrations through
simple additions to the distance field. We evaluate GPI in simulation and on
real robots across diverse tasks. Experiments show that GPI achieves higher
success rates than diffusion-based policies while running 20 times faster,
requiring less memory, and remaining robust to perturbations. These results
establish GPI as an efficient, interpretable, and scalable alternative to
generative approaches for robotic imitation learning. Project website:

*Zhenyu Zhao,Hongyi Jing,Xiawei Liu,Jiageng Mao,Abha Jha,Hanwen Yang,Rong Xue,Sergey Zakharor,Vitor Guizilini,Yue Wang*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces "Humanoid Everyday," a large-scale humanoid manipulation dataset with multimodal sensory data, addressing gaps in benchmark diversity and evaluation standards.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current humanoid robot research lacks diverse, standardized datasets and benchmarks for versatile tasks involving locomotion, interaction, and manipulation.

Method: A supervised teleoperation pipeline was used to collect multimodal data (RGB, depth, LiDAR, tactile inputs, natural language annotations) across 10.3k trajectories covering 260 tasks.

Result: Generated a comprehensive dataset and analyzed policy learning methods, highlighting strengths and limitations for task categories.

Conclusion: Humanoid Everyday, alongside a cloud-based evaluation platform, aims to advance humanoid manipulation research and establish standards for real-world robotic capabilities.

Abstract: From loco-motion to dextrous manipulation, humanoid robots have made
remarkable strides in demonstrating complex full-body capabilities. However,
the majority of current robot learning datasets and benchmarks mainly focus on
stationary robot arms, and the few existing humanoid datasets are either
confined to fixed environments or limited in task diversity, often lacking
human-humanoid interaction and lower-body locomotion. Moreover, there are a few
standardized evaluation platforms for benchmarking learning-based policies on
humanoid data. In this work, we present Humanoid Everyday, a large-scale and
diverse humanoid manipulation dataset characterized by extensive task variety
involving dextrous object manipulation, human-humanoid interaction,
locomotion-integrated actions, and more. Leveraging a highly efficient
human-supervised teleoperation pipeline, Humanoid Everyday aggregates
high-quality multimodal sensory data, including RGB, depth, LiDAR, and tactile
inputs, together with natural language annotations, comprising 10.3k
trajectories and over 3 million frames of data across 260 tasks across 7 broad
categories. In addition, we conduct an analysis of representative policy
learning methods on our dataset, providing insights into their strengths and
limitations across different task categories. For standardized evaluation, we
introduce a cloud-based evaluation platform that allows researchers to
seamlessly deploy their policies in our controlled setting and receive
performance feedback. By releasing Humanoid Everyday along with our policy
learning analysis and a standardized cloud-based evaluation platform, we intend
to advance research in general-purpose humanoid manipulation and lay the
groundwork for more capable and embodied robotic agents in real-world
scenarios. Our dataset, data collection code, and cloud evaluation website are
made publicly available on our project website.

### [383] [Adaptive Motion Planning via Contact-Based Intent Inference for Human-Robot Collaboration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08811)
*Jiurun Song,Xiao Liang,Minghui Zheng*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper presents a framework for human-robot collaboration (HRC) that infers human intent through physical contact and adapts robot motion online.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance safe and efficient human-robot collaboration by developing a method that reduces reliance on burdening kinesthetic guidance and overcomes the limitations of large language models in reliable motion planning for HRC.

Method: The framework includes an optimization-based approach to estimate contact forces and locations using joint torque data and a robot dynamics model. It uses a torque-based contact detection mechanism and incorporates a contact-informed adaptive motion planner for online motion correction.

Result: Experiments on a 7-DOF manipulator demonstrate the framework's accuracy in force estimation and its capability for effective motion planning even under sensor uncertainty.

Conclusion: The proposed framework offers an innovative solution for enhancing real-time adaptability and safety in HRC by enabling robots to interpret human intent through physical contact with minimal installation complexity.

Abstract: Human-robot collaboration (HRC) requires robots to adapt their motions to
human intent to ensure safe and efficient cooperation in shared spaces.
Although large language models (LLMs) provide high-level reasoning for
inferring human intent, their application to reliable motion planning in HRC
remains challenging. Physical human-robot interaction (pHRI) is intuitive but
often relies on continuous kinesthetic guidance, which imposes burdens on
operators. To address these challenges, a contact-informed adaptive
motion-planning framework is introduced to infer human intent directly from
physical contact and employ the inferred intent for online motion correction in
HRC. First, an optimization-based force estimation method is proposed to infer
human-intended contact forces and locations from joint torque measurements and
a robot dynamics model, thereby reducing cost and installation complexity while
enabling whole-body sensitivity. Then, a torque-based contact detection
mechanism with link-level localization is introduced to reduce the optimization
search space and to enable real-time estimation. Subsequently, a
contact-informed adaptive motion planner is developed to infer human intent
from contacts and to replan robot motion online, while maintaining smoothness
and adapting to human corrections. Finally, experiments on a 7-DOF manipulator
are conducted to demonstrate the accuracy of the proposed force estimation
method and the effectiveness of the contact-informed adaptive motion planner
under perception uncertainty in HRC.

*Grace Ra Kim,Hailey Warner,Duncan Eddy,Evan Astle,Zachary Booth,Edward Balaban,Mykel J. Kochenderfer*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper introduces a framework to enhance autonomous science operations for deep space missions, reducing errors by 40%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Communication delays and environmental uncertainty in deep space missions hinder real-time operations, necessitating advanced autonomous systems.

Method: A POMDP framework is used to sequence science instruments, integrated with a Bayesian network to handle high-dimensional measurements. Policies are computed offline for resource-aware planning.

Result: The framework reduces sample identification errors by nearly 40% in a case study using Enceladus Orbilander's Life Detection Suite.

Conclusion: The proposed approach significantly improves autonomous science operations by reducing errors and enhancing system performance in communication-constrained settings.

Abstract: Deep space missions face extreme communication delays and environmental
uncertainty that prevent real-time ground operations. To support autonomous
science operations in communication-constrained environments, we present a
partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP) framework that adaptively
sequences spacecraft science instruments. We integrate a Bayesian network into
the POMDP observation space to manage the high-dimensional and uncertain
measurements typical of astrobiology missions. This network compactly encodes
dependencies among measurements and improves the interpretability and
computational tractability of science data. Instrument operation policies are
computed offline, allowing resource-aware plans to be generated and thoroughly
validated prior to launch. We use the Enceladus Orbilander's proposed Life
Detection Suite (LDS) as a case study, demonstrating how Bayesian network
structure and reward shaping influence system performance. We compare our
method against the mission's baseline Concept of Operations (ConOps),
evaluating both misclassification rates and performance in off-nominal sample
accumulation scenarios. Our approach reduces sample identification errors by
nearly 40%

*Le Mao,Andrew H. Liu,Renos Zabounidis,Zachary Kingston,Joseph Campbell*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces Concept-Driven Exploration (CDE), a technique using pre-trained vision-language models to improve exploration in visual control tasks for reinforcement learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Exploration in visual RL tasks is inefficient because raw pixels lack task-relevant structure, elevating the need for intelligent exploration strategies.

Method: The method employs pre-trained vision-language models to derive visual concepts from text task descriptions, using concept reconstruction as an auxiliary objective to guide policy learning and boost exploration.

Result: CDE achieves efficient and targeted exploration, is robust to noise, and demonstrates its efficacy in both simulated tasks and real-world settings, achieving an 80% success rate in a real manipulation test.

Conclusion: CDE reduces reliance on external models during deployment, effectively aligns exploration with task-relevant objectives, and enhances RL performance in both simulated and real-world scenarios.

Abstract: Intelligent exploration remains a critical challenge in reinforcement
learning (RL), especially in visual control tasks. Unlike low-dimensional
state-based RL, visual RL must extract task-relevant structure from raw pixels,
making exploration inefficient. We propose Concept-Driven Exploration (CDE),
which leverages a pre-trained vision-language model (VLM) to generate
object-centric visual concepts from textual task descriptions as weak,
potentially noisy supervisory signals. Rather than directly conditioning on
these noisy signals, CDE trains a policy to reconstruct the concepts via an
auxiliary objective, using reconstruction accuracy as an intrinsic reward to
guide exploration toward task-relevant objects. Because the policy internalizes
these concepts, VLM queries are only needed during training, reducing
dependence on external models during deployment. Across five challenging
simulated visual manipulation tasks, CDE achieves efficient, targeted
exploration and remains robust to noisy VLM predictions. Finally, we
demonstrate real-world transfer by deploying CDE on a Franka Research 3 arm,
attaining an 80\% success rate in a real-world manipulation task.

*Baoshan Song,Xiao Xia,Penggao Yan,Yihan Zhong,Weisong Wen,Li-Ta Hsu*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper introduces a tightly-coupled calibration method using IMU, odometer, and raw GNSS measurements, achieving better localization accuracy and releasing a novel open-source dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate calibration of intrinsic and extrinsic parameters is critical for autonomous ground vehicle localization, and existing GNSS-aided methods fall short in observability properties and ambiguity resolution.

Method: The authors propose a tightly coupled online calibration method that integrates IMU, odometer, and raw GNSS measurements within a factor graph optimization framework, supplemented by outlier mitigation and ambiguity resolution.

Result: Their method demonstrated superior calibration and localization performance in both simulation and real-world experiments, reducing maximum error from 61.51 m to 17.75 m, showing a 71.14% improvement over loosely coupled methods.

Conclusion: This study offers a robust calibration approach that enhances localization, while also releasing the first open dataset combining IMU, 2D odometer, and raw GNSS measurements, encouraging further advancements in the field.

Abstract: Accurate calibration of intrinsic (odometer scaling factors) and extrinsic
parameters (IMU-odometer translation and rotation) is essential for autonomous
ground vehicle localization. Existing GNSS-aided approaches often rely on
positioning results or raw measurements without ambiguity resolution, and their
observability properties remain underexplored. This paper proposes a tightly
coupled online calibration method that fuses IMU, odometer, and raw GNSS
measurements (pseudo-range, carrier-phase, and Doppler) within an extendable
factor graph optimization (FGO) framework, incorporating outlier mitigation and
ambiguity resolution. Observability analysis reveals that two horizontal
translation and three rotation parameters are observable under general motion,
while vertical translation remains unobservable. Simulation and real-world
experiments demonstrate superior calibration and localization performance over
state-of-the-art loosely coupled methods. Specifically, the IMU-odometer
positioning using our calibrated parameters achieves the absolute maximum error
of 17.75 m while the one of LC method is 61.51 m, achieving up to 71.14 percent
improvement. To foster further research, we also release the first open-source
dataset that combines IMU, 2D odometer, and raw GNSS measurements from both
rover and base stations.

*Alexandre Lopes,Catarina Barata,Plinio Moreno*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper applies a hybrid reinforcement learning (RL) framework to improve in-hand robotic manipulation tasks, showing enhancements in performance at the cost of higher computational complexity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: In-hand robotic manipulation is a complex and challenging task in robotics, requiring advanced control for handling diverse objects effectively.

Method: The method integrates Model-Free and Model-Based Reinforcement Learning frameworks. It combines a trained policy, a dynamic model, and value-function trajectory evaluation akin to Model Predictive Control. Performance testing involved both fully-actuated and under-actuated robotic hands across varied object properties.

Result: The hybrid RL framework significantly improves task performance for most test cases, even with variations in object density and size. It also supports task generalization across different objects.

Conclusion: The hybrid RL framework enhances manipulative capabilities in robotics but comes with a higher computational cost due to the added complexity of trajectory evaluations.

Abstract: In-Hand Manipulation, as many other dexterous tasks, remains a difficult
challenge in robotics by combining complex dynamic systems with the capability
to control and manoeuvre various objects using its actuators. This work
presents the application of a previously developed hybrid Reinforcement
Learning (RL) Framework to In-Hand Manipulation task, verifying that it is
capable of improving the performance of the task. The model combines concepts
of both Model-Free and Model-Based Reinforcement Learning, by guiding a trained
policy with the help of a dynamic model and value-function through trajectory
evaluation, as done in Model Predictive Control. This work evaluates the
performance of the model by comparing it with the policy that will be guided.
To fully explore this, various tests are performed using both fully-actuated
and under-actuated simulated robotic hands to manipulate different objects for
a given task. The performance of the model will also be tested for
generalization tests, by changing the properties of the objects in which both
the policy and dynamic model were trained, such as density and size, and
additionally by guiding a trained policy in a certain object to perform the
same task in a different one. The results of this work show that, given a
policy with high average reward and an accurate dynamic model, the hybrid
framework improves the performance of in-hand manipulation tasks for most test
cases, even when the object properties are changed. However, this improvement
comes at the expense of increasing the computational cost, due to the
complexity of trajectory evaluation.

TL;DR: The paper applies Data-enabled Predictive Control (DeePC), a model-free control approach, to a novel 3D soft robotic arm, achieving greater accuracy and robustness than model-based controllers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Soft robots have complex and nonlinear dynamics, making precise control challenging; applying DeePC to 3D soft robotic systems is relatively unexplored.

Method: This study designs and fabricates a 3D cable-driven soft robotic arm and applies DeePC with singular value decomposition (SVD) for control tasks like fixed-point regulation and trajectory tracking.

Result: Experimental tests show that DeePC outperforms a model-based controller in accuracy, robustness, and adaptability during dynamic control tasks.

Conclusion: DeePC presents a promising solution for effectively controlling 3D soft robots, offering notable advantages over traditional control approaches.

Abstract: Soft robots offer significant advantages in safety and adaptability, yet
achieving precise and dynamic control remains a major challenge due to their
inherently complex and nonlinear dynamics. Recently, Data-enabled Predictive
Control (DeePC) has emerged as a promising model-free approach that bypasses
explicit system identification by directly leveraging input-output data. While
DeePC has shown success in other domains, its application to soft robots
remains underexplored, particularly for three-dimensional (3D) soft robotic
systems. This paper addresses this gap by developing and experimentally
validating an effective DeePC framework on a 3D, cable-driven soft arm.
Specifically, we design and fabricate a soft robotic arm with a thick tubing
backbone for stability, a dense silicone body with large cavities for strength
and flexibility, and rigid endcaps for secure termination. Using this platform,
we implement DeePC with singular value decomposition (SVD)-based dimension
reduction for two key control tasks: fixed-point regulation and trajectory
tracking in 3D space. Comparative experiments with a baseline model-based
controller demonstrate DeePC's superior accuracy, robustness, and adaptability,
highlighting its potential as a practical solution for dynamic control of soft
robots.

TL;DR: This paper introduces a novel classification of quadrics and a method to solve the point-to-axisymmetric quadric proximity problem, emphasizing computational efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to provide an efficient and novel approach to classify quadrics and address the point-to-axisymmetric quadric proximity problem, which has minimal presence in existing literature.

Method: They simplify the problem by reducing it from 3D to 2D and use geometric properties of conics (e.g., sub-normal, eccentricity) to systematically solve sub-cases for different conic types.

Result: The method is computationally efficient, categorized into unique sub-cases depending on conic and point location, and outperforms the commercial library Bullet.

Conclusion: The proposed approach is novel, practical for programming implementation, and faster than existing libraries, making it a valuable contribution.

Abstract: This paper presents the classification of a general quadric into an
axisymmetric quadric (AQ) and the solution to the problem of the proximity of a
given point to an AQ. The problem of proximity in $R^3$ is reduced to the same
in $R^2$, which is not found in the literature. A new method to solve the
problem in $R^2$ is used based on the geometrical properties of the conics,
such as sub-normal, length of the semi-major axis, eccentricity, slope and
radius. Furthermore, the problem in $R^2$ is categorised into two and three
more sub-cases for parabola and ellipse/hyperbola, respectively, depending on
the location of the point, which is a novel approach as per the authors'
knowledge. The proposed method is suitable for implementation in a common
programming language, such as C and proved to be faster than a commercial
library, namely, Bullet.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a model for supervisor trust in autonomous systems, examining asymmetric trust dynamics with sampled interaction data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve human-autonomous system interaction through a better understanding and modeling of trust dynamics.

Method: A switched linear system structure with event-triggered sampling was developed, followed by empirical data collection from 51 participants for model parameter identification.

Result: Trust response data enabled parameter identification for the proposed model, successfully capturing asymmetric and intermittent trust dynamics.

Conclusion: The model provides a nuanced method to analyze supervisor trust in autonomous systems, enhancing future applications involving human-system interaction.

Abstract: Advances in the control of autonomous systems have accompanied an expansion
in the potential applications for autonomous robotic systems. The success of
applications involving humans depends on the quality of interaction between the
autonomous system and the human supervisor, which is particularly affected by
the degree of trust that the supervisor places in the autonomous system. Absent
from the literature are models of supervisor trust dynamics that can
accommodate asymmetric responses to autonomous system performance and the
intermittent nature of supervisor-autonomous system communication. This paper
focuses on formulating an estimated model of supervisor trust that incorporates
both of these features by employing a switched linear system structure with
event-triggered sampling of the model input and output. Trust response data
collected in a user study with 51 participants were then used identify
parameters for a switched linear model-based observer of supervisor trust.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: iMoWM is a new interactive world model for robotic manipulation, combining image, depth, and robot arm representations efficiently using MMTokenizer and leveraging VideoGPT.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable better geometric and spatial reasoning in robotic manipulation through improved 3D world modeling, addressing limitations of 2D video-based approaches.

Method: Developed iMoWM capable of generating multi-modal outputs (color images, depth maps, robot arm masks) using MMTokenizer for compact token representation which integrates with VideoGPT for efficiency.

Result: iMoWM demonstrated superior performance in producing visual predictions, supporting model-based reinforcement learning (MBRL), and aiding real-world imitation learning through multi-modal world modeling.

Conclusion: iMoWM showcases the advantages of multi-modal approaches for improving robotic manipulation tasks and serves as an effective simulator integrating richer physical information.

Abstract: Learned world models hold significant potential for robotic manipulation, as
they can serve as simulator for real-world interactions. While extensive
progress has been made in 2D video-based world models, these approaches often
lack geometric and spatial reasoning, which is essential for capturing the
physical structure of the 3D world. To address this limitation, we introduce
iMoWM, a novel interactive world model designed to generate color images, depth
maps, and robot arm masks in an autoregressive manner conditioned on actions.
To overcome the high computational cost associated with three-dimensional
information, we propose MMTokenizer, which unifies multi-modal inputs into a
compact token representation. This design enables iMoWM to leverage large-scale

*Shannon Liu,Maria Teresa Parreira,Wendy Ju*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The study employs machine learning to identify robot errors and their progression by analyzing human reactions during repeated conversational failures, achieving high accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As robots are increasingly central to society, detecting and responding to robot errors is critical to ensure seamless human-robot interactions.

Method: 26 participants engaged with a robot making repeated conversational errors. Behavioral data was extracted from videos and used to train machine learning models tailored to each individual.

Result: The machine learning approach achieved 93.5% accuracy in error detection and 84.1% accuracy in classifying successive robot failures from human reactions.

Conclusion: Analyzing human reactions to robot errors with machine learning can significantly improve the detection of errors and understanding of interaction breakdown progression in HRI.

Abstract: As robots become more integrated into society, detecting robot errors is
essential for effective human-robot interaction (HRI). When a robot fails
repeatedly, how can it know when to change its behavior? Humans naturally
respond to robot errors through verbal and nonverbal cues that intensify over
successive failures-from confusion and subtle speech changes to visible
frustration and impatience. While prior work shows that human reactions can
indicate robot failures, few studies examine how these evolving responses
reveal successive failures. This research uses machine learning to recognize
stages of robot failure from human reactions. In a study with 26 participants
interacting with a robot that made repeated conversational errors, behavioral
features were extracted from video data to train models for individual users.
The best model achieved 93.5% accuracy for detecting errors and 84.1% for
classifying successive failures. Modeling the progression of human reactions
enhances error detection and understanding of repeated interaction breakdowns
in HRI.

*Jikai Wang,Yunqi Cheng,Kezhi Wang,Zonghai Chen*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper presents a robust visual teach-and-repeat navigation system for mobile robots, using a topo-metric graph, advanced place recognition, and a local map-less navigation strategy for overcoming environmental challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges faced by mobile robots in trajectory repeat navigation within unknown environments, such as environmental changes and dynamic objects.

Method: The proposed system formulates keyframes as a topo-metric graph during the teaching process, clusters keyframes for place recognition in the repeating process, employs a long-term goal management algorithm for tracking, and uses a local trajectory-control candidate optimization for navigation without a map.

Result: Extensive experiments on a mobile platform show that the proposed system outperforms baseline methods in robustness and effectiveness.

Conclusion: The novel visual teach-and-repeat system provides a flexible and robust solution, overcoming issues such as environmental changes and occlusions, making it more effective for mobile robots.

Abstract: Visual Teach-and-Repeat Navigation is a direct solution for mobile robot to
be deployed in unknown environments. However, robust trajectory repeat
navigation still remains challenged due to environmental changing and dynamic
objects. In this paper, we propose a novel visual teach-and-repeat navigation
system, which consists of a flexible map representation, robust map matching
and a map-less local navigation module. During the teaching process, the
recorded keyframes are formulated as a topo-metric graph and each node can be
further extended to save new observations. Such representation also alleviates
the requirement of globally consistent mapping. To enhance the place
recognition performance during repeating process, instead of using
frame-to-frame matching, we firstly implement keyframe clustering to aggregate
similar connected keyframes into local map and perform place recognition based
on visual frame-tolocal map matching strategy. To promote the local goal
persistent tracking performance, a long-term goal management algorithm is
constructed, which can avoid the robot getting lost due to environmental
changes or obstacle occlusion. To achieve the goal without map, a local
trajectory-control candidate optimization algorithm is proposed. Extensively
experiments are conducted on our mobile platform. The results demonstrate that
our system is superior to the baselines in terms of robustness and
effectiveness.

*Xinhu Li,Ayush Jain,Zhaojing Yang,Yigit Korkmaz,Erdem Bƒ±yƒ±k*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper proposes a method for training robots that enables them to surpass the limitations of conventional demonstrations by constrained experts, resulting in faster and more efficient task execution.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations in expert demonstrations caused by constraints such as indirect control interfaces, restricted hardware setups, and safety concerns, which result in suboptimal robot policies.

Method: The proposed method uses constrained expert demonstrations to infer a state-only reward signal for evaluating task progress. Unknown states are assigned rewards through temporal interpolation. This approach goes beyond direct imitation and enables robots to explore more efficient trajectories.

Result: The method achieves improved sample efficiency and significantly faster task completion time compared to common imitation learning techniques. On a WidowX robotic arm, it completed tasks in 12 seconds, which is 10x faster than behavioral cloning.

Conclusion: The approach enables robots to learn more efficient policies than those demonstrated by constrained experts, overcoming traditional performance limitations in imitation learning frameworks.

Abstract: Learning from demonstrations enables experts to teach robots complex tasks
using interfaces such as kinesthetic teaching, joystick control, and
sim-to-real transfer. However, these interfaces often constrain the expert's
ability to demonstrate optimal behavior due to indirect control, setup
restrictions, and hardware safety. For example, a joystick can move a robotic
arm only in a 2D plane, even though the robot operates in a higher-dimensional
space. As a result, the demonstrations collected by constrained experts lead to
suboptimal performance of the learned policies. This raises a key question: Can
a robot learn a better policy than the one demonstrated by a constrained
expert? We address this by allowing the agent to go beyond direct imitation of
expert actions and explore shorter and more efficient trajectories. We use the
demonstrations to infer a state-only reward signal that measures task progress,
and self-label reward for unknown states using temporal interpolation. Our
approach outperforms common imitation learning in both sample efficiency and
task completion time. On a real WidowX robotic arm, it completes the task in 12
seconds, 10x faster than behavioral cloning, as shown in real-robot videos on
https://sites.google.com/view/constrainedexpert .

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A decentralized navigation framework combines strategic foresight with tactical agility for multi-robot systems in constrained, GPS-denied environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the limitations of centralized and distributed methods in navigating unknown, communication-limited environments.

Method: Introduces a hierarchical framework with strategic topological mapping and local metric-based trajectory planning.

Result: System achieved superior success rates and efficiency in simulations and real-world tests, especially under communication constraints.

Conclusion: The framework balances global awareness and local agility without a unified coordinate system, improving navigation performance in complex environments.

Abstract: Multi-robot navigation in unknown, structurally constrained, and GPS-denied
environments presents a fundamental trade-off between global strategic
foresight and local tactical agility, particularly under limited communication.
Centralized methods achieve global optimality but suffer from high
communication overhead, while distributed methods are efficient but lack the
broader awareness to avoid deadlocks and topological traps. To address this, we
propose a fully decentralized, hierarchical relative navigation framework that
achieves both strategic foresight and tactical agility without a unified
coordinate system. At the strategic layer, robots build and exchange
lightweight topological maps upon opportunistic encounters. This process
fosters an emergent global awareness, enabling the planning of efficient,
trap-avoiding routes at an abstract level. This high-level plan then inspires
the tactical layer, which operates on local metric information. Here, a
sampling-based escape point strategy resolves dense spatio-temporal conflicts
by generating dynamically feasible trajectories in real time, concurrently
satisfying tight environmental and kinodynamic constraints. Extensive
simulations and real-world experiments demonstrate that our system
significantly outperforms in success rate and efficiency, especially in
communication-limited environments with complex topological structures.

*Simon Idoko,Arun Kumar Singh*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper introduces a learning-based method called Flow-Opt for centralized trajectory optimization in multi-robot systems, achieving smoother and faster results compared to existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the computational intractability of centralized trajectory optimization for large multi-robot swarms, particularly in complex and cluttered environments.

Method: Flow-Opt combines a permutation-invariant generative diffusion model for sampling candidate trajectories with a Safety-Filter solver equipped with a self-supervised neural network for constraint satisfaction.

Result: The method generates trajectories for tens of robots in cluttered spaces within milliseconds, outperforming competitors in speed and smoothness. It also solves multiple problem instances in parallel efficiently and provides diverse trajectory options.

Conclusion: Flow-Opt sets a new standard in centralized multi-robot trajectory optimization by significantly improving computational efficiency, scalability, and solution diversity, potentially enabling broader adoption in complex robotic systems.

Abstract: Centralized trajectory optimization in the joint space of multiple robots
allows access to a larger feasible space that can result in smoother
trajectories, especially while planning in tight spaces. Unfortunately, it is
often computationally intractable beyond a very small swarm size. In this
paper, we propose Flow-Opt, a learning-based approach towards improving the
computational tractability of centralized multi-robot trajectory optimization.
Specifically, we reduce the problem to first learning a generative model to
sample different candidate trajectories and then using a learned
Safety-Filter(SF) to ensure fast inference-time constraint satisfaction. We
propose a flow-matching model with a diffusion transformer (DiT) augmented with
permutation invariant robot position and map encoders as the generative model.
We develop a custom solver for our SF and equip it with a neural network that
predicts context-specific initialization. The initialization network is trained
in a self-supervised manner, taking advantage of the differentiability of the
SF solver. We advance the state-of-the-art in the following respects. First, we
show that we can generate trajectories of tens of robots in cluttered
environments in a few tens of milliseconds. This is several times faster than
existing centralized optimization approaches. Moreover, our approach also
generates smoother trajectories orders of magnitude faster than competing
baselines based on diffusion models. Second, each component of our approach can
be batched, allowing us to solve a few tens of problem instances in a fraction
of a second. We believe this is a first such result; no existing approach
provides such capabilities. Finally, our approach can generate a diverse set of
trajectories between a given set of start and goal locations, which can capture
different collision-avoidance behaviors.

*Yuki Kuroda,Tomoya Takahashi,Cristian C Beltran-Hernandez,Masashi Hamaya,Kazutoshi Tanaka*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This study introduces a lightweight electric prosthetic hand (311 g) with only four motors, designed for in-hand manipulations like rotating objects, achieving high success rates (90-100%) in experiments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations of electric prosthetic hands, such as excessive weight, static grasp posture, and vulnerability to external damage, while enabling essential in-hand manipulation for daily activities.

Method: The researchers used a combination of a single-axis thumb and optimized thumb positioning to ensure posture transitions between grasps, achieving rotational movements for in-hand manipulations using only four motors in a compact design.

Result: The prosthetic hand demonstrated successful reorientation tasks with primitive objects of various shapes and widths, achieving a 90-100% success rate. It also performed practical tasks like seal stamping, USB insertion, and screwdriver operation.

Conclusion: The proposed lightweight and simple design for an electric prosthetic hand provides effective in-hand manipulation while addressing weight, durability, and usability issues, making it suitable for daily tasks.

Abstract: Electric prosthetic hands should be lightweight to decrease the burden on the
user, shaped like human hands for cosmetic purposes, and have motors inside to
protect them from damage and dirt. In addition to the ability to perform daily
activities, these features are essential for everyday use of the hand. In-hand
manipulation is necessary to perform daily activities such as transitioning
between different postures, particularly through rotational movements, such as
reorienting cards before slot insertion and operating tools such as
screwdrivers. However, currently used electric prosthetic hands only achieve
static grasp postures, and existing manipulation approaches require either many
motors, which makes the prosthesis heavy for daily use in the hand, or complex
mechanisms that demand a large internal space and force external motor
placement, complicating attachment and exposing the components to damage.
Alternatively, we combine a single-axis thumb and optimized thumb positioning
to achieve basic posture and in-hand manipulation, that is, the reorientation
between precision and lateral grasps, using only four motors in a lightweight
(311 g) prosthetic hand. Experimental validation using primitive objects of
various widths (5-30 mm) and shapes (cylinders and prisms) resulted in success
rates of 90-100% for reorientation tasks. The hand performed seal stamping and
USB device insertion, as well as rotation to operate a screwdriver.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a need for robots to combine autonomous exploration with effective whole-body control to navigate and interact physically in unstructured and dynamic environments.

Method: The HANDO framework consists of two layers: an autonomous goal-conditioned exploration policy for navigation and a unified loco-manipulation policy for precise physical interaction tasks.

Result: An initial deployment of the navigation module has been conducted, with plans to extend the system for more detailed whole-body manipulation tasks.

Conclusion: The proposed framework demonstrates potential for advancing human-centered robot interaction in complex real-world environments.

Abstract: Seamless loco-manipulation in unstructured environments requires robots to
leverage autonomous exploration alongside whole-body control for physical
interaction. In this work, we introduce HANDO (Hierarchical Autonomous
Navigation and Dexterous Omni-loco-manipulation), a two-layer framework
designed for legged robots equipped with manipulators to perform human-centered
mobile manipulation tasks. The first layer utilizes a goal-conditioned
autonomous exploration policy to guide the robot to semantically specified
targets, such as a black office chair in a dynamic environment. The second
layer employs a unified whole-body loco-manipulation policy to coordinate the
arm and legs for precise interaction tasks-for example, handing a drink to a
person seated on the chair. We have conducted an initial deployment of the
navigation module, and will continue to pursue finer-grained deployment of
whole-body loco-manipulation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the need for efficient motion planning that avoids reliance on large training datasets or costly human demonstrations while achieving high-quality trajectory generation.

Method: The method encodes a single demonstration as a Dynamic Movement Primitive (DMP), reshapes it using policy-based reinforcement learning to create diverse trajectories, and trains a neural network using this dataset. The neural network maps obstacle-related input parameters to DMP parameters for trajectory generation.

Result: The proposed approach outperforms the RRT-Connect method in both simulation and real-robot experiments, achieving better computation and execution times, shorter trajectory lengths, and support for multi-modal trajectory generation.

Conclusion: The work demonstrates that efficient motion planning is possible with minimal input, leveraging artificial demonstrations and reinforcement learning to achieve high-quality, adaptable trajectories in diverse environments.

Abstract: Learning-based motion planning can quickly generate near-optimal
trajectories. However, it often requires either large training datasets or
costly collection of human demonstrations. This work proposes an alternative
approach that quickly generates smooth, near-optimal collision-free 3D
Cartesian trajectories from a single artificial demonstration. The
demonstration is encoded as a Dynamic Movement Primitive (DMP) and iteratively
reshaped using policy-based reinforcement learning to create a diverse
trajectory dataset for varying obstacle configurations. This dataset is used to
train a neural network that takes as inputs the task parameters describing the
obstacle dimensions and location, derived automatically from a point cloud, and
outputs the DMP parameters that generate the trajectory. The approach is
validated in simulation and real-robot experiments, outperforming a RRT-Connect
baseline in terms of computation and execution time, as well as trajectory
length, while supporting multi-modal trajectory generation for different
obstacle geometries and end-effector dimensions. Videos and the implementation

Motivation: Robotic navigation in dynamic environments is challenging, and traditional testing methods often fail to adequately address all operational requirements.

Method: The authors extended the Surrealist framework to generate obstacle avoidance scenarios for ANYmal, validated by search-based algorithm testing, and conducted a six-month evaluation in industrial workflows.

Result: The framework identified critical flaws in robotic algorithms, revealing success rates of 40.3% and 71.2% for different approaches, and was positively assessed in industrial settings.

Conclusion: Surrealist enhances robotic algorithm development by uncovering failures, serving as an objective benchmark, and improving verification processes, demonstrating its value in industrial applications.

Abstract: Ensuring robust robotic navigation in dynamic environments is a key
challenge, as traditional testing methods often struggle to cover the full
spectrum of operational requirements. This paper presents the industrial
adoption of Surrealist, a simulation-based test generation framework originally
for UAVs, now applied to the ANYmal quadrupedal robot for industrial
inspection. Our method uses a search-based algorithm to automatically generate
challenging obstacle avoidance scenarios, uncovering failures often missed by
manual testing. In a pilot phase, generated test suites revealed critical
weaknesses in one experimental algorithm (40.3% success rate) and served as an
effective benchmark to prove the superior robustness of another (71.2% success
rate). The framework was then integrated into the ANYbotics workflow for a
six-month industrial evaluation, where it was used to test five proprietary

TL;DR: The paper introduces FIPER, a framework for early runtime failure prediction for generative imitation learning policies in robots, improving safety and robustness without needing failure data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address unpredictable and unsafe robot behavior caused by distribution shifts or compounding errors in unseen environments, aiming for failure prediction methods that work without requiring failure data.

Method: FIPER uses random network distillation for detecting out-of-distribution observations and introduces an action-chunk entropy score for measuring action uncertainty. It calibrates predictions using conformal prediction and triggers failure alarms based on aggregated thresholds.

Result: FIPER demonstrated higher accuracy and earlier failure prediction across simulated and real-world environments compared to existing methods, effectively distinguishing failures from benign conditions.

Conclusion: This method advances safer and more interpretable generative robot policies, showcasing a general framework for runtime failure prediction with broad applications in robotic systems.

Abstract: Imitation learning (IL) with generative models, such as diffusion and flow
matching, has enabled robots to perform complex, long-horizon tasks. However,
distribution shifts from unseen environments or compounding action errors can
still cause unpredictable and unsafe behavior, leading to task failure. Early
failure prediction during runtime is therefore essential for deploying robots
in human-centered and safety-critical environments. We propose FIPER, a general
framework for Failure Prediction at Runtime for generative IL policies that
does not require failure data. FIPER identifies two key indicators of impending
failure: (i) out-of-distribution (OOD) observations detected via random network
distillation in the policy's embedding space, and (ii) high uncertainty in
generated actions measured by a novel action-chunk entropy score. Both failure
prediction scores are calibrated using a small set of successful rollouts via
conformal prediction. A failure alarm is triggered when both indicators,
aggregated over short time windows, exceed their thresholds. We evaluate FIPER
across five simulation and real-world environments involving diverse failure
modes. Our results demonstrate that FIPER better distinguishes actual failures
from benign OOD situations and predicts failures more accurately and earlier
than existing methods. We thus consider this work an important step towards
more interpretable and safer generative robot policies. Code, data and videos

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current robotic tips for guidewires improve maneuverability but face challenges in modeling and control, necessitating automation to enhance precision and safety in endovascular procedures.

Method: The proposed method uses a transformer-based imitation learning framework combined with goal conditioning, relative action outputs, and automatic contrast dye injection, trained on simulated fluoroscopy data.

Result: The model successfully navigated soft robotic guidewires to aneurysm targets with an 83% success rate on unseen geometries, surpassing competing baselines.

Conclusion: The presented framework demonstrates considerable promise for improving precision and safety in robotic guidewire operations, underscoring its potential for broader applications in surgical automation.

Abstract: In endovascular surgery, endovascular interventionists push a thin tube
called a catheter, guided by a thin wire to a treatment site inside the
patient's blood vessels to treat various conditions such as blood clots,
aneurysms, and malformations. Guidewires with robotic tips can enhance
maneuverability, but they present challenges in modeling and control.
Automation of soft robotic guidewire navigation has the potential to overcome
these challenges, increasing the precision and safety of endovascular
navigation. In other surgical domains, end-to-end imitation learning has shown
promising results. Thus, we develop a transformer-based imitation learning
framework with goal conditioning, relative action outputs, and automatic
contrast dye injections to enable generalizable soft robotic guidewire
navigation in an aneurysm targeting task. We train the model on 36 different
modular bifurcated geometries, generating 647 total demonstrations under
simulated fluoroscopy, and evaluate it on three previously unseen vascular
geometries. The model can autonomously drive the tip of the robot to the
aneurysm location with a success rate of 83% on the unseen geometries,
outperforming several baselines. In addition, we present ablation and baseline
studies to evaluate the effectiveness of each design and data collection
choice. Project website: https://softrobotnavigation.github.io/

TL;DR: This paper introduces a method to improve energy-efficient locomotion in robots by combining a metric called Impact Mitigation Factor (IMF) with existing Adversarial Motion Prior (AMP) and Reinforcement Learning (RL) approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Animals move with energy efficiency due to their implicit passive dynamics, which has been challenging for roboticists to replicate effectively using traditional methods.

Method: The paper integrates a physics-informed metric (IMF) into RL policies, allowing the robot to learn both explicit motion patterns and implicit passive dynamics from animal references.

Result: Energy efficiency improved by up to 32%, as measured using the Cost of Transport (CoT), when applying this method to AMP and handcrafted reward structures.

Conclusion: Incorporating IMF into RL policies enhances both the naturalistic motion and energy efficiency of robots, advancing the replication of animal-like locomotion in robotics.

Abstract: Animals achieve energy-efficient locomotion by their implicit passive
dynamics, a marvel that has captivated roboticists for decades.Recently,
methods incorporated Adversarial Motion Prior (AMP) and Reinforcement learning
(RL) shows promising progress to replicate Animals' naturalistic motion.
However, such imitation learning approaches predominantly capture explicit
kinematic patterns, so-called gaits, while overlooking the implicit passive
dynamics. This work bridges this gap by incorporating a reward term guided by
Impact Mitigation Factor (IMF), a physics-informed metric that quantifies a
robot's ability to passively mitigate impacts. By integrating IMF with AMP, our
approach enables RL policies to learn both explicit motion trajectories from
animal reference motion and the implicit passive dynamic. We demonstrate energy
efficiency improvements of up to 32%, as measured by the Cost of Transport
(CoT), across both AMP and handcrafted reward structure.

*Daria de tinguy,Tim Verbelen,Emilio Gamba,Bart Dhoedt*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A biologically-inspired framework, AIMAPP, combines mapping, localization, and planning for autonomous robot navigation without relying on predefined maps or training, showcasing robust and scalable performance in diverse environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address the challenge of autonomous robot navigation in unfamiliar and unstructured environments without reliance on predefined maps, extensive training, or human intervention.

Method: The proposed AIMAPP framework uses Active Inference principles inspired by hippocampal navigation, combining sparse topological mapping, dynamic state learning, and action planning by minimizing Expected Free Energy. It operates self-supervised and integrates seamlessly with diverse robotic hardware.

Result: The framework exhibits robust performance in both simulated and real-world environments, showcasing adaptability to ambiguous observations, environmental changes, and sensor noise. Comparisons with state-of-the-art planning models demonstrate its superior scalability and resilience.

Conclusion: AIMAPP provides a self-supervised, biologically-inspired solution for autonomous robot navigation, merging exploration and goal-directed behavior effectively. Its release as an open-source tool ensures accessibility for further research and application.

Abstract: Autonomous navigation in unfamiliar environments requires robots to
simultaneously explore, localise, and plan under uncertainty, without relying
on predefined maps or extensive training. We present a biologically inspired,
Active Inference-based framework, Active Inference MAPping and Planning
(AIMAPP). This model unifies mapping, localisation, and decision-making within
a single generative model. Inspired by hippocampal navigation, it uses
topological reasoning, place-cell encoding, and episodic memory to guide
behaviour. The agent builds and updates a sparse topological map online, learns
state transitions dynamically, and plans actions by minimising Expected Free
Energy. This allows it to balance goal-directed and exploratory behaviours. We
implemented a ROS-compatible navigation system that is sensor and
robot-agnostic, capable of integrating with diverse hardware configurations. It
operates in a fully self-supervised manner, is resilient to drift, and supports
both exploration and goal-directed navigation without any pre-training. We
demonstrate robust performance in large-scale real and simulated environments
against state-of-the-art planning models, highlighting the system's
adaptability to ambiguous observations, environmental changes, and sensor
noise. The model offers a biologically inspired, modular solution to scalable,
self-supervised navigation in unstructured settings. AIMAPP is available at

*Justus Flerlage,Alexander Acker,Odej Kao*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper evaluates the feasibility of locally deployable, open-source LLMs as components for intent-based operating systems, comparing them to proprietary GPT-4 models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of cloud-based proprietary LLMs, such as privacy concerns, lack of autonomy, and scalability, and explore the potential of open-source LLMs in local deployment.

Method: The study conducts a comparative analysis of open-source models versus GPT-4-based systems in resolving user intentions and generating workflows. Performance trade-offs and practical viability are examined.

Result: Empirical findings highlight the trade-offs and capabilities of open-source LLMs in supporting local deployment, compared to cloud-based proprietary systems.

Conclusion: Open-source LLMs show promise for decentralized, privacy-conscious intent resolution, indicating their potential in localized AI-driven operating systems with adaptive and seamless user-device interaction.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as transformative tools for natural
language understanding and user intent resolution, enabling tasks such as
translation, summarization, and, increasingly, the orchestration of complex
workflows. This development signifies a paradigm shift from conventional,
GUI-driven user interfaces toward intuitive, language-first interaction
paradigms. Rather than manually navigating applications, users can articulate
their objectives in natural language, enabling LLMs to orchestrate actions
across multiple applications in a dynamic and contextual manner. However,
extant implementations frequently rely on cloud-based proprietary models, which
introduce limitations in terms of privacy, autonomy, and scalability. For
language-first interaction to become a truly robust and trusted interface
paradigm, local deployment is not merely a convenience; it is an imperative.
This limitation underscores the importance of evaluating the feasibility of
locally deployable, open-source, and open-access LLMs as foundational
components for future intent-based operating systems. In this study, we examine
the capabilities of several open-source and open-access models in facilitating
user intention resolution through machine assistance. A comparative analysis is
conducted against OpenAI's proprietary GPT-4-based systems to assess
performance in generating workflows for various user intentions. The present
study offers empirical insights into the practical viability, performance
trade-offs, and potential of open LLMs as autonomous, locally operable
components in next-generation operating systems. The results of this study
inform the broader discussion on the decentralization and democratization of AI
infrastructure and point toward a future where user-device interaction becomes
more seamless, adaptive, and privacy-conscious through locally embedded
intelligence.

### [410] [Which Is Better For Reducing Outdated and Vulnerable Dependencies: Pinning or Floating?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08609)
*Imranur Rahman,Jill Marley,William Enck,Laurie Williams*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper analyzes how different dependency version constraint types impact the likelihood of dependencies becoming outdated or vulnerable, offering insights for developers making version constraint choices.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Helping developers make informed decisions about dependency version constraints to balance security risks and the likelihood of outdated dependencies.

Method: The research evaluates trends in version constraint usage and dependency transitions in npm, PyPI, and Cargo ecosystems using survival analysis.

Result: The study identifies patterns: 'floating-major' is the least likely to cause outdated dependencies, and 'floating-minor' is the least prone to vulnerabilities. 'Pinning' is common but carries higher risks of outdated dependencies.

Conclusion: Understanding the trade-offs between dependency version constraints allows developers to better manage security risks, update dependencies effectively, and optimize software supply chain trustworthiness.

Abstract: Developers consistently use version constraints to specify acceptable
versions of the dependencies for their project. \emph{Pinning} dependencies can
reduce the likelihood of breaking changes, but comes with a cost of manually
managing the replacement of outdated and vulnerable dependencies. On the other
hand, \emph{floating} can be used to automatically get bug fixes and security
fixes, but comes with the risk of breaking changes. Security practitioners
advocate \emph{pinning} dependencies to prevent against software supply chain
attacks, e.g., malicious package updates. However, since \emph{pinning} is the
tightest version constraint, \emph{pinning} is the most likely to result in
outdated dependencies. Nevertheless, how the likelihood of becoming outdated or
vulnerable dependencies changes across version constraint types is unknown. The
goal of this study is to aid developers in making an informed dependency
version constraint choice by empirically evaluating the likelihood of
dependencies becoming outdated or vulnerable across version constraint types at
scale. In this study, we first identify the trends in dependency version
constraint usage and the patterns of version constraint type changes made by
developers in the npm, PyPI, and Cargo ecosystems. We then modeled the
dependency state transitions using survival analysis and estimated how the
likelihood of becoming outdated or vulnerable changes when using \emph{pinning}
as opposed to the rest of the version constraint types. We observe that among
outdated and vulnerable dependencies, the most commonly used version constraint
type is \emph{floating-minor}, with \emph{pinning} being the next most common.
We also find that \emph{floating-major} is the least likely to result in
outdated and \emph{floating-minor} is the least likely to result in vulnerable
dependencies.

### [411] [Relative Positioning Based Code Chunking Method For Rich Context Retrieval In Repository Level Code Completion Task With Code Language Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08610)
*Imranur Rahman,Md Rayhanur Rahman*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper discusses improving code completion by preprocessing code into chunks and retrieving relevant chunks using syntactic and semantic methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the gap in determining effective contexts for large language models (LLMs) to improve code completion in integrated development environments (IDEs).

Method: Proposed preprocessing repositories into smaller code chunks, using syntactic and semantic similarity-based retrieval, and organizing them with relative positioning for context.

Result: The strategy of code chunking and relative positioning enhanced the performance of code completion tasks.

Conclusion: Effective context collection using chunking and positional techniques can significantly aid LLMs in providing better code completion.

Abstract: Code completion can help developers improve efficiency and ease the
development lifecycle. Although code completion is available in modern
integrated development environments (IDEs), research lacks in determining what
makes a good context for code completion based on the information available to
the IDEs for the large language models (LLMs) to perform better. In this paper,
we describe an effective context collection strategy to assist the LLMs in
performing better at code completion tasks. The key idea of our strategy is to
preprocess the repository into smaller code chunks and later use syntactic and
semantic similarity-based code chunk retrieval with relative positioning. We
found that code chunking and relative positioning of the chunks in the final
context improve the performance of code completion tasks.

TL;DR: The paper explores the transformative impact of Large Language Models (LLMs) on SDLC collaboration, presenting both benefits and challenges such as improved productivity and privacy concerns.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in team collaboration during SDLC and assess how LLMs can improve productivity, communication, and decision-making.

Method: By conducting a literature review, industry examples, a team survey, and case studies on LLM-assisted tools.

Result: LLMs were found to significantly enhance efficiency, communication, and cross-functional collaboration while introducing limitations and privacy concerns.

Conclusion: The paper underscores the dual impact of LLMs in collaborative software engineering, proposing future research directions for their effective implementation.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly being integrated into software
development processes, with the potential to transform team workflows and
productivity. This paper investigates how LLMs affect team collaboration
throughout the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC). We reframe and update a
prior study with recent developments as of 2025, incorporating new literature
and case studies. We outline the problem of collaboration hurdles in SDLC and
explore how LLMs can enhance productivity, communication, and decision-making
in a team context. Through literature review, industry examples, a team survey,
and two case studies, we assess the impact of LLM-assisted tools (such as code
generation assistants and AI-powered project management agents) on
collaborative software engineering practices. Our findings indicate that LLMs
can significantly improve efficiency (by automating repetitive tasks and
documentation), enhance communication clarity, and aid cross-functional
collaboration, while also introducing new challenges like model limitations and
privacy concerns. We discuss these benefits and challenges, present research
questions guiding the investigation, evaluate threats to validity, and suggest
future research directions including domain-specific model customization,
improved integration into development tools, and robust strategies for ensuring
trust and security.

### [413] [Automating Android Build Repair: Bridging the Reasoning-Execution Gap in LLM Agents with Domain-Specific Tools](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08640)
*Ha Min Son,Huan Ren,Xin Liu,Zhe Zhao*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper introduces AndroidBuildBench for debugging Android build errors and proposes a specialized LLM agent, GradleFixer, which outperforms existing methods by leveraging domain-specific tools.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the challenge of fixing Android build errors automatically, which remains underexplored despite the wide use of LLMs for other code-related tasks.

Method: The authors created AndroidBuildBench, a dataset of build failures with verified fixes, and developed GradleFixer, a domain-specific LLM agent that uses tailored tools for inspecting the Gradle build environment.

Result: GradleFixer achieved an 81.4% success rate (pass@1) in resolving build failures, outperforming a general-purpose LLM agent by using domain-aware tools through a strategy called Tool Bridging.

Conclusion: The study concludes that domain-specific tools improve the reliability and effectiveness of LLMs in solving Android build errors, bridging the gap between high-level reasoning and low-level execution.

Abstract: Android is the largest mobile platform, yet automatically building
applications remains a practical challenge. While Large Language Models (LLMs)
show promise for code repair, their use for fixing Android build errors remains
underexplored. To address this gap, we first introduce AndroidBuildBench, a
benchmark of 1,019 build failures curated from the commit histories of 43
open-source Android projects. Each problem is paired with a verified solution
from a subsequent commit, ensuring that fixes are feasible. Second, we propose
GradleFixer, an LLM agent with domain-specific tools for inspecting and
manipulating the Gradle build environment. GradleFixer achieves a resolve rate
of 81.4% (pass@1), significantly outperforming a state-of-the-art coding agent
that relies on a general-purpose shell. GradleFixer's success suggests that
while LLMs possess the high-level knowledge to solve these failures, they
struggle to translate this knowledge into effective low-level actions using a
general-purpose shell. We demonstrate the effectiveness of a strategy we term
Tool Bridging, which replaces general-purpose shell commands with domain-aware
abstractions. We hypothesize this approach works through two mechanisms: 1) it
provides tools in an API-like format that LLMs use more reliably, and 2) it
constrains the action space to relevant operations. This approach bridges the
gap between the model's high-level reasoning and effective low-level execution.

*Jianan Mu,Mingyu Shi,Yining Wang,Tianmeng Yang,Bin Sun,Xing Hu,Jing Ye,Huawei Li*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper introduces Faver, a middleware to improve LLM-based RTL generation accuracy, addressing challenges in generating hardware code due to semantic gaps and limited data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To resolve the challenges of accurately generating hardware-level RTL from high-level code due to semantic gaps and limited verification data availability.

Method: Proposes using Faver, a verifiable middleware that combines LLM-friendly code structures with rule-based templates to simplify RTL verification and enhance LLM focus on functionality.

Result: Experiments showed a significant improvement of up to 14% in RTL generation accuracy when using Faver.

Conclusion: Faver effectively bridges the gap between high-level functional semantics and low-level details in LLM-based RTL generation, streamlining the process and enhancing accuracy.

Abstract: LLM-based RTL generation is an interesting research direction, as it holds
the potential to liberate the least automated stage in the current chip design.
However, due to the substantial semantic gap between high-level specifications
and RTL, coupled with limited training data, existing models struggle with
generation accuracy. Drawing on human experience, design with verification
helps improving accuracy. However, as the RTL testbench data are even more
scarce, it is not friendly for LLMs. Although LLMs excel at higher-level
languages like Python/C, they have a huge semantic gap from RTL. When
implementing the same functionality, Python/C code and hardware code differ
significantly in the spatiotemporal granularity, requiring the LLM not only to
consider high-level functional semantics but also to ensure the low-level
details align with the circuit code. It is not an easy task. In this paper, we
propose a function abstracted verifiable middleware (Faver) that streamlines
RTL verification in LLM-based workflows. By mixing LLM-friendly code structures
with a rule-based template, Faver decouples the details of circuit
verification, allowing the LLM to focus on the functionality itself. In our
experiments on the SFT model and open-source models, Faver improved the model's
generation accuracy by up to 14%.

*Aofan Liu,Haoxuan Li,Bin Wang,Ao Yang,Hui Li*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper introduces a multi-agent framework for controllable and secure code generation using LLMs, achieving high security rates and fostering user trust through transparent reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing code generation models face issues with safety, accuracy, and controllability, especially in complex tasks.

Method: A multi-agent framework is proposed, consisting of specialized agents (Planner, Searcher, CodeGen agent, and Extractor) utilizing the ReAct paradigm for reasoning and dynamic integration of external tools.

Result: The framework achieved a 94.8% security rate with CodeQL on the SVEN dataset, outperforming previous methods.

Conclusion: The framework enhances accuracy, controllability, and transparency in code generation, offering significant improvements over existing techniques.

Abstract: Code generation models based on large language models (LLMs) have gained wide
adoption, but challenges remain in ensuring safety, accuracy, and
controllability, especially for complex tasks. Existing methods often lack
dynamic integration of external tools, transparent reasoning, and user control
over safety. To address these issues, we propose a controllable code generation
framework utilizing the ReAct paradigm for multi-agent task execution. This
framework is a multi-agent system designed to enable efficient, precise, and
interpretable code generation through dynamic interactions between LLMs and
external resources. The framework adopts a collaborative architecture
comprising four specialized agents: a Planner for task decomposition, a
Searcher that leverages the ReAct framework for reasoning and tool integration,
a CodeGen agent for accurate code generation, and an Extractor for structured
data retrieval. The ReAct-based Searcher alternates between generating
reasoning traces and executing actions, facilitating seamless integration of
internal knowledge with external tools (such as search engines) to enhance
accuracy and user control. Experimental results show the framework's
effectiveness across multiple languages, achieving a 94.8% security rate on the
SVEN dataset with CodeQL, outperforming existing approaches. Its transparent
reasoning process fosters user trust and improves controllability.

TL;DR: The paper introduces literate tracing for program documentation using annotated execution traces and the TReX tool.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Software systems are growing increasingly complex, necessitating better methods for experts to explain system operation to novices.

Method: It proposes literate tracing, using annotated execution traces to document software and introduces TReX, a tool with interactive and visual features.

Result: The authors successfully applied TReX to document components of major software like the Linux kernel, Git, and GCC compiler.

Conclusion: Literate traces provide both global context and concrete code connection, bridging gaps left by traditional comments and design documents.

Abstract: As computer systems grow ever larger and more complex, a crucial task in
software development is for one person (the system expert) to communicate to
another (the system novice) how a certain program works. This paper reports on
the author's experiences with a paradigm for program documentation that we call
literate tracing. A literate trace explains a software system using annotated,
concrete execution traces of the system. Literate traces complement both
in-code comments (which often lack global context) and out-of-band design docs
(which often lack a concrete connection to the code). We also describe TReX,
our tool for making literate traces that are interactive, visual, and
guaranteed by construction to be faithful to the program semantics. We have
used TReX to write literate traces explaining components of large systems
software including the Linux kernel, Git source control system, and GCC
compiler.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) framework to optimize issue resolution in software teams by integrating JIRA tickets, GitHub pull requests, and semantic embeddings with FAISS-based vector search.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address delays in resolving recurring or related issues caused by scattered knowledge across JIRA tickets, developer discussions, and GitHub pull requests.

Method: The framework uses Sentence-Transformers for semantic embeddings, FAISS-based vector search for retrieving relevant past cases, and a Large Language Model (LLM) to synthesize grounded resolution suggestions.

Result: Experimental evaluation showed improvements in resolution accuracy, fix quality, resolution time reduction, and developer acceptance.

Conclusion: The proposed system enhances knowledge reuse and context-aware ticket resolution in DevOps environments, linking heterogeneous software artifacts effectively.

Abstract: Modern software teams frequently encounter delays in resolving recurring or
related issues due to fragmented knowledge scattered across JIRA tickets,
developer discussions, and GitHub pull requests (PRs). To address this
challenge, we propose a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) framework that
integrates Sentence-Transformers for semantic embeddings with FAISS-based
vector search to deliver context-aware ticket resolution recommendations. The
approach embeds historical JIRA tickets, user comments, and linked PR metadata
to retrieve semantically similar past cases, which are then synthesized by a
Large Language Model (LLM) into grounded and explainable resolution
suggestions. The framework contributes a unified pipeline linking JIRA and
GitHub data, an embedding and FAISS indexing strategy for heterogeneous
software artifacts, and a resolution generation module guided by retrieved
evidence. Experimental evaluation using precision, recall, resolution time
reduction, and developer acceptance metrics shows that the proposed system
significantly improves resolution accuracy, fix quality, and knowledge reuse in
modern DevOps environments.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper introduces BigCodeArena, a platform enabling human evaluation of code generation models with execution-based interaction, collecting extensive data across 10 models and curating benchmarks to assess coding quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in evaluating code generation models, which involve complex raw code understanding and execution simulation.

Method: Developed BigCodeArena, an evaluation platform for executing and interacting with LLM-generated code, collected extensive conversation data, and created benchmarks (BigCodeReward and AutoCodeArena).

Result: Over 14,000 code-centric sessions were collected, with analysis showing proprietary models outperform in code generation when execution results are available.

Conclusion: Execution-based evaluation enhances understanding of LLM coding preferences, indicating proprietary models remain leaders in coding tasks; AutoCodeArena enables effective automatic benchmarking.

Abstract: Crowdsourced model evaluation platforms, such as Chatbot Arena, enable
real-time evaluation from human perspectives to assess the quality of model
responses. In the coding domain, manually examining the quality of
LLM-generated content is extremely challenging, as it requires understanding
long chunks of raw code and deliberately simulating code execution. To this
end, we introduce BigCodeArena, an open human evaluation platform for code
generation backed by a comprehensive and on-the-fly execution environment.
Built on top of Chatbot Arena, BigCodeArena enables the execution of
LLM-generated code and allows humans to interact with the execution process and
outcomes. We collected over 14,000 raw code-centric conversation sessions
across 10 widely used LLMs, spanning 10 languages and 8 types of execution
environments. Among these conversations, we identified more than 4,700
multi-turn samples with pairwise human preferences. Further analysis uncovers
underexplored preferences of LLMs in fine-grained domains characterized by
tasks, languages, and frameworks. To systematically examine code understanding
and generation capabilities of frontier LLMs, we curated two benchmarks based
on the collected data, namely BigCodeReward and AutoCodeArena. For
BigCodeReward, we post-processed the 4,700 conversations and evaluated the
consistency between reward models and human preferences. The evaluation shows
that most LLMs have superior performance in judging coding preferences when the
execution results are available. Inspired by these findings, we propose
AutoCodeArena, an automatic Elo rating benchmark designed to assess the coding
quality of LLMs without human involvement. We find that proprietary LLMs like
GPT-5, Claude-Sonnet-4, and Claude-Opus-4 still lead in code generation
performance among recent emerging models.

*Stephan Lukasczyk,Gordon Fraser*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper investigates using differential evolution to efficiently tune hyperparameters of search-based test-generation algorithms, showing improved performance over default settings and grid search.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Default hyperparameter settings in test-generation algorithms often fail to deliver optimal results, and hyperparameter tuning methods, while promising, can be resource-intensive.

Method: The study employs differential evolution to optimize the hyperparameters for DynaMOSA and MIO algorithms within the Pynguin framework, comparing its performance to traditional grid search.

Result: The tuned DynaMOSA algorithm significantly improves test suite coverage, and differential evolution proves more efficient than grid search.

Conclusion: Differential evolution is a practical and efficient approach for tuning hyperparameters of many-objective search algorithms, leading to better performance outcomes.

Abstract: Search-based test-generation algorithms have countless configuration options.
Users rarely adjust these options and usually stick to the default values,
which may not lead to the best possible results. Tuning an algorithm's
hyperparameters is a method to find better hyperparameter values, but it
typically comes with a high demand of resources. Meta-heuristic search
algorithms -- that effectively solve the test-generation problem -- have been
proposed as a solution to also efficiently tune parameters. In this work we
explore the use of differential evolution as a means for tuning the
hyperparameters of the DynaMOSA and MIO many-objective search algorithms as
implemented in the Pynguin framework. Our results show that significant
improvement of the resulting test suite's coverage is possible with the tuned
DynaMOSA algorithm and that differential evolution is more efficient than basic
grid search.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper introduces PyMigTool, an end-to-end automated solution leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) for library migration in Python projects, combining LLMs with static and dynamic analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Library migration is difficult, error-prone, and time-consuming, often requiring extensive understanding of APIs and manual code transformations. Existing tools are limited in scope and functionality.

Method: The approach involves studying LLMs' capability for library migration, developing PyMigTool to integrate LLMs with static and dynamic analysis, and evaluating it on real-world benchmarks and projects.

Result: PyMigTool achieved 32% correctness on its evaluated migrations, and only 14% of changes required further fixes for over half of the failed migrations.

Conclusion: LLMs show promise in automating library migration tasks, and combining them with additional techniques in tools like PyMigTool can significantly reduce manual workload.

Abstract: Library migration is the process of replacing a library with a similar one in
a software project. Manual library migration is time consuming and error prone,
as it requires developers to understand the Application Programming Interfaces
(API) of both libraries, map equivalent APIs, and perform the necessary code
transformations. Due to the difficulty of the library migration process, most
of the existing automated techniques and tooling stop at the API mapping stage
or support a limited set of libraries and code transformations. In this paper,
we develop an end-to-end solution that can automatically migrate code between
any arbitrary pair of Python libraries that provide similar functionality. Due
to the promising capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) in code
generation and transformation, we use LLMs as the primary engine for migration.
Before building the tool, we first study the capabilities of LLMs for library
migration on a benchmark of 321 real-world library migrations. We find that
LLMs can effectively perform library migration, but some post-processing steps
can further improve the performance. Based on this, we develop PyMigTool, a
command line application that combines the power of LLMs, static analysis, and
dynamic analysis to provide accurate library migration. We evaluate PyMigTool
on 717 real-world Python applications that are not from our benchmark. We find
that PyMigTool can migrate 32% of the migrations with complete correctness. Of
the remaining migrations, only 14% of the migration-related changes are left
for developers to fix for more than half of the projects.

TL;DR: The paper introduces 'McMining,' a system for identifying programming misconceptions in student code using LLMs, and provides a benchmark dataset for it.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Students often develop misconceptions in programming, resulting in bugs, inefficiencies, and slower concept learning.

Method: The authors developed a benchmark dataset of programming misconceptions, then implemented LLM-based approaches using Gemini, Claude, and GPT models to detect misconceptions in student code.

Result: Extensive evaluations showed that the introduced LLM-based approaches are effective in identifying programming misconceptions.

Conclusion: McMining and the accompanying dataset help in diagnosing and addressing student misconceptions, potentially improving programming education.

Abstract: When learning to code, students often develop misconceptions about various
programming language concepts. These can not only lead to bugs or inefficient
code, but also slow down the learning of related concepts. In this paper, we
introduce McMining, the task of mining programming misconceptions from samples
of code from a student. To enable the training and evaluation of McMining
systems, we develop an extensible benchmark dataset of misconceptions together
with a large set of code samples where these misconceptions are manifested. We
then introduce two LLM-based McMiner approaches and through extensive
evaluations show that models from the Gemini, Claude, and GPT families are
effective at discovering misconceptions in student code.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Video games have unique debugging challenges that require techniques beyond traditional software debugging methods.

Method: The study involves recording debugging sessions of 20 experienced game developers tackling major bug types, analyzing their tools, methods, and collaborative roles.

Result: Developers spend 36.6% of time inspecting artifacts and 35.1% reproducing bugs. The thematic analysis highlights bottlenecks and tool usage.

Conclusion: The paper emphasizes the need for specialized debugging processes in video games and how collaboration and technical roles are essential for efficient debugging.

Abstract: Conventional debugging techniques used in traditional software are similarly
used when debugging video games. However, the reality of video games require
its own set of unique debugging techniques such as On-Screen Console, Debug
Draws, Debug Camera, Cheats and In-Game Menus, and Data Scrubbing. In this
article, we provide insights from a video game studio on how 20 seasoned
industry game developers debug during the production of a game. Our experiments
rely on the recordings of debugging sessions for the most critical bugs
categorized as Crashes, Object Behaviors, and Object Persistence. In this
paper, we focus on identifying the debugging activities that bottleneck bug
resolution. We also identify the debugging tools used to perform debugging
techniques. Lastly, we present how different disciplines collaborate during
debugging and how technical roles are at the core of debugging. Our thematic
analysis has identified game developers spend 36.6\% of their time inspecting
game artifacts and 35.1\% of their time reproducing the bug locally.

*Vasudha Yanuganti,Ishaan Puri,Swapnil Chhatre,Mantinder Singh,Ashok Jallepalli,Hritvik Shrivastava,Pradeep Kumar Sharma*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper proposes a novel method for file path retrieval in codebases by fine-tuning a language model and generating training data with code-aware strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Developers and AI coding assistants face challenges in locating relevant files in complex codebases, as traditional code search lacks semantic context and LLMs lack repository-specific knowledge.

Method: The authors fine-tune the Qwen3-8B LLM using QLoRA and Unsloth optimizations. Training data is generated using six code-aware strategies that utilize abstract syntax tree structures and repository contents.

Result: The fine-tuned model achieves up to 91% exact match accuracy and 93% recall on held-out queries. On larger codebases like PyTorch, it demonstrates scalability with a recall of 59%.

Conclusion: The approach effectively enhances code retrieval accuracy by leveraging multi-level code signals and provides insights on limitations like context length, with potential for future integrations with LLM-based code intelligence.

Abstract: Modern codebases make it hard for developers and AI coding assistants to find
the right source files when answering questions like "How does this feature
work?" or "Where was the bug introduced?" Traditional code search (keyword or
IR based) often misses semantic context and cross file links, while large
language models (LLMs) understand natural language but lack repository specific
detail. We present a method for file path retrieval that fine tunes a strong
LLM (Qwen3-8B) with QLoRA and Unsloth optimizations to predict relevant file
paths directly from a natural language query. To build training data, we
introduce six code aware strategies that use abstract syntax tree (AST)
structure and repository content to generate realistic question-answer pairs,
where answers are sets of file paths. The strategies range from single file
prompts to hierarchical repository summaries, providing broad coverage. We fine
tune on Python projects including Flask, Click, Jinja, FastAPI, and PyTorch,
and obtain high retrieval accuracy: up to 91\% exact match and 93\% recall on
held out queries, clearly beating single strategy training. On a large codebase
like PyTorch (about 4,000 Python files), the model reaches 59\% recall, showing
scalability. We analyze how multi level code signals help the LLM reason over
cross file context and discuss dataset design, limits (for example, context
length in very large repos), and future integration of retrieval with LLM based
code intelligence.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper introduces a system to convert large software repositories into a vectorized knowledge graph for architectural understanding and automated development.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding and managing large software repositories is challenging due to their complexity. The paper aims to simplify this by providing an automated system for semantic understanding and retrieval.

Method: They construct a vectorized knowledge graph encoding syntactic and semantic relationships, enhanced with LLM-based summaries and embeddings, and utilize a hybrid retrieval pipeline for semantic and graph-aware operations.

Result: The system enables automation in repository development through its graph-based structure and integrates LLMs to provide effective interaction and explanations.

Conclusion: The approach improves repository management by embedding architectural and semantic knowledge, allowing efficient retrieval processes and understanding for future developments.

Abstract: We present a repository decomposition system that converts large software
repositories into a vectorized knowledge graph which mirrors project
architectural and semantic structure, capturing semantic relationships and
allowing a significant level of automatization of further repository
development. The graph encodes syntactic relations such as containment,
implementation, references, calls, and inheritance, and augments nodes with
LLM-derived summaries and vector embeddings. A hybrid retrieval pipeline
combines semantic retrieval with graph-aware expansion, and an LLM-based
assistant formulates constrained, read-only graph requests and produces
human-oriented explanations.

### [425] [SEER: Sustainability Enhanced Engineering of Software Requirements](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08981)
*Mandira Roy,Novarun Deb,Nabendu Chaki,Agostino Cortesi*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper introduces SEER, an AI-powered framework designed to evaluate and optimize sustainability requirements early in software development phases.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper is driven by the need to address sustainability in software development beyond high-level guidelines, focusing on the requirements engineering phase.

Method: SEER uses large language models with a RAG engine to identify, evaluate, and optimize sustainability requirements through a three-stage process.

Result: SEER successfully demonstrated its capability in identifying diverse sustainability concerns across software projects from various domains.

Conclusion: The implementation of SEER proves effective in tackling sustainability challenges early in software development, promoting the achievement of UN Sustainable Development Goals.

Abstract: The rapid expansion of software development has significant environmental,
technical, social, and economic impacts. Achieving the United Nations
Sustainable Development Goals by 2030 compels developers to adopt sustainable
practices. Existing methods mostly offer high-level guidelines, which are
time-consuming to implement and rely on team adaptability. Moreover, they focus
on design or implementation, while sustainability assessment should start at
the requirements engineering phase. In this paper, we introduce SEER, a
framework which addresses sustainability concerns in the early software
development phase. The framework operates in three stages: (i) it identifies
sustainability requirements (SRs) relevant to a specific software product from
a general taxonomy; (ii) it evaluates how sustainable system requirements are
based on the identified SRs; and (iii) it optimizes system requirements that
fail to satisfy any SR. The framework is implemented using the reasoning
capabilities of large language models and the agentic RAG (Retrieval Augmented
Generation) approach. SEER has been experimented on four software projects from
different domains. Results generated using Gemini 2.5 reasoning model
demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in accurately
identifying a broad range of sustainability concerns across diverse domains.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The study systematically reviews sustainability requirements (SRs) in software systems, presenting a detailed taxonomy across four sustainability dimensions and providing metrics, measures, and a correlation matrix to help reconcile trade-offs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the fragmented, domain-specific nature of existing sustainability requirements research and establish a unified taxonomy for the software engineering community.

Method: A Systematic Literature Review (SLR) to extract and categorize sustainability requirements (SRs) based on four sustainability dimensions (environmental, technical, social, and economic).

Result: The study proposes a detailed taxonomy of SRs with definitions, associated metrics, and measures, along with a correlation matrix to highlight synergies and conflicts across dimensions.

Conclusion: The taxonomy and correlation matrix serve as a reference for software professionals to efficiently create, manage, and balance sustainability trade-offs in software development.

Abstract: Software systems are a significant contributor to global sustainability
concerns, demanding that environmental, social, technical, and economic factors
be systematically addressed from the initial requirements engineering phase.
Although existing research provides various sustainability requirements (SRs),
these contributions are often fragmented, specific to certain dimensions, or
limited to particular application domains, resulting in a critical lack of a
unified, comprehensive taxonomy for the software engineering community. To
address this gap, this research conducts a Systematic Literature Review (SLR)
to extract and organize sustainability requirements from the state-of-the-art.
The primary contribution is a comprehensive taxonomy of SRs across the four
dimensions of sustainability (environmental, technical, social, and economic).
For each identified category, we provide clear definitions, associated metrics,
and measures. Furthermore, we depict a correlation matrix that projects the
positive and negative influences (synergies and conflicts) among categories
across different dimensions. This systematized reference assists both software
developers and researchers in effectively formulating, managing, and
reconciling trade-offs within sustainable software development.

### [427] [Saving SWE-Bench: A Benchmark Mutation Approach for Realistic Agent Evaluation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08996)
*Spandan Garg,Ben Steenhoek,Yufan Huang*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper introduces a new benchmarking framework for software engineering agents, addressing limitations of current benchmarks in mirroring real-world developer interactions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current benchmarks, primarily based on GitHub issues, fail to represent real-world usage of chat-based coding assistants within IDEs, leading to inflated evaluations of agent capabilities.

Method: The authors developed a testing framework that mutates formal benchmarks into realistic user queries by analyzing telemetry data from developer interactions with chat-based agents.

Result: They applied the framework to various benchmarks, revealing that current evaluations overestimate agent capabilities by over 50% for public benchmarks and by 10-16% for an internal benchmark.

Conclusion: This study proposes benchmark mutation as a more accurate evaluation method for chat-based software engineering agents, offering a flexible approach that aligns better with real-world developer requirements.

Abstract: Current benchmarks for evaluating software engineering agents, such as
SWE-Bench Verified, are predominantly derived from GitHub issues and fail to
accurately reflect how developers interact with chat-based coding assistants in
integrated development environments (IDEs). We posit that this mismatch leads
to a systematic overestimation of agent's capabilities in real-world scenarios,
especially bug fixing. We introduce a novel benchmarking framework that
transforms existing formal benchmarks into realistic user queries through
systematic analysis of developer interaction patterns with chat-based agents.
Our methodology is flexible and can be easily extended to existing benchmarks.
In this paper, we apply our testing framework to SWE-Bench Verified, the
TypeScript subset of Multi-SWE-Bench and a private benchmark, SWE-Bench C# and
transform formal GitHub issue descriptions into realistic user-style queries
based on telemetry analysis of a popular chat-based agent interactions. Our
findings reveal that existing benchmarks significantly overestimate agent
capabilities for some models by >50% over baseline performance for public
benchmarks and ~10-16% for our internal benchmark. This work establishes a new
paradigm for evaluating interactive chat-based software engineering agents
through benchmark mutation techniques.

*Manojit Chakraborty,Madhusudan Ghosh,Rishabh Gupta*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper introduces a zero-shot code translation method using identifier replacement to address LLM issues with translating long source codes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs struggle with accurately translating lengthy source codes that exceed their context window.

Method: The authors proposed replacing user-provided long identifiers with generalized placeholders to optimize token count and focus on the code's logical structure.

Result: The empirical evaluation demonstrates that the proposed approach maintains code structure and reduces token usage, improving translation efficiency.

Conclusion: This identifier replacement method enhances cost-effectiveness and efficiency for long code translations while preserving syntactical and hierarchical code quality.

Abstract: In the domain of software development, LLMs have been utilized to automate
tasks such as code translation, where source code from one programming language
is translated to another while preserving its functionality. However, LLMs
often struggle with long source codes that don't fit into the context window,
which produces inaccurate translations. To address this, we propose a novel
zero-shot code translation method that incorporates identifier replacement. By
substituting user-given long identifiers with generalized placeholders during
translation, our method allows the LLM to focus on the logical structure of the
code, by reducing token count and memory usage, which improves the efficiency
and cost-effectiveness of long code translation. Our empirical results
demonstrate that our approach preserves syntactical and hierarchical
information and produces translation results with reduced tokens.

TL;DR: The paper surveys 131 software practitioners to investigate how they utilize Large Language Models (LLMs) in software development, focusing on their applications, benefits, and limitations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs are increasingly integrated into software development, but there is limited understanding of their practical use and professional perception.

Method: The study uses a global survey involving 131 software practitioners to collect data on LLM usage, benefits, and concerns.

Result: Findings show that LLMs enhance productivity, reduce cognitive load, and assist in learning but present challenges like inaccurate outputs, ethical risks, and limited context awareness.

Conclusion: Most developers use LLMs as assistive tools rather than standalone solutions, prompting the need for further research on responsible and effective adoption in software engineering.

Abstract: Large Language Models have quickly become a central component of modern
software development workflows, and software practitioners are increasingly
integrating LLMs into various stages of the software development lifecycle.
Despite the growing presence of LLMs, there is still a limited understanding of
how these tools are actually used in practice and how professionals perceive
their benefits and limitations. This paper presents preliminary findings from a
global survey of 131 software practitioners. Our results reveal how LLMs are
utilized for various coding-specific tasks. Software professionals report
benefits such as increased productivity, reduced cognitive load, and faster
learning, but also raise concerns about LLMs' inaccurate outputs, limited
context awareness, and associated ethical risks. Most developers treat LLMs as
assistive tools rather than standalone solutions, reflecting a cautious yet
practical approach to their integration. Our findings provide an early,
practitioner-focused perspective on LLM adoption, highlighting key
considerations for future research and responsible use in software engineering.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: PynguinML enhances the Pynguin test generator to better comply with input constraints for ML libraries like PyTorch and TensorFlow, leading to more effective testing and higher code coverage.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Testing ML libraries is challenging due to the strict input constraints imposed by APIs and the high complexity of data structures like tensors. Existing test generation tools like Pynguin often fail to create compliant inputs, resulting in early test failures.

Method: PynguinML extracts constraints from official API documentation to inform the test generator on how to create inputs compliant with ML library requirements, improving the Pynguin framework.

Result: In an evaluation across 165 modules from PyTorch and TensorFlow, PynguinML demonstrated up to 63.9% higher code coverage compared to Pynguin.

Conclusion: PynguinML significantly enhances the test generation process for ML libraries, addressing the limitations of existing tools and ensuring more thorough and effective testing.

Abstract: Machine learning (ML) libraries such as PyTorch and TensorFlow are essential
for a wide range of modern applications. Ensuring the correctness of ML
libraries through testing is crucial. However, ML APIs often impose strict
input constraints involving complex data structures such as tensors. Automated
test generation tools such as Pynguin are not aware of these constraints and
often create non-compliant inputs. This leads to early test failures and
limited code coverage. Prior work has investigated extracting constraints from
official API documentation. In this paper, we present PynguinML, an approach
that improves the Pynguin test generator to leverage these constraints to
generate compliant inputs for ML APIs, enabling more thorough testing and
higher code coverage. Our evaluation is based on 165 modules from PyTorch and
TensorFlow, comparing PynguinML against Pynguin. The results show that
PynguinML significantly improves test effectiveness, achieving up to 63.9 %
higher code coverage.

*Amal Elgammal,Bernd J. Kr√§mer,Michael P. Papazoglou,Mira Raheem*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Patient Medical Digital Twin (PMDT), a framework that integrates diverse health data while ensuring privacy, semantic interoperability, and reuse in clinical contexts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current digital twin applications in healthcare are organ-specific, tied to isolated data types, and lack a unified, privacy-preserving foundation for chronic care management.

Method: The PMDT is implemented using an ontology in OWL 2.0 and structured with modular Blueprints. It was refined through expert workshops, questionnaires, and pilot studies with real-world data.

Result: The PMDT successfully unified heterogeneous data, ensured GDPR compliance, and supported advanced analytics. Evaluation confirmed semantic standardization, usability, and reasoning correctness.

Conclusion: The PMDT offers a transformative, validated platform for next-generation chronic care management, enabling proactive, precise, and equitable decision-making in digital health ecosystems.

Abstract: Personalized chronic care requires the integration of multimodal health data
to enable precise, adaptive, and preventive decision-making. Yet most current
digital twin (DT) applications remain organ-specific or tied to isolated data
types, lacking a unified and privacy-preserving foundation. This paper
introduces the Patient Medical Digital Twin (PMDT), an ontology-driven in
silico patient framework that integrates physiological, psychosocial,
behavioral, and genomic information into a coherent, extensible model.
Implemented in OWL 2.0, the PMDT ensures semantic interoperability, supports
automated reasoning, and enables reuse across diverse clinical contexts. Its
ontology is structured around modular Blueprints (patient, disease and
diagnosis, treatment and follow-up, trajectories, safety, pathways, and adverse
events), formalized through dedicated conceptual views. These were iteratively
refined and validated through expert workshops, questionnaires, and a pilot
study in the EU H2020 QUALITOP project with real-world immunotherapy patients.
Evaluation confirmed ontology coverage, reasoning correctness, usability, and
GDPR compliance. Results demonstrate the PMDT's ability to unify heterogeneous
data, operationalize competency questions, and support descriptive, predictive,
and prescriptive analytics in a federated, privacy-preserving manner. By
bridging gaps in data fragmentation and semantic standardization, the PMDT
provides a validated foundation for next-generation digital health ecosystems,
transforming chronic care toward proactive, continuously optimized, and
equitable management.

TL;DR: This paper introduces the Medical Interoperability Language (MILA), a domain-specific language for healthcare AI, integrated with a federated learning system to ensure privacy while boosting predictive accuracy in multi-center studies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to tackle challenges in healthcare AI such as fragmented data, strict privacy rules, and technical complexity in clinical systems development.

Method: The method involves using Model Driven Engineering (MDE) principles with formal metamodels, domain-specific languages like MILA, and automated transformations to transition from high-level specifications to implementable software.

Result: The approach demonstrated strong predictive accuracy in a cancer immunotherapy study, achieving up to 98.5% and 98.3% accuracy, while reducing manual coding effort.

Conclusion: MDE principles, including semantic integration and automated code generation, can create trustworthy and reproducible digital health platforms capable of addressing privacy and interoperability challenges in healthcare AI.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) has the potential to transform healthcare by
supporting more accurate diagnoses and personalized treatments. However, its
adoption in practice remains constrained by fragmented data sources, strict
privacy rules, and the technical complexity of building reliable clinical
systems. To address these challenges, we introduce a model driven engineering
(MDE) framework designed specifically for healthcare AI. The framework relies
on formal metamodels, domain-specific languages (DSLs), and automated
transformations to move from high level specifications to running software. At
its core is the Medical Interoperability Language (MILA), a graphical DSL that
enables clinicians and data scientists to define queries and machine learning
pipelines using shared ontologies. When combined with a federated learning
architecture, MILA allows institutions to collaborate without exchanging raw
patient data, ensuring semantic consistency across sites while preserving
privacy. We evaluate this approach in a multi center cancer immunotherapy
study. The generated pipelines delivered strong predictive performance, with
support vector machines achieving up to 98.5 percent and 98.3 percent accuracy
in key tasks, while substantially reducing manual coding effort. These findings
suggest that MDE principles metamodeling, semantic integration, and automated
code generation can provide a practical path toward interoperable,
reproducible, and trustworthy digital health platforms.

*He Jiang,Yufu Wang,Hao Lin,Peiyu Zou,Zhide Zhou,Ang Jia,Xiaochen Li,Zhilei Ren*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper introduces TIT (Tree-structured Instruction Tuning) to improve LLM-based code translation, addressing issues like syntactic confusion and semantic misalignment by leveraging structured parsing, fine-grained dataset augmentation, and dual-stage tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Mainstream LLM-based code translation methods struggle with syntactic confusion and lack semantic alignment due to over-reliance on function-level datasets and sensitivity to language-specific features.

Method: The proposed TIT model employs structured parsing for syntax, augments datasets using statement-level segmentation and contrastive matching, and utilizes a dual-stage tuning process (syntax-aware fine-tuning and code generation tuning).

Result: The TIT approach significantly outperforms existing methods, achieving a 1.22x-1.75x higher success rate in code translation while reducing syntactic errors.

Conclusion: Tree-structured Instruction Tuning (TIT) effectively addresses the limitations of existing LLM-based code translation methods by enhancing semantic alignment and mitigating syntactic confusion, yielding better translation accuracy.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown strong performance in automated
source-to-target code translation through pretraining on extensive code
corpora. However, mainstream LLM-based code translation methods suffer from two
critical limitations. First, they are highly sensitive to language-specific
features, which often introduce source-language syntax or lexicon into the
output, leading to syntactic confusion. Second, they lack fine-grained semantic
alignment due to an over-reliance on function-level parallel datasets,
resulting in semantic misalignment between the translated code and the original
source. To overcome these limitations, we propose TIT, a Tree-structured
Instruction Tuning paradigm for LLM-based code translation. Specifically, TIT
consists of three modules. First, to mitigate syntactic confusion, the
syntactic information representation module integrates language-agnostic
syntactic features via structured parsing. Then, to generate high-quality
fine-grained parallel data, the fine-grained parallel dataset augmentation
module aligns nodes with code segments through statement-level segmentation and
contrastive matching. Finally, we leverage the dual-stage tree instruction
tuning module to alleviate the contextual processing burden on the LLM caused
by the introduction of syntactic information. The first stage employs
syntax-aware fine-tuning to enable the LLM to autonomously comprehend
structured syntactic information, while the second stage utilizes code
generation fine-tuning to guide the model in generating accurate target code
based on function-level syntactic dependencies. The experimental results
demonstrate that the proposed method significantly outperforms existing
approaches in multiple LLMs, achieving a success rate 1.22x-1.75x higher in
code translation while markedly reducing syntactic confusion.

Main category: q-bio.NC

TL;DR: This paper reviews the use of human intracranial recordings to overcome limitations in identifying neural correlates of perceptual consciousness (NCC), advocating for their high spatial and temporal resolution and proposing future directions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The quest to identify neural correlates of perceptual consciousness remains unresolved due to limitations in non-invasive neural measures, such as low spatiotemporal resolution and poor signal sensitivity.

Method: The authors review studies utilizing human intracranial recordings to examine NCCs, focusing on single neurons and populations of neurons, alongside evaluating various theories of consciousness.

Result: Intracranial recordings demonstrate potential in advancing NCC research by addressing methodological limitations, offering higher precision and broader cortical/subcortical coverage.

Conclusion: Current intracranial recording methods provide significant insights into NCCs but face limitations. Future research should explore emerging technologies and novel experimental paradigms.

Abstract: Despite many years of research, the quest to identify neural correlates of
perceptual consciousness (NCC) remains unresolved. One major obstacle lies in
methodological limitations: most studies rely on non-invasive neural measures
with limited spatial or temporal resolution making it difficult to disentangle
proper NCCs from concurrent cognitive processes. Additionally, the relatively
low sensitivity of non-invasive neural measures limits the interpretation of
null findings in studies targeting proper NCCs. In this review, we discuss how
human intracranial recordings can advance the search for NCCs, by offering high
spatiotemporal resolution, improved signal sensitivity, and broad cortical and
subcortical coverage. We review studies that have examined NCCs at the level of
single neurons and populations of neurons, and evaluate their implications on
the debates between cognitive and sensory theories of consciousness. Finally,
we highlight the limits of current intracranial human recordings and propose
future directions based on emerging technologies and novel experimental
paradigms.

### [435] [Estimating Brain Activity with High Spatial and Temporal Resolution using a Naturalistic MEG-fMRI Encoding Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09415)
*Beige Jerry Jin,Leila Wehbe*

Main category: q-bio.NC

TL;DR: The paper introduces a transformer-based encoding model that integrates MEG and fMRI data for high-resolution cortical source estimation, achieving better performance and generalization compared to existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome limitations of current neuroimaging techniques in achieving both high spatial and temporal resolutions, particularly for single-trial, naturalistic data.

Method: The authors collected MEG data while subjects listened to narratives matching an open fMRI dataset. Using this data, they developed a transformer-based encoding model that combines MEG and fMRI signals, trained it on cross-subject/multiple-modality predictions, and validated its output with external datasets.

Result: The model surpasses single-modality encoding models in predicting MEG, delivers higher spatiotemporal fidelity in source estimation compared to traditional methods, and generalizes well across unseen subjects and modalities, even outperforming ECoG-trained models in predicting ECoG responses.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates the feasibility of millisecond-and-millimeter-scale brain mapping by combining naturalistic experiments, MEG, fMRI, and advanced encoding models, paving the way for significant advancements in neuroimaging and brain mapping technologies.

Abstract: Current non-invasive neuroimaging techniques trade off between spatial
resolution and temporal resolution. While magnetoencephalography (MEG) can
capture rapid neural dynamics and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI)
can spatially localize brain activity, a unified picture that preserves both
high resolutions remains an unsolved challenge with existing source
localization or MEG-fMRI fusion methods, especially for single-trial
naturalistic data. We collected whole-head MEG when subjects listened passively
to more than seven hours of narrative stories, using the same stimuli in an
open fMRI dataset (LeBel et al., 2023). We developed a transformer-based
encoding model that combines the MEG and fMRI from these two naturalistic
speech comprehension experiments to estimate latent cortical source responses
with high spatiotemporal resolution. Our model is trained to predict MEG and
fMRI from multiple subjects simultaneously, with a latent layer that represents
our estimates of reconstructed cortical sources. Our model predicts MEG better
than the common standard of single-modality encoding models, and it also yields
source estimates with higher spatial and temporal fidelity than classic
minimum-norm solutions in simulation experiments. We validated the estimated
latent sources by showing its strong generalizability across unseen subjects
and modalities. Estimated activity in our source space predict
electrocorticography (ECoG) better than an ECoG-trained encoding model in an
entirely new dataset. By integrating the power of large naturalistic
experiments, MEG, fMRI, and encoding models, we propose a practical route
towards millisecond-and-millimeter brain mapping.

TL;DR: This paper introduces the Adaptive Topological Vision Transformer (AT-ViT) to decode hierarchical visual information across brain regions using neural data from the Visual Coding Neuropixel dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Exploring the encoding and decoding mechanisms of dynamic neural responses to uncover how the brain processes visual information, particularly in hierarchical structures.

Method: The study uses the Visual Coding Neuropixel dataset and proposes AT-ViT, which performs adaptive topological decoding primarily in fine-grained decoding tests across single and multiple brain regions.

Result: AT-ViT demonstrates its significance in decoding hierarchical networks, validates the hypothesis about quantifiable hierarchical information in brain regions, and uncovers unexpected decoding patterns in the hippocampus.

Conclusion: The results emphasize the utility of hierarchical neural decoding methods for understanding visual processing, revealing scientific insights even in cases of atypical decoding performance.

Abstract: Understanding the encoding and decoding mechanisms of dynamic neural
responses to different visual stimuli is an important topic in exploring how
the brain represents visual information. Currently, hierarchically deep neural
networks (DNNs) have played a significant role as tools for mining the core
features of complex data. However, most methods often overlook the dynamic
generation process of neural data, such as hierarchical brain's visual data,
within the brain's structure. In the decoding of brain's visual data, two main
paradigms are 'fine-grained decoding tests' and 'rough-grained decoding tests',
which we define as focusing on a single brain region and studying the overall
structure across multiple brain regions, respectively. In this paper, we mainly
use the Visual Coding Neuropixel dataset from the Allen Brain Institute, and
the hierarchical information extracted from some single brain regions (i.e.,
fine-grained decoding tests) is provided to the proposed method for studying
the adaptive topological decoding between brain regions, called the Adaptive
Topological Vision Transformer, or AT-ViT. In numerous experiments, the results
reveal the importance of the proposed method in hierarchical networks in the
visual tasks, and also validate the hypothesis that "the hierarchical
information content in brain regions of the visual system can be quantified by
decoding outcomes to reflect an information hierarchy." Among them, we found
that neural data collected in the hippocampus can have a random decoding
performance, and this negative impact on performance still holds significant
scientific value.

### [437] [Gradient-Guided Furthest Point Sampling for Robust Training Set Selection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08906)
*Morris Trestman,Stefan Gugler,Felix A. Faber,O. A. von Lilienfeld*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper introduces Gradient Guided Furthest Point Sampling (GGFPS), an enhanced data sampling method for efficient and robust machine learning predictions in chemistry.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address inefficiencies and inaccuracies in the Furthest Point Sampling (FPS) technique, particularly its systematic under-sampling of molecular geometries at equilibrium, which impacts robustness and prediction accuracy in computational chemistry applications.

Method: The authors propose GGFPS, which extends FPS by incorporating molecular force norms, tested on the Styblinski-Tang function and MD17 molecular dynamics data, while comparing its performance against FPS and uniform sampling.

Result: GGFPS outperformed FPS and uniform sampling, showing better data efficiency, reduced training costs without accuracy loss, and lower prediction errors and variances on molecular datasets.

Conclusion: Gradient-aware sampling techniques like GGFPS are effective for improving training set selection, enhancing prediction consistency, and correcting imbalances caused by naive FPS application.

Abstract: Smart training set selections procedures enable the reduction of data needs
and improves predictive robustness in machine learning problems relevant to
chemistry. We introduce Gradient Guided Furthest Point Sampling (GGFPS), a
simple extension of Furthest Point Sampling (FPS) that leverages molecular
force norms to guide efficient sampling of configurational spaces of molecules.
Numerical evidence is presented for a toy-system (Styblinski-Tang function) as
well as for molecular dynamics trajectories from the MD17 dataset. Compared to
FPS and uniform sampling, our numerical results indicate superior data
efficiency and robustness when using GGFPS. Distribution analysis of the MD17
data suggests that FPS systematically under-samples equilibrium geometries,
resulting in large test errors for relaxed structures. GGFPS cures this
artifact and (i) enables up to two fold reductions in training cost without
sacrificing predictive accuracy compared to FPS in the 2-dimensional
Styblinksi-Tang system, (ii) systematically lowers prediction errors for
equilibrium as well as strained structures in MD17, and (iii) systematically
decreases prediction error variances across all of the MD17 configuration
spaces. These results suggest that gradient-aware sampling methods hold great
promise as effective training set selection tools, and that naive use of FPS
may result in imbalanced training and inconsistent prediction outcomes.

### [438] [A Representer Theorem for Hawkes Processes via Penalized Least Squares Minimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08916)
*Hideaki Kim,Tomoharu Iwata*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: This paper proposes a novel, efficient approach to estimate latent triggering kernels for multivariate Hawkes processes using a representer theorem within an RKHS framework.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve the computational efficiency and practicality of kernel-based methods for estimating latent triggering kernels in linear multivariate Hawkes processes.

Method: A novel form of representer theorem is proposed, utilizing transformed kernels defined via simultaneous integral equations. The estimator is expressed as a linear combination of these transformed kernels, with analytically fixed dual coefficients.

Result: The proposed method achieves competitive predictive accuracy and substantial computational efficiency improvements over conventional kernel methods in empirical evaluations using synthetic datasets.

Conclusion: The novel RKHS-based method enables efficient and scalable estimation of triggering kernels for Hawkes processes, offering an advancement in kernel methods for large-scale data handling.

Abstract: The representer theorem is a cornerstone of kernel methods, which aim to
estimate latent functions in reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces (RKHSs) in a
nonparametric manner. Its significance lies in converting inherently
infinite-dimensional optimization problems into finite-dimensional ones over
dual coefficients, thereby enabling practical and computationally tractable
algorithms. In this paper, we address the problem of estimating the latent
triggering kernels--functions that encode the interaction structure between
events--for linear multivariate Hawkes processes based on observed event
sequences within an RKHS framework. We show that, under the principle of
penalized least squares minimization, a novel form of representer theorem
emerges: a family of transformed kernels can be defined via a system of
simultaneous integral equations, and the optimal estimator of each triggering
kernel is expressed as a linear combination of these transformed kernels
evaluated at the data points. Remarkably, the dual coefficients are all
analytically fixed to unity, obviating the need to solve a costly optimization
problem to obtain the dual coefficients. This leads to a highly efficient
estimator capable of handling large-scale data more effectively than
conventional nonparametric approaches. Empirical evaluations on synthetic
datasets reveal that the proposed method attains competitive predictive
accuracy while substantially improving computational efficiency over existing
state-of-the-art kernel method-based estimators.

### [439] [Mirror Flow Matching with Heavy-Tailed Priors for Generative Modeling on Convex Domains](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08929)
*Yunrui Guan,Krishnakumar Balasubramanian,Shiqian Ma*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper introduces 'Mirror Flow Matching' which uses a regularized mirror map and Student-$t$ prior to solve challenges in generative modeling over convex domains, providing theoretical and empirical benefits.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Generative modeling on convex domains faces issues like heavy-tailed dual distributions and poor coupling with Gaussian priors in flow-matching frameworks.

Method: The proposed 'Mirror Flow Matching' incorporates a regularized mirror map to control tail behavior and aligns with heavy-tailed targets using a Student-$t$ prior, with guarantees on velocity field regularity and convergence rates.

Result: The method demonstrates better performance in synthetic and real-world constrained generative tasks, with theoretical assurances of convergence and regularity.

Conclusion: Using regularized mirror maps and Student-$t$ priors, the approach improves both theoretical robustness and empirical competitiveness in constrained convex-domain modeling.

Abstract: We study generative modeling on convex domains using flow matching and mirror
maps, and identify two fundamental challenges. First, standard log-barrier
mirror maps induce heavy-tailed dual distributions, leading to ill-posed
dynamics. Second, coupling with Gaussian priors performs poorly when matching
heavy-tailed targets. To address these issues, we propose Mirror Flow Matching
based on a \emph{regularized mirror map} that controls dual tail behavior and
guarantees finite moments, together with coupling to a Student-$t$ prior that
aligns with heavy-tailed targets and stabilizes training. We provide
theoretical guarantees, including spatial Lipschitzness and temporal regularity
of the velocity field, Wasserstein convergence rates for flow matching with
Student-$t$ priors and primal-space guarantees for constrained generation,
under $\varepsilon$-accurate learned velocity fields. Empirically, our method
outperforms baselines in synthetic convex-domain simulations and achieves
competitive sample quality on real-world constrained generative tasks.

*Mihriban Ceylan,David J. Pr√∂mel*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper establishes the universal approximation property for several neural network architectures in Orlicz spaces, extending prior results beyond $L^p$ spaces.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To extend the universal approximation theorem to encompass Orlicz spaces, filling gaps in the theory for various neural network classes.

Method: The paper demonstrates the density of certain neural networks in Orlicz spaces by theoretical analysis.

Result: It proves that widely-used neural network architectures, such as feedforward, deep narrow networks, and functional input networks, possess the universal approximation property in these extended spaces.

Conclusion: This work broadens the scope of neural network universal approximation theorems to include non-traditional settings, emphasizing their theoretical capabilities.

Abstract: The universal approximation property uniformly with respect to weakly compact
families of measures is established for several classes of neural networks. To
that end, we prove that these neural networks are dense in Orlicz spaces,
thereby extending classical universal approximation theorems even beyond the
traditional $L^p$-setting. The covered classes of neural networks include
widely used architectures like feedforward neural networks with non-polynomial
activation functions, deep narrow networks with ReLU activation functions and
functional input neural networks.

### [441] [A unified Bayesian framework for adversarial robustness](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09288)
*Pablo G. Arce,Roi Naveiro,David R√≠os Insua*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: This paper introduces a Bayesian framework to address adversarial attacks on machine learning models by considering uncertainties, proposing strategies for both training and operational phases, and demonstrating empirical effectiveness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional approaches to defend against adversarial attacks are deterministic and fail to account for uncertainties in the adversary's strategies, which limits their robustness.

Method: The paper presents a formal Bayesian framework to model adversarial uncertainty through probabilistic assumptions, introducing proactive defense (during training) and reactive defense (during operations).

Result: The framework provides two strategies to enhance model robustness, recovering previous defense methods as special cases, and demonstrates improved results through empirical validation.

Conclusion: Explicitly modeling adversarial uncertainty using a Bayesian framework enhances the robustness of machine learning models better than traditional deterministic or less rigorous stochastic defenses.

Abstract: The vulnerability of machine learning models to adversarial attacks remains a
critical security challenge. Traditional defenses, such as adversarial
training, typically robustify models by minimizing a worst-case loss. However,
these deterministic approaches do not account for uncertainty in the
adversary's attack. While stochastic defenses placing a probability
distribution on the adversary exist, they often lack statistical rigor and fail
to make explicit their underlying assumptions. To resolve these issues, we
introduce a formal Bayesian framework that models adversarial uncertainty
through a stochastic channel, articulating all probabilistic assumptions. This
yields two robustification strategies: a proactive defense enacted during
training, aligned with adversarial training, and a reactive defense enacted
during operations, aligned with adversarial purification. Several previous
defenses can be recovered as limiting cases of our model. We empirically
validate our methodology, showcasing the benefits of explicitly modeling
adversarial uncertainty.

### [442] [Efficient Autoregressive Inference for Transformer Probabilistic Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09477)
*Conor Hassan,Nasrulloh Loka,Cen-You Li,Daolang Huang,Paul E. Chang,Yang Yang,Francesco Silvestrin,Samuel Kaski,Luigi Acerbi*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper presents a method to efficiently generate coherent joint distributions in transformer-based probabilistic models by introducing a causal autoregressive buffer that combines set-conditioning and autoregressive paradigms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Many real-world applications require capturing dependencies in joint distributions that are challenging for traditional transformer-based models or autoregressive architectures alone.

Method: The proposed method introduces a causal autoregressive buffer that separates context encoding from conditioning set updates, allowing for efficient joint sampling and one-pass log-likelihood evaluation.

Result: The method achieves predictive accuracy comparable to strong baselines across various data types while being up to 20 times faster in joint sampling.

Conclusion: By combining autoregressive efficiency with the flexibility of set-based conditioning, this approach makes joint prediction feasible and efficient for transformer-based probabilistic models.

Abstract: Transformer-based models for amortized probabilistic inference, such as
neural processes, prior-fitted networks, and tabular foundation models, excel
at single-pass marginal prediction. However, many real-world applications, from
signal interpolation to multi-column tabular predictions, require coherent
joint distributions that capture dependencies between predictions. While purely
autoregressive architectures efficiently generate such distributions, they
sacrifice the flexible set-conditioning that makes these models powerful for
meta-learning. Conversely, the standard approach to obtain joint distributions
from set-based models requires expensive re-encoding of the entire augmented
conditioning set at each autoregressive step. We introduce a causal
autoregressive buffer that preserves the advantages of both paradigms. Our
approach decouples context encoding from updating the conditioning set. The
model processes the context once and caches it. A dynamic buffer then captures
target dependencies: as targets are incorporated, they enter the buffer and
attend to both the cached context and previously buffered targets. This enables
efficient batched autoregressive generation and one-pass joint log-likelihood
evaluation. A unified training strategy allows seamless integration of
set-based and autoregressive modes at minimal additional cost. Across synthetic
functions, EEG signals, cognitive models, and tabular data, our method matches
predictive accuracy of strong baselines while delivering up to 20 times faster
joint sampling. Our approach combines the efficiency of autoregressive
generative models with the representational power of set-based conditioning,
making joint prediction practical for transformer-based probabilistic models.

### [443] [Interpretable Generative and Discriminative Learning for Multimodal and Incomplete Clinical Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09513)
*Albert Belenguer-Llorens,Carlos Sevilla-Salcedo,Janaina Mourao-Miranda,Vanessa G√≥mez-Verdejo*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper introduces a Bayesian method to deal with multimodal clinical data challenges like incomplete views and limited sample sizes, combining generative and discriminative strategies for robust inference and task-specific insights.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Clinical datasets often have multimodal data with missing views and small cohorts. This makes it difficult for machine learning algorithms to perform efficiently and accurately.

Method: The method integrates a Bayesian framework that combines a generative aspect for capturing cross-view relationships and a discriminative aspect for selecting relevant information for specific tasks. It also works semi-supervised for better generalization and imputation of missing data.

Result: This approach enables robust inference across multiple data sources and automatically imputes missing views. It is especially effective in handling complex relationships in multimodal clinical datasets (biological, psychological, and sociodemographic data).

Conclusion: The Bayesian method provides an interpretable, efficient, and robust solution for multimodal clinical data analysis, offering both general insights and task-specific results.

Abstract: Real-world clinical problems are often characterized by multimodal data,
usually associated with incomplete views and limited sample sizes in their
cohorts, posing significant limitations for machine learning algorithms. In
this work, we propose a Bayesian approach designed to efficiently handle these
challenges while providing interpretable solutions. Our approach integrates (1)
a generative formulation to capture cross-view relationships with a
semi-supervised strategy, and (2) a discriminative task-oriented formulation to
identify relevant information for specific downstream objectives. This dual
generative-discriminative formulation offers both general understanding and
task-specific insights; thus, it provides an automatic imputation of the
missing views while enabling robust inference across different data sources.
The potential of this approach becomes evident when applied to the multimodal
clinical data, where our algorithm is able to capture and disentangle the
complex interactions among biological, psychological, and sociodemographic
modalities.

### [444] [Conditional Flow Matching for Bayesian Posterior Inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09534)
*So Won Jeong,Percy S. Zhai,Veronika Roƒçov√°*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: This paper introduces a new method called flow matching for efficiently sampling multivariate posterior distributions by learning a velocity field to construct transport maps in data and parameter space.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to develop a simpler, computationally efficient method for posterior sampling that avoids likelihood evaluation and captures complex posterior structures, addressing a gap in existing GAN-based and diffusion-based approaches.

Method: The approach involves learning a dynamic block-triangular velocity field which constructs a deterministic transport map from a source distribution to the posterior. The method uses a constrained velocity design and employs Monge-Kantorovich depth for fast map inversion and credible set generation.

Result: The method provides computational advantages over existing alternatives, produces accurate capture of complex posteriors, and offers a frequentist guarantee of consistency for both posterior recovery and Bayesian credible sets.

Conclusion: The proposed flow matching method is a computationally efficient and theoretically consistent tool for posterior inference, facilitating credible set generation and addressing gaps in traditional methods.

Abstract: We propose a generative multivariate posterior sampler via flow matching. It
offers a simple training objective, and does not require access to likelihood
evaluation. The method learns a dynamic, block-triangular velocity field in the
joint space of data and parameters, which results in a deterministic transport
map from a source distribution to the desired posterior. The inverse map, named
vector rank, is accessible by reversibly integrating the velocity over time. It
is advantageous to leverage the dynamic design: proper constraints on the
velocity yield a monotone map, which leads to a conditional Brenier map,
enabling a fast and simultaneous generation of Bayesian credible sets whose
contours correspond to level sets of Monge-Kantorovich data depth. Our approach
is computationally lighter compared to GAN-based and diffusion-based
counterparts, and is capable of capturing complex posterior structures.
Finally, frequentist theoretical guarantee on the consistency of the recovered
posterior distribution, and of the corresponding Bayesian credible sets, is
provided.

*Alison Gon√ßalves Schemitt,Henrique Fan da Silva,Roben Castagna Lunardi,Diego Kreutz,Rodrigo Brand√£o Mansilha,Avelino Francisco Zorzo*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: Quantum computing poses risks to traditional encryption algorithms, spurring development in post-quantum cryptography (PQC). This paper benchmarks PQC's applicability to blockchain systems, addressing performance impacts and highlighting minor overheads for PQC adoption compared to current standards like ECDSA.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper is motivated by the vulnerability of current blockchain cryptographic standards, like ECDSA, to quantum attacks and the need for secure, efficient post-quantum alternatives.

Method: The authors benchmark the performance of various PQC and traditional cryptographic algorithms in blockchain scenarios, evaluating metrics such as signature generation and verification times across different computational setups and simulating large-scale impacts.

Result: The study finds that PQC schemes introduce minor overheads at lower security levels and can surpass ECDSA's performance at higher security levels. For example, ML-DSA at security level 5 achieves significantly faster verification times against ECDSA.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that PQC algorithms are viable for blockchain systems, offering performance comparable to or better than ECDSA in certain contexts. The authors release an open-source implementation to foster reproducibility and further investigations.

Abstract: The advent of quantum computing threatens the security of traditional
encryption algorithms, motivating the development of post-quantum cryptography
(PQC). In 2024, the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)
standardized several PQC algorithms, marking an important milestone in the
transition toward quantum-resistant security. Blockchain systems fundamentally
rely on cryptographic primitives to guarantee data integrity and transaction
authenticity. However, widely used algorithms such as ECDSA, employed in
Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other networks, are vulnerable to quantum attacks.
Although adopting PQC is essential for long-term security, its computational
overhead in blockchain environments remains largely unexplored. In this work,
we propose a methodology for benchmarking both PQC and traditional
cryptographic algorithms in blockchain contexts. We measure signature
generation and verification times across diverse computational environments and
simulate their impact at scale. Our evaluation focuses on PQC digital signature
schemes (ML-DSA, Dilithium, Falcon, Mayo, SLH-DSA, SPHINCS+, and Cross) across
security levels 1 to 5, comparing them to ECDSA, the current standard in
Bitcoin and Ethereum. Our results indicate that PQC algorithms introduce only
minor performance overhead at security level 1, while in some scenarios they
significantly outperform ECDSA at higher security levels. For instance, ML-DSA
achieves a verification time of 0.14 ms on an ARM-based laptop at level 5,
compared to 0.88 ms for ECDSA. We also provide an open-source implementation to
ensure reproducibility and encourage further research.

*Zhuolun Li,Haluk Sonmezler,Faiza Shirazi,Febin Shaji,Tymoteusz Mroczkowski,Dexter Lardner,Matthew Alain Camus,Evangelos Pournaras*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper introduces a blockchain-based voting system prioritizing ballot security through decentralized secret-sharing among voters, integrating threshold cryptography and user-friendly interfaces.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Ballot secrecy is crucial for trustworthy electronic voting, yet decentralization in large-scale elections poses challenges to confidentiality and secure implementation.

Method: The system incorporates threshold cryptography and smart contracts on a blockchain architecture, allowing voters to collectively maintain ballot secrecy while offering transparency and accessibility.

Result: User testing revealed high willingness of voters to act as secret holders, dependable share release participation, and improved security confidence in the proposed voting system.

Conclusion: The study shows that collectively secure voting via blockchain is not only feasible but also effective in ensuring voter confidentiality with strong participation and practical applicability.

Abstract: Ensuring ballot secrecy is critical for fair and trustworthy electronic
voting systems, yet achieving strong secrecy guarantees in decentralized,
large-scale elections remains challenging. This paper proposes the concept of
collectively secure voting, in which voters themselves can opt in as secret
holders to protect ballot secrecy. A practical blockchain-based collectively
secure voting system is designed and implemented. Our design strikes a balance
between strong confidentiality guarantees and real-world applicability. The
proposed system combines threshold cryptography and smart contracts to ensure
ballots remain confidential during voting, while all protocol steps remain
transparent and verifiable. Voters can use the system without prior blockchain
knowledge through an intuitive user interface that hides underlying complexity.
To evaluate this approach, a user testing is conducted. Results show a high
willingness to act as secret holders, reliable participation in share release,
and high security confidence in the proposed system. The findings demonstrate
that voters can collectively maintain secrecy and that such a practical
deployment is feasible.

*Nico Bistolfi,Andreea Georgescu,Dave Hodson*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper highlights vulnerabilities in cloud environments from outdated standing permissions and introduces on-demand data enclaves to implement Zero Standing Privilege (ZSP) and Just-in-Time (JIT) principles at the data level.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the critical security risks posed by standing permissions in dynamic and distributed cloud workflows, especially in the context of AI-driven processes handling sensitive data.

Method: They leverage an innovative architecture using on-demand data enclaves that replace static permissions with temporary data contracts, enabling tailored access and real-time monitoring.

Result: The proposed method reduces the attack surface, avoids privilege creep, simplifies auditing, and enhances cloud data security through precise, on-demand data access.

Conclusion: Implementing on-demand data enclaves for ZSP and JIT at the data level is essential to transitioning enterprises to a secure cloud infrastructure equipped for AI-driven processes.

Abstract: As cloud infrastructure evolves to support dynamic and distributed workflows,
accelerated now by AI-driven processes, the outdated model of standing
permissions has become a critical vulnerability. Based on the Cloud Security
Alliance (CSA) Top Threats to Cloud Computing Deep Dive 2025 Report, our
analysis details how standing permissions cause catastrophic cloud breaches.
While current security tools are addressing network and API security, the
challenge of securing granular data access remains. Removing standing
permissions at the data level is as critical as it is at the network level,
especially for companies handling valuable data at scale.
  In this white paper, we introduce an innovative architecture based on
on-demand data enclaves to address this gap directly. Our approach enables Zero
Standing Privilege (ZSP) and Just-in-Time (JIT) principles at the data level.
We replace static permissions with temporary data contracts that enforce
proactive protection. This means separation is built around the data requested
on-demand, providing precise access and real time monitoring for individual
records instead of datasets. This solution drastically reduces the attack
surface, prevents privilege creep, and simplifies auditing, offering a vital
path for enterprises to transition to a more secure and resilient data
environment.

### [448] [CommandSans: Securing AI Agents with Surgical Precision Prompt Sanitization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08829)
*Debeshee Das,Luca Beurer-Kellner,Marc Fischer,Maximilian Baader*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper tackles indirect prompt injection attacks on LLM agents by introducing a token-level sanitization method, which removes potentially harmful AI-directed instructions from tool outputs rather than relying on sample-level classification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Indirect prompt injections on LLM agents with access to tools and sensitive data pose risks due to high false positive rates of current defenses, which hinders real-world applications.

Method: The authors propose a token-level sanitization method that removes executable instructions at the token level, is non-blocking, calibration-free, context-agnostic, and uses instruction-tuning data for training instead of synthetic injection examples.

Result: The proposed method significantly reduces attack success rates (e.g., from 34% to 3% on AgentDojo) while maintaining agent utility across both benign and malicious settings.

Conclusion: Token-level sanitization provides a practical, effective, and generalizable defense against indirect prompt injection attacks, addressing the limitations of existing classifiers.

Abstract: The increasing adoption of LLM agents with access to numerous tools and
sensitive data significantly widens the attack surface for indirect prompt
injections. Due to the context-dependent nature of attacks, however, current
defenses are often ill-calibrated as they cannot reliably differentiate
malicious and benign instructions, leading to high false positive rates that
prevent their real-world adoption. To address this, we present a novel approach
inspired by the fundamental principle of computer security: data should not
contain executable instructions. Instead of sample-level classification, we
propose a token-level sanitization process, which surgically removes any
instructions directed at AI systems from tool outputs, capturing malicious
instructions as a byproduct. In contrast to existing safety classifiers, this
approach is non-blocking, does not require calibration, and is agnostic to the
context of tool outputs. Further, we can train such token-level predictors with
readily available instruction-tuning data only, and don't have to rely on
unrealistic prompt injection examples from challenges or of other synthetic
origin. In our experiments, we find that this approach generalizes well across
a wide range of attacks and benchmarks like AgentDojo, BIPIA, InjecAgent, ASB
and SEP, achieving a 7-10x reduction of attack success rate (ASR) (34% to 3% on
AgentDojo), without impairing agent utility in both benign and malicious
settings.

### [449] [Goal-oriented Backdoor Attack against Vision-Language-Action Models via Physical Objects](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09269)
*Zirun Zhou,Zhengyang Xiao,Haochuan Xu,Jing Sun,Di Wang,Jingfeng Zhang*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper introduces a goal-oriented backdoor attack (GoBA) on vision-language-action (VLA) models, which uses physical objects as triggers to make models perform predefined actions without affecting clean input performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to highlight security vulnerabilities in VLA models due to their dependence on uncurated training datasets, specifically demonstrating the risks of backdoor attacks that enforce predefined actions.

Method: A novel attack method, called GoBA, was developed where physical triggers (e.g., objects) were used to manipulate VLA models so they behave normally without the trigger but execute backdoor actions in its presence. This was tested using a benchmark called BadLIBERO.

Result: Experiments revealed that the GoBA attack successfully achieved the backdoor goal in 97% of trigger-present inputs without impacting the performance of clean inputs. Factors like action trajectory and trigger color influenced the attack's success.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates that physical-object-based backdoor attacks are practical and highly effective against VLA models, revealing pressing security concerns. It emphasizes the need for robust defenses in VLA systems.

Abstract: Recent advances in vision-language-action (VLA) models have greatly improved
embodied AI, enabling robots to follow natural language instructions and
perform diverse tasks. However, their reliance on uncurated training datasets
raises serious security concerns. Existing backdoor attacks on VLAs mostly
assume white-box access and result in task failures instead of enforcing
specific actions. In this work, we reveal a more practical threat: attackers
can manipulate VLAs by simply injecting physical objects as triggers into the
training dataset. We propose goal-oriented backdoor attacks (GoBA), where the
VLA behaves normally in the absence of physical triggers but executes
predefined and goal-oriented actions in the presence of physical triggers.
Specifically, based on a popular VLA benchmark LIBERO, we introduce BadLIBERO
that incorporates diverse physical triggers and goal-oriented backdoor actions.
In addition, we propose a three-level evaluation that categorizes the victim
VLA's actions under GoBA into three states: nothing to do, try to do, and
success to do. Experiments show that GoBA enables the victim VLA to
successfully achieve the backdoor goal in 97 percentage of inputs when the
physical trigger is present, while causing zero performance degradation on
clean inputs. Finally, by investigating factors related to GoBA, we find that
the action trajectory and trigger color significantly influence attack
performance, while trigger size has surprisingly little effect. The code and
BadLIBERO dataset are accessible via the project page at
https://goba-attack.github.io/.

*Dennis Rall,Bernhard Bauer,Mohit Mittal,Thomas Fraunholz*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper evaluates vulnerabilities in Large Language Models (LLMs) to indirect prompt injection attacks and proposes enhanced security measures to address them.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper investigates the increasing susceptibility of LLMs to exploitation through manipulated inputs, amid their expanded use and integration with external data sources.

Method: A systematic evaluation of indirect prompt injection attacks was performed across multiple LLMs, considering factors like model size, manufacturer, and implementation.

Result: Even established attack patterns remain effective, highlighting persistent weaknesses in the defense mechanisms of current LLMs.

Conclusion: The study calls for improved training methods, a centralized attack database, and unified security testing frameworks to enhance LLM defenses and ensure robust, secure use.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are now routinely used to autonomously execute
complex tasks, from natural language processing to dynamic workflows like web
searches. The usage of tool-calling and Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)
allows LLMs to process and retrieve sensitive corporate data, amplifying both
their functionality and vulnerability to abuse. As LLMs increasingly interact
with external data sources, indirect prompt injection emerges as a critical and
evolving attack vector, enabling adversaries to exploit models through
manipulated inputs. Through a systematic evaluation of indirect prompt
injection attacks across diverse models, we analyze how susceptible current
LLMs are to such attacks, which parameters, including model size and
manufacturer, specific implementations, shape their vulnerability, and which
attack methods remain most effective. Our results reveal that even well-known
attack patterns continue to succeed, exposing persistent weaknesses in model
defenses. To address these vulnerabilities, we emphasize the need for
strengthened training procedures to enhance inherent resilience, a centralized
database of known attack vectors to enable proactive defense, and a unified
testing framework to ensure continuous security validation. These steps are
essential to push developers toward integrating security into the core design
of LLMs, as our findings show that current models still fail to mitigate
long-standing threats.

on deployment, constraints, and threat modeling generalize to other modalities,
including audio. This paper provides a comprehensive documentation for the

### [452] [Provable Watermarking for Data Poisoning Attacks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09210)
*Yifan Zhu,Lijia Yu,Xiao-Shan Gao*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: Data poisoning can cause misunderstandings even when designed for beneficial uses; this paper proposes watermarking schemes to help identify and prevent misuse of poisoned datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To manage the negative perception and potential misuse of data poisoning attacks by helping users identify poisoned datasets and ensuring dataset ownership.

Method: The paper introduces two watermarking methods: post-poisoning watermarking and poisoning-concurrent watermarking, along with their theoretical proof of detectability and utility.

Result: Theoretical analysis shows watermarking schemes achieve detectability and maintain poisoning utility, validated in experiments with various attacks, models, and datasets.

Conclusion: Watermarking is a feasible solution for marking data poisoned datasets, providing detectability and maintaining dataset utility under attacks.

Abstract: In recent years, data poisoning attacks have been increasingly designed to
appear harmless and even beneficial, often with the intention of verifying
dataset ownership or safeguarding private data from unauthorized use. However,
these developments have the potential to cause misunderstandings and conflicts,
as data poisoning has traditionally been regarded as a security threat to
machine learning systems. To address this issue, it is imperative for harmless
poisoning generators to claim ownership of their generated datasets, enabling
users to identify potential poisoning to prevent misuse. In this paper, we
propose the deployment of watermarking schemes as a solution to this challenge.
We introduce two provable and practical watermarking approaches for data
poisoning: {\em post-poisoning watermarking} and {\em poisoning-concurrent
watermarking}. Our analyses demonstrate that when the watermarking length is
$\Theta(\sqrt{d}/\epsilon_w)$ for post-poisoning watermarking, and falls within
the range of $\Theta(1/\epsilon_w^2)$ to $O(\sqrt{d}/\epsilon_p)$ for
poisoning-concurrent watermarking, the watermarked poisoning dataset provably
ensures both watermarking detectability and poisoning utility, certifying the
practicality of watermarking under data poisoning attacks. We validate our
theoretical findings through experiments on several attacks, models, and
datasets.

### [453] [GREAT: Generalizable Backdoor Attacks in RLHF via Emotion-Aware Trigger Synthesis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09260)
*Subrat Kishore Dutta,Yuelin Xu,Piyush Pant,Xiao Zhang*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This paper introduces GREAT, a framework for injecting effective backdoors into RLHF setups using emotion-aware triggers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of existing static, rare-token-based backdoor methods in RLHF, aiming for more versatile and generalizable attack strategies.

Method: The GREAT framework utilizes angry, emotion-aware triggers, combined with a dataset called Erinyes and analytical techniques like PCA and clustering in latent spaces for effective trigger identification.

Result: GREAT achieves higher attack success rates than baseline methods in benchmark datasets, especially for unseen triggers, while maintaining response quality for benign inputs.

Conclusion: Emotion-aware triggers in RLHF poisoning are highly effective and outperform traditional methods, showcasing the dangers and vulnerabilities in RLHF systems.

Abstract: Recent work has shown that RLHF is highly susceptible to backdoor attacks,
poisoning schemes that inject malicious triggers in preference data. However,
existing methods often rely on static, rare-token-based triggers, limiting
their effectiveness in realistic scenarios. In this paper, we develop GREAT, a
novel framework for crafting generalizable backdoors in RLHF through
emotion-aware trigger synthesis. Specifically, GREAT targets harmful response
generation for a vulnerable user subgroup characterized by both semantically
violent requests and emotionally angry triggers. At the core of GREAT is a
trigger identification pipeline that operates in the latent embedding space,
leveraging principal component analysis and clustering techniques to identify
the most representative triggers. To enable this, we present Erinyes, a
high-quality dataset of over $5000$ angry triggers curated from GPT-4.1 using a
principled, hierarchical, and diversity-promoting approach. Experiments on
benchmark RLHF datasets demonstrate that GREAT significantly outperforms
baseline methods in attack success rates, especially for unseen trigger
scenarios, while largely preserving the response quality on benign inputs.

### [454] [Generating CodeMeta using declarative mapping rules: An open-ended approach using ShExML](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09172)
*Herminio Garc√≠a-Gonz√°lez*

Main category: cs.DL

TL;DR: This paper proposes using declarative mapping rules to generate standardized CodeMeta files for research software, ensuring metadata compliance with FAIR principles.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The increasing reliance on research software across scientific fields requires reproducibility via adherence to FAIR principles for metadata representation.

Method: Declarative mapping rules were implemented using ShExML to create CodeMeta files, validated through SHACL and ShEx, with automation for minimal user intervention.

Result: Three crosswalks were designed and expanded to generate CodeMeta files for two research software artefacts, successfully validated to demonstrate workflow flexibility and adaptability.

Conclusion: The approach facilitates CodeMeta adoption and enhances research software's FAIRness, providing a reusable example for other developers.

Abstract: Nowadays, software is one of the cornerstones when conducting research in
several scientific fields which employ computer-based methodologies to answer
new research questions. However, for these experiments to be completely
reproducible, research software should comply with the FAIR principles, yet its
metadata can be represented following different data models and spread across
different locations. In order to bring some cohesion to the field, CodeMeta was
proposed as a vocabulary to represent research software metadata in a unified
and standardised manner. While existing tools can help users to generate
CodeMeta files for some specific use cases, they fall short on flexibility and
adaptability. Hence, in this work, I propose the use of declarative mapping
rules to generate CodeMeta files, illustrated through the implementation of
three crosswalks in ShExML which are then expanded and merged to cover the
generation of CodeMeta files for two existing research software artefacts.
Moreover, the outputs are validated using SHACL and ShEx and the whole
generation workflow is automated requiring minimal user intervention upon a new
version release. This work can, therefore, be used as an example upon which
other developers can include a CodeMeta generation workflow in their
repositories, facilitating the adoption of CodeMeta and, ultimately, increasing
research software FAIRness.

### [455] [Multiparty equality in the local broadcast model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09143)
*Louis Esperet,Jean-Florent Raymond*

Main category: math.CO

TL;DR: This paper investigates the multiparty equality problem in graphs under the local broadcast model, where vertices decide if all inputs are equal. A new protocol leveraging the concept of total vertex cover is proposed, outperforming prior solutions in specific cases and achieving optimality in certain topologies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to improve the efficiency of solutions to the multiparty equality problem in graphs, with a focus on leveraging network topology, building upon limitations in prior general-purpose protocols.

Method: A new protocol is introduced specifically for 2-connected graphs, utilizing the graph theory concept of total vertex cover. It is analyzed and applied to various network topologies like cycles and hypercubes.

Result: The proposed protocol outperforms the earlier 4-approximation approach in certain instances and achieves (or asymptotically approaches) optimal solutions for specific topologies.

Conclusion: The total vertex cover-based protocol demonstrates versatility and efficiency in addressing the multiparty equality problem, particularly in structured graph topologies.

Abstract: In this paper we consider the multiparty equality problem in graphs, where
every vertex of a graph $G$ is given an input, and the goal of the vertices is
to decide whether all inputs are equal. We study this problem in the local
broadcast model, where a message sent by a vertex is received by all its
neighbors and the total cost of a protocol is the sum of the lengths of the
messages sent by the vertices. This setting was studied by Khan and Vaidya, who
gave in 2021 a protocol achieving a 4-approximation in the general case.
  We study this multiparty communication problem through the lens of network
topology. We design a new protocol for 2-connected graphs, whose efficiency
relies on the notion of total vertex cover in graph theory. This protocol
outperforms the aforementioned 4-approximation in a number of cases. To
demonstrate its applicability, we apply it to obtain optimal or asymptotically
optimal protocols for several natural network topologies such as cycles,
hypercubes, and grids. On the way we also provide new bounds of independent
interest on the size of total vertex covers in regular graphs.

### [456] [Reliability Sensitivity with Response Gradient](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09315)
*Siu-Kui Au,Zi-Jun Cao*

Main category: stat.ME

TL;DR: This paper develops a Monte Carlo method for computing sensitivity in engineering risk scenarios by utilizing response values and gradients, employing kernel smoothing techniques to address zero-probability conditioning on thresholds.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in engineering risk sensitivity calculations, including rare events, implicit nonlinear responses, and inefficiencies in traditional Monte Carlo methods, especially when dealing with numerous random input variables.

Method: The proposed method integrates Monte Carlo simulations with response values and gradients, leveraging kernel smoothing to resolve conditioning on zero-probability response thresholds, thereby enabling sensitivity analysis for all thresholds in a single simulation run.

Result: The approach is demonstrated through examples featuring diverse sensitivity parameters, showcasing its capability to compute sensitivity estimates efficiently and accurately, while avoiding traditional computational inefficiencies.

Conclusion: This study introduces a unified Monte Carlo framework that combines sensitivity calculation and reliability analysis, paving the way for a more efficient approach in engineering risk assessments as response gradients become more accessible.

Abstract: Engineering risk is concerned with the likelihood of failure and the
scenarios when it occurs. The sensitivity of failure probability to change in
system parameters is relevant to risk-informed decision making. Computing
sensitivity is at least one level more difficult than the probability itself,
which is already challenged by a large number of input random variables, rare
events and implicit nonlinear `black-box' response. Finite difference with
Monte Carlo probability estimates is spurious, requiring the number of samples
to grow with the reciprocal of step size to suppress estimation variance. Many
existing works gain efficiency by exploiting a specific class of input
variables, sensitivity parameters, or response in its exact or surrogate form.
For general systems, this work presents a theory and associated Monte Carlo
strategy for computing sensitivity using response values and gradients with
respect to sensitivity parameters. It is shown that the sensitivity at a given
response threshold can be expressed via the expectation of response gradient
conditional on the threshold. Determining the expectation requires conditioning
on the threshold that is a zero-probability event, but it can be resolved by
the concept of kernel smoothing. The proposed method offers sensitivity
estimates for all response thresholds generated in a single Monte Carlo run. It
is investigated in a number of examples featuring sensitivity parameters of
different nature. As response gradient becomes increasingly available, it is
hoped that this work can provide the basis for embedding sensitivity
calculations with reliability in the same Monte Carlo run.

*Graham Tierney,Srikar Katta,Christopher Bail,Sunshine Hillygus,Alexander Volfovsky*

Main category: stat.ME

TL;DR: The paper addresses how linguistic properties affect audience attitudes and behaviors while tackling latent confounding issues by introducing a new experimental design.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to explore how linguistic elements, like humility in political communication, causally influence audience perception, minimizing biases from overlapping text properties.

Method: A novel experimental design is proposed to manage latent confounding and avoid overlap bias, comparing LLM methods to simpler models and utilizing real-world text data.

Result: LLM-based methods are shown to perform worse than bag-of-words models in predicting effects. The causal effect of humility on persuasiveness in political communication is successfully isolated.

Conclusion: The paper provides a robust experimental framework and practical insights for understanding linguistic impacts, valuable for policymakers, social platforms, and researchers.

Abstract: Many social science questions ask how linguistic properties causally affect
an audience's attitudes and behaviors. Because text properties are often
interlinked (e.g., angry reviews use profane language), we must control for
possible latent confounding to isolate causal effects. Recent literature
proposes adapting large language models (LLMs) to learn latent representations
of text that successfully predict both treatment and the outcome. However,
because the treatment is a component of the text, these deep learning methods
risk learning representations that actually encode the treatment itself,
inducing overlap bias. Rather than depending on post-hoc adjustments, we
introduce a new experimental design that handles latent confounding, avoids the
overlap issue, and unbiasedly estimates treatment effects. We apply this design
in an experiment evaluating the persuasiveness of expressing humility in
political communication. Methodologically, we demonstrate that LLM-based
methods perform worse than even simple bag-of-words models using our real text
and outcomes from our experiment. Substantively, we isolate the causal effect
of expressing humility on the perceived persuasiveness of political statements,
offering new insights on communication effects for social media platforms,
policy makers, and social scientists.

*Benjamin Shiue-Hal Chou,Purvish Jajal,Nick John Eliopoulos,James C. Davis,George K. Thiruvathukal,Kristen Yeon-Ji Yun,Yung-Hsiang Lu*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: LadderSym, a Transformer-based model, enhances music error detection by addressing alignment and ambiguity issues of previous methods, achieving significant performance gains in precision.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop an advanced tool for music error detection, addressing limitations in inter-stream alignment and ambiguity caused by reliance on score audio.

Method: The LadderSym method introduces a two-stream encoder with inter-stream alignment modules and a multimodal strategy that incorporates symbolic representations as decoder prompts.

Result: LadderSym significantly improves the F1 score for note detection on the MAESTRO-E and CocoChorales-E datasets, doubling F1 for missed notes and improving extra note detection.

Conclusion: LadderSym outperforms existing methods, propelling advancements in music error detection and informing sequence evaluation tasks.

Abstract: Music learners can greatly benefit from tools that accurately detect errors
in their practice. Existing approaches typically compare audio recordings to
music scores using heuristics or learnable models. This paper introduces
\textit{LadderSym}, a novel Transformer-based method for music error detection.
\textit{LadderSym} is guided by two key observations about the state-of-the-art
approaches: (1) late fusion limits inter-stream alignment and cross-modality
comparison capability; and (2) reliance on score audio introduces ambiguity in
the frequency spectrum, degrading performance in music with concurrent notes.
To address these limitations, \textit{LadderSym} introduces (1) a two-stream
encoder with inter-stream alignment modules to improve audio comparison
capabilities and error detection F1 scores, and (2) a multimodal strategy that
leverages both audio and symbolic scores by incorporating symbolic
representations as decoder prompts, reducing ambiguity and improving F1 scores.
We evaluate our method on the \textit{MAESTRO-E} and \textit{CocoChorales-E}
datasets by measuring the F1 score for each note category. Compared to the
previous state of the art, \textit{LadderSym} more than doubles F1 for missed
notes on \textit{MAESTRO-E} (26.8\% $\rightarrow$ 56.3\%) and improves extra
note detection by 14.4 points (72.0\% $\rightarrow$ 86.4\%). Similar gains are
observed on \textit{CocoChorales-E}. This work introduces general insights
about comparison models that could inform sequence evaluation tasks for
reinforcement Learning, human skill assessment, and model evaluation.

*Hansol Park,Hoseong Ahn,Junwon Moon,Yejin Lee,Kyuhong Shim*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: This paper investigates how spoken inputs affect hallucinations in multimodal vision-language models, revealing increased error rates under clean and noisy conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to explore the impact of voice-driven queries on hallucinations in multimodal models, an area relatively unexamined despite the growing reliance on voice interfaces.

Method: The authors developed RePOPE-Spk, an audio-augmented benchmark, and evaluated proprietary and open-source models under various acoustic conditions. They also tested strategies like prompting and chain-of-thought reasoning.

Result: Hallucinations increased by 3% with clean speech and up to 20% under noisy conditions. Input order and query length also influenced robustness.

Conclusion: Spoken queries escalate hallucinations in multimodal models, highlighting a significant challenge for improving the reliability of voice-driven systems.

Abstract: Hallucinations in vision-language models have been extensively studied using
benchmarks that probe reliability in image-text settings. In contrast, the
effect of spoken queries on multimodal hallucinations remains largely
unexplored, despite the growing role of voice-driven interfaces. In this work,
we investigate how spoken input influences hallucinations in multimodal large
language models. We present RePOPE-Spk, an audio-augmented extension of the
RePOPE benchmark, where queries are provided as speech under diverse acoustic
conditions. Using RePOPE-Spk, we systematically evaluate both proprietary and
open-source models. Experimental results show that hallucinations escalate when
queries are spoken rather than written: error rates increase by 3% under clean
speech and by up to 20% with environmental noise. Input order and query length
further affect robustness, while strategies such as many-shot prompting and
chain-of-thought reasoning offer partial but insufficient mitigation. These
findings highlight a critical and underexplored challenge, opening new
directions for building reliable voice interface systems.

TL;DR: EGSTalker proposes a fast and visually high-quality method for audio-driven talking head animation using 3D Gaussian Splatting, requiring minimal training data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of generating high-quality real-time talking head animations with minimal training video data.

Method: The framework integrates static Gaussian initialization using a multi-resolution hash triplane and Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN), combined with audio-driven deformation using the Efficient Spatial-Audio Attention (ESAA) module.

Result: EGSTalker achieves high visual fidelity and lip-sync accuracy comparable to advanced methods, with a significant boost in inference speed.

Conclusion: EGSTalker offers a promising solution for real-time multimedia applications, combining speed with high-quality rendering.

Abstract: This paper presents EGSTalker, a real-time audio-driven talking head
generation framework based on 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS). Designed to enhance
both speed and visual fidelity, EGSTalker requires only 3-5 minutes of training
video to synthesize high-quality facial animations. The framework comprises two
key stages: static Gaussian initialization and audio-driven deformation. In the
first stage, a multi-resolution hash triplane and a Kolmogorov-Arnold Network
(KAN) are used to extract spatial features and construct a compact 3D Gaussian
representation. In the second stage, we propose an Efficient Spatial-Audio
Attention (ESAA) module to fuse audio and spatial cues, while KAN predicts the
corresponding Gaussian deformations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
EGSTalker achieves rendering quality and lip-sync accuracy comparable to
state-of-the-art methods, while significantly outperforming them in inference
speed. These results highlight EGSTalker's potential for real-time multimedia
applications.

TL;DR: MMAudioSep is a generative model for sound separation using video/text queries, leveraging a pretrained video-to-audio model for efficient training and achieving superior performance over existing models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable efficient sound separation using a generative model that leverages pre-trained relationships between video/text and audio.

Method: MMAudioSep employs fine-tuning of a pretrained video-to-audio model for sound separation tasks, without requiring training from scratch.

Result: MMAudioSep outperforms existing deterministic and generative sound separation models on benchmark tests and preserves its original video-to-audio generation capability.

Conclusion: Foundational generative models, such as MMAudioSep, showcase potential for downstream sound-related tasks while maintaining base functionality. Its superior performance sets a new benchmark for the field.

Abstract: We introduce MMAudioSep, a generative model for video/text-queried sound
separation that is founded on a pretrained video-to-audio model. By leveraging
knowledge about the relationship between video/text and audio learned through a
pretrained audio generative model, we can train the model more efficiently,
i.e., the model does not need to be trained from scratch. We evaluate the
performance of MMAudioSep by comparing it to existing separation models,
including models based on both deterministic and generative approaches, and
find it is superior to the baseline models. Furthermore, we demonstrate that
even after acquiring functionality for sound separation via fine-tuning, the
model retains the ability for original video-to-audio generation. This
highlights the potential of foundational sound generation models to be adopted
for sound-related downstream tasks. Our code is available at

TL;DR: The paper introduces ControlAudio, a progressive diffusion model for controllable text-to-audio generation with precise timing and phoneme control, achieving state-of-the-art generation performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing TTA generation methods perform poorly at scale due to data scarcity and limited precision control.

Method: ControlAudio uses multi-task learning and a progressive diffusion modeling approach. It includes data construction methods (annotation/simulation), pretraining a diffusion transformer, and progressive fine-grained information integration during inference.

Result: ControlAudio achieves significant improvements in temporal accuracy and speech clarity, displaying state-of-the-art results in both objective and subjective evaluations.

Conclusion: The study proposes a scalable and controllable TTA generation framework that outperforms prior methods, enabling fine-grained control for better audio generation quality and precision.

Abstract: Text-to-audio (TTA) generation with fine-grained control signals, e.g.,
precise timing control or intelligible speech content, has been explored in
recent works. However, constrained by data scarcity, their generation
performance at scale is still compromised. In this study, we recast
controllable TTA generation as a multi-task learning problem and introduce a
progressive diffusion modeling approach, ControlAudio. Our method adeptly fits
distributions conditioned on more fine-grained information, including text,
timing, and phoneme features, through a step-by-step strategy. First, we
propose a data construction method spanning both annotation and simulation,
augmenting condition information in the sequence of text, timing, and phoneme.
Second, at the model training stage, we pretrain a diffusion transformer (DiT)
on large-scale text-audio pairs, achieving scalable TTA generation, and then
incrementally integrate the timing and phoneme features with unified semantic
representations, expanding controllability. Finally, at the inference stage, we
propose progressively guided generation, which sequentially emphasizes more
fine-grained information, aligning inherently with the coarse-to-fine sampling
nature of DiT. Extensive experiments show that ControlAudio achieves
state-of-the-art performance in terms of temporal accuracy and speech clarity,
significantly outperforming existing methods on both objective and subjective
evaluations. Demo samples are available at:

Motivation: To enhance expressiveness and scalability in Singing Voice Synthesis (SVS) while addressing the challenges of data scarcity and the need for robust alignment tools.

Method: A two-stage pipeline was developed: (1) Creating a compact set of data with LLM-generated diverse lyrics and fixed melodies for training, (2) Training a Diffusion Transformer (DiTSinger) with alignment-free mechanisms using advanced techniques such as RoPE and qk-norm.

Result: DiTSinger successfully synthesizes over 500 hours of high-quality Chinese singing data, showing superior robustness and high fidelity in handling noisy or uncertain alignments.

Conclusion: The proposed system offers a scalable, alignment-free, and high-quality SVS solution that can be extended and applied in challenging synthesis scenarios for Chinese singing.

Abstract: Recent progress in diffusion-based Singing Voice Synthesis (SVS) demonstrates
strong expressiveness but remains limited by data scarcity and model
scalability. We introduce a two-stage pipeline: a compact seed set of
human-sung recordings is constructed by pairing fixed melodies with diverse
LLM-generated lyrics, and melody-specific models are trained to synthesize over
500 hours of high-quality Chinese singing data. Building on this corpus, we
propose DiTSinger, a Diffusion Transformer with RoPE and qk-norm,
systematically scaled in depth, width, and resolution for enhanced fidelity.
Furthermore, we design an implicit alignment mechanism that obviates
phoneme-level duration labels by constraining phoneme-to-acoustic attention
within character-level spans, thereby improving robustness under noisy or
uncertain alignments. Extensive experiments validate that our approach enables
scalable, alignment-free, and high-fidelity SVS.

Motivation: Enhancing the robustness and generalization of speech emotion recognition in real-world scenarios hindered by noise and dataset variability.

Method: The method combines EDRL for extracting discriminative features and MEA for refining representations into a joint latent subspace.

Result: The model achieved superior performance in recognizing emotions on unseen noisy and cross-corpus speech samples.

Conclusion: The approach successfully demonstrates improved robustness and effectiveness of speech emotion recognition models under challenging conditions.

Abstract: Effectiveness of speech emotion recognition in real-world scenarios is often
hindered by noisy environments and variability across datasets. This paper
introduces a two-step approach to enhance the robustness and generalization of
speech emotion recognition models through improved representation learning.
First, our model employs EDRL (Emotion-Disentangled Representation Learning) to
extract class-specific discriminative features while preserving shared
similarities across emotion categories. Next, MEA (Multiblock Embedding
Alignment) refines these representations by projecting them into a joint
discriminative latent subspace that maximizes covariance with the original
speech input. The learned EDRL-MEA embeddings are subsequently used to train an
emotion classifier using clean samples from publicly available datasets, and
are evaluated on unseen noisy and cross-corpus speech samples. Improved
performance under these challenging conditions demonstrates the effectiveness
of the proposed method.

Motivation: To address challenges in motion planning for multiple autonomous robots navigating in unknown environments with sequential targets, expanding on prior topological complexity frameworks.

Method: The authors model the problem mathematically using fibrations to analyze topological complexity, alongside cohomological computations and construction of explicit motion planning algorithms.

Result: Successfully derived the topological complexity invariant for generalized multi-robot motion planning, addressing both odd and even-dimensional spaces.

Conclusion: The study develops a mathematical framework and insights for minimally complex, collision-free motion planning in diverse, constrained environments.

Abstract: We study a generalized motion planning problem involving multiple autonomous
robots navigating in a $d$-dimensional Euclidean space in the presence of a set
of obstacles whose positions are unknown a priori. Each robot is required to
visit sequentially a prescribed set of target states, with the number of
targets varying between robots. This heterogeneous setting generalizes the
framework considered in the prior works on sequential parametrized topological
complexity by Farber and the second author of this article. To determine the
topological complexity of our problem, we formulate it mathematically by
constructing an appropriate fibration. Our main contribution is the
determination of this invariant in the generalized setting, which captures the
minimal algorithmic instability required for designing collision-free motion
planning algorithms under parameter-dependent constraints. We provide a
detailed analysis for both odd and even-dimensional ambient spaces, including
the essential cohomological computations and explicit constructions of
corresponding motion planning algorithms.

Motivation: Existing methods rely on restrictive assumptions or are limited in scope, necessitating a unified and distribution-free approach to changepoint inference.

Result: The methods exhibit consistency, finite-sample validity, and provide enhanced power for distribution-change alternatives as corroborated by simulation studies.

Conclusion: The study broadens the applicability and credibility of conformal methods in modern changepoint analysis, offering unified and distribution-free inference techniques.

Abstract: Changepoint localization aims to provide confidence sets for a changepoint
(if one exists). Existing methods either relying on strong parametric
assumptions or providing only asymptotic guarantees or focusing on a particular
kind of change(e.g., change in the mean) rather than the entire distributional
change. A method (possibly the first) to achieve distribution-free changepoint
localization with finite-sample validity was recently introduced by
\cite{dandapanthula2025conformal}. However, while they proved finite sample
coverage, there was no analysis of set size. In this work, we provide rigorous
theoretical guarantees for their algorithm. We also show the consistency of a
point estimator for change, and derive its convergence rate without
distributional assumptions. Along that line, we also construct a
distribution-free consistent test to assess whether a particular time point is
a changepoint or not. Thus, our work provides unified distribution-free
guarantees for changepoint detection, localization, and testing. In addition,
we present various finite sample and asymptotic properties of the conformal
$p$-value in the distribution change setup, which provides a theoretical
foundation for many applications of the conformal $p$-value. As an application
of these properties, we construct distribution-free consistent tests for
exchangeability against distribution-change alternatives and a new,
computationally tractable method of optimizing the powers of conformal tests.
We run detailed simulation studies to corroborate the performance of our
methods and theoretical results. Together, our contributions offer a
comprehensive and theoretically principled approach to distribution-free
changepoint inference, broadening both the scope and credibility of conformal
methods in modern changepoint analysis.

### [468] [Understanding Exoplanet Habitability: A Bayesian ML Framework for Predicting Atmospheric Absorption Spectra](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08766)
*Vasuda Trehan,Kevin H. Knuth,M. J. Way*

Main category: astro-ph.EP

TL;DR: This study focuses on creating a predictive model for exoplanet atmospheric absorption spectra using observational and synthetic data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To leverage advancements in AI and ML for analyzing vast observational data, improving our understanding of exoplanetary atmospheres, climates, and habitability.

Method: The study utilizes spline curves to depict simulated spectra, coupled with Bayesian Adaptive Exploration to target parameter spaces needing more data. The ROCKE-3D GCM outputs synthetic spectra for modeling.

Result: A forward model is being developed to infer planetary parameters based on their atmospheric absorption spectra.

Conclusion: This research aims to enhance the understanding of exoplanetary properties and contribute significantly to the field of exoplanet science and habitability studies.

Abstract: The evolution of space technology in recent years, fueled by advancements in
computing such as Artificial Intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML), has
profoundly transformed our capacity to explore the cosmos. Missions like the
James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) have made information about distant objects
more easily accessible, resulting in extensive amounts of valuable data. As
part of this work-in-progress study, we are working to create an atmospheric
absorption spectrum prediction model for exoplanets. The eventual model will be
based on both collected observational spectra and synthetic spectral data
generated by the ROCKE-3D general circulation model (GCM) developed by the
climate modeling program at NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies (GISS).
In this initial study, spline curves are used to describe the bin heights of
simulated atmospheric absorption spectra as a function of one of the values of
the planetary parameters. Bayesian Adaptive Exploration is then employed to
identify areas of the planetary parameter space for which more data are needed
to improve the model. The resulting system will be used as a forward model so
that planetary parameters can be inferred given a planet's atmospheric
absorption spectrum. This work is expected to contribute to a better
understanding of exoplanetary properties and general exoplanet climates and
habitability.

TL;DR: The paper presents PolicySmith, a framework leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) to automate the generation of instance-optimal heuristics for systems policies like web caching and congestion control.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual policy design for systems controllers is labor-intensive and requires domain expertise to tailor specific heuristics, calling for an automated, efficient alternative.

Method: The authors introduce PolicySmith, which uses LLM-driven code generation to automate the search and synthesis of optimal heuristics for given policy design problems.

Result: PolicySmith outperformed established baselines in web caching on standard open-source traces and generated safe, integrable congestion control policies for the Linux kernel.

Conclusion: LLM-driven heuristic search, as demonstrated by PolicySmith, is a promising approach to automate and optimize systems policy design, unlocking new possibilities in this domain.

Abstract: Policy design for various systems controllers has conventionally been a
manual process, with domain experts carefully tailoring heuristics for the
specific instance in which the policy will be deployed. In this paper, we
re-imagine policy design via a novel automated search technique fueled by
recent advances in generative models, specifically Large Language Model
(LLM)-driven code generation. We outline the design and implementation of
PolicySmith, a framework that applies LLMs to synthesize instance-optimal
heuristics. We apply PolicySmith to two long-standing systems policies - web
caching and congestion control, highlighting the opportunities unraveled by
this LLM-driven heuristic search. For caching, PolicySmith discovers heuristics
that outperform established baselines on standard open-source traces. For
congestion control, we show that PolicySmith can generate safe policies that
integrate directly into the Linux kernel.

Result: Extensive simulations show superior modeling accuracy and control efficacy of the MAKO approach compared to other baseline methods.

Conclusion: MAKO effectively provides a robust and adaptive framework for modeling and controlling nonlinear systems, ensuring closed-loop stability and handling previously unseen parameter settings.

Abstract: In this work, we propose a meta-learning-based Koopman modeling and
predictive control approach for nonlinear systems with parametric
uncertainties. An adaptive deep meta-learning-based modeling approach, called
Meta Adaptive Koopman Operator (MAKO), is proposed. Without knowledge of the

Koopman model, a predictive control scheme is developed, and the stability of
the closed-loop system is ensured even in the presence of previously unseen
parameter settings. Through extensive simulations, our proposed approach
demonstrates superior performance in both modeling accuracy and control

TL;DR: The paper introduces a multistable mechanical metamaterial capable of toggling stiffness by switching between stable configurations. The effect is experimentally validated and has potential applications in adaptive systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create mechanical responses through structural design rather than material composition, with a focus on toggleable stiffness for advanced applications.

Method: They use surrogate beam models and numerical analysis to explore the stiffness toggling mechanism, validated with experiments on 3D-printed prototypes.

Result: The study shows that the stiffness toggling behavior can be engineered and fine-tuned by altering the structural parameters, such as beam slenderness and hinge incorporation.

Conclusion: The research offers a novel strategy for toggleable stiffness in mechanical metamaterials, with significant implications for soft robotics and smart structures.

Abstract: Mechanical metamaterials enable unconventional and programmable mechanical
responses through structural design rather than material composition. In this
work, we introduce a multistable mechanical metamaterial that exhibits a
toggleable stiffness effect, where the effective shear stiffness switches
discretely between stable configurations. The mechanical analysis of surrogate
beam models of the unit cell reveal that this behavior originates from the
rotation transmitted by the support beams to the curved beam, which governs the
balance between bending and axial deformation. The stiffness ratio between the
two states of the unit cell can be tuned by varying the slenderness of the
support beams or by incorporating localized hinges that modulate rotational
transfer. Experiments on 3D-printed prototypes validate the numerical
predictions, confirming consistent stiffness toggling across different
geometries. Finally, we demonstrate a monolithic soft clutch that leverages
this effect to achieve programmable, stepwise stiffness modulation. This work
establishes a design strategy for toggleable stiffness using multistable
metamaterials, paving the way for adaptive, lightweight, and autonomous systems
in soft robotics and smart structures.

*Bharath Muppasani,Ritirupa Dey,Biplav Srivastava,Vignesh Narayanan*

Main category: cs.MA

TL;DR: This paper addresses limitations in multi-agent pathfinding (MAPF) algorithms by proposing a hybrid method, combining decentralized RL-based planning with lightweight centralized coordination to improve scalability and conflict resolution.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the inefficiencies of computationally expensive centralized algorithms and low-quality solutions of distributed approaches in MAPF for robotics and autonomous systems.

Method: Proposed a hybrid framework that uses reinforcement learning for decentralized planning along with dynamic conflict alerts from a centralized coordinator.

Result: The approach reduces inter-agent information sharing while maintaining consistent, collision-free, and scalable solutions, even in scenarios with high agent counts.

Conclusion: The hybrid model effectively balances solution quality and computational efficiency in MAPF, offering a practical solution for large-scale operations.

Abstract: Multi-agent pathfinding (MAPF) remains a critical problem in robotics and
autonomous systems, where agents must navigate shared spaces efficiently while
avoiding conflicts. Traditional centralized algorithms that have global
information, such as Conflict-Based Search (CBS), provide high-quality
solutions but become computationally expensive in large-scale scenarios due to
the combinatorial explosion of conflicts that need resolution. Conversely,
distributed approaches that have local information, particularly learning-based
methods, offer better scalability by operating with relaxed information
availability, yet often at the cost of solution quality. To address these
limitations, we propose a hybrid framework that combines decentralized path
planning with a lightweight centralized coordinator. Our framework leverages
reinforcement learning (RL) for decentralized planning, enabling agents to
adapt their planning based on minimal, targeted alerts--such as static
conflict-cell flags or brief conflict tracks--that are dynamically shared
information from the central coordinator for effective conflict resolution. We
empirically study the effect of the information available to an agent on its
planning performance. Our approach reduces the inter-agent information sharing
compared to fully centralized and distributed methods, while still consistently
finding feasible, collision-free solutions--even in large-scale scenarios
having higher agent counts.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AI applications in Alzheimer's disease care are isolated and not comprehensive, necessitating a systemic, integrated approach to better meet patient and caregiver needs.

Method: The paper outlines a multi-agent system composed of eight specialized AI agents categorized into three functions: Caregiver and Patient Support, Data Analysis and Research, and Advanced Multimodal Workflows.

Result: It presents an architectural blueprint leveraging technologies like large language models, Retrieval-Augmented Generation, and specialized tools to enable a collaborative AI ecosystem for Alzheimer's care.

Conclusion: The framework lays the foundation for adaptive and integrated solutions, aiming to enhance patient outcomes and caregiver support through a collaborative, multi-agent approach.

Abstract: Alzheimer's disease (AD) presents a complex, multifaceted challenge to
patients, caregivers, and the healthcare system, necessitating integrated and
dynamic support solutions. While artificial intelligence (AI) offers promising
avenues for intervention, current applications are often siloed, addressing
singular aspects of the disease such as diagnostics or caregiver support
without systemic integration. This paper proposes a novel methodological
framework for a comprehensive, multi-agent system (MAS) designed for holistic
Alzheimer's disease management. The objective is to detail the architecture of
a collaborative ecosystem of specialized AI agents, each engineered to address
a distinct challenge in the AD care continuum, from caregiver support and
multimodal data analysis to automated research and clinical data
interpretation. The proposed framework is composed of eight specialized,
interoperable agents. These agents are categorized by function: (1) Caregiver
and Patient Support, (2) Data Analysis and Research, and (3) Advanced
Multimodal Workflows. The methodology details the technical architecture of
each agent, leveraging a suite of advanced technologies including large
language models (LLMs) such as GPT-4o and Gemini, multi-agent orchestration
frameworks, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) for evidence-grounded
responses, and specialized tools for web scraping, multimodal data processing,
and in-memory database querying. This paper presents a detailed architectural
blueprint for an integrated AI ecosystem for AD care. By moving beyond
single-purpose tools to a collaborative, multi-agent paradigm, this framework
establishes a foundation for developing more adaptive, personalized, and
proactive solutions. This methodological approach aims to pave the way for
future systems capable of synthesizing diverse data streams to improve patient
outcomes and reduce caregiver burden.

Motivation: Develop a geometrically optimal and computationally efficient background grid for unstructured mesh generation while addressing challenges like banding artifacts.

Method: Reformulate grid simplification as an edge score regression task using a GCN model with custom loss functions to predict optimal edge collapses, replacing procedural evaluations with efficient data-driven approaches.

Result: Simplified grids reduced elements by 74%-94% and sizing field query times by 35%-88%, demonstrating effectiveness across complex engineering models.

Conclusion: The proposed framework enhances computational efficiency and geometric fidelity in background grid simplification for unstructured mesh generation.

Abstract: The sizing field defined on a triangular background grid is pivotal for
controlling the quality and efficiency of unstructured mesh generation.
However, creating an optimal background grid that is geometrically conforming,
computationally lightweight, and free from artifacts like banding is a
significant challenge. This paper introduces a novel, adaptive background grid
simplification (ABGS) framework based on a Graph Convolutional Network (GCN).
We reformulate the grid simplification task as an edge score regression problem
and train a GCN model to efficiently predict optimal edge collapse candidates.
The model is guided by a custom loss function that holistically considers both
geometric fidelity and sizing field accuracy. This data-driven approach
replaces a costly procedural evaluation, accelerating the simplification
process. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework
across diverse and complex engineering models. Compared to the initial dense
grids, our simplified background grids achieve an element reduction of 74%-94%,
leading to a 35%-88% decrease in sizing field query times.

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: This paper discusses using Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods as a key component in enhancing generative AI models and physically-based rendering.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore how MCMC can unify techniques in diffusion-based generative models and physically-based rendering, as no unified framework currently exists.

Method: The paper proposes studying the use of MCMC in generative processes, focusing on both theoretical and practical tools for understanding its role in parameter space exploration and sampling high-dimensional distributions.

Result: The paper introduces preliminary steps and tools to establish MCMC as a bridge between generative AI and physically-based rendering methodologies.

Conclusion: MCMC methods have the potential to unite different areas of generative modeling and physically-based rendering, providing insights and tools for academic and practical advancements.

Abstract: Generative artificial intelligence (AI) has made unprecedented advances in
vision language models over the past two years. During the generative process,
new samples (images) are generated from an unknown high-dimensional
distribution. Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods are particularly
effective in drawing samples from such complex, high-dimensional distributions.
This makes MCMC methods an integral component for models like EBMs, ensuring
accurate sample generation.
  Gradient-based optimization is at the core of modern generative models. The
update step during the optimization forms a Markov chain where the new update
depends only on the current state. This allows exploration of the parameter
space in a memoryless manner, thus combining the benefits of gradient-based
optimization and MCMC sampling. MCMC methods have shown an equally important
role in physically based rendering where complex light paths are otherwise
quite challenging to sample from simple importance sampling techniques.
  A lot of research is dedicated towards bringing physical realism to samples
(images) generated from diffusion-based generative models in a data-driven
manner, however, a unified framework connecting these techniques is still
missing. In this course, we take the first steps toward understanding each of
these components and exploring how MCMC could potentially serve as a bridge,
linking these closely related areas of research. Our course aims to provide
necessary theoretical and practical tools to guide students, researchers and
practitioners towards the common goal of generative physically based rendering.

*Proggya Chakraborty,Aaquib Asrar,Jayasree Sengupta,Sipra Das Bit*

Main category: cs.NI

TL;DR: The paper introduces DePSAC, a DRL-based admission control scheme in 5G networks, designed to optimize profit while reducing latency and improving resource allocation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing DRL frameworks primarily focus on profit optimization without accounting for service delay, leading to potential QoS violations for latency-sensitive services. Additionally, common exploration techniques like epsilon-greedy result in unstable convergence.

Method: DePSAC uses a delay-aware reward function to prioritize latency-critical slices and employs Boltzmann exploration for smoother DRL convergence.

Result: The proposed method outperforms the DSARA baseline, improving profit, URLLC slice delays, acceptance rates, and resource utilization in a simulated 5G network setup.

Conclusion: DePSAC achieves better QoS and profit trade-offs, making it well-suited for practical deployment in 5G network slicing scenarios.

Abstract: 5G networks enable diverse services such as eMBB, URLLC, and mMTC through
network slicing, necessitating intelligent admission control and resource
allocation to meet stringent QoS requirements while maximizing Network Service
Provider (NSP) profits. However, existing Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL)
frameworks focus primarily on profit optimization without explicitly accounting
for service delay, potentially leading to QoS violations for latency-sensitive
slices. Moreover, commonly used epsilon-greedy exploration of DRL often results
in unstable convergence and suboptimal policy learning. To address these gaps,
we propose DePSAC -- a Delay and Profit-aware Slice Admission Control scheme.
Our DRL-based approach incorporates a delay-aware reward function, where
penalties due to service delay incentivize the prioritization of
latency-critical slices such as URLLC. Additionally, we employ Boltzmann
exploration to achieve smoother and faster convergence. We implement and
evaluate DePSAC on a simulated 5G core network substrate with realistic Network
Slice Request (NSLR) arrival patterns. Experimental results demonstrate that
our method outperforms the DSARA baseline in terms of overall profit, reduced
URLLC slice delays, improved acceptance rates, and improved resource
consumption. These findings validate the effectiveness of the proposed DePSAC
in achieving better QoS-profit trade-offs for practical 5G network slicing
scenarios.

Main category: cs.NI

TL;DR: The paper introduces an uncertainty-aware model to estimate user throughput in 5G networks using crowdsourced data, improving existing methods and analyzing bottlenecks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The shift in bottlenecks from the Radio Access Network (RAN) to deeper network layers in next-generation networks complicates traditional throughput characterization methods.

Method: Crowdsourced user equipment data is used with NGBoost to provide downlink throughput estimations, including confidence intervals.

Result: Improved throughput estimation accuracy for 4G by 8.7%, created benchmarks for 5G datasets, and analyzed bottleneck shifts in the network layers.

Conclusion: Throughput estimation accuracy improves with NGBoost, while the importance shifts from radio-related features to transport layers in 5G networks.

Abstract: Characterizing application-layer user throughput in next-generation networks
is increasingly challenging as the higher capacity of the 5G Radio Access
Network (RAN) shifts connectivity bottlenecks towards deeper parts of the
network. Traditional methods, such as drive tests and operator equipment
counters, are costly, limited, or fail to capture end-to-end (E2E) Quality of
Service (QoS) and its variability. In this work, we leverage large-scale
crowdsourced measurements-including E2E, radio, contextual and network
deployment features collected by the user equipment (UE)-to propose an
uncertainty-aware and explainable approach for downlink user throughput
estimation. We first validate prior 4G methods, improving R^2 by 8.7%, and then
extend them to 5G NSA and 5G SA, providing the first benchmarks for 5G
crowdsourced datasets. To address the variability of throughput, we apply
NGBoost, a model that outputs both point estimates and calibrated confidence
intervals, representing its first use in the field of computer communications.
Finally, we use the proposed model to analyze the evolution from 4G to 5G SA,
and show that throughput bottlenecks move from the RAN to transport and service
layers, as seen by E2E metrics gaining importance over radio-related features.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the challenge of constructing SMTs in hyperbolic space, given the NP-hard nature of the problem and limitations of deterministic heuristics such as HyperSteiner.

Method: Randomized HyperSteiner (RHS) integrates randomness in tree expansion via Delaunay triangulation and refines results using Riemannian gradient descent optimization.

Result: RHS outperforms existing methods like MST, Neighbor Joining, and vanilla HyperSteiner (HS), achieving significant reductions in total length, particularly near-boundary configurations.

Conclusion: The proposed RHS method demonstrates superior effectiveness and robustness in constructing SMTs in diverse data regimes compared to traditional approaches.

Abstract: We study the problem of constructing Steiner Minimal Trees (SMTs) in
hyperbolic space. Exact SMT computation is NP-hard, and existing hyperbolic
heuristics such as HyperSteiner are deterministic and often get trapped in
locally suboptimal configurations. We introduce Randomized HyperSteiner (RHS),
a stochastic Delaunay triangulation heuristic that incorporates randomness into
the expansion process and refines candidate trees via Riemannian gradient
descent optimization. Experiments on synthetic data sets and a real-world
single-cell transcriptomic data show that RHS outperforms Minimum Spanning Tree
(MST), Neighbour Joining, and vanilla HyperSteiner (HS). In near-boundary
configurations, RHS can achieve a 32% reduction in total length over HS,
demonstrating its effectiveness and robustness in diverse data regimes.

### [482] [Application of Deep Reinforcement Learning to At-the-Money S&P 500 Options Hedging](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09247)
*Zofia Bracha,Pawe≈Ç Sakowski,Jakub Micha≈Ñk√≥w*

Main category: q-fin.CP

TL;DR: The paper develops a deep reinforcement learning model for hedging S&P 500 index options and benchmarks its performance against traditional methods, showing superior results, particularly in volatile conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the use of deep reinforcement learning in developing more effective options hedging strategies that can adapt to market volatility and practical constraints.

Method: A DRL agent based on the TD3 algorithm was trained using historical intraday option prices and six predictor variables, employing walk-forward training for out-of-sample evaluation and benchmarking against Black-Scholes delta-hedging.

Result: The DRL agent outperformed traditional hedging methods, particularly in volatile or high-cost conditions, but struggled with higher risk-awareness settings. Stability improved with longer volatility estimation intervals.

Conclusion: Deep reinforcement learning provides a robust and adaptable alternative for options hedging, but requires fine-tuning of risk-related parameters for optimal performance.

Abstract: This paper explores the application of deep Q-learning to hedging
at-the-money options on the S\&P~500 index. We develop an agent based on the
Twin Delayed Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (TD3) algorithm, trained to
simulate hedging decisions without making explicit model assumptions on price
dynamics. The agent was trained on historical intraday prices of S\&P~500 call
options across years 2004--2024, using a single time series of six predictor
variables: option price, underlying asset price, moneyness, time to maturity,
realized volatility, and current hedge position. A walk-forward procedure was
applied for training, which led to nearly 17~years of out-of-sample evaluation.
The performance of the deep reinforcement learning (DRL) agent is benchmarked
against the Black--Scholes delta-hedging strategy over the same period. We
assess both approaches using metrics such as annualized return, volatility,
information ratio, and Sharpe ratio. To test the models' adaptability, we
performed simulations across varying market conditions and added constraints
such as transaction costs and risk-awareness penalties. Our results show that
the DRL agent can outperform traditional hedging methods, particularly in
volatile or high-cost environments, highlighting its robustness and flexibility
in practical trading contexts. While the agent consistently outperforms
delta-hedging, its performance deteriorates when the risk-awareness parameter
is higher. We also observed that the longer the time interval used for
volatility estimation, the more stable the results.

### [483] [A Framework for Distributed Resource Allocation in Quantum Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09371)
*Nitish K. Panigrahy,Leonardo Bacciottini,C. V. Hollot,Emily A. Van Milligen,Matheus Guedes de Andrade,Nageswara S. V. Rao,Gayane Vardoyan,Don Towsley*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: The paper proposes QPrimal-Dual, a decentralized algorithm for resource allocation in the Quantum Internet, using a utility maximization framework.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of decentralized and efficient resource allocation in the Quantum Internet for multiple applications.

Method: The authors introduce the QPrimal-Dual algorithm based on Quantum Network Utility Maximization (QNUM), decentralized control, and local state information.

Result: Simulations demonstrate that QPrimal-Dual outperforms baseline strategies, is scalable, and handles latency and decoherence effectively.

Conclusion: QPrimalDual is a promising and practical approach for fully distributed resource allocation in quantum networks.

Abstract: We introduce a distributed resource allocation framework for the Quantum
Internet that relies on feedback-based, fully decentralized coordination to
serve multiple co-existing applications. We develop quantum network control
algorithms under the mathematical framework of Quantum Network Utility
Maximization (QNUM), where utility functions quantify network performance by
mapping entanglement rate and quality into a joint optimization objective. We
then introduce QPrimal-Dual, a decentralized, scalable algorithm that solves
QNUM by strategically placing network controllers that operate using local
state information and limited classical message exchange. We prove global
asymptotic stability for concave, separable utility functions, and provide
sufficient conditions for local stability for broader non-concave cases. To
reduce control overhead and account for quantum memory decoherence, we also
propose schemes that locally approximate global quantities and prevent
congestion in the network. We evaluate the performance of our approach via
simulations in realistic quantum network architectures. Results show that
QPrimalDual significantly outperforms baseline allocation strategies, scales
with network size, and is robust to latency and decoherence. Our observations
suggest that QPrimalDual could be a practical, high-performance foundation for
fully distributed resource allocation in quantum networks.

*Vinayak Sharma,Ashish Padhy,Vijay Jagdish Karanjkar,Sourav Behera,Lord Sen,Shyamapada Mukherjee,Aviral Shrivastava*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: This paper proposes a quantum-inspired variant of Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) called QuIRK, utilizing single-qubit structures for enhancing performance and interpretability while reducing parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve the efficiency and interpretability of KANs while reducing trainable parameters, especially for periodic functions.

Method: The QuIRK model replaces B-splines in KANs with single-qubit Data Re-uploading models, leveraging GPU acceleration for tractable simulation.

Result: QuIRK matches or outperforms traditional KANs in regression problems, particularly with periodic functions, using fewer parameters.

Conclusion: QuIRK retains the interpretability, allows for closed-form solutions, and achieves superior efficiency compared to traditional KANs.

Abstract: Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks or KANs have shown the ability to outperform
classical Deep Neural Networks, while using far fewer trainable parameters for
regression problems on scientific domains. Even more powerful has been their
interpretability due to their structure being composed of univariate B-Spline
functions. This enables us to derive closed-form equations from trained KANs
for a wide range of problems. This paper introduces a quantum-inspired variant
of the KAN based on Quantum Data Re-uploading~(DR) models. The Quantum-Inspired
Re-uploading KAN or QuIRK model replaces B-Splines with single-qubit DR models
as the univariate function approximator, allowing them to match or outperform
traditional KANs while using even fewer parameters. This is especially apparent
in the case of periodic functions. Additionally, since the model utilizes only
single-qubit circuits, it remains classically tractable to simulate with
straightforward GPU acceleration. Finally, we also demonstrate that QuIRK
retains the interpretability advantages and the ability to produce closed-form
solutions.

### [485] [Three Birds with One Stone: Improving Performance, Convergence, and System Throughput with Nest](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09578)
*Yuqian Huo,David Quiroga,Anastasios Kyrillidis,Tirthak Patel*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: The paper introduces Nest, a technique to optimize variational quantum algorithms (VQAs) by dynamically varying the qubit fidelity map, achieving improved results, faster convergence, and higher system throughput.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors are addressing the challenge of balancing performance, speed, and system throughput when running variational quantum algorithms (VQAs) on near-term quantum computers.

Method: The proposed method, Nest, dynamically adjusts the fidelity levels of qubits used in VQAs over their execution. This strategy aims to optimize computations by starting with low-fidelity and transitioning to high-fidelity qubit usage.

Result: Using Nest, the authors demonstrated improved performance near optimal results, faster algorithmic convergence, and the ability to run multiple VQAs simultaneously, thus increasing throughput.

Conclusion: Dynamic adjustments to qubit fidelity maps via Nest can simultaneously optimize multiple performance metrics for VQAs, presenting a promising enhancement for quantum computing efficiency.

Abstract: Variational quantum algorithms (VQAs) have the potential to demonstrate
quantum utility on near-term quantum computers. However, these algorithms often
get executed on the highest-fidelity qubits and computers to achieve the best
performance, causing low system throughput. Recent efforts have shown that VQAs
can be run on low-fidelity qubits initially and high-fidelity qubits later on
to still achieve good performance. We take this effort forward and show that
carefully varying the qubit fidelity map of the VQA over its execution using
our technique, Nest, does not just (1) improve performance (i.e., help achieve
close to optimal results), but also (2) lead to faster convergence. We also use
Nest to co-locate multiple VQAs concurrently on the same computer, thus (3)
increasing the system throughput, and therefore, balancing and optimizing three
conflicting metrics simultaneously.

### [486] [deep-REMAP: Probabilistic Parameterization of Stellar Spectra Using Regularized Multi-Task Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09362)
*Sankalp Gilda*

Main category: astro-ph.IM

TL;DR: A novel framework, deep-REMAP, utilizes deep learning to predict stellar atmospheric parameters from spectra with high accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional spectroscopic analysis struggles to handle the growing survey data volumes, prompting the need for automated and robust methods.

Method: The study introduces deep-REMAP, a deep learning model trained on synthetic spectral data and fine-tuned using transfer learning on observed spectra. The method leverages multi-task learning and combines a regression-as-classification framework.

Result: The framework accurately predicts parameters like effective temperature and surface gravity, achieving high precision validated on calibration stars.

Conclusion: Deep-REMAP offers a scalable solution for stellar characterization, adaptable across various surveys, enhancing robustness and interpretability.

Abstract: In the era of exploding survey volumes, traditional methods of spectroscopic
analysis are being pushed to their limits. In response, we develop deep-REMAP,
a novel deep learning framework that utilizes a regularized, multi-task
approach to predict stellar atmospheric parameters from observed spectra. We
train a deep convolutional neural network on the PHOENIX synthetic spectral
library and use transfer learning to fine-tune the model on a small subset of
observed FGK dwarf spectra from the MARVELS survey. We then apply the model to
732 uncharacterized FGK giant candidates from the same survey. When validated
on 30 MARVELS calibration stars, deep-REMAP accurately recovers the effective
temperature ($T_{\rm{eff}}$), surface gravity ($\log \rm{g}$), and metallicity
([Fe/H]), achieving a precision of, for instance, approximately 75 K in
$T_{\rm{eff}}$. By combining an asymmetric loss function with an embedding
loss, our regression-as-classification framework is interpretable, robust to
parameter imbalances, and capable of capturing non-Gaussian uncertainties.
While developed for MARVELS, the deep-REMAP framework is extensible to other
surveys and synthetic libraries, demonstrating a powerful and automated pathway
for stellar characterization.

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: The SHERLOCK framework leverages large language models to enhance risk investigations in the e-commerce industry by automating workflows, improving the precision of risk localization, and enabling rapid adaptation to emerging fraud patterns.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in risk analysis caused by high workloads, the need for expert-level scrutiny, and inconsistencies in workflows among analysts within the e-commerce industry.

Method: The SHERLOCK framework includes: (1) creating a domain knowledge base (KB) from multi-modal data, (2) building an intelligent platform with iteratively fine-tuned LLMs for operational enhancements, and (3) integrating a Reflect & Refine module for quick adaptation to evolving risks.

Result: Experiments on JD.com's transaction data validate the method's improvement in both factual alignment and risk localization. The SHERLOCK framework has also improved case investigation efficiency for risk managers.

Conclusion: SHERLOCK enhances e-commerce risk management by leveraging LLMs to streamline workflows, improve analytical precision, and adapt to emerging fraud patterns, marking it as an effective solution for the shadow economy's adversarial dynamics.

Abstract: The growth of the e-commerce industry has intensified the adversarial
dynamics between shadow economy actors and risk management teams. Companies
often conduct risk investigations into suspicious cases to identify emerging
fraud patterns, thereby enhancing both preemptive risk prevention and post-hoc
governance. However, the sheer volume of case analyses imposes a substantial
workload on risk management analysts, as each case requires the integration of
long-term expert experience and meticulous scrutiny across multiple risk
dimensions. Additionally, individual disparities among analysts hinder the
establishment of uniform and high-standard workflows. To address these
challenges, we propose the SHERLOCK framework, which leverages the reasoning
capabilities of large language models (LLMs) to assist analysts in risk
investigations. Our approach consists of three primary components: (1)
extracting risk management knowledge from multi-modal data and constructing a
domain knowledge base (KB), (2) building an intelligent platform guided by the
data flywheel paradigm that integrates daily operations, expert annotations,
and model evaluations, with iteratively fine-tuning for preference alignment,
and (3) introducing a Reflect & Refine (R&R) module that collaborates with the
domain KB to establish a rapid response mechanism for evolving risk patterns.
Experiments conducted on the real-world transaction dataset from JD.com
demonstrate that our method significantly improves the precision of both
factual alignment and risk localization within the LLM analysis results.
Deployment of the SHERLOCK-based LLM system on JD.com has substantially
enhanced the efficiency of case investigation workflows for risk managers.

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: This paper evaluates the effectiveness of 'controlled personalization,' a mix of editorial and algorithmic content selection, through an A/B test on a Norwegian news website.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper explores how legacy news outlets can balance technological innovation with core editorial values while adopting personalization technologies.

Method: An A/B test was conducted on the website of a major Norwegian legacy news outlet to evaluate the effects of controlled personalization.

Result: Controlled personalization led to higher click-through rates, reduced navigation effort, greater content diversity, wider catalog coverage, and reduced popularity bias among users.

Conclusion: Controlled personalization offers a practical approach for legacy media to integrate personalization technologies while maintaining journalistic integrity and aligning user needs with editorial goals.

Abstract: Personalized news recommendations have become a standard feature of large
news aggregation services, optimizing user engagement through automated content
selection. In contrast, legacy news media often approach personalization
cautiously, striving to balance technological innovation with core editorial
values. As a result, online platforms of traditional news outlets typically
combine editorially curated content with algorithmically selected articles - a
strategy we term controlled personalization. In this industry paper, we
evaluate the effectiveness of controlled personalization through an A/B test
conducted on the website of a major Norwegian legacy news organization. Our
findings indicate that even a modest level of personalization yields
substantial benefits. Specifically, we observe that users exposed to
personalized content demonstrate higher click-through rates and reduced
navigation effort, suggesting improved discovery of relevant content. Moreover,
our analysis reveals that controlled personalization contributes to greater
content diversity and catalog coverage and in addition reduces popularity bias.
Overall, our results suggest that controlled personalization can successfully
align user needs with editorial goals, offering a viable path for legacy media
to adopt personalization technologies while upholding journalistic values.

TL;DR: ChoirRec leverages Large Language Models for semantic user grouping to improve conversion rate prediction for low-activity users in e-commerce systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address challenges in CVR prediction for low-activity users due to noisy behavioral data, data sparsity, and high-activity user bias.

Method: Introduced ChoirRec framework with semantic group generation, hierarchical representations, and dual-channel architecture for knowledge transfer.

Result: Improved GAUC by 1.16% in offline tests and order volume by 7.24% in online A/B tests on the Taobao platform.

Conclusion: ChoirRec effectively enhances CVR prediction for low-activity users, showing significant value in practical e-commerce applications.

Abstract: Accurately predicting conversion rates (CVR) for low-activity users remains a
fundamental challenge in large-scale e-commerce recommender systems.Existing
approaches face three critical limitations: (i) reliance on noisy and
unreliable behavioral signals; (ii) insufficient user-level information due to
the lack of diverse interaction data; and (iii) a systemic training bias toward
high-activity users that overshadows the needs of low-activity users.To address
these challenges, we propose ChoirRec, a novel framework that leverages the
semantic capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) to construct semantic
user groups and enhance CVR prediction for low-activity users.With a
dual-channel architecture designed for robust cross-user knowledge transfer,
ChoirRec comprises three components: (i) a Semantic Group Generation module
that utilizes LLMs to form reliable, cross-activity user clusters, thereby
filtering out noisy signals; (ii) a Group-aware Hierarchical Representation
module that enriches sparse user embeddings with informative group-level priors
to mitigate data insufficiency; and (iii) a Group-aware Multi-granularity
Modual that employs a dual-channel architecture and adaptive fusion mechanism
to ensure effective learning and utilization of group knowledge. We conduct
extensive offline and online experiments on Taobao, a leading industrial-scale
e-commerce platform.ChoirRec improves GAUC by 1.16\% in offline evaluations,
while online A/B testing reveals a 7.24\% increase in order volume,
highlighting its substantial practical value in real-world applications.

*X. Jiang,J. Qiu,K. Gustavsson,B. Mehlig,L. Zhao*

Main category: physics.flu-dyn

TL;DR: Compact artificial gliders can navigate fluid environments by dynamically adjusting their center of mass, utilizing strategies optimized via numerical simulations and reinforcement learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable artificial gliders to navigate precisely through fluid environments by understanding their interaction with the surrounding fluid and optimizing their dispersal.

Method: The study employs direct numerical simulations (DNS) and reinforcement learning to identify optimal navigation strategies for varying particle Reynolds numbers.

Result: Two navigation strategies are identified based on fluid interaction: tumbling with inertial forces at large Reynolds numbers and steady inclined orientation generating viscous forces at small Reynolds numbers.

Conclusion: The efficacy of navigation strategies depends significantly on Reynolds numbers, with inertial forces enabling larger horizontal travel distances and viscous forces limiting them.

Abstract: Artificial gliders are designed to disperse as they settle through a fluid,
requiring precise navigation to reach target locations. We show that a compact
glider settling in a viscous fluid can navigate by dynamically adjusting its
centre-of-mass. Using fully resolved direct numerical simulations (DNS) and
reinforcement learning, we find two optimal navigation strategies that allow
the glider to reach its target location accurately. These strategies depend
sensitively on how the glider interacts with the surrounding fluid. The nature
of this interaction changes as the particle Reynolds number Re$_p$ changes. Our
results explain how the optimal strategy depends on Re$_p$. At large Re$_p$,
the glider learns to tumble rapidly by moving its centre-of-mass as its
orientation changes. This generates a large horizontal inertial lift force,
which allows the glider to travel far. At small Re$_p$, by contrast, high
viscosity hinders tumbling. In this case, the glider learns to adjust its
centre-of-mass so that it settles with a steady, inclined orientation that
results in a horizontal viscous force. The horizontal range is much smaller
than for large Re$_p$, because this viscous force is much smaller than the
inertial lift force at large Re$_p$.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a robust precoding method for FDD systems using a VQ-VAE and GNN in an end-to-end fashion, outperforming conventional approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the drawbacks of Gaussian mixture models (GMMs) in scaling with increased feedback bits for site-specific precoding in FDD systems.

Method: Utilization of a vector quantized-variational autoencoder (VQ-VAE) to replace GMMs, alongside joint training with a graph neural network (GNN) and pilot optimization in an end-to-end model.

Result: The proposed framework demonstrably outperforms conventional methods in terms of sum rate gains, enabling systems with fewer pilots or feedback bits.

Conclusion: The integration of VQ-VAE and GNN in site-specific precoding for FDD systems leads to significant performance improvements and efficient system deployment.

Abstract: Robust precoding is efficiently feasible in frequency division duplex (FDD)
systems by incorporating the learnt statistics of the propagation environment
through a generative model. We build on previous work that successfully
designed site-specific precoders based on a combination of Gaussian mixture
models (GMMs) and graph neural networks (GNNs). In this paper, by utilizing a
vector quantized-variational autoencoder (VQ-VAE), we circumvent one of the key
drawbacks of GMMs, i.e., the number of GMM components scales exponentially to
the feedback bits. In addition, the deep learning architecture of the VQ-VAE
allows us to jointly train the GNN together with VQ-VAE along with pilot
optimization forming an end-to-end (E2E) model, resulting in considerable
performance gains in sum rate for multi-user wireless systems. Simulations
demonstrate the superiority of the proposed frameworks over the conventional
methods involving the sub-discrete Fourier transform (DFT) pilot matrix and
iterative precoder algorithms enabling the deployment of systems characterized
by fewer pilots or feedback bits.

TL;DR: This paper proposes a data augmentation method using synthetic data generation to improve neural network training and prediction accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenge of improving neural network training accuracy, particularly in forecasting and modeling dynamic systems like pandemics.

Method: Combine a compartmental model with uncertainty to generate synthetic data, calibrate using available data, and integrate with Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) and Nonlinear Autoregressive (NAR) models.

Result: Numerical simulations show that NAR models excel in short-term forecasting with high accuracy, while PINNs capture long-term system behaviors qualitatively.

Conclusion: The approach improves predictive performance and highlights trade-offs between NAR's short-term accuracy and PINNs' long-term trend analysis, validated through COVID-19 pandemic data in Lombardy, Italy.

Abstract: In this work, we propose a data augmentation strategy aimed at improving the
training phase of neural networks and, consequently, the accuracy of their
predictions. Our approach relies on generating synthetic data through a
suitable compartmental model combined with the incorporation of uncertainty.
The available data are then used to calibrate the model, which is further
integrated with deep learning techniques to produce additional synthetic data
for training. The results show that neural networks trained on these augmented
datasets exhibit significantly improved predictive performance. We focus in
particular on two different neural network architectures: Physics-Informed
Neural Networks (PINNs) and Nonlinear Autoregressive (NAR) models. The NAR
approach proves especially effective for short-term forecasting, providing
accurate quantitative estimates by directly learning the dynamics from data and
avoiding the additional computational cost of embedding physical constraints
into the training. In contrast, PINNs yield less accurate quantitative
predictions but capture the qualitative long-term behavior of the system,
making them more suitable for exploring broader dynamical trends. Numerical
simulations of the second phase of the COVID-19 pandemic in the Lombardy region
(Italy) validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

tools affecting research outcomes. To address these challenges, we present
PyNoetic, a modular BCI framework designed to cater to the diverse needs of BCI
research. PyNoetic is one of the very few frameworks in Python that encompasses
the entire BCI design pipeline, from stimulus presentation and data acquisition
to channel selection, filtering, feature extraction, artifact removal, and
finally simulation and visualization. Notably, PyNoetic introduces an intuitive
and end-to-end GUI coupled with a unique pick-and-place configurable flowchart
for no-code BCI design, making it accessible to researchers with minimal
programming experience. For advanced users, it facilitates the seamless
integration of custom functionalities and novel algorithms with minimal coding,
ensuring adaptability at each design stage. PyNoetic also includes a rich array
of analytical tools such as machine learning models, brain-connectivity
indices, systematic testing functionalities via simulation, and evaluation
methods of novel paradigms. PyNoetic's strengths lie in its versatility for
both offline and real-time BCI development, which streamlines the design

TL;DR: The study converts phylogenetic trees of Mycobacterium tuberculosis into graph structures analyzable by neural networks to detect adaptive mutations linked to drug resistance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The goal is to improve genomic surveillance and identify adaptive mutations in Mycobacterium tuberculosis, which have implications for drug resistance and disease evolution.

Method: The authors use a graph attention network (GAT) to analyze phylogenetic relationships and SNP data, transforming phylogenetic trees into graphs where evolutionary proximity is emphasized.

Result: The model achieved 88% accuracy and identified adaptive signals in 41 uncertain variants across multiple M. tuberculosis lineages.

Conclusion: Attention-based neural networks prove to be effective tools for evolutionary and genomic surveillance to detect adaptive mutations in pathogens.

Abstract: Positive selection drives the emergence of adaptive mutations in
Mycobacterium tuberculosis, shaping drug resistance, transmissibility, and
virulence. Phylogenetic trees capture evolutionary relationships among isolates
and provide a natural framework for detecting such adaptive signals. We present
a phylogeny-guided graph attention network (GAT) approach, introducing a method
for converting SNP-annotated phylogenetic trees into graph structures suitable
for neural network analysis. Using 500 M. tuberculosis isolates from four major
lineages and 249 single-nucleotide variants (84 resistance-associated and 165
neutral) across 61 drug-resistance genes, we constructed graphs where nodes
represented isolates and edges reflected phylogenetic distances. Edges between
isolates separated by more than seven internal nodes were pruned to emphasise
local evolutionary structure. Node features encoded SNP presence or absence,
and the GAT architecture included two attention layers, a residual connection,
global attention pooling, and a multilayer perceptron classifier. The model
achieved an accuracy of 0.88 on a held-out test set and, when applied to 146
WHO-classified "uncertain" variants, identified 41 candidates with convergent
emergence across multiple lineages, consistent with adaptive evolution. This
work demonstrates the feasibility of transforming phylogenies into
GNN-compatible structures and highlights attention-based models as effective
tools for detecting positive selection, aiding genomic surveillance and variant
prioritisation.

Method: The approach employs supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning, introducing innovations like skeleton-completeness scoring, latency-aware rewards, and self-distillation to balance reasoning and efficiency.

Result: HES-SQL achieves 79.14% and 54.9% execution accuracy on the BIRD and KaggleDBQA benchmarks, respectively, with efficiency gains of 11% to 20% over supervised baselines.

Conclusion: HES-SQL sets a new standard for Text-to-SQL systems by effectively combining semantic accuracy and efficiency, with applications to broader structured generation tasks.

Abstract: We present HES-SQL, a novel hybrid training framework that advances
Text-to-SQL generation through the integration of thinking-mode-fused
supervised fine-tuning (SFT) with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO).
Our approach introduces three key innovations: (1) a skeleton-completeness
scoring mechanism that enhances preference alignment between generated queries
and optimal SQL structures; (2) a query-latency-aware reward system that
incentivizes the generation of computationally efficient SQL queries; (3) a
self-distillation process for thinking-mode completion that prevents
degradation of the model's reasoning capabilities. This framework enables
hybrid thinking models to switch between reasoning and non-reasoning modes
while improving SQL query accuracy and execution efficiency.
  Experimental evaluation, conducted on MySQL 8.0 and SQLite 3.42 under
controlled single-user conditions, demonstrates that HES-SQL achieves
competitive performance with execution accuracies of 79.14\% and 54.9\% on the
BIRD and KaggleDBQA benchmarks, respectively. Query latency is measured as the
end-to-end execution time of generated queries on the DBMS, averaged over
multiple runs to mitigate variance. Efficiency gains range from 11\% to 20\%
relative to supervised baselines. Our results establish a new paradigm for
Text-to-SQL systems that effectively balances semantic accuracy with
computational efficiency through execution-informed reinforcement learning
(RL). The proposed methodology has significant implications for developing
robust natural language interfaces to databases and can be extended to broader
structured generation tasks requiring both correctness and efficiency
optimization.

### [497] [Interlaced dynamic XCT reconstruction with spatio-temporal implicit neural representations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08641)
*Mathias Boulanger,Ericmoore Jossou*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: This paper proposes a method combining implicit neural representations (INRs) and ADMM-based optimization for dynamic X-ray CT reconstruction under interlaced acquisition schemes, achieving superior performance compared to the TIMBIR method.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The goal is to improve dynamic X-ray computed tomography (XCT) reconstruction, particularly under challenging scenarios such as global undersampling, spatial complexity, noise levels, and detector non-idealities.

Method: The method uses spatio-temporal implicit neural representations (INRs) integrated with ADMM optimization and INCODE, a conditioning framework with prior knowledge. Explicit noise modeling and modularity are incorporated for handling artifacts and enabling parallelized 4D volumetric reconstruction.

Result: The proposed model outperforms the state-of-the-art TIMBIR in both robustness to noise and handling noise through weighted least squares data fidelity. It also adapts to detector non-idealities and supports 4D reconstruction optimization.

Conclusion: The study highlights the efficiency and adaptability of the proposed framework, which not only outpaces existing methods but also showcases scalability by enabling massive parallelization for handling large datasets.

Abstract: In this work, we investigate the use of spatio-temporalImplicit Neural
Representations (INRs) for dynamic X-ray computed tomography (XCT)
reconstruction under interlaced acquisition schemes. The proposed approach
combines ADMM-based optimization with INCODE, a conditioning framework
incorporating prior knowledge, to enable efficient convergence. We evaluate our
method under diverse acquisition scenarios, varying the severity of global
undersampling, spatial complexity (quantified via spatial information), and
noise levels. Across all settings, our model achieves strong performance and
outperforms Time-Interlaced Model-Based Iterative Reconstruction (TIMBIR), a
state-of-the-art model-based iterative method. In particular, we show that the
inductive bias of the INR provides good robustness to moderate noise levels,
and that introducing explicit noise modeling through a weighted least squares
data fidelity term significantly improves performance in more challenging
regimes. The final part of this work explores extensions toward a practical
reconstruction framework. We demonstrate the modularity of our approach by
explicitly modeling detector non-idealities, incorporating ring artifact
correction directly within the reconstruction process. Additionally, we present
a proof-of-concept 4D volumetric reconstruction by jointly optimizing over
batched axial slices, an approach which opens up the possibilities for massive
parallelization, a critical feature for processing large-scale datasets.

### [498] [Progressive Uncertainty-Guided Evidential U-KAN for Trustworthy Medical Image Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08949)
*Zhen Yang,Yansong Ma,Lei Chen*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: This paper introduces a novel method, Evidential U-KAN, for trustworthy medical image segmentation, employing progressive evidence uncertainty guided attention (PEUA) for enhanced focus on challenging regions and semantic-preserving evidence learning (SAEL) to maintain semantic fidelity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance accuracy and reliability in medical image segmentation, addressing limitations in existing evidence deep learning (EDL) methods, particularly in refining ambiguous boundary segmentation and preserving critical semantics.

Method: The paper proposes PEUA for progressive attention refinement using uncertainty maps and low-rank learning for noise reduction. It also introduces SAEL to integrate a semantic-smooth evidence generator and fidelity-enhancing regularization for robust semantic preservation.

Result: The proposed Evidential U-KAN demonstrates superior accuracy and reliability in medical image segmentation, surpassing competing methods in experiments conducted on four datasets.

Conclusion: Incorporating PEUA and SAEL into U-KAN enhances its capability for accurate and trustworthy segmentation, presenting a significant improvement over standard EDL approaches in ambiguous and challenging regions.

Abstract: Trustworthy medical image segmentation aims at deliver accurate and reliable
results for clinical decision-making. Most existing methods adopt the evidence
deep learning (EDL) paradigm due to its computational efficiency and
theoretical robustness. However, the EDL-based methods often neglect leveraging
uncertainty maps rich in attention cues to refine ambiguous boundary
segmentation. To address this, we propose a progressive evidence uncertainty
guided attention (PEUA) mechanism to guide the model to focus on the feature
representation learning of hard regions. Unlike conventional approaches, PEUA
progressively refines attention using uncertainty maps while employing low-rank
learning to denoise attention weights, enhancing feature learning for
challenging regions. Concurrently, standard EDL methods suppress evidence of
incorrect class indiscriminately via Kullback-Leibler (KL) regularization,
impairing the uncertainty assessment in ambiguous areas and consequently
distorts the corresponding attention guidance. We thus introduce a
semantic-preserving evidence learning (SAEL) strategy, integrating a
semantic-smooth evidence generator and a fidelity-enhancing regularization term
to retain critical semantics. Finally, by embedding PEUA and SAEL with the
state-of-the-art U-KAN, we proposes Evidential U-KAN, a novel solution for
trustworthy medical image segmentation. Extensive experiments on 4 datasets
demonstrate superior accuracy and reliability over the competing methods. The

*Yingtie Lei,Zimeng Li,Chi-Man Pun,Yupeng Liu,Xuhang Chen*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: This paper proposes FS-RWKV, a novel framework for synthesizing high-quality 7T MRI images from 3T acquisitions, improving anatomical detail preservation and global tissue contrast.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The limited availability and high cost of 7T MRI scanners restrict their clinical use, necessitating a computational approach to synthesize 7T-quality images from widely available 3T scans.

Method: FS-RWKV employs an RWKV-based framework incorporating Frequency-Spatial Omnidirectional Shift and Structural Fidelity Enhancement Block for global contextual representation and anatomical structure reinforcement.

Result: Experiments on UNC and BNU datasets demonstrated that FS-RWKV outperforms existing image synthesis methods, achieving better perceptual quality and anatomical fidelity.

Conclusion: FS-RWKV efficiently bridges the gap between 3T and 7T MRI by leveraging innovative frequency-aware components, making it a potential solution to increase 7T-level MRI accessibility.

Abstract: Ultra-high-field 7T MRI offers enhanced spatial resolution and tissue
contrast that enables the detection of subtle pathological changes in
neurological disorders. However, the limited availability of 7T scanners
restricts widespread clinical adoption due to substantial infrastructure costs
and technical demands. Computational approaches for synthesizing 7T-quality
images from accessible 3T acquisitions present a viable solution to this
accessibility challenge. Existing CNN approaches suffer from limited spatial
coverage, while Transformer models demand excessive computational overhead.
RWKV architectures offer an efficient alternative for global feature modeling
in medical image synthesis, combining linear computational complexity with
strong long-range dependency capture. Building on this foundation, we propose
Frequency Spatial-RWKV (FS-RWKV), an RWKV-based framework for 3T-to-7T MRI
translation. To better address the challenges of anatomical detail preservation
and global tissue contrast recovery, FS-RWKV incorporates two key modules: (1)
Frequency-Spatial Omnidirectional Shift (FSO-Shift), which performs discrete
wavelet decomposition followed by omnidirectional spatial shifting on the
low-frequency branch to enhance global contextual representation while
preserving high-frequency anatomical details; and (2) Structural Fidelity
Enhancement Block (SFEB), a module that adaptively reinforces anatomical
structure through frequency-aware feature fusion. Comprehensive experiments on
UNC and BNU datasets demonstrate that FS-RWKV consistently outperforms existing
CNN-, Transformer-, GAN-, and RWKV-based baselines across both T1w and T2w
modalities, achieving superior anatomical fidelity and perceptual quality.

*Yeqing Yang,Le Xu,Lixia Tian*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: SAM2-3dMed adapts the Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM2) for accurate segmentation of 3D medical images by addressing domain gaps like anatomical continuity and boundary delineation. It significantly improves performance on medical segmentation datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper seeks to address limitations in applying SAM2, designed for video object segmentation, directly to 3D medical images, which differ in anatomical continuity and boundary precision demands.

Method: Two key modules are introduced: Slice Relative Position Prediction (SRPP) for modeling bidirectional inter-slice dependencies and Boundary Detection (BD) for improving segmentation accuracy at critical boundaries.

Result: SAM2-3dMed achieved superior segmentation overlap and boundary precision compared to state-of-the-art methods on medical image datasets (Lung, Spleen, Pancreas from MSD).

Conclusion: SAM2-3dMed not only enhances segmentation performance in 3D medical imaging but also establishes a paradigm for adapting video foundation models to spatial volumetric data.

Abstract: Accurate segmentation of 3D medical images is critical for clinical
applications like disease assessment and treatment planning. While the Segment
Anything Model 2 (SAM2) has shown remarkable success in video object
segmentation by leveraging temporal cues, its direct application to 3D medical
images faces two fundamental domain gaps: 1) the bidirectional anatomical
continuity between slices contrasts sharply with the unidirectional temporal
flow in videos, and 2) precise boundary delineation, crucial for morphological
analysis, is often underexplored in video tasks. To bridge these gaps, we
propose SAM2-3dMed, an adaptation of SAM2 for 3D medical imaging. Our framework
introduces two key innovations: 1) a Slice Relative Position Prediction (SRPP)
module explicitly models bidirectional inter-slice dependencies by guiding SAM2
to predict the relative positions of different slices in a self-supervised
manner; 2) a Boundary Detection (BD) module enhances segmentation accuracy
along critical organ and tissue boundaries. Extensive experiments on three
diverse medical datasets (the Lung, Spleen, and Pancreas in the Medical
Segmentation Decathlon (MSD) dataset) demonstrate that SAM2-3dMed significantly
outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving superior performance in
segmentation overlap and boundary precision. Our approach not only advances 3D
medical image segmentation performance but also offers a general paradigm for
adapting video-centric foundation models to spatial volumetric data.

*Alemu Sisay Nigru,Michele Svanera,Austin Dibble,Connor Dalby,Mattia Savardi,Sergio Benini*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: This paper proposes LODi, a novel framework that improves infant brain MRI segmentation by leveraging adult brain MRI segmentation models using transfer learning, domain adaptation, and weakly supervised learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address the challenges of accurately segmenting infant brain MRI images caused by evolving anatomy, motion artifacts, and lack of labeled data.

Method: LODi adapts an adult brain segmentation model to infant brain scans using transfer learning, domain adaptation, and weakly supervised learning. A hierarchical feature refinement and multi-level consistency approach is applied to enhance performance.

Result: LODi significantly outperforms traditional supervised learning and domain-specific models on both internal and external datasets, demonstrating its effectiveness and generalizability.

Conclusion: The research showcases the benefits of using adult brain priors to enable more accurate, scalable, and generalizable brain MRI segmentation for infants, with potential applications spanning the entire lifespan.

Abstract: Accurate segmentation of infant brain MRI is critical for studying early
neurodevelopment and diagnosing neurological disorders. Yet, it remains a
fundamental challenge due to continuously evolving anatomy of the subjects,
motion artifacts, and the scarcity of high-quality labeled data. In this work,
we present LODi, a novel framework that utilizes prior knowledge from an adult
brain MRI segmentation model to enhance the segmentation performance of infant
scans. Given the abundance of publicly available adult brain MRI data, we
pre-train a segmentation model on a large adult dataset as a starting point.
Through transfer learning and domain adaptation strategies, we progressively
adapt the model to the 0-2 year-old population, enabling it to account for the
anatomical and imaging variability typical of infant scans. The adaptation of
the adult model is carried out using weakly supervised learning on infant brain
scans, leveraging silver-standard ground truth labels obtained with FreeSurfer.
By introducing a novel training strategy that integrates hierarchical feature
refinement and multi-level consistency constraints, our method enables fast,
accurate, age-adaptive segmentation, while mitigating scanner and site-specific
biases. Extensive experiments on both internal and external datasets
demonstrate the superiority of our approach over traditional supervised
learning and domain-specific models. Our findings highlight the advantage of
leveraging adult brain priors as a foundation for age-flexible neuroimaging
analysis, paving the way for more reliable and generalizable brain MRI
segmentation across the lifespan.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the need for accurate and realistic MRI inpainting for various clinical and research purposes.

Method: A generative latent diffusion model is built to conditionally synthesize 3D MRIs based on tissue segmentations and adjustable tumor concentrations, enabling both tumor synthesis and healthy tissue restoration.

Result: The model achieves PSNR scores of 18.5 for healthy tissue inpainting and 17.4 for tumor inpainting, demonstrating its effectiveness in generating anatomically accurate 3D MRI data.

Conclusion: The proposed model offers a novel and effective approach for MRI inpainting tasks, with applications in synthesizing tumor-affected and healthy brain images.

Abstract: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) inpainting supports numerous clinical and
research applications. We introduce the first generative model that conditions
on voxel-level, continuous tumor concentrations to synthesize high-fidelity
brain tumor MRIs. For the BraTS 2025 Inpainting Challenge, we adapt this
architecture to the complementary task of healthy tissue restoration by setting
the tumor concentrations to zero. Our latent diffusion model conditioned on
both tissue segmentations and the tumor concentrations generates 3D spatially
coherent and anatomically consistent images for both tumor synthesis and
healthy tissue inpainting. For healthy inpainting, we achieve a PSNR of 18.5,
and for tumor inpainting, we achieve 17.4. Our code is available at:

Main category: q-fin.GN

TL;DR: The paper uses Graph Neural Networks on SME loan data to predict defaults by analyzing interconnected firm networks, improving risk assessment and revealing contagion effects.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SMEs are key to economic growth but face challenges in accessing credit. Accurate risk assessments are needed to address issues amplified by interlinked firm networks.

Method: Leverages Graph Neural Networks and multilayer network data based on ownership and financial transactions, combined with traditional data to predict SME credit default.

Result: Improved predictive performance for credit scoring and insights into contagion risk in SME networks, including directional and intensity-driven contagion analysis.

Conclusion: Network data enhances understanding of SME credit risk and highlights risk propagation via supply chain networks, with implications for lenders.

Abstract: Small and Medium-sized Enterprises (SMEs) are known to play a vital role in
economic growth, employment, and innovation. However, they tend to face
significant challenges in accessing credit due to limited financial histories,
collateral constraints, and exposure to macroeconomic shocks. These challenges
make an accurate credit risk assessment by lenders crucial, particularly since
SMEs frequently operate within interconnected firm networks through which
default risk can propagate. This paper presents and tests a novel approach for
modelling the risk of SME credit, using a unique large data set of SME loans
provided by a prominent financial institution. Specifically, our approach
employs Graph Neural Networks to predict SME default using multilayer network
data derived from common ownership and financial transactions between firms. We
show that combining this information with traditional structured data not only
improves application scoring performance, but also explicitly models contagion
risk between companies. Further analysis shows how the directionality and
intensity of these connections influence financial risk contagion, offering a
deeper understanding of the underlying processes. Our findings highlight the
predictive power of network data, as well as the role of supply chain networks
in exposing SMEs to correlated default risk.

*Rogier P. Krijnen,Akshay Joshi,Siddhant Kumar,Mathias Peirlinck*

Main category: q-bio.TO

TL;DR: The paper introduces a method for estimating the behavior of highly nonlinear, orthotropic materials using a single biaxial stretch test, reducing the need for multiple samples and manipulations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address challenges in traditional tissue testing, such as reliance on multiple tests and associated drawbacks like sample variability and manipulation-induced damage.

Method: The authors adapted EUCLID, an unsupervised method, to a Bayesian inference-based approach for parameter identification and applied it to synthetic myocardial tissue slabs using 3D continuum elements.

Result: The method demonstrated good agreement with ground-truth simulations and was robust against varying noise levels, effectively identifying parameters with credible intervals.

Conclusion: The study underscores the potential for characterizing complex material models with reduced experimental requirements, highlighting the efficiency of using a single biaxial test coupled with uncertainty quantification.

Abstract: Fully capturing this behavior in traditional homogenized tissue testing
requires the excitation of multiple deformation modes, i.e. combined triaxial
shear tests and biaxial stretch tests. Inherently, such multimodal experimental
protocols necessitate multiple tissue samples and extensive sample
manipulations. Intrinsic inter-sample variability and manipulation-induced
tissue damage might have an adverse effect on the inversely identified tissue
behavior. In this work, we aim to overcome this gap by focusing our attention
to the use of heterogeneous deformation profiles in a parameter estimation
problem. More specifically, we adapt EUCLID, an unsupervised method for the
automated discovery of constitutive models, towards the purpose of parameter
identification for highly nonlinear, orthotropic constitutive models using a
Bayesian inference approach and three-dimensional continuum elements. We
showcase its strength to quantitatively infer, with varying noise levels, the
material model parameters of synthetic myocardial tissue slabs from a single
heterogeneous biaxial stretch test. This method shows good agreement with the
ground-truth simulations and with corresponding credibility intervals. Our work
highlights the potential for characterizing highly nonlinear and orthotropic
material models from a single biaxial stretch test with uncertainty
quantification.

Main category: cs.ET

TL;DR: The paper introduces a semantic routing system to optimize reasoning application in LLMs, improving accuracy while reducing latency and token usage.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large Language Models face inefficiency in reasoning tasks, leading to unnecessary resources and environmental costs for prompts that do not require complex reasoning.

Method: The study proposes a semantic router to classify queries based on reasoning needs and selectively apply reasoning only where beneficial.

Result: Semantic routing led to a 10.2 percentage point accuracy improvement on the MMLU-Pro benchmark, along with reductions of 47.1% in response latency and 48.5% in token usage.

Conclusion: The research demonstrates that semantic routing effectively balances accuracy and efficiency in LLM systems, addressing environmental and financial concerns.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate substantial accuracy gains when
augmented with reasoning modes such as chain-of-thought and inference-time
scaling. However, reasoning also incurs significant costs in inference latency
and token usage, with environmental and financial impacts, which are
unnecessary for many simple prompts. We present a semantic router that
classifies queries based on their reasoning requirements and selectively
applies reasoning only when beneficial. Our approach achieves a 10.2 percentage
point improvement in accuracy on the MMLU-Pro benchmark while reducing response
latency by 47.1% and token consumption by 48.5% compared to direct inference
with vLLM. These results demonstrate that semantic routing offers an effective
mechanism for striking a balance between accuracy and efficiency in open-source
LLM serving systems

TL;DR: The paper presents AIMS, an AI-enhanced virtual simulation for interprofessional education, aiming to improve collaborative clinical reasoning and health promotion among healthcare students.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional interprofessional education techniques struggle with scalability, cost, and mimicking real-world clinical complexities.

Method: AIMS integrates a Unity-based virtual environment, large language model (Gemini-2.5-Flash), and character creation tools for synchronized multimodal interactions. Usability testing was conducted where participants role-played healthcare professionals.

Result: The simulation allowed realistic, profession-specific conversations about patient care, though some usability challenges like audio routing and latency were identified.

Conclusion: AIMS showed promise in enhancing healthcare team training, with improvements planned to tackle technical issues and broaden pedagogical applications.

Abstract: Interprofessional education has long relied on case studies and the use of
standardized patients to support teamwork, communication, and related
collaborative competencies among healthcare professionals. However, traditional
approaches are often limited by cost, scalability, and inability to mimic the
dynamic complexity of real-world clinical scenarios. To address these
challenges, we designed and developed AIMS (AI-Enhanced Immersive
Multidisciplinary Simulations), a virtual simulation that integrates a large
language model (Gemini-2.5-Flash), a Unity-based virtual environment engine,
and a character creation pipeline to support synchronized, multimodal
interactions between the user and the virtual patient. AIMS was designed to
enhance collaborative clinical reasoning and health promotion competencies
among students from pharmacy, medicine, nursing, and social work. A formal
usability testing session was conducted which participants assumed professional
roles on a healthcare team and engaged in a mix of scripted and unscripted
conversations. Participants explored the patient's symptoms, social context,
and care needs. Usability issues were identified (e.g., audio routing, response
latency) and used to guide subsequent refinements. Findings in general suggest
that AIMS supports realistic, profession-specific and contextually appropriate
conversations. We discussed both technical and pedagogical innovations of AIMS
and concluded with future directions.

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: This study explores how visual and auditory cues on a tablet evoke pseudo-haptic sensations, impacting tactile forces measured during interactions with different terrains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate how consumer-grade devices can produce pseudo-haptic sensations for applications such as rehabilitation tools, training simulators, and assistive interfaces.

Method: Participants interacted with a Unity-based Rollball game on a tablet, guiding a virtual ball over different textured terrains with varying auditory and visual cues while tactile forces were measured using a force-torque sensor.

Result: Tactile forces increased systematically with the intensity of visual and auditory cues, confirming that higher audio frequencies and denser visual textures elicit stronger pseudo-haptic feedback.

Conclusion: Pseudo-haptic feedback can be reliably induced and measured using affordable devices, highlighting their potential in creating cost-effective haptic experiences for various applications.

Abstract: Pseudo-haptics exploit carefully crafted visual or auditory cues to trick the
brain into "feeling" forces that are never physically applied, offering a
low-cost alternative to traditional haptic hardware. Here, we present a
comparative psychophysical study that quantifies how visual and auditory
stimuli combine to evoke pseudo-haptic pressure sensations on a commodity
tablet. Using a Unity-based Rollball game, participants (n = 4) guided a
virtual ball across three textured terrains while their finger forces were
captured in real time with a Robotous RFT40 force-torque sensor. Each terrain
was paired with a distinct rolling-sound profile spanning 440 Hz - 4.7 kHz, 440
Hz - 13.1 kHz, or 440 Hz - 8.9 kHz; crevice collisions triggered additional
"knocking" bursts to heighten realism. Average tactile forces increased
systematically with cue intensity: 0.40 N, 0.79 N and 0.88 N for visual-only
trials and 0.41 N, 0.81 N and 0.90 N for audio-only trials on Terrains 1-3,
respectively. Higher audio frequencies and denser visual textures both elicited
stronger muscle activation, and their combination further reduced the force
needed to perceive surface changes, confirming multisensory integration. These
results demonstrate that consumer-grade isometric devices can reliably induce
and measure graded pseudo-haptic feedback without specialized actuators,
opening a path toward affordable rehabilitation tools, training simulators and
assistive interfaces.

TL;DR: The paper investigates the potential of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) in mimicking human preferences for user interface (UI) evaluations, highlighting their strengths and limitations in UX research.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional early UI design and user research are limited by resource constraints. The authors aim to explore whether MLLMs can function as evaluators to streamline the design process in the early stages, saving resources and effort.

Method: The authors benchmark GPT-4o, Claude, and Llama across 30 interfaces using data from a crowdsourcing platform. They measure MLLM alignment with human judgments across multiple UI evaluation dimensions.

Result: MLLMs can approximate human preferences on certain UI evaluation factors but show divergence in others. This suggests mixed reliability and scope for improvement.

Conclusion: MLLMs show promise for supplementing early-stage UX research but are not universally reliable across all dimensions; further refinement is needed to maximize their utility.

Abstract: In an ideal design pipeline, user interface (UI) design is intertwined with
user research to validate decisions, yet studies are often resource-constrained
during early exploration. Recent advances in multimodal large language models
(MLLMs) offer a promising opportunity to act as early evaluators, helping
designers narrow options before formal testing. Unlike prior work that
emphasizes user behavior in narrow domains such as e-commerce with metrics like
clicks or conversions, we focus on subjective user evaluations across varied
interfaces. We investigate whether MLLMs can mimic human preferences when
evaluating individual UIs and comparing them. Using data from a crowdsourcing
platform, we benchmark GPT-4o, Claude, and Llama across 30 interfaces and
examine alignment with human judgments on multiple UI factors. Our results show
that MLLMs approximate human preferences on some dimensions but diverge on
others, underscoring both their potential and limitations in supplementing
early UX research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the persistent gap between user-perceived interests and system-inferred interests, and to create an interpretable and user-modifiable recommendation framework.

Method: An eight-week online field study involving 1775 active users of a movie recommender system, with editable profiles to inspect and modify personalized interest summaries.

Result: Users identified significant discrepancies between their opinions and system conclusions, and actively engaged with the profiles to reflect on their preferences.

Conclusion: Editable user profiles foster transparency and trust in recommender systems but require further refinement to better align system and user interests.

Abstract: Natural language-based user profiles in recommender systems have been
explored for their interpretability and potential to help users scrutinize and
refine their interests, thereby improving recommendation quality. Building on
this foundation, we introduce a human-AI collaborative profile for a movie
recommender system that presents editable personalized interest summaries of a
user's movie history. Unlike static profiles, this design invites users to
directly inspect, modify, and reflect on the system's inferences. In an
eight-week online field deployment with 1775 active movie recommender users, we
find persistent gaps between user-perceived and system-inferred interests, show
how the profile encourages engagement and reflection, and identify design
directions for leveraging imperfect AI-powered user profiles to stimulate more
user intervention and build more transparent and trustworthy recommender
experiences.

Motivation: To address challenges in motor imagery EEG decoding, such as non-stationary noise and low accuracy in challenging subjects, by introducing RDWT as a preprocessing method tailored to enhance deep learning classifier performance.

Method: Conducting a systematic paired comparison (with and without RDWT) across four deep learning architectures (EEGNet, ShallowConvNet, MBEEG\_SENet, EEGTCNet) on three benchmark datasets (High Gamma, BCI-IV-2a, BCI-IV-2b), analyzing performance in terms of accuracy and Cohen's kappa.

Result: RDWT consistently improves performance across datasets. Significant gains are seen, particularly in challenging recordings. For instance, EEGTCNet and MBEEG\_SENet showed the highest gains in BCI-IV-2a (+4.44 pp and +2.23 pp, respectively).

Conclusion: RDWT is an effective, low-overhead preprocessing technique that enhances rhythm-specific features and reduces noise, leading to better EEG decoding accuracy and kappa scores, particularly for difficult sessions and advanced deep learning models.

Abstract: The present study investigates the impact of the Rational Discrete Wavelet
Transform (RDWT), used as a plug-in preprocessing step for motor imagery
electroencephalographic (EEG) decoding prior to applying deep learning
classifiers. A systematic paired evaluation (with/without RDWT) is conducted on
four state-of-the-art deep learning architectures: EEGNet, ShallowConvNet,
MBEEG\_SENet, and EEGTCNet. This evaluation was carried out across three
benchmark datasets: High Gamma, BCI-IV-2a, and BCI-IV-2b. The performance of
the RDWT is reported with subject-wise averages using accuracy and Cohen's
kappa, complemented by subject-level analyses to identify when RDWT is
beneficial. On BCI-IV-2a, RDWT yields clear average gains for EEGTCNet (+4.44
percentage points, pp; kappa +0.059) and MBEEG\_SENet (+2.23 pp; +0.030), with
smaller improvements for EEGNet (+2.08 pp; +0.027) and ShallowConvNet (+0.58
pp; +0.008). On BCI-IV-2b, the enhancements observed are modest yet consistent
for EEGNet (+0.21 pp; +0.044) and EEGTCNet (+0.28 pp; +0.077). On HGD, average
effects are modest to positive, with the most significant gain observed for
MBEEG\_SENet (+1.65 pp; +0.022), followed by EEGNet (+0.76 pp; +0.010) and
EEGTCNet (+0.54 pp; +0.008). Inspection of the subject material reveals
significant enhancements in challenging recordings (e.g., non-stationary
sessions), indicating that RDWT can mitigate localized noise and enhance
rhythm-specific information. In conclusion, RDWT is shown to be a low-overhead,
architecture-aware preprocessing technique that can yield tangible gains in
accuracy and agreement for deep model families and challenging subjects.

### [511] [$\mathsf{P} \neq \mathsf{NP}$: A Non-Relativizing Proof via Quantale Weakness and Geometric Complexity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08814)
*Ben Goertzel*

Main category: cs.CC

TL;DR: The paper establishes a novel framework combining information-theoretic techniques and symmetry/sparsity properties of masked random Unique-SAT instances to provide distributional lower bounds contradicting known upper bounds under the assumption that $\mathsf{P}=\mathsf{NP}$. Analytical results support $\mathsf{P}\ne\mathsf{NP}$.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to challenge the long-standing open question in computer science of whether $\mathsf{P}=\mathsf{NP}$ by leveraging a compositional information-theoretic approach rooted in masked Unique-SAT ensembles.

Method: The framework employs sparsified symmetries, Switching-by-Weakness normal forms, sign-invariant neutrality lemmas, and sparsification templates to analyze per-bit locality and random behavior. These tools establish quantitative gaps between decoding complexity and distributional lower bounds under $\mathsf{P}=\mathsf{NP}$.

Result: By proving the Switching-by-Weakness normal form and enforcing near-randomness on independent blocks, the paper demonstrates linear tuple complexity bounds contradicting existing compression expectations when assuming $\mathsf{P}=\mathsf{NP}$.

Conclusion: The work leverages symmetry and sparsity-based formalism to show that $\mathsf{P}\ne\mathsf{NP}$, resolving the contradiction between lower bounds and self-reduction-based upper bounds.

Abstract: We give a compositional, information-theoretic framework that turns short
programs into locality on many independent blocks, and combine it with symmetry
and sparsity of masked random Unique-SAT to obtain distributional lower bounds
that contradict the self-reduction upper bound under $\mathsf{P}=\mathsf{NP}$.
We work in the weakness quantale $w_Q=K_{\mathrm{poly}}(\cdot\mid\cdot)$. For
an efficiently samplable ensemble $D_m$ made by masking random $3$-CNFs with
fresh $S_m\ltimes(\mathbb{Z}_2)^m$ symmetries and a small-seed
Valiant--Vazirani isolation layer, we prove a Switching-by-Weakness normal
form: for any polytime decoder $P$ of description length $\le \delta t$ (with
$t=\Theta(m)$ blocks), a short wrapper $W$ makes $(P\circ W)$ per-bit local on
a $\gamma$-fraction of blocks. Two ingredients then force near-randomness on
$\Omega(t)$ blocks for every short decoder: (a) a sign-invariant neutrality
lemma giving $\Pr[X_i=1\mid \mathcal{I}]=1/2$ for any sign-invariant view
$\mathcal{I}$; and (b) a template sparsification theorem at logarithmic radius
showing that any fixed local rule appears with probability $m^{-\Omega(1)}$.
Combined with single-block bounds for tiny $\mathrm{ACC}^0$/streaming decoders,
this yields a success bound $2^{-\Omega(t)}$ and, by Compression-from-Success,
$K_{\mathrm{poly}}\big((X_1,\ldots,X_t)\mid(\Phi_1,\ldots,\Phi_t)\big)\ge \eta
t$. If $\mathsf{P}=\mathsf{NP}$, a uniform constant-length program maps any
on-promise instance to its unique witness in polytime (bit fixing via a
$\mathrm{USAT}$ decider), so $K_{\mathrm{poly}}(X\mid\Phi)\le O(1)$ and the
tuple complexity is $O(1)$, contradicting the linear bound. The proof is
non-relativizing and non-natural; symmetry, sparsification, and switching yield
a quantale upper-lower clash, hence $\mathsf{P}\ne\mathsf{NP}$.

### [512] [Articulation-Informed ASR: Integrating Articulatory Features into ASR via Auxiliary Speech Inversion and Cross-Attention Fusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08585)
*Ahmed Adel Attia,Jing Liu,Carol Espy Wilson*

Main category: eess.AS

TL;DR: This paper revisits using articulatory features in automatic speech recognition with deep learning, proposing a cross-attention-based framework that incorporates these features, achieving improved results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Articulatory features were previously underused in ASR research, especially with shallow models. The authors aim to explore their potential benefits when paired with modern deep learning techniques.

Method: The framework uses speech inversion to predict articulatory features, incorporating them as a query stream via a cross-attention module alongside acoustic embeddings.

Result: Using LibriSpeech data, the approach improved recognition performance, especially in low-resource settings, surpassing strong transformer-based models.

Conclusion: Articulatory features, when reintroduced with contemporary deep learning architectures, provide significant enhancements for ASR systems.

Abstract: Prior works have investigated the use of articulatory features as
complementary representations for automatic speech recognition (ASR), but their
use was largely confined to shallow acoustic models. In this work, we revisit
articulatory information in the era of deep learning and propose a framework
that leverages articulatory representations both as an auxiliary task and as a
pseudo-input to the recognition model. Specifically, we employ speech inversion
as an auxiliary prediction task, and the predicted articulatory features are
injected into the model as a query stream in a cross-attention module with
acoustic embeddings as keys and values. Experiments on LibriSpeech demonstrate
that our approach yields consistent improvements over strong transformer-based
baselines, particularly under low-resource conditions. These findings suggest
that articulatory features, once sidelined in ASR research, can provide
meaningful benefits when reintroduced with modern architectures.

### [513] [Dynamic Stress Detection: A Study of Temporal Progression Modelling of Stress in Speech](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08586)
*Vishakha Lall,Yisi Liu*

Main category: eess.AS

TL;DR: The paper proposes a method to detect psychological stress from speech by treating it as a dynamic phenomenon, achieving significant accuracy improvements using novel sequential models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous studies oversimplify psychological stress detection by treating stress as a static label, which fails to capture its evolving nature influenced by emotions.

Method: The authors developed a dynamic labelling strategy based on emotional labels and employed cross-attention-based sequential models, including a Unidirectional LSTM and Transformer Encoder, to model stress progression over time.

Result: Their approach significantly improved accuracy on well-known datasets, MuSE (+5%) and StressID (+18%), and generalized effectively to a custom real-world dataset.

Conclusion: Modelling stress as a dynamic construct rather than a static one enhances the accuracy and real-world applicability of speech-based stress detection systems.

Abstract: Detecting psychological stress from speech is critical in high-pressure
settings. While prior work has leveraged acoustic features for stress
detection, most treat stress as a static label. In this work, we model stress
as a temporally evolving phenomenon influenced by historical emotional state.
We propose a dynamic labelling strategy that derives fine-grained stress
annotations from emotional labels and introduce cross-attention-based
sequential models, a Unidirectional LSTM and a Transformer Encoder, to capture
temporal stress progression. Our approach achieves notable accuracy gains on
MuSE (+5%) and StressID (+18%) over existing baselines, and generalises well to
a custom real-world dataset. These results highlight the value of modelling
stress as a dynamic construct in speech.

### [514] [BaldWhisper: Faster Whisper with Head Shearing and Layer Merging](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08599)
*Yaya Sy,Christophe Cerisara,Irina Illina*

Main category: eess.AS

TL;DR: This study proposes a new method to prune and compress Whisper models for low-resource languages, achieving significant size and speed enhancements while preserving most of the original performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need to adapt large pre-trained transformers, like Whisper, for low-resource languages where massive retraining data is unavailable.

Method: Novel pruning approach using low-rank decomposition and feature distillation for embeddings, complemented by layer merging instead of removal.

Result: The optimized model retains 90% of the original model's performance, is 48% smaller, and operates 2.15x faster on edge devices.

Conclusion: The proposed pruning method shows promise for effectively compressing large language models in data-scarce settings without substantial performance trade-offs.

Abstract: Pruning large pre-trained transformers for low-resource languages is
challenging, as it often requires massive retraining data to recover
performance. For instance, Distill-Whisper prunes Whisper by 40% and retrains
on 21,000 hours of speech, far beyond what is available for most languages. Can
Whisper be made lighter and faster for edge devices in data-scarce settings?
Focusing on Bambara with only 32h of speech-to-text data, we propose a new
pruning recipe. Instead of vocabulary pruning, which is unsuitable due to
frequent code-switching by Bambara speakers, we compress the embeddings with
low-rank decomposition and feature distillation. Rather than removing layers,
we merge them to limit performance loss. The final model preserves 90% of the
original performance while being 48% smaller and 2.15x faster on a MacBook Air
M1.

### [515] [Look before Transcription: End-to-End SlideASR with Visually-Anchored Policy Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08618)
*Rui Hu,Delai Qiu,Yining Wang,Shengping Liu,Jitao Sang*

Main category: eess.AS

TL;DR: This paper introduces the SlideASR task, which aims to enhance automatic speech recognition (ASR) in academic lectures using slide visuals. A novel method, Visually-Anchored Policy Optimization (VAPO), is proposed to improve transcription accuracy through structured reasoning and reinforcement learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ASR systems struggle with understanding domain-specific terms in specialized settings, such as lectures, where visual aids like slides contain rich context. The aim is to use this visual information for better transcription accuracy.

Method: The paper presents a method called VAPO, which follows a structured reasoning framework (<think><answer>) using Chain-of-Thought reasoning. Post-training optimization is performed via reinforcement learning, emphasizing OCR accuracy, transcription quality, format consistency, and visual referencing.

Result: The VAPO method demonstrated significant improvement in recognizing domain-specific terms in SlideASR. Additionally, the authors introduced SlideASR-Bench, a synthetic and real-world benchmark for evaluation.

Conclusion: VAPO establishes an effective, end-to-end framework for improving ASR in visually-supported contexts, laying groundwork for future research in this domain.

Abstract: Automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems often struggle with
domain-specific terminology, especially in specialized settings such as
academic lectures. To address this, we define the SlideASR task, which
leverages the rich visual information from presentation slides to improve
transcription accuracy. Existing pipeline methods for this task tend to be
complex and underperform. Although omni-modal large language models (OLLMs)
provide a promising end-to-end framework, they frequently fail in practice by
degenerating into simple optical character recognition (OCR) systems. To
overcome this, we propose Visually-Anchored Policy Optimization (VAPO), a novel
post-training method designed to control the model's reasoning process. Drawing
on the Chain-of-Thought reasoning paradigm, VAPO enforces a structured "Look
before Transcription" procedure using a <think><answer> format. Specifically,
the model first performs OCR on the slide content within the think step, then
generates the transcription by referencing this recognized visual information
in the answer step. This reasoning process is optimized via reinforcement
learning with four distinct rewards targeting format compliance, OCR accuracy,
ASR quality, and visual anchoring consistency. To support further research, we
construct SlideASR-Bench, a new entity-rich benchmark consisting of a synthetic
dataset for training and testing, and a challenging real-world set for
evaluation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that VAPO significantly improves
recognition of domain-specific terms, establishing an effective end-to-end
paradigm for SlideASR.

### [516] [Unsupervised lexicon learning from speech is limited by representations rather than clustering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09225)
*Danel Adendorff,Simon Malan,Herman Kamper*

Main category: eess.AS

TL;DR: The paper investigates limitations in zero-resource word segmentation and clustering systems, focusing on whether representation or clustering methods hinder performance. The study identifies representation variability as the main constraint.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate whether limitations in zero-resource word segmentation and clustering systems are caused by the way word segments are represented or by the methods used to cluster them.

Method: The study integrates various self-supervised speech features and clustering techniques (K-means, hierarchical, graph-based), testing them on English and Mandarin datasets. Controlled experiments isolate the effects of representations and clustering methods.

Result: The best-performing system utilized graph clustering with dynamic time warping on continuous features. Alternatives include graph clustering with cosine distance on averaged continuous features or edit distance on discrete unit sequences.

Conclusion: Representation variability across word-type segments, rather than clustering methods, is the primary factor restricting performance in zero-resource word segmentation systems.

Abstract: Zero-resource word segmentation and clustering systems aim to tokenise speech
into word-like units without access to text labels. Despite progress, the
induced lexicons are still far from perfect. In an idealised setting with gold
word boundaries, we ask whether performance is limited by the representation of
word segments, or by the clustering methods that group them into word-like
types. We combine a range of self-supervised speech features
(continuous/discrete, frame/word-level) with different clustering methods
(K-means, hierarchical, graph-based) on English and Mandarin data. The best
system uses graph clustering with dynamic time warping on continuous features.
Faster alternatives use graph clustering with cosine distance on averaged
continuous features or edit distance on discrete unit sequences. Through
controlled experiments that isolate either the representations or the
clustering method, we demonstrate that representation variability across
segments of the same word type -- rather than clustering -- is the primary
factor limiting performance.

*Natalia Tomashenko,Junichi Yamagishi,Xin Wang,Yun Liu,Emmanuel Vincent*

Main category: eess.AS

TL;DR: The paper addresses the challenge of anonymizing a single target speaker in multi-speaker conversational audio, specifically for privacy-sensitive contexts like call centers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing speaker anonymization research primarily focuses on single-speaker audio, lacking optimization for multi-speaker settings like customer-operator conversations where selective anonymization is critical.

Method: The study explores targeted strategies for anonymizing a single speaker in conversational audio settings, and develops improved evaluation methodologies for assessing privacy protection and utility.

Result: Issues in current anonymization methods are identified and solutions for selective speaker anonymization are proposed along with enhanced evaluation methods.

Conclusion: The research bridges gaps in anonymization techniques for multi-speaker audio by introducing targeted strategies and appropriate evaluation methodologies, particularly relevant for real-world applications like call centers.

Abstract: Most of the existing speaker anonymization research has focused on
single-speaker audio, leading to the development of techniques and evaluation
metrics optimized for such condition. This study addresses the significant
challenge of speaker anonymization within multi-speaker conversational audio,
specifically when only a single target speaker needs to be anonymized. This
scenario is highly relevant in contexts like call centers, where customer
privacy necessitates anonymizing only the customer's voice in interactions with
operators. Conventional anonymization methods are often not suitable for this
task. Moreover, current evaluation methodology does not allow us to accurately
assess privacy protection and utility in this complex multi-speaker scenario.
This work aims to bridge these gaps by exploring effective strategies for
targeted speaker anonymization in conversational audio, highlighting potential
problems in their development and proposing corresponding improved evaluation
methodologies.

### [518] [Physically Valid Biomolecular Interaction Modeling with Gauss-Seidel Projection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08946)
*Siyuan Chen,Minghao Guo,Caoliwen Wang,Anka He Chen,Yikun Zhang,Jingjing Chai,Yin Yang,Wojciech Matusik,Peter Yichen Chen*

Main category: q-bio.BM

TL;DR: The paper introduces a method addressing physical validity in biomolecular interaction modeling using a Gauss-Seidel projection module, achieving faster and accurate results compared to state-of-the-art models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the issue of physically invalid all-atom structures produced by foundation models in biomolecular interaction modeling.

Method: Incorporate a unified module with a differentiable Gauss-Seidel projection that maps provisional atom coordinates to the nearest physically valid configuration.

Result: Achieved structural accuracy comparable to state-of-the-art 200-step diffusion baselines using just 2 denoising steps with approximately 10 times faster computational speed.

Conclusion: The proposed approach ensures both physical validity and structural accuracy, providing significant improvements in computational efficiency.

Abstract: Biomolecular interaction modeling has been substantially advanced by
foundation models, yet they often produce all-atom structures that violate
basic steric feasibility. We address this limitation by enforcing physical
validity as a strict constraint during both training and inference with a
uniffed module. At its core is a differentiable projection that maps the
provisional atom coordinates from the diffusion model to the nearest physically
valid conffguration. This projection is achieved using a Gauss-Seidel scheme,
which exploits the locality and sparsity of the constraints to ensure stable
and fast convergence at scale. By implicit differentiation to obtain gradients,
our module integrates seamlessly into existing frameworks for end-to-end
ffnetuning. With our Gauss-Seidel projection module in place, two denoising
steps are sufffcient to produce biomolecular complexes that are both physically
valid and structurally accurate. Across six benchmarks, our 2-step model
achieves the same structural accuracy as state-of-the-art 200-step diffusion
baselines, delivering approximately 10 times faster wall-clock speed while
guaranteeing physical validity.
