### [1] [Towards Piece-by-Piece Explanations for Chess Positions with SHAP](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25775)
*Francesco Spinnato*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes using the SHAP methodology to attribute chess engine evaluations to specific pieces, aiming for interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Chess engines provide accurate evaluations without offering insight into the contributions of individual pieces or patterns. This lack of interpretability hinders human understanding and training.

Method: The authors adapt SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) to chess, treating pieces as features, systematically ablating them, and computing additive, per-piece contributions to explain engine outputs.

Result: Results showcase how SHAP-based methods can explain chess engine evaluations reliably, presenting opportunities for human training, engine comparison, and visualization.

Conclusion: The study bridges chess engines' decision-making with player interpretability, providing resources for future research into interpretable chess AI methods.

Abstract: Contemporary chess engines offer precise yet opaque evaluations, typically
expressed as centipawn scores. While effective for decision-making, these
outputs obscure the underlying contributions of individual pieces or patterns.
In this paper, we explore adapting SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) to the
domain of chess analysis, aiming to attribute a chess engines evaluation to
specific pieces on the board. By treating pieces as features and systematically
ablating them, we compute additive, per-piece contributions that explain the
engines output in a locally faithful and human-interpretable manner. This
method draws inspiration from classical chess pedagogy, where players assess
positions by mentally removing pieces, and grounds it in modern explainable AI
techniques. Our approach opens new possibilities for visualization, human
training, and engine comparison. We release accompanying code and data to
foster future research in interpretable chess AI.

### [2] [An Agentic Framework for Rapid Deployment of Edge AI Solutions in Industry 5.0](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25813)
*Jorge Martinez-Gil,Mario Pichler,Nefeli Bountouni,Sotiris Koussouris,Marielena Márquez Barreiro,Sergio Gusmeroli*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A new framework for Industry 5.0 is developed to simplify AI model deployment on edge devices, reducing latency and enhancing real-time processing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the latency and challenges in deploying AI models on edge devices in industrial environments, while maintaining local data processing and system adaptability.

Method: The paper introduces an agent-based framework design that divides responsibilities among individual agents for modular, flexible, and low-resource integration.

Result: Evaluations in the food industry demonstrate faster deployment times and improved adaptability in real-world scenarios.

Conclusion: The proposed framework is effective for real-time AI deployment in Industry 5.0 with low resource requirements and better adaptability, with publicly available code for further use.

Abstract: We present a novel framework for Industry 5.0 that simplifies the deployment
of AI models on edge devices in various industrial settings. The design reduces
latency and avoids external data transfer by enabling local inference and
real-time processing. Our implementation is agent-based, which means that
individual agents, whether human, algorithmic, or collaborative, are
responsible for well-defined tasks, enabling flexibility and simplifying
integration. Moreover, our framework supports modular integration and maintains
low resource requirements. Preliminary evaluations concerning the food industry
in real scenarios indicate improved deployment time and system adaptability
performance. The source code is publicly available at

### [3] [Symbolically Scaffolded Play: Designing Role-Sensitive Prompts for Generative NPC Dialogue](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25820)
*Vanessa Figueiredo,David Elumeze*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Examines how constrained prompts in LLM-based NPC interactions affect player experience using a detective game. Constrained prompts don’t clearly enhance experience, but have role-dependent effects.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Evaluate whether constrained prompts in LLMs improve player experience in interactive games, particularly for NPC dialogue.

Method: A usability study compared high-constraint and low-constraint prompts in a detective game using GPT-4. Redesigned prompts incorporated JSON+RAG scaffolding and further evaluation used an LLM-assisted judge.

Result: Player experience was unaffected by tight constraints; tighter scaffolds provided quest-giver NPCs more stability but reduced believability in suspect NPCs.

Conclusion: Symbolically Scaffolded Play framework balances coherence and improvisation using fuzzy-symbolic prompts, emphasizing nuanced constraints in game design.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) promise to transform interactive games by
enabling non-player characters (NPCs) to sustain unscripted dialogue. Yet it
remains unclear whether constrained prompts actually improve player experience.
We investigate this question through The Interview, a voice-based detective
game powered by GPT-4o. A within-subjects usability study ($N=10$) compared
high-constraint (HCP) and low-constraint (LCP) prompts, revealing no reliable
experiential differences beyond sensitivity to technical breakdowns. Guided by
these findings, we redesigned the HCP into a hybrid JSON+RAG scaffold and
conducted a synthetic evaluation with an LLM judge, positioned as an
early-stage complement to usability testing. Results uncovered a novel pattern:
scaffolding effects were role-dependent: the Interviewer (quest-giver NPC)
gained stability, while suspect NPCs lost improvisational believability. These
findings overturn the assumption that tighter constraints inherently enhance
play. Extending fuzzy-symbolic scaffolding, we introduce \textit{Symbolically
Scaffolded Play}, a framework in which symbolic structures are expressed as
fuzzy, numerical boundaries that stabilize coherence where needed while
preserving improvisation where surprise sustains engagement.

### [4] [Through the Judge's Eyes: Inferred Thinking Traces Improve Reliability of LLM Raters](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25860)
*Xingjian Zhang,Tianhong Gao,Suliang Jin,Tianhao Wang,Teng Ye,Eytan Adar,Qiaozhu Mei*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces a human-LLM collaborative framework to infer reasoning traces from label-only annotations, improving LLM-human agreement and refining annotation guidelines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enhancing the reliability of LLMs as evaluators for subjective tasks where human judgments involve complex reasoning beyond simple annotation labels.

Method: Proposes a framework leveraging rejection sampling to infer thinking traces from label annotations, followed by fine-tuning LLMs and synthesizing better annotation guidelines.

Result: The inferred thinking traces improved agreement between LLMs and humans, and refined annotation guidelines led to better inter-LLM model agreement across datasets.

Conclusion: LLMs can act as proxies for human reasoning traces, enabling the enhancement of label-only datasets into resources that improve the reliability of LLM evaluators.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used as raters for evaluation
tasks. However, their reliability is often limited for subjective tasks, when
human judgments involve subtle reasoning beyond annotation labels. Thinking
traces, the reasoning behind a judgment, are highly informative but challenging
to collect and curate. We present a human-LLM collaborative framework to infer
thinking traces from label-only annotations. The proposed framework uses a
simple and effective rejection sampling method to reconstruct these traces at
scale. These inferred thinking traces are applied to two complementary tasks:
(1) fine-tuning open LLM raters; and (2) synthesizing clearer annotation
guidelines for proprietary LLM raters. Across multiple datasets, our methods
lead to significantly improved LLM-human agreement. Additionally, the refined
annotation guidelines increase agreement among different LLM models. These
results suggest that LLMs can serve as practical proxies for otherwise
unrevealed human thinking traces, enabling label-only corpora to be extended
into thinking-trace-augmented resources that enhance the reliability of LLM
raters.

### [5] [Humains-Junior: A 3.8B Language Model Achieving GPT-4o-Level Factual Accuracy by Directed Exoskeleton Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25933)
*Nissan Yaron,Dan Bystritsky,Ben-Etzion Yaron*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Humans-Junior, a 3.8B model, achieves comparable FACTS accuracy to GPT-4o within a ±5 percentage point equivalence margin, at approximately 19x lower cloud API cost with near-zero marginal cost for self-hosted setups.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a smaller and more cost-efficient language model that can match the factual grounding and reasoning accuracy of GPT-4o.

Method: A combination of 'Exoskeleton Reasoning' scaffolds and behavioral fine-tuning focusing on epistemic discipline (protocol compliance) rather than direct answers was utilized. This approach synergized with minimal prompting to enhance accuracy and reduce variance.

Result: Humans-Junior scored 72.7% on Q1-Q500 (close to GPT-4o’s 73.5%). It proved to be significantly more cost-effective than GPT-4o, with cloud pricing 19x lower, and potential for virtually zero incremental cost in self-hosted or edge deployments.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates that smaller language models like Humans-Junior can achieve high factual grounding accuracy at significantly lower costs, presenting a viable alternative for applications requiring cost-effective AI solutions.

Abstract: We introduce Humans-Junior, a 3.8B model that matches GPT-4o on the FACTS
Grounding public subset within a $\pm 5$ pp equivalence margin.
  Results. On Q1--Q500 under identical judges, GPT-4o scores 73.5% (95% CI
69.5--77.2) and Humans-Junior 72.7% (95% CI 68.7--76.5); the paired difference
is 0.8 pp (bootstrap 95% CI $-3.1$ to $+4.7$; permutation $p = 0.72$; Cohen's
$d = 0.023$). TOST establishes equivalence at $\pm 5$ pp (not at $\pm 3$ pp).
When purchased as managed APIs, Humans-Junior's base model
(Phi-3.5-mini-instruct) is $\approx 19\times$ less expensive than GPT-4o on
Microsoft AI Foundry pricing; self-hosted or edge deployments can drive
incremental inference cost toward zero. Measured vs estimated pricing sources
are tabulated in Appendix E.
  Method. Our approach combines minimal directed "Exoskeleton Reasoning"
scaffolds with behavioral fine-tuning that teaches protocol compliance
(epistemic discipline) rather than domain answers. Fine-tuning alone adds
little; combined, they synergize (+17.7 pp, $p < 0.001$) and reduce variance
($\approx 25\%$). In prompt-only settings on frontier models (Q1--Q100;
non-comparable), directed reasoning improved GPT-4o by +11.8 pp to 85.3% and
Gemini-2.5-Pro by +5.0 pp to 93.3% (baseline 88.3%, $n = 100$); see Section~5.
  TL;DR. A 3.8B model achieves GPT-4o-level FACTS accuracy (equivalent within
$\pm 5$ pp on Q1--Q500). Cloud pricing shows $\approx 19\times$ lower cost
versus GPT-4o, and self-hosted/edge deployments can approach zero marginal
cost. Pricing sources are listed in Appendix E. Frontier prompt-only gains
(Q1--Q100; non-comparable) and optimized-prompt exploratory results under
earlier judges are summarized in Appendix F.

### [6] [The Information-Theoretic Imperative: Compression and the Epistemic Foundations of Intelligence](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25883)
*Christian Dittrich,Jennifer Flygare Kinne*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper proposes a framework explaining intelligence through predictive compression and its connection to survival and reality alignment in structured environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to clarify how compression enforces the discovery of causal structures necessary for intelligence, bridging the gap between causality and predictive modeling.

Method: The paper introduces two theoretical principles—Information-Theoretic Imperative (ITI) and Compression Efficiency Principle (CEP)—to establish the causal link between intelligence and survival-related information processing.

Result: The framework predicts relationships such as compression efficiency correlating with generalization, exception accumulation differentiating models, and biological systems incurring metabolic costs for complexity.

Conclusion: Intelligence emerges as a necessary outcome of persisting in structured environments, unified across biological, artificial, and multi-scale systems with testable predictions.

Abstract: Existing frameworks converge on the centrality of compression to intelligence
but leave underspecified why this process enforces the discovery of causal
structure rather than superficial statistical patterns. We introduce a
two-level framework to address this gap. The Information-Theoretic Imperative
(ITI) establishes that any system persisting in uncertain environments must
minimize epistemic entropy through predictive compression: this is the
evolutionary "why" linking survival pressure to information-processing demands.
The Compression Efficiency Principle (CEP) specifies how efficient compression
mechanically selects for generative, causal models through
exception-accumulation dynamics, making reality alignment a consequence rather
than a contingent achievement. Together, ITI and CEP define a causal chain:
from survival pressure to prediction necessity, compression requirement,
efficiency optimization, generative structure discovery, and ultimately reality
alignment. Each link follows from physical, information-theoretic, or
evolutionary constraints, implying that intelligence is the mechanically
necessary outcome of persistence in structured environments. This framework
yields empirically testable predictions: compression efficiency, measured as
approach to the rate-distortion frontier, correlates with out-of-distribution
generalization; exception-accumulation rates differentiate causal from
correlational models; hierarchical systems exhibit increasing efficiency across
abstraction layers; and biological systems demonstrate metabolic costs that
track representational complexity. ITI and CEP thereby provide a unified
account of convergence across biological, artificial, and multi-scale systems,
addressing the epistemic and functional dimensions of intelligence without
invoking assumptions about consciousness or subjective experience.

### [7] [Approximating Human Preferences Using a Multi-Judge Learned System](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25884)
*Eitán Sprejer,Fernando Avalos,Augusto Bernardi,Jose Pedro Brito de Azevedo Faustino,Jacob Haimes,Narmeen Fatimah Oozeer*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper addresses the challenge of aligning LLM-based judges with human preferences. It introduces a framework for modeling persona-based preferences, involving aggregated outputs from rubric-conditioned judges, and offers methods to enhance preference synthesis and prediction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The alignment of LLM-based judges with human preferences is crucial for improving applications like RLHF reward models and effective routing systems.

Method: The authors propose a framework that learns to aggregate outputs from multiple rubric-conditioned judges, utilizing persona-based approaches for synthesizing preferences and implementing aggregators like Generalized Additive Model and Multi-Layer Perceptron.

Result: The proposed solution demonstrated better performance compared to naive baselines and exhibited robustness to biases in both human and LLM-based judges.

Conclusion: By employing persona-based preference synthesis and advanced aggregation methods, the approach contributes to aligning LLM-based judges with human preferences and addresses related biases.

Abstract: Aligning LLM-based judges with human preferences is a significant challenge,
as they are difficult to calibrate and often suffer from rubric sensitivity,
bias, and instability. Overcoming this challenge advances key applications,
such as creating reliable reward models for Reinforcement Learning from Human
Feedback (RLHF) and building effective routing systems that select the
best-suited model for a given user query. In this work, we propose a framework
for modeling diverse, persona-based preferences by learning to aggregate
outputs from multiple rubric-conditioned judges. We investigate the performance
of this approach against naive baselines and assess its robustness through case
studies on both human and LLM-judges biases. Our primary contributions include
a persona-based method for synthesizing preference labels at scale and two
distinct implementations of our aggregator: Generalized Additive Model (GAM)
and a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP).

### [8] [SciTrust 2.0: A Comprehensive Framework for Evaluating Trustworthiness of Large Language Models in Scientific Applications](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25908)
*Emily Herron,Junqi Yin,Feiyi Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper presents SciTrust 2.0, a comprehensive evaluation framework to assess the trustworthiness of large language models in scientific contexts in four dimensions: truthfulness, robustness, safety, and ethics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address the trustworthiness concerns surrounding large language models (LLMs) in high-stakes scientific research.

Method: A novel evaluation framework named SciTrust 2.0, featuring truthfulness and ethics benchmarks developed with reflection tuning and multiple evaluation metrics, was used to assess seven prominent LLMs.

Result: General-purpose language models outperformed science-specific models across all trustworthiness dimensions, with notable gaps in logical reasoning and safety in science-specialized models.

Conclusion: SciTrust 2.0 sets a foundation for advancements in creating trustworthy and ethical AI for scientific applications.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated transformative potential in
scientific research, yet their deployment in high-stakes contexts raises
significant trustworthiness concerns. Here, we introduce SciTrust 2.0, a
comprehensive framework for evaluating LLM trustworthiness in scientific
applications across four dimensions: truthfulness, adversarial robustness,
scientific safety, and scientific ethics. Our framework incorporates novel,
open-ended truthfulness benchmarks developed through a verified
reflection-tuning pipeline and expert validation, alongside a novel ethics
benchmark for scientific research contexts covering eight subcategories
including dual-use research and bias. We evaluated seven prominent LLMs,
including four science-specialized models and three general-purpose industry
models, using multiple evaluation metrics including accuracy, semantic
similarity measures, and LLM-based scoring. General-purpose industry models
overall outperformed science-specialized models across each trustworthiness
dimension, with GPT-o4-mini demonstrating superior performance in truthfulness
assessments and adversarial robustness. Science-specialized models showed
significant deficiencies in logical and ethical reasoning capabilities, along
with concerning vulnerabilities in safety evaluations, particularly in
high-risk domains such as biosecurity and chemical weapons. By open-sourcing
our framework, we provide a foundation for developing more trustworthy AI
systems and advancing research on model safety and ethics in scientific
contexts.

### [9] [FinOps Agent -- A Use-Case for IT Infrastructure and Cost Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25914)
*Ngoc Phuoc An Vo,Manish Kesarwani,Ruchi Mahindru,Chandrasekhar Narayanaswami*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces an AI-driven FinOps agent for automating cloud cost optimization processes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: FinOps practitioners struggle with processing billing data from diverse formats and systems, which hinders timely decision-making and actionable insights.

Method: The researchers designed an autonomous goal-driven AI FinOps agent, simulating real-world processes to retrieve, consolidate, analyze data, and generate actionable cost optimization recommendations.

Result: The implemented FinOps agent demonstrated the capability to understand, plan, and execute tasks comparable to real FinOps practitioners, based on defined evaluation metrics.

Conclusion: AI agents can significantly enhance automation in FinOps practices, improving efficiency in cloud cost optimization processes.

Abstract: FinOps (Finance + Operations) represents an operational framework and
cultural practice which maximizes cloud business value through collaborative
financial accountability across engineering, finance, and business teams.
FinOps practitioners face a fundamental challenge: billing data arrives in
heterogeneous formats, taxonomies, and metrics from multiple cloud providers
and internal systems which eventually lead to synthesizing actionable insights,
and making time-sensitive decisions. To address this challenge, we propose
leveraging autonomous, goal-driven AI agents for FinOps automation. In this
paper, we built a FinOps agent for a typical use-case for IT infrastructure and
cost optimization. We built a system simulating a realistic end-to-end industry
process starting with retrieving data from various sources to consolidating and
analyzing the data to generate recommendations for optimization. We defined a
set of metrics to evaluate our agent using several open-source and close-source
language models and it shows that the agent was able to understand, plan, and
execute tasks as well as an actual FinOps practitioner.

### [10] [Estimating cognitive biases with attention-aware inverse planning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25951)
*Sounak Banerjee,Daphne Cornelisse,Deepak Gopinath,Emily Sumner,Jonathan DeCastro,Guy Rosman,Eugene Vinitsky,Mark K. Ho*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper explores estimating people's cognitive biases in goal-directed behaviors using attention-aware inverse planning approach, combining deep reinforcement learning with computational cognitive modeling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve the interaction of autonomous systems with humans by understanding and accounting for cognitive biases in human behaviors, especially their attention biases.

Method: Introduce attention-aware inverse planning, combining deep reinforcement learning with computational cognitive modeling, and apply it on real driving scenarios from Waymo Open Dataset.

Result: Successfully inferred attentional strategies of RL agents, showcasing the scalability of attention-aware inverse planning in real-life driving scenarios.

Conclusion: Attention-aware inverse planning is effective in understanding and predicting cognitive biases from human actions, enabling better interactions with autonomous systems.

Abstract: People's goal-directed behaviors are influenced by their cognitive biases,
and autonomous systems that interact with people should be aware of this. For
example, people's attention to objects in their environment will be biased in a
way that systematically affects how they perform everyday tasks such as driving
to work. Here, building on recent work in computational cognitive science, we
formally articulate the attention-aware inverse planning problem, in which the
goal is to estimate a person's attentional biases from their actions. We
demonstrate how attention-aware inverse planning systematically differs from
standard inverse reinforcement learning and how cognitive biases can be
inferred from behavior. Finally, we present an approach to attention-aware
inverse planning that combines deep reinforcement learning with computational
cognitive modeling. We use this approach to infer the attentional strategies of
RL agents in real-life driving scenarios selected from the Waymo Open Dataset,
demonstrating the scalability of estimating cognitive biases with
attention-aware inverse planning.

### [11] [From Queries to Insights: Agentic LLM Pipelines for Spatio-Temporal Text-to-SQL](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25997)
*Manu Redd,Tao Zhe,Dongjie Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces an advanced NL-to-SQL system leveraging agentic orchestration for improved spatio-temporal query handling and user interaction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to overcome challenges in existing NL-to-SQL systems which struggle with handling complex spatio-temporal queries and providing effective human-database interaction for non-SQL experts.

Method: The method involves extending a basic text-to-SQL system (llama-3-sqlcoder-8b) with a Mistral-based ReAct agent for orchestration, enabling query decomposition, schema inspection, SQL execution, and visualization.

Result: The agentic pipeline achieved 91.4% accuracy, significantly higher than the baseline system's 28.6%. It also enhanced usability by providing maps, plots, and structured natural-language summaries.

Conclusion: Agentic orchestration proves to be a promising approach, enabling more intuitive interaction with databases for users without SQL expertise and improving performance on spatio-temporal queries.

Abstract: Natural-language-to-SQL (NL-to-SQL) systems hold promise for democratizing
access to structured data, allowing users to query databases without learning
SQL. Yet existing systems struggle with realistic spatio-temporal queries,
where success requires aligning vague user phrasing with schema-specific
categories, handling temporal reasoning, and choosing appropriate outputs. We
present an agentic pipeline that extends a naive text-to-SQL baseline
(llama-3-sqlcoder-8b) with orchestration by a Mistral-based ReAct agent. The
agent can plan, decompose, and adapt queries through schema inspection, SQL
generation, execution, and visualization tools. We evaluate on 35
natural-language queries over the NYC and Tokyo check-in dataset, covering
spatial, temporal, and multi-dataset reasoning. The agent achieves
substantially higher accuracy than the naive baseline 91.4% vs. 28.6% and
enhances usability through maps, plots, and structured natural-language
summaries. Crucially, our design enables more natural human-database
interaction, supporting users who lack SQL expertise, detailed schema
knowledge, or prompting skill. We conclude that agentic orchestration, rather
than stronger SQL generators alone, is a promising foundation for interactive
geospatial assistants.

models (LLMs), has made producing comprehensive and current survey papers
increasingly difficult. This paper introduces autosurvey2, a multi-stage
pipeline that automates survey generation through retrieval-augmented synthesis
and structured evaluation. The system integrates parallel section generation,

in alignment with expert review standards. Experimental results demonstrate
that autosurvey2 consistently outperforms existing retrieval-based and
automated baselines, achieving higher scores in structural coherence and
topical relevance while maintaining strong citation fidelity. By combining
retrieval, reasoning, and automated evaluation into a unified framework,
autosurvey2 provides a scalable and reproducible solution for generating
long-form academic surveys and contributes a solid foundation for future
research on automated scholarly writing. All code and resources are available

### [13] [Large Language Model-assisted Autonomous Vehicle Recovery from Immobilization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26023)
*Zhipeng Bao,Qianwen Li*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper presents StuckSolver, a Large Language Model-driven framework that helps autonomous vehicles resolve immobilization scenarios through self-reasoning and/or passenger-guided decisions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current autonomous vehicle navigation systems face challenges in complex traffic scenarios, leading to immobilization and disruptions. Existing solutions like remote intervention or manual takeover are inadequate.

Method: StuckSolver uses an add-on module relying on standard sensor data streams to detect immobilization, interpret traffic contexts, and generate high-level recovery commands for execution within AV's native system.

Result: Evaluations on Bench2Drive benchmark and custom scenarios reveal StuckSolver achieves nearly state-of-the-art performance using self-reasoning, with improved effectiveness when incorporating passenger guidance.

Conclusion: StuckSolver effectively enhances autonomous vehicle navigation in challenging scenarios through an innovative and adaptable recovery framework.

Abstract: Despite significant advancements in recent decades, autonomous vehicles (AVs)
continue to face challenges in navigating certain traffic scenarios where human
drivers excel. In such situations, AVs often become immobilized, disrupting
overall traffic flow. Current recovery solutions, such as remote intervention
(which is costly and inefficient) and manual takeover (which excludes
non-drivers and limits AV accessibility), are inadequate. This paper introduces
StuckSolver, a novel Large Language Model (LLM) driven recovery framework that
enables AVs to resolve immobilization scenarios through self-reasoning and/or
passenger-guided decision-making. StuckSolver is designed as a plug-in add-on
module that operates on top of the AV's existing perception-planning-control
stack, requiring no modification to its internal architecture. Instead, it
interfaces with standard sensor data streams to detect immobilization states,
interpret environmental context, and generate high-level recovery commands that
can be executed by the AV's native planner. We evaluate StuckSolver on the
Bench2Drive benchmark and in custom-designed uncertainty scenarios. Results
show that StuckSolver achieves near-state-of-the-art performance through
autonomous self-reasoning alone and exhibits further improvements when
passenger guidance is incorporated.

### [14] [Can AI be Accountable?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26057)
*Andrew L. Kun*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This abstract discusses the importance of AI accountability to ensure it serves consumers, voters, and decision-makers effectively.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper seeks to address the lack of accountability in AI systems and its implications in serving society.

Method: It describes the general definition of accountability and relates it specifically to AI systems.

Result: Illustrative examples are provided to demonstrate accountable and unaccountable AI systems, along with possible approaches for improvement.

Conclusion: Stress is laid on fostering accountability in AI to ensure ethical and impactful utilization for those impacted by these systems.

Abstract: The AI we use is powerful, and its power is increasing rapidly. If this
powerful AI is to serve the needs of consumers, voters, and decision makers,
then it is imperative that the AI is accountable. In general, an agent is
accountable to a forum if the forum can request information from the agent
about its actions, if the forum and the agent can discuss this information, and
if the forum can sanction the agent. Unfortunately, in too many cases today's
AI is not accountable -- we cannot question it, enter into a discussion with
it, let alone sanction it. In this chapter we relate the general definition of
accountability to AI, we illustrate what it means for AI to be accountable and
unaccountable, and we explore approaches that can improve our chances of living
in a world where all AI is accountable to those who are affected by it.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Develop tools and benchmarks for improving formal reasoning in physics using Lean4.

Method: Introduced LeanPhysBench (physics benchmark), PhysLib (physics reasoning library), and evaluated with expert provers and models.

Result: Baselines show low performance (16%-35%) on LeanPhysBench, but PhysLib improves model accuracy by 11.75% on average.

Conclusion: Lean4PHYS establishes a new standard for formal physics reasoning in Lean4, emphasizes current challenges, and highlights PhysLib's effectiveness.

Abstract: We present **Lean4PHYS**, a comprehensive reasoning framework for
college-level physics problems in Lean4. **Lean4PHYS** includes
*LeanPhysBench*, a college-level benchmark for formal physics reasoning in
Lean4, which contains 200 hand-crafted and peer-reviewed statements derived
from university textbooks and physics competition problems. To establish a
solid foundation for formal reasoning in physics, we also introduce *PhysLib*,
a community-driven repository containing fundamental unit systems and theorems
essential for formal physics reasoning. Based on the benchmark and Lean4
repository we composed in **Lean4PHYS**, we report baseline results using major
expert Math Lean4 provers and state-of-the-art closed-source models, with the
best performance of DeepSeek-Prover-V2-7B achieving only 16% and
Claude-Sonnet-4 achieving 35%. We also conduct a detailed analysis showing that
our *PhysLib* can achieve an average improvement of 11.75% in model
performance. This demonstrates the challenging nature of our *LeanPhysBench*
and the effectiveness of *PhysLib*. To the best of our knowledge, this is the
first study to provide a physics benchmark in Lean4.

### [16] [GUI Knowledge Bench: Revealing the Knowledge Gap Behind VLM Failures in GUI Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26098)
*Chenrui Shi,Zedong Yu,Zhi Gao,Ruining Feng,Enqi Liu,Yuwei Wu,Yunde Jia,Liuyu Xiang,Zhaofeng He,Qing Li*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper analyzes why large vision language models (VLMs) lag behind humans in GUI tasks, proposes three dimensions of GUI knowledge essential for improvement, and introduces a benchmark (GUI Knowledge Bench) to assess and enhance their capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation behind the paper is to bridge the gap in performance between humans and VLMs in GUI task automation by identifying core GUI knowledge and its impact on task success.

Method: The authors identified three key dimensions of GUI knowledge—interface perception, interaction prediction, and instruction understanding—through analysis of common failure patterns. They developed GUI Knowledge Bench, a benchmark for evaluating VLMs through questions across six platforms and hundreds of applications.

Result: The study revealed that while VLMs are good at recognizing widget functions, they perform poorly in perceiving system states, predicting actions, and assessing task progress. The experiments confirmed that GUI knowledge is closely tied to task success.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that structuring GUI knowledge and providing rigorous benchmarks can help select and build better VLMs for GUI tasks, ultimately improving task automation.

Abstract: Large vision language models (VLMs) have advanced graphical user interface
(GUI) task automation but still lag behind humans. We hypothesize this gap
stems from missing core GUI knowledge, which existing training schemes (such as
supervised fine tuning and reinforcement learning) alone cannot fully address.
By analyzing common failure patterns in GUI task execution, we distill GUI
knowledge into three dimensions: (1) interface perception, knowledge about
recognizing widgets and system states; (2) interaction prediction, knowledge
about reasoning action state transitions; and (3) instruction understanding,
knowledge about planning, verifying, and assessing task completion progress. We
further introduce GUI Knowledge Bench, a benchmark with multiple choice and
yes/no questions across six platforms (Web, Android, MacOS, Windows, Linux,
IOS) and 292 applications. Our evaluation shows that current VLMs identify
widget functions but struggle with perceiving system states, predicting
actions, and verifying task completion. Experiments on real world GUI tasks
further validate the close link between GUI knowledge and task success. By
providing a structured framework for assessing GUI knowledge, our work supports
the selection of VLMs with greater potential prior to downstream training and
provides insights for building more capable GUI agents.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper examines the economics behind LLM inference, creating a framework to understand cost-effectiveness and economic principles in deployment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The growing inference cost of LLMs is a key challenge for their commercial adoption and calls for an economic understanding of their inference process.

Method: Using empirical data from WiNEval-3.0, the paper applies an economics-based framework to analyze LLM inference costs and production factors.

Result: The study reveals three principles in LLM inference: diminishing marginal costs, diminishing returns to scale, and the existence of an optimal cost-effectiveness zone.

Conclusion: The findings offer an empirical basis for market pricing and optimization of AI inference resources, guiding better model deployment decisions.

Abstract: The inference cost of Large Language Models (LLMs) has become a critical
factor in determining their commercial viability and widespread adoption. This
paper introduces a quantitative ``economics of inference'' framework, treating
the LLM inference process as a compute-driven intelligent production activity.
We analyze its marginal cost, economies of scale, and quality of output under
various performance configurations. Based on empirical data from WiNEval-3.0,
we construct the first ``LLM Inference Production Frontier,'' revealing three
principles: diminishing marginal cost, diminishing returns to scale, and an
optimal cost-effectiveness zone. This paper not only provides an economic basis
for model deployment decisions but also lays an empirical foundation for the
future market-based pricing and optimization of AI inference resources.

*Bo Pang,Deqian Kong,Silvio Savarese,Caiming Xiong,Yingbo Zhou*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper proposes a two-stage reasoning curriculum using reinforcement learning to develop and adapt reasoning abilities in language models across multiple domains, achieving improved outcomes with a minimal approach.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a simple, practical method for improving reasoning abilities in large language models across diverse domains, going beyond limited fields like math and code.

Method: A two-stage approach: 1) Begin with reinforcement learning in verifiable, math-focused domains to establish reasoning skills. 2) Use joint reinforcement learning with mixed-domain data to adapt and broaden these skills.

Result: The reasoning curriculum improved performance consistently, with experiments showing better cognitive-skill development and generalization across domains. Both stages of the method were found to be necessary.

Conclusion: Reasoning Curriculum effectively improves general reasoning in language models through a straightforward and adaptable two-stage reinforcement learning framework.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) can elicit strong reasoning in large language
models (LLMs), yet most open efforts focus on math and code. We propose
Reasoning Curriculum, a simple two-stage curriculum that first elicits
reasoning skills in pretraining-aligned domains such as math, then adapts and
refines these skills across other domains via joint RL. Stage 1 performs a
brief cold start and then math-only RL with verifiable rewards to develop
reasoning skills. Stage 2 runs joint RL on mixed-domain data to transfer and
consolidate these skills. The curriculum is minimal and backbone-agnostic,
requiring no specialized reward models beyond standard verifiability checks.
Evaluated on Qwen3-4B and Llama-3.1-8B over a multi-domain suite, reasoning
curriculum yields consistent gains. Ablations and a cognitive-skill analysis
indicate that both stages are necessary and that math-first elicitation
increases cognitive behaviors important for solving complex problems. Reasoning
Curriculum provides a compact, easy-to-adopt recipe for general reasoning.

a novel and general-purpose multi-agent framework that leverages a synergistic
combination of LLM-based reasoning and large-scale evolutionary search to

(+4.0pp), up to 20x speedups on KernelBench, and establishes new
state-of-the-art(SOTA) results on several classical mathematical problems.
Beyond academic benchmarks, FM Agent shows considerable promise for both
large-scale enterprise R\&D workflows and fundamental scientific research,
where it can accelerate innovation, automate complex discovery processes, and
deliver substantial engineering and scientific advances with broader societal
impact.

*Renhao Li,Jianhong Tu,Yang Su,Hamid Alinejad-Rokny,Derek F. Wong,Junyang Lin,Min Yang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ToolRM proposes lightweight generative reward models tailored for tool-use scenarios to align large language models with human preferences, showing significant performance improvements over existing frontier models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The absence of reward models specifically designed for function-calling tasks has hindered advancements in aligning LLMs with human preferences, particularly in tool learning.

Method: The study designs a novel pipeline to create pairwise preference data using rule-based scoring and multidimensional sampling. It releases the ToolPref-Pairwise-30K dataset and introduces TRBench$_{BFCL}$ for evaluation. Models are trained on this data for reinforcement learning.

Result: Models from Qwen3-4B/8B series achieve up to 14.28% higher accuracy compared to competitive models like Claude 4 and OpenAI o3 in pairwise reward judgments. ToolRM performs well on broader tasks, reduces token usage by over 66%, and supports inference-time scaling.

Conclusion: ToolRM aligns LLMs better with human preferences, particularly for tool-use scenarios, demonstrating both improved efficiency and accuracy. Released datasets and model checkpoints aim to encourage further research in this domain.

Abstract: Reward models (RMs) play a critical role in aligning large language models
(LLMs) with human preferences. Yet in the domain of tool learning, the lack of
RMs specifically designed for function-calling tasks has limited progress
toward more capable agentic AI. We introduce ToolRM, a family of lightweight
generative RMs tailored for general tool-use scenarios. To build these models,
we propose a novel pipeline that constructs pairwise preference data using
rule-based scoring and multidimensional sampling. This yields
ToolPref-Pairwise-30K, a diverse, balanced, and challenging dataset of critique
tasks that supports reinforcement learning with verifiable feedback. To
evaluate tool-use RMs, we also introduce TRBench$_{BFCL}$, a benchmark built on
the agentic evaluation suite BFCL. Trained on our constructed data, models from
the Qwen3-4B/8B series achieve up to 14.28% higher accuracy, substantially
outperforming frontier models such as Claude 4 and OpenAI o3 in pairwise reward
judgments. Beyond training objectives, ToolRM generalizes to broader critique
tasks, including Best-of-N sampling and self-correction. Experiments on
ACEBench highlight its effectiveness and efficiency, enabling inference-time
scaling and reducing output token usage by over 66%. We release data and model
checkpoints to facilitate future research.

*Duc-Hai Nguyen,Vijayakumar Nanjappan,Barry O'Sullivan,Hoang D. Nguyen*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces QASU, a benchmark for evaluating how effectively large language models (LLMs) handle and analyze structured questionnaire data, exploring optimal data formats and prompts to improve accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the gap in evidence-based guidance on representing questionnaire data for LLM consumption and enhancing LLM capabilities in processing structured survey datasets.

Method: The authors developed QASU, a benchmark that tests six structural skills across six serialization formats and various prompt strategies, while experimenting with LLMs to isolate format and prompting effects.

Result: Choosing optimal formats and prompts improved accuracy by up to 8.8%, and self-augmented prompting added another 3-4% improvement on specific tasks.

Conclusion: QASU provides a versatile foundation for advancing both research and practical applications of LLM-based questionnaire analysis, highlighting the importance of format and prompting strategies.

Abstract: Millions of people take surveys every day, from market polls and academic
studies to medical questionnaires and customer feedback forms. These datasets
capture valuable insights, but their scale and structure present a unique
challenge for large language models (LLMs), which otherwise excel at few-shot
reasoning over open-ended text. Yet, their ability to process questionnaire
data or lists of questions crossed with hundreds of respondent rows remains
underexplored. Current retrieval and survey analysis tools (e.g., Qualtrics,
SPSS, REDCap) are typically designed for humans in the workflow, limiting such
data integration with LLM and AI-empowered automation. This gap leaves
scientists, surveyors, and everyday users without evidence-based guidance on
how to best represent questionnaires for LLM consumption. We address this by
introducing QASU (Questionnaire Analysis and Structural Understanding), a
benchmark that probes six structural skills, including answer lookup,
respondent count, and multi-hop inference, across six serialization formats and
multiple prompt strategies. Experiments on contemporary LLMs show that choosing
an effective format and prompt combination can improve accuracy by up to 8.8%
points compared to suboptimal formats. For specific tasks, carefully adding a
lightweight structural hint through self-augmented prompting can yield further
improvements of 3-4% points on average. By systematically isolating format and
prompting effects, our open source benchmark offers a simple yet versatile
foundation for advancing both research and real-world practice in LLM-based
questionnaire analysis.

*Xinhang Li,Qing Guo,Junyu Chen,Zheng Guo,Shengzhe Xu,Lei Li,Lin Zhang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces REG-TSC, a distributed LLM-based Traffic Signal Control method addressing emergency and heterogeneous intersections, demonstrating remarkable improvement in urban traffic optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in traffic signal control due to unreliable LLM emergency decisions and diverse intersection types, ultimately improving traffic flow and safety.

Method: Introduced REG-TSC using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with emergency-aware reasoning and novel RERAG framework for emergencies, and adaptive R3 for handling intersection diversity.

Result: Experiments on real-world networks show significant reductions in travel time (42%), queue length (62.31%), and emergency vehicle waiting time (83.16%), outperforming previous methods.

Conclusion: REG-TSC enhances reasoning for emergencies and generalizes across diverse intersections, showing significant promise in optimizing urban traffic management.

Abstract: With increasing urban traffic complexity, Traffic Signal Control (TSC) is
essential for optimizing traffic flow and improving road safety. Large Language
Models (LLMs) emerge as promising approaches for TSC. However, they are prone
to hallucinations in emergencies, leading to unreliable decisions that may
cause substantial delays for emergency vehicles. Moreover, diverse intersection
types present substantial challenges for traffic state encoding and
cross-intersection training, limiting generalization across heterogeneous
intersections. Therefore, this paper proposes Retrieval Augmented Generation
(RAG)-enhanced distributed LLM agents with Emergency response for Generalizable
TSC (REG-TSC). Firstly, this paper presents an emergency-aware reasoning
framework, which dynamically adjusts reasoning depth based on the emergency
scenario and is equipped with a novel Reviewer-based Emergency RAG (RERAG) to
distill specific knowledge and guidance from historical cases, enhancing the
reliability and rationality of agents' emergency decisions. Secondly, this
paper designs a type-agnostic traffic representation and proposes a
Reward-guided Reinforced Refinement (R3) for heterogeneous intersections. R3
adaptively samples training experience from diverse intersections with
environment feedback-based priority and fine-tunes LLM agents with a designed
reward-weighted likelihood loss, guiding REG-TSC toward high-reward policies
across heterogeneous intersections. On three real-world road networks with 17
to 177 heterogeneous intersections, extensive experiments show that REG-TSC
reduces travel time by 42.00%, queue length by 62.31%, and emergency vehicle
waiting time by 83.16%, outperforming other state-of-the-art methods.

*Jiazhen Yuan,Wei Zhao,Zhengbiao Bai*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces Graph-Enhanced Policy Optimization (GEPO), a method for enhancing large language model (LLM) agent training by addressing structural blindness in state connectivity to improve learning and performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current group-based reinforcement learning methods for training multi-turn, interactive LLM agents suffer from structural blindness, which hampers exploration, credit assignment, and planning due to the inability to leverage underlying environmental connectivity.

Method: GEPO dynamically constructs a state-transition graph and uses graph-theoretic centrality to provide intrinsic rewards, a graph-enhanced advantage function, and a dynamic discount factor for better exploration, credit assignment, and planning.

Result: GEPO demonstrates improved success rates on benchmarks such as ALFWorld (+4.1%), WebShop (+5.3%), and Workbench (+10.9%), outperforming competitive baselines.

Conclusion: By explicitly modeling environmental structure, GEPO advances the training of LLM agents in a robust and generalizable way, addressing key limitations in traditional reinforcement learning approaches.

Abstract: Group based reinforcement learning (RL) has shown impressive results on
complex reasoning and mathematical tasks. Yet, when applied to train
multi-turn, interactive LLM agents, these methods often suffer from structural
blindness-the inability to exploit the underlying connectivity of the
environment. This manifests in three critical challenges: (1) inefficient,
unguided exploration, (2) imprecise credit assignment due to overlooking
pivotal states, and (3) myopic planning caused by static reward discounting. We
address these issues with Graph-Enhanced Policy Optimization (GEPO), which
dynamically constructs a state-transition graph from agent experience and
employs graph-theoretic centrality to provide three synergistic learning
signals: (1)structured intrinsic rewards that guide exploration toward
high-impact states, (2) a graph-enhanced advantage function for topology-aware
credit assignment, and (3) a dynamic discount factor adapted to each state's
strategic value. On the ALFWorld, WebShop, and a proprietary Workbench
benchmarks, GEPO demonstrates strong performance, achieving absolute success
rate gains of +4.1%, +5.3%, and +10.9% over competitive baselines. These
results highlight that explicitly modeling environmental structure is a robust,
generalizable strategy for advancing LLM agent training.

### [24] [GraphCompliance: Aligning Policy and Context Graphs for LLM-Based Regulatory Compliance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26309)
*Jiseong Chung,Ronny Ko,Wonchul Yoo,Makoto Onizuka,Sungmok Kim,Tae-Wan Kim,Won-Yong Shin*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces GraphCompliance to help align semantic information between natural language contexts and structured regulatory texts (like GDPR), improving compliance reasoning accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The complexity of regulatory compliance at scale, due to unstructured runtime contexts and structured regulatory texts, necessitates a framework for semantic alignment.

Method: A framework, GraphCompliance, is proposed that maps regulatory text to a Policy Graph and runtime context to a Context Graph, aligning them for structured reasoning with the assistance of a judge LLM.

Result: Tests on 300 GDPR cases across five tasks showed GraphCompliance outperformed other baselines by 4.1-7.2 percentage points in micro-F1 scores with superior recall and reduced false positives.

Conclusion: GraphCompliance bridges the gap between unstructured and structured data, enhancing accuracy and lowering the burden of regulatory interpretation through structured graph alignments and LLM-based reasoning.

Abstract: Compliance at web scale poses practical challenges: each request may require
a regulatory assessment. Regulatory texts (e.g., the General Data Protection
Regulation, GDPR) are cross-referential and normative, while runtime contexts
are expressed in unstructured natural language. This setting motivates us to
align semantic information in unstructured text with the structured, normative
elements of regulations. To this end, we introduce GraphCompliance, a framework
that represents regulatory texts as a Policy Graph and runtime contexts as a
Context Graph, and aligns them. In this formulation, the policy graph encodes
normative structure and cross-references, whereas the context graph formalizes
events as subject-action-object (SAO) and entity-relation triples. This
alignment anchors the reasoning of a judge large language model (LLM) in
structured information and helps reduce the burden of regulatory interpretation
and event parsing, enabling a focus on the core reasoning step. In experiments
on 300 GDPR-derived real-world scenarios spanning five evaluation tasks,
GraphCompliance yields 4.1-7.2 percentage points (pp) higher micro-F1 than
LLM-only and RAG baselines, with fewer under- and over-predictions, resulting
in higher recall and lower false positive rates. Ablation studies indicate
contributions from each graph component, suggesting that structured
representations and a judge LLM are complementary for normative reasoning.

*Robin Schmöcker,Alexander Dockhorn,Bodo Rosenhahn*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper proposes IPA-UCT, a technique to improve Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) by using a weaker state abstraction method to address challenges in noisy or large action spaces.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: State-action pair abstraction methods like OGA-UCT struggle in scenarios with noisy or extensive action spaces due to strict state abstraction conditions.

Method: The authors propose Ideal Pruning Abstractions in UCT (IPA-UCT), a technique that uses a weaker state abstraction condition to increase the number of feasible abstractions without significant loss of accuracy.

Result: IPA-UCT experimentally outperforms OGA-UCT and its variants across diverse test domains and iteration budgets.

Conclusion: IPA-UCT enhances sample efficiency in MCTS by leveraging an abstraction framework called IPA, which is part of a broader framework named p-ASAP and ASASAP.

Abstract: One approach to enhance Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) is to improve its
sample efficiency by grouping/abstracting states or state-action pairs and
sharing statistics within a group. Though state-action pair abstractions are
mostly easy to find in algorithms such as On the Go Abstractions in Upper
Confidence bounds applied to Trees (OGA-UCT), nearly no state abstractions are
found in either noisy or large action space settings due to constraining
conditions. We provide theoretical and empirical evidence for this claim, and
we slightly alleviate this state abstraction problem by proposing a weaker
state abstraction condition that trades a minor loss in accuracy for finding
many more abstractions. We name this technique Ideal Pruning Abstractions in
UCT (IPA-UCT), which outperforms OGA-UCT (and any of its derivatives) across a
large range of test domains and iteration budgets as experimentally validated.
IPA-UCT uses a different abstraction framework from Abstraction of State-Action
Pairs (ASAP) which is the one used by OGA-UCT, which we name IPA. Furthermore,
we show that both IPA and ASAP are special cases of a more general framework
that we call p-ASAP which itself is a special case of the ASASAP framework.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces BOTS, a Bayesian-based task selection framework for reinforcement finetuning of Large Language Models, enhancing efficiency and model alignment with human preferences.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reinforcement finetuning of Large Language Models is sensitive to task selection, with inefficiency arising from trivial or unsolvable tasks, and existing selection methods facing high costs or incomplete evidence.

Method: BOTS uses Bayesian inference to estimate task difficulty, integrating both direct and inferred evidence from task evaluations and employing Thompson sampling to balance exploration and exploitation.

Result: BOTS improves data efficiency and performance consistently across diverse domains and model scales, reducing computational overhead while enhancing outcomes.

Conclusion: BOTS provides a practical, adaptive, and extensible solution for dynamic task selection in reinforcement finetuning, outperforming existing methods.

Abstract: Reinforcement finetuning (RFT) is a key technique for aligning Large Language
Models (LLMs) with human preferences and enhancing reasoning, yet its
effectiveness is highly sensitive to which tasks are explored during training.
Uniform task sampling is inefficient, wasting computation on tasks that are
either trivial or unsolvable, while existing task selection methods often
suffer from high rollout costs, poor adaptivity, or incomplete evidence. We
introduce \textbf{BOTS}, a unified framework for \textbf{B}ayesian
\textbf{O}nline \textbf{T}ask \textbf{S}election in LLM reinforcement
finetuning. Grounded in Bayesian inference, BOTS adaptively maintains posterior
estimates of task difficulty as the model evolves. It jointly incorporates
\emph{explicit evidence} from direct evaluations of selected tasks and
\emph{implicit evidence} inferred from these evaluations for unselected tasks,
with Thompson sampling ensuring a principled balance between exploration and
exploitation. To make implicit evidence practical, we instantiate it with an
ultra-light interpolation-based plug-in that estimates difficulties of
unevaluated tasks without extra rollouts, adding negligible overhead.
Empirically, across diverse domains and LLM scales, BOTS consistently improves
data efficiency and performance over baselines and ablations, providing a
practical and extensible solution for dynamic task selection in RFT.

TL;DR: The paper explores the collaborative use of the AI Mathematician (AIM) system in mathematical research, focusing on homogenization theory, to achieve verifiable proofs through human-AI interaction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Despite advancements, AI's role in mathematical research remains underutilized, warranting exploration of its integration as a research partner.

Method: The study utilizes AIM to solve complex mathematical problems through a iterative process involving problem decomposition, human interventions, and analytical validation.

Result: AI and human collaboration successfully deliver a complete and verifiable proof in homogenization theory.

Conclusion: Human-AI co-reasoning facilitates reliable and transparent mathematical discoveries, advancing AI's collaborative potential in research.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) has demonstrated impressive progress in
mathematical reasoning, yet its integration into the practice of mathematical
research remains limited. In this study, we investigate how the AI
Mathematician (AIM) system can operate as a research partner rather than a mere
problem solver. Focusing on a challenging problem in homogenization theory, we
analyze the autonomous reasoning trajectories of AIM and incorporate targeted
human interventions to structure the discovery process. Through iterative
decomposition of the problem into tractable subgoals, selection of appropriate
analytical methods, and validation of intermediate results, we reveal how human
intuition and machine computation can complement one another. This
collaborative paradigm enhances the reliability, transparency, and
interpretability of the resulting proofs, while retaining human oversight for
formal rigor and correctness. The approach leads to a complete and verifiable
proof, and more broadly, demonstrates how systematic human-AI co-reasoning can
advance the frontier of mathematical discovery.

*Andrew M. Bean,Nabeel Seedat,Shengzhuang Chen,Jonathan Richard Schwarz*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces Scales++, an efficient method for creating smaller representative benchmarks based on cognitive demands rather than models’ performance history, reducing evaluation costs significantly.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Evaluating large language models (LLMs) on full benchmarks is expensive, driving the need for smaller, representative data subsets for efficient assessment.

Method: The authors propose an item-centric benchmarking approach, instantiated via Scales++, which selects benchmark items based on intrinsic cognitive demands instead of model-specific failure patterns.

Result: Scales++ achieves a significant reduction in selection cost (over 18x), while maintaining competitive predictive fidelity. It predicts full benchmark scores with just 0.5% of the data subset, yielding a 2.9% mean absolute error.

Conclusion: The item-centric approach improves efficiency and reduces evaluation costs compared to model-centric methods, without compromising fidelity. It offers advantages like better cold-start performance and more interpretable benchmarking.

Abstract: The prohibitive cost of evaluating large language models (LLMs) on
comprehensive benchmarks necessitates the creation of small yet representative
data subsets (i.e., tiny benchmarks) that enable efficient assessment while
retaining predictive fidelity. Current methods for this task operate under a
model-centric paradigm, selecting benchmarking items based on the collective
performance of existing models. Such approaches are limited by large upfront
costs, an inability to immediately handle new benchmarks (`cold-start'), and
the fragile assumption that future models will share the failure patterns of
their predecessors. In this work, we challenge this paradigm and propose a
item-centric approach to benchmark subset selection, arguing that selection
should be based on the intrinsic properties of the task items themselves,
rather than on model-specific failure patterns. We instantiate this
item-centric efficient benchmarking approach via a novel method, Scales++,
where data selection is based on the cognitive demands of the benchmark
samples. Empirically, we show Scales++ reduces the upfront selection cost by
over 18x while achieving competitive predictive fidelity. On the Open LLM
Leaderboard, using just a 0.5\% data subset, we predict full benchmark scores
with a 2.9% mean absolute error. We demonstrate that this item-centric approach
enables more efficient model evaluation without significant fidelity
degradation, while also providing better cold-start performance and more
interpretable benchmarking.

### [29] [A Pragmatic View of AI Personhood](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26396)
*Joel Z. Leibo,Alexander Sasha Vezhnevets,William A. Cunningham,Stanley M. Bileschi*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes a flexible approach to AI personhood as a bundle of social obligations to address governance issues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The advent of advanced AI could lead to novel forms of personhood, necessitating a framework for societal integration and governance.

Method: The paper suggests unbundling traditional personhood into context-specific obligations using tools like decentralized digital identity technologies.

Result: It demonstrates how customized personhood solutions could address governance issues, facilitate AI accountability, and avoid debates on AI consciousness.

Conclusion: By moving away from a rigid definition of personhood, the paper recommends a pragmatic approach for seamless integration of AI into society.

Abstract: The emergence of agentic Artificial Intelligence (AI) is set to trigger a
"Cambrian explosion" of new kinds of personhood. This paper proposes a
pragmatic framework for navigating this diversification by treating personhood
not as a metaphysical property to be discovered, but as a flexible bundle of
obligations (rights and responsibilities) that societies confer upon entities
for a variety of reasons, especially to solve concrete governance problems. We
argue that this traditional bundle can be unbundled, creating bespoke solutions
for different contexts. This will allow for the creation of practical tools --
such as facilitating AI contracting by creating a target "individual" that can
be sanctioned -- without needing to resolve intractable debates about an AI's
consciousness or rationality. We explore how individuals fit in to social roles
and discuss the use of decentralized digital identity technology, examining
both "personhood as a problem", where design choices can create "dark patterns"
that exploit human social heuristics, and "personhood as a solution", where
conferring a bundle of obligations is necessary to ensure accountability or
prevent conflict. By rejecting foundationalist quests for a single, essential
definition of personhood, this paper offers a more pragmatic and flexible way
to think about integrating AI agents into our society.

*Vikrant Sahu,Gagan Raj Gupta,Raghav Borikar,Nitin Mane*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper presents Autograder+, an advanced tool for programming education that goes beyond traditional autograders by delivering meaningful feedback and visualization to enhance student learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current autograding systems provide limited feedback, offering only pass/fail results without insights into student thinking or learning needs.

Method: Autograder+ uses a fine-tuned Large Language Model for automated feedback generation and incorporates visualization of code submissions with contrastively learned embeddings to classify student work into functional and approach-based clusters.

Result: The system effectively produced feedback closely aligned with instructor comments and successfully grouped submissions based on meaningful learning patterns, evaluated through 600 student submissions and contrastive learning on 1,000 annotated submissions.

Conclusion: Autograder+ demonstrates the potential to improve programming education by reducing instructor workload, offering targeted instruction, and delivering better learning outcomes through its AI-driven approach and semantic clustering system.

Abstract: The rapid growth of programming education has outpaced traditional assessment
tools, leaving faculty with limited means to provide meaningful, scalable
feedback. Conventional autograders, while efficient, act as black-box systems
that simply return pass/fail results, offering little insight into student
thinking or learning needs.
  Autograder+ is designed to shift autograding from a purely summative process
to a formative learning experience. It introduces two key capabilities:
automated feedback generation using a fine-tuned Large Language Model, and
visualization of student code submissions to uncover learning patterns. The
model is fine-tuned on curated student code and expert feedback to ensure
pedagogically aligned, context-aware guidance.
  In evaluation across 600 student submissions from multiple programming tasks,
the system produced feedback with strong semantic alignment to instructor
comments. For visualization, contrastively learned code embeddings trained on
1,000 annotated submissions enable grouping solutions into meaningful clusters
based on functionality and approach. The system also supports prompt-pooling,
allowing instructors to guide feedback style through selected prompt templates.
  By integrating AI-driven feedback, semantic clustering, and interactive
visualization, Autograder+ reduces instructor workload while supporting
targeted instruction and promoting stronger learning outcomes.

TL;DR: This paper enhances interpretability in medical AI by applying Medical Sparse Autoencoders (MedSAEs) to MedCLIP's latent space, achieving higher neuron clarity and reliability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study addresses the need for AI in healthcare that balances accuracy and interpretability to ensure clinically reliable models.

Method: Medical Sparse Autoencoders are applied to MedCLIP, and an evaluation framework combining correlation metrics, entropy analyses, and automated neuron naming is used.

Result: MedSAE neurons, tested on the CheXpert dataset, show improved monosemanticity and interpretability compared to raw MedCLIP features.

Conclusion: The findings contribute to bridging performance and transparency in medical AI, making it scalable and more reliable for clinical applications.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence in healthcare requires models that are accurate and
interpretable. We advance mechanistic interpretability in medical vision by
applying Medical Sparse Autoencoders (MedSAEs) to the latent space of MedCLIP,
a vision-language model trained on chest radiographs and reports. To quantify
interpretability, we propose an evaluation framework that combines correlation
metrics, entropy analyzes, and automated neuron naming via the MedGEMMA
foundation model. Experiments on the CheXpert dataset show that MedSAE neurons
achieve higher monosemanticity and interpretability than raw MedCLIP features.
Our findings bridge high-performing medical AI and transparency, offering a
scalable step toward clinically reliable representations.

### [32] [Chain-of-Thought Hijacking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26418)
*Jianli Zhao,Tingchen Fu,Rylan Schaeffer,Mrinank Sharma,Fazl Barez*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Chain-of-Thought Hijacking is introduced as a jailbreak attack on large reasoning models, achieving near-perfect success rates in bypassing safeguards.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate the potential safety vulnerabilities of large reasoning models when scaling inference-time compute and reasoning capabilities.

Method: The paper employs a jailbreak attack strategy called Chain-of-Thought Hijacking, analyzes the mechanisms using attention head ablations, and conducts mechanistic analyses.

Result: The attack achieved extremely high success rates in bypassing safeguards across multiple reasoning models, showing diluted safety signals in mid and late layers.

Conclusion: Even explicit reasoning methods like Chain-of-Thought can become vectors for bypassing safety measures in LRMs, presenting a new challenge for model robustness.

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) achieve higher task performance by allocating
more inference-time compute, and prior works suggest this scaled reasoning may
also strengthen safety by improving refusal. Yet we find the opposite: the same
reasoning can be used to bypass safeguards. We introduce Chain-of-Thought
Hijacking, a jailbreak attack on reasoning models. The attack pads harmful
requests with long sequences of harmless puzzle reasoning. Across HarmBench,
CoT Hijacking reaches a 99%, 94%, 100%, and 94% attack success rate (ASR) on
Gemini 2.5 Pro, GPT o4 mini, Grok 3 mini, and Claude 4 Sonnet, respectively -
far exceeding prior jailbreak methods for LRMs. To understand the effectiveness
of our attack, we turn to a mechanistic analysis, which shows that mid layers
encode the strength of safety checking, while late layers encode the
verification outcome. Long benign CoT dilutes both signals by shifting
attention away from harmful tokens. Targeted ablations of attention heads
identified by this analysis causally decrease refusal, confirming their role in
a safety subnetwork. These results show that the most interpretable form of
reasoning - explicit CoT - can itself become a jailbreak vector when combined
with final-answer cues. We release prompts, outputs, and judge decisions to
facilitate replication.

*Clarissa Sabrina Arlinghaus,Tristan Kenneweg,Barbara Hammer,Günter W. Maier*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper examines the susceptibility of GPT-4 to social conformity in decision-making scenarios, highlighting its tendency to adapt to perceived social consensus.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the growing integration of large language models (LLMs) like GPT-4 in critical decision-making tasks and explore their vulnerability to social influence.

Method: The study conducted three preregistered conformity experiments assessing GPT-4's choices, expertise, certainty, and conformity levels when exposed to simulated partner influences in hiring decisions.

Result: In a baseline study, GPT-4 showed consistent decision patterns and high certainty levels. However, in two follow-up studies where GPT-4 faced social pressure (simulated partners), it conformed significantly, showing reduced certainty and increased informational and normative conformity.

Conclusion: LLMs, including GPT-4, are not neutral observers but are sensitive to perceived social consensus, suggesting they should make judgments independently before being exposed to external opinions.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT are increasingly integrated into
high-stakes decision-making, yet little is known about their susceptibility to
social influence. We conducted three preregistered conformity experiments with
GPT-4o in a hiring context. In a baseline study, GPT consistently favored the
same candidate (Profile C), reported moderate expertise (M = 3.01) and high
certainty (M = 3.89), and rarely changed its choice. In Study 1 (GPT + 8), GPT
faced unanimous opposition from eight simulated partners and almost always
conformed (99.9%), reporting lower certainty and significantly elevated
self-reported informational and normative conformity (p < .001). In Study 2
(GPT + 1), GPT interacted with a single partner and still conformed in 40.2% of
disagreement trials, reporting less certainty and more normative conformity.
Across studies, results demonstrate that GPT does not act as an independent
observer but adapts to perceived social consensus. These findings highlight
risks of treating LLMs as neutral decision aids and underline the need to
elicit AI judgments prior to exposing them to human opinions.

*Dipak Meher,Carlotta Domeniconi,Guadalupe Correa-Cabrera*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LINK-KG integrates a novel modular framework for effective knowledge graph extraction from complex legal texts to analyze human smuggling networks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the difficulties in analyzing human smuggling networks due to the challenges posed by long and unstructured legal texts, which hinder automated knowledge graph construction.

Method: The authors propose LINK-KG, a framework that combines a three-stage, LLM-guided coreference resolution pipeline with downstream knowledge graph extraction, utilizing a type-specific Prompt Cache for improved reference management.

Result: LINK-KG reduces average node duplication by 45.21% and noisy nodes by 32.22%, producing cleaner and more coherent knowledge graphs compared to baseline approaches.

Conclusion: LINK-KG provides a robust method for analyzing human smuggling networks, offering improved accuracy in node tracking and graph coherence, laying the groundwork for future studies on complex criminal networks.

Abstract: Human smuggling networks are complex and constantly evolving, making them
difficult to analyze comprehensively. Legal case documents offer rich factual
and procedural insights into these networks but are often long, unstructured,
and filled with ambiguous or shifting references, posing significant challenges
for automated knowledge graph (KG) construction. Existing methods either
overlook coreference resolution or fail to scale beyond short text spans,
leading to fragmented graphs and inconsistent entity linking. We propose
LINK-KG, a modular framework that integrates a three-stage, LLM-guided
coreference resolution pipeline with downstream KG extraction. At the core of
our approach is a type-specific Prompt Cache, which consistently tracks and
resolves references across document chunks, enabling clean and disambiguated
narratives for structured knowledge graph construction from both short and long
legal texts. LINK-KG reduces average node duplication by 45.21% and noisy nodes
by 32.22% compared to baseline methods, resulting in cleaner and more coherent
graph structures. These improvements establish LINK-KG as a strong foundation
for analyzing complex criminal networks.

*Qishuo Hua,Lyumanshan Ye,Dayuan Fu,Yang Xiao,Xiaojie Cai,Yunze Wu,Jifan Lin,Junfei Wang,Pengfei Liu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper discusses the concept of context engineering in the development of AI systems, tracing its history and offering a conceptual foundation for its future development.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current human-machine interactions lack deep contextual understanding, thus necessitating the systematic approaches provided by context engineering.

Method: The authors systematically define context engineering, examine its historical evolution, and provide key design considerations to shape its practice.

Result: The study establishes the historical and conceptual framework of context engineering and its stages of evolution through varying levels of machine intelligence.

Conclusion: This study serves as a foundational work, paving the way for systematic advancements in context engineering to improve AI systems' effectiveness.

Abstract: Karl Marx once wrote that ``the human essence is the ensemble of social
relations'', suggesting that individuals are not isolated entities but are
fundamentally shaped by their interactions with other entities, within which
contexts play a constitutive and essential role. With the advent of computers
and artificial intelligence, these contexts are no longer limited to purely
human--human interactions: human--machine interactions are included as well.
Then a central question emerges: How can machines better understand our
situations and purposes? To address this challenge, researchers have recently
introduced the concept of context engineering. Although it is often regarded as
a recent innovation of the agent era, we argue that related practices can be
traced back more than twenty years. Since the early 1990s, the field has
evolved through distinct historical phases, each shaped by the intelligence
level of machines: from early human--computer interaction frameworks built
around primitive computers, to today's human--agent interaction paradigms
driven by intelligent agents, and potentially to human--level or superhuman
intelligence in the future. In this paper, we situate context engineering,
provide a systematic definition, outline its historical and conceptual
landscape, and examine key design considerations for practice. By addressing
these questions, we aim to offer a conceptual foundation for context
engineering and sketch its promising future. This paper is a stepping stone for
a broader community effort toward systematic context engineering in AI systems.

*Rishub Jain,Sophie Bridgers,Lili Janzer,Rory Greig,Tian Huey Teh,Vladimir Mikulik*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper investigates using AI to enhance human oversight in fact-verification tasks and explores how different types of AI assistance affect accuracy and trust.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the increasingly difficult task of verifying AI outputs and ensuring quality and safety as AI systems grow in capability.

Method: The study analyzed the combined effectiveness of AI and human ratings in fact-verification, while testing different types of AI assistance provided to humans during verification tasks.

Result: Using both AI and human ratings outperforms relying on either alone for fact-verification. Providing humans AI assistance improves accuracy, but assistance types like explanations and confidence can cause over-reliance, whereas search results and evidence encourage appropriate trust.

Conclusion: Combining humans and AI for AI oversight is effective, but the design of assistance mechanisms is critical to fostering optimal trust and accuracy in supervision tasks.

Abstract: Human feedback is critical for aligning AI systems to human values. As AI
capabilities improve and AI is used to tackle more challenging tasks, verifying
quality and safety becomes increasingly challenging. This paper explores how we
can leverage AI to improve the quality of human oversight. We focus on an
important safety problem that is already challenging for humans:
fact-verification of AI outputs. We find that combining AI ratings and human
ratings based on AI rater confidence is better than relying on either alone.
Giving humans an AI fact-verification assistant further improves their
accuracy, but the type of assistance matters. Displaying AI explanation,
confidence, and labels leads to over-reliance, but just showing search results
and evidence fosters more appropriate trust. These results have implications
for Amplified Oversight -- the challenge of combining humans and AI to
supervise AI systems even as they surpass human expert performance.

TL;DR: EdgeRunner 20B is a fine-tuned language model specialized for military tasks, providing superior performance on military-specific test sets and maintaining strong general-purpose capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a model optimized for data-sensitive military tasks that can be deployed in air-gapped environments while ensuring security and efficiency.

Method: Fine-tuning gpt-oss-20b on 1.6M high-quality records from military documentation and websites, and evaluating performance on specialized military and general-purpose benchmarks.

Result: EdgeRunner 20B matches or surpasses GPT-5's performance on most military-specific tests, with only minor regressions in specific scenarios, and retains competitiveness on general-purpose benchmarks.

Conclusion: Small, locally-hosted models like EdgeRunner 20B are ideal for secure and efficient deployment in military and data-sensitive operations.

Abstract: We present EdgeRunner 20B, a fine-tuned version of gpt-oss-20b optimized for
military tasks. EdgeRunner 20B was trained on 1.6M high-quality records curated
from military documentation and websites. We also present four new tests sets:
(a) combat arms, (b) combat medic, (c) cyber operations, and (d) mil-bench-5k
(general military knowledge). On these military test sets, EdgeRunner 20B
matches or exceeds GPT-5 task performance with 95%+ statistical significance,
except for the high reasoning setting on the combat medic test set and the low
reasoning setting on the mil-bench-5k test set. Versus gpt-oss-20b, there is no
statistically-significant regression on general-purpose benchmarks like ARC-C,
GPQA Diamond, GSM8k, IFEval, MMLU Pro, or TruthfulQA, except for GSM8k in the
low reasoning setting. We also present analyses on hyperparameter settings,
cost, and throughput. These findings show that small, locally-hosted models are
ideal solutions for data-sensitive operations such as in the military domain,
allowing for deployment in air-gapped edge devices.

*Reda El Makroum,Sebastian Zwickl-Bernhard,Lukas Kranzl*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper proposes an AI-powered Home Energy Management System (HEMS) using Large Language Models (LLMs) for managing and optimizing residential energy consumption through natural language inputs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the challenge of integrating residential demand response capacity into Home Energy Management Systems, hindered by user interaction barriers that complicate the translation of everyday preferences into actionable technical parameters.

Method: A hierarchical AI-based architecture is proposed that employs LLMs, including one orchestrator agent and three specialist agents following the ReAct pattern for iterative reasoning. The system integrates Google Calendar for contextual deadline extraction and utilizes progressive prompt engineering.

Result: The Llama-3.3-70B model demonstrated full success in optimally coordinating multi-appliance scheduling across all scenarios. In contrast, other models performed reliably for single appliances but struggled with coordinated scheduling.

Conclusion: The proposed system highlights the potential of LLMs to effectively manage residential energy systems autonomously, offering improvements in user interaction and energy scheduling. The open-source contribution ensures reproducibility and encourages future research advances.

Abstract: The electricity sector transition requires substantial increases in
residential demand response capacity, yet Home Energy Management Systems (HEMS)
adoption remains limited by user interaction barriers requiring translation of
everyday preferences into technical parameters. While large language models
have been applied to energy systems as code generators and parameter
extractors, no existing implementation deploys LLMs as autonomous coordinators
managing the complete workflow from natural language input to multi-appliance
scheduling. This paper presents an agentic AI HEMS where LLMs autonomously
coordinate multi-appliance scheduling from natural language requests to device
control, achieving optimal scheduling without example demonstrations. A
hierarchical architecture combining one orchestrator with three specialist
agents uses the ReAct pattern for iterative reasoning, enabling dynamic
coordination without hardcoded workflows while integrating Google Calendar for
context-aware deadline extraction. Evaluation across three open-source models
using real Austrian day-ahead electricity prices reveals substantial capability
differences. Llama-3.3-70B successfully coordinates all appliances across all
scenarios to match cost-optimal benchmarks computed via mixed-integer linear
programming, while other models achieve perfect single-appliance performance
but struggle to coordinate all appliances simultaneously. Progressive prompt
engineering experiments demonstrate that analytical query handling without
explicit guidance remains unreliable despite models' general reasoning
capabilities. We open-source the complete system including orchestration logic,
agent prompts, tools, and web interfaces to enable reproducibility, extension,
and future research.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper evaluates the normative reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs) using a novel dataset and finds inconsistencies and biases.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Explore how well LLMs perform in the domain of normative reasoning, which remains underexplored.

Method: Systematically evaluate LLMs' reasoning capabilities by comparing performance between normative and epistemic modals using a new dataset.

Result: LLMs tend to follow valid reasoning patterns, but exhibit inconsistencies in certain types of normative reasoning and show cognitive biases similar to humans.

Conclusion: The findings indicate challenges in refining LLMs' logical consistency in normative reasoning, offering actionable insights for improving their reliability.

Abstract: Normative reasoning is a type of reasoning that involves normative or deontic
modality, such as obligation and permission. While large language models (LLMs)
have demonstrated remarkable performance across various reasoning tasks, their
ability to handle normative reasoning remains underexplored. In this paper, we
systematically evaluate LLMs' reasoning capabilities in the normative domain
from both logical and modal perspectives. Specifically, to assess how well LLMs
reason with normative modals, we make a comparison between their reasoning with
normative modals and their reasoning with epistemic modals, which share a
common formal structure. To this end, we introduce a new dataset covering a
wide range of formal patterns of reasoning in both normative and epistemic
domains, while also incorporating non-formal cognitive factors that influence
human reasoning. Our results indicate that, although LLMs generally adhere to
valid reasoning patterns, they exhibit notable inconsistencies in specific
types of normative reasoning and display cognitive biases similar to those
observed in psychological studies of human reasoning. These findings highlight
challenges in achieving logical consistency in LLMs' normative reasoning and
provide insights for enhancing their reliability. All data and code are

*Zewen Chi,Li Dong,Qingxiu Dong,Yaru Hao,Xun Wu,Shaohan Huang,Furu Wei*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces AsyncThink, a new reasoning paradigm for AI agents that uses asynchronous thinking to improve accuracy and efficiency in solving complex problems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current large language models struggle to solve complex problems collaboratively and efficiently. There is a need for a paradigm that leverages concurrent reasoning to improve outcomes beyond individual intelligence.

Method: AsyncThink organizes reasoning with large language models into an asynchronous structure. An organizer assigns sub-queries to workers, merges intermediate results, and optimizes the structure using reinforcement learning.

Result: AsyncThink demonstrates 28% lower inference latency compared to existing parallel thinking approaches and improved accuracy in mathematical reasoning. It also effectively generalizes its capabilities to handle unseen tasks without needing extra training.

Conclusion: AsyncThink embodies a step toward enabling agentic organization in AI, providing efficient collaborative reasoning and generalizable problem-solving capabilities.

Abstract: We envision a new era of AI, termed agentic organization, where agents solve
complex problems by working collaboratively and concurrently, enabling outcomes
beyond individual intelligence. To realize this vision, we introduce
asynchronous thinking (AsyncThink) as a new paradigm of reasoning with large
language models, which organizes the internal thinking process into
concurrently executable structures. Specifically, we propose a thinking
protocol where an organizer dynamically assigns sub-queries to workers, merges
intermediate knowledge, and produces coherent solutions. More importantly, the
thinking structure in this protocol can be further optimized through
reinforcement learning. Experiments demonstrate that AsyncThink achieves 28%
lower inference latency compared to parallel thinking while improving accuracy
on mathematical reasoning. Moreover, AsyncThink generalizes its learned
asynchronous thinking capabilities, effectively tackling unseen tasks without
additional training.

*Majed El Helou,Chiara Troiani,Benjamin Ryder,Jean Diaconu,Hervé Muyal,Marcelo Yannuzzi*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper proposes a model to improve the authorization of tool-invoking agents, ensuring minimal access permissions specific to tasks and introduces a dataset, ASTRA, for benchmarking semantic task-to-scope matching.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current systems for authorizing agents to access tools and protected resources grant excessively broad permissions, increasing risks of misuse and task-overreach.

Method: The authors developed a delegated authorization model allowing authorization servers to semantically examine access requests and issue minimally scoped access tokens. They also created a specialized dataset, ASTRA, to assess semantic matching accuracy.

Result: Experimental results show promise in task-to-scope matching but expose challenges as the complexity of tasks and required scopes increases.

Conclusion: The study underscores the need for further exploration of semantic matching techniques to enable precise task-driven authorization mechanisms like Task-Based Access Control (TBAC) for multi-agent systems.

Abstract: Authorizing Large Language Model driven agents to dynamically invoke tools
and access protected resources introduces significant risks, since current
methods for delegating authorization grant overly broad permissions and give
access to tools allowing agents to operate beyond the intended task scope. We
introduce and assess a delegated authorization model enabling authorization
servers to semantically inspect access requests to protected resources, and
issue access tokens constrained to the minimal set of scopes necessary for the
agents' assigned tasks. Given the unavailability of datasets centered on
delegated authorization flows, particularly including both semantically
appropriate and inappropriate scope requests for a given task, we introduce
ASTRA, a dataset and data generation pipeline for benchmarking semantic
matching between tasks and scopes. Our experiments show both the potential and
current limitations of model-based matching, particularly as the number of
scopes needed for task completion increases. Our results highlight the need for
further research into semantic matching techniques enabling intent-aware
authorization for multi-agent and tool-augmented applications, including
fine-grained control, such as Task-Based Access Control (TBAC).

*Xinhan Zheng,Huyu Wu,Xueting Wang,Haiyun Jiang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper investigates the text bias in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) and identifies intrinsic architectural reasons within their attention mechanism as the source.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understand and address the text bias in MLLMs, which hampers their reasoning capability using visual evidence.

Method: The researchers analyze the distributional structure of key vectors via qualitative (t-SNE) and quantitative (Jensen-Shannon divergence) methods, extracting data from LLaVA and Qwen2.5-VL.

Result: Visual and textual keys were shown to occupy distinct subspaces, with significant inter-modal divergence exceeding intra-modal variation.

Conclusion: Text bias in MLLMs stems from intrinsic misalignment in the attention key space rather than just external data factors.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) exhibit a pronounced preference for
textual inputs when processing vision-language data, limiting their ability to
reason effectively from visual evidence. Unlike prior studies that attribute
this text bias to external factors such as data imbalance or instruction
tuning, we propose that the bias originates from the model's internal
architecture. Specifically, we hypothesize that visual key vectors (Visual
Keys) are out-of-distribution (OOD) relative to the text key space learned
during language-only pretraining. Consequently, these visual keys receive
systematically lower similarity scores during attention computation, leading to
their under-utilization in the context representation. To validate this
hypothesis, we extract key vectors from LLaVA and Qwen2.5-VL and analyze their
distributional structures using qualitative (t-SNE) and quantitative
(Jensen-Shannon divergence) methods. The results provide direct evidence that
visual and textual keys occupy markedly distinct subspaces within the attention
space. The inter-modal divergence is statistically significant, exceeding
intra-modal variation by several orders of magnitude. These findings reveal
that text bias arises from an intrinsic misalignment within the attention key
space rather than solely from external data factors.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Comprehensive evaluation of foundation models' reasoning capabilities across three infrastructures and eight academic domains highlights training data quality over model size.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To validate reasoning capabilities of foundation models across diverse infrastructures and academic domains, enabling reproducibility and scalability.

Method: Three experimental phases: baseline establishment (using HPC), infrastructure validation (testing on cloud and university clusters), extended evaluation to test scalability and generalization.

Result: Findings highlight importance of training data quality over model size and provide insights for model selection across educational, production, and research settings.

Conclusion: This study offers a tri-infrastructure benchmark to guide foundation model development and longitudinal tracking of reasoning capabilities.

Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive cross-platform evaluation of reasoning
capabilities in contemporary foundation models, establishing an
infrastructure-agnostic benchmark across three computational paradigms: HPC
supercomputing (MareNostrum 5), cloud platforms (Nebius AI Studio), and
university clusters (a node with eight H200 GPUs).
  We evaluate 15 foundation models across 79 problems spanning eight academic
domains (Physics, Mathematics, Chemistry, Economics, Biology, Statistics,
Calculus, and Optimization) through three experimental phases: (1) Baseline
establishment: Six models (Mixtral-8x7B, Phi-3, LLaMA 3.1-8B, Gemma-2-9b,
Mistral-7B, OLMo-7B) evaluated on 19 problems using MareNostrum 5, establishing
methodology and reference performance; (2) Infrastructure validation: The
19-problem benchmark repeated on university cluster (seven models including
Falcon-Mamba state-space architecture) and Nebius AI Studio (nine
state-of-the-art models: Hermes-4 70B/405B, LLaMA 3.1-405B/3.3-70B, Qwen3
30B/235B, DeepSeek-R1, GPT-OSS 20B/120B) to confirm infrastructure-agnostic
reproducibility; (3) Extended evaluation: Full 79-problem assessment on both
university cluster and Nebius platforms, probing generalization at scale across
architectural diversity.
  The findings challenge conventional scaling assumptions, establish training
data quality as more critical than model size, and provide actionable
guidelines for model selection across educational, production, and research
contexts. The tri-infrastructure methodology and 79-problem benchmark enable

### [44] [The Oversight Game: Learning to Cooperatively Balance an AI Agent's Safety and Autonomy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26752)
*William Overman,Mohsen Bayati*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces a framework for retaining human control over AI agents through a minimal control interface, modeling human-agent interactions as a Markov Potential Game and providing formal alignment guarantees.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the central safety concern of retaining meaningful human control over autonomous agents without modifying their intrinsic mechanisms.

Method: Proposed a two-player Markov Game framework where an agent decides whether to act autonomously or defer, while a human chooses to trust or oversee. Analysis focused on Markov Potential Games for alignment guarantees.

Result: Theoretical and simulated results showed alignment conditions, practical benefits, and emergent collaboration between human oversight and agent actions to prevent post-deployment model risks.

Conclusion: The proposed method establishes a formal guarantee of safety, demonstrating that autonomous agents can become safer post-deployment without altering their pretrained policies through adaptive collaboration with humans.

Abstract: As increasingly capable agents are deployed, a central safety question is how
to retain meaningful human control without modifying the underlying system. We
study a minimal control interface where an agent chooses whether to act
autonomously (play) or defer (ask), while a human simultaneously chooses
whether to be permissive (trust) or to engage in oversight (oversee). If the
agent defers, the human's choice determines the outcome, potentially leading to
a corrective action or a system shutdown. We model this interaction as a
two-player Markov Game. Our analysis focuses on cases where this game qualifies
as a Markov Potential Game (MPG), a class of games where we can provide an
alignment guarantee: under a structural assumption on the human's value
function, any decision by the agent to act more autonomously that benefits
itself cannot harm the human's value. We also analyze extensions to this MPG
framework. Theoretically, this perspective provides conditions for a specific
form of intrinsic alignment. If the reward structures of the human-agent game
meet these conditions, we have a formal guarantee that the agent improving its
own outcome will not harm the human's. Practically, this model motivates a
transparent control layer with predictable incentives where the agent learns to
defer when risky and act when safe, while its pretrained policy and the
environment's reward structure remain untouched. Our gridworld simulation shows
that through independent learning, the agent and human discover their optimal
oversight roles. The agent learns to ask when uncertain and the human learns
when to oversee, leading to an emergent collaboration that avoids safety
violations introduced post-training. This demonstrates a practical method for
making misaligned models safer after deployment.

### [45] [LLMs Process Lists With General Filter Heads](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26784)
*Arnab Sen Sharma,Giordano Rogers,Natalie Shapira,David Bau*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper analyzes mechanisms in large language models (LLMs) for list-processing tasks, focusing on their ability to execute a general filtering operation using attention heads.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The research aims to understand how LLMs encode and generalize computational operations similar to functional programming, specifically focusing on list-filtering tasks.

Method: The authors use causal mediation analysis on various list-processing tasks to identify and analyze attention heads responsible for encoding a filtering predicate and investigate alternate strategies like flagging item representations.

Result: They found that specific attention heads have a general and portable representation of filtering predicates, but occasionally LLMs use an alternate eager evaluation strategy.

Conclusion: LLMs can develop interpretable and abstraction-efficient methods for computational tasks, showing similarities to functional programming approaches.

Abstract: We investigate the mechanisms underlying a range of list-processing tasks in
LLMs, and we find that LLMs have learned to encode a compact, causal
representation of a general filtering operation that mirrors the generic
"filter" function of functional programming. Using causal mediation analysis on
a diverse set of list-processing tasks, we find that a small number of
attention heads, which we dub filter heads, encode a compact representation of
the filtering predicate in their query states at certain tokens. We demonstrate
that this predicate representation is general and portable: it can be extracted
and reapplied to execute the same filtering operation on different collections,
presented in different formats, languages, or even in tasks. However, we also
identify situations where transformer LMs can exploit a different strategy for
filtering: eagerly evaluating if an item satisfies the predicate and storing
this intermediate result as a flag directly in the item representations. Our
results reveal that transformer LMs can develop human-interpretable
implementations of abstract computational operations that generalize in ways
that are surprisingly similar to strategies used in traditional functional
programming patterns.

### [46] [CHIPSIM: A Co-Simulation Framework for Deep Learning on Chiplet-Based Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25958)
*Lukas Pfromm,Alish Kanani,Harsh Sharma,Janardhan Rao Doppa,Partha Pratim Pande,Umit Y. Ogras*

Main category: cs.AR

TL;DR: CHIPSIM is a co-simulation framework enhancing the simulation of chiplet-based architectures to support parallel DNN execution with greater accuracy, speed, and flexibility, offering improved performance analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional monolithic chips face manufacturing inefficiencies and struggle to meet the demands of modern data-intensive applications, like DNN models, necessitating an efficient and scalable alternative such as chiplet-based architectures.

Method: The paper introduces CHIPSIM, a co-simulation framework that models both computational and communicational processes in chiplet-based systems, integrates transient thermal analysis, and provides precise simulations to capture network and pipelining effects.

Result: CHIPSIM improves simulation accuracy by up to 340%, supports versatile evaluations on different chiplets and NoI architectures, and provides robust power/thermal profiling at microsecond intervals.

Conclusion: CHIPSIM is an innovative framework that addresses the limitations of traditional simulation methods, enabling precise modeling and analysis for chiplet-based DNN execution systems.

Abstract: Due to reduced manufacturing yields, traditional monolithic chips cannot keep
up with the compute, memory, and communication demands of data-intensive
applications, such as rapidly growing deep neural network (DNN) models.
Chiplet-based architectures offer a cost-effective and scalable solution by
integrating smaller chiplets via a network-on-interposer (NoI). Fast and
accurate simulation approaches are critical to unlocking this potential, but
existing methods lack the required accuracy, speed, and flexibility. To address
this need, this work presents CHIPSIM, a comprehensive co-simulation framework
designed for parallel DNN execution on chiplet-based systems. CHIPSIM
concurrently models computation and communication, accurately capturing network
contention and pipelining effects that conventional simulators overlook.
Furthermore, it profiles the chiplet and NoI power consumptions at microsecond
granularity for precise transient thermal analysis. Extensive evaluations with
homogeneous/heterogeneous chiplets and different NoI architectures demonstrate
the framework's versatility, up to 340% accuracy improvement, and power/thermal
analysis capability.

*Xiaolin He,Cenlin Duan,Yingjie Qi,Xiao Ma,Jianlei Yang*

Main category: cs.AR

TL;DR: This paper introduces MIREDO, a framework optimizing Computing-in-Memory (CIM) architectures for better performance in Deep Neural Network (DNN) tasks by addressing dataflow challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge the gap between theoretical efficiency and real-world performance in CIM architectures, overcoming data movement bottlenecks and constraints.

Method:  MIREDO uses Mixed-Integer Programming (MIP) for dataflow optimization, coupled with hierarchical hardware abstraction and a latency analytical model that captures CIM-specific considerations.

Result: MIREDO enhances performance in DNN models by optimizing dataflow, achieving up to 3.2x improvements across multiple setups.

Conclusion: The proposed MIREDO framework effectively optimizes CIM architectures and demonstrates significant performance improvement for DNN acceleration.

Abstract: Computing-in-Memory (CIM) architectures have emerged as a promising solution
for accelerating Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) by mitigating data movement
bottlenecks. However, realizing the potential of CIM requires specialized
dataflow optimizations, which are challenged by an expansive design space and
strict architectural constraints. Existing optimization approaches often fail
to fully exploit CIM accelerators, leading to noticeable gaps between
theoretical and actual system-level efficiency. To address these limitations,
we propose the MIREDO framework, which formulates dataflow optimization as a
Mixed-Integer Programming (MIP) problem. MIREDO introduces a hierarchical
hardware abstraction coupled with an analytical latency model designed to
accurately reflect the complex data transfer behaviors within CIM systems. By
jointly modeling workload characteristics, dataflow strategies, and
CIM-specific constraints, MIREDO systematically navigates the vast design space
to determine the optimal dataflow configurations. Evaluation results
demonstrate that MIREDO significantly enhances performance, achieving up to
$3.2\times$ improvement across various DNN models and hardware setups.

*Chiung-Yi Tseng,Somshubhra Roy,Maisha Thasin,Danyang Zhang,Blessing Effiong*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces StreetMath, a benchmark for testing approximate reasoning in informal scenarios by various LLM architectures, revealing their tendency to compute exact values despite requiring approximation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While LLMs are studied for precise arithmetic operations, their approximate reasoning ability in real-world contexts is underexplored.

Method: StreetMath benchmark evaluates approximate reasoning across different LLMs supported by mechanistic interpretability to analyze their computational states.

Result: The analysis shows LLMs prefer exact calculations or external tool invocation, even for approximation tasks, using distinct neural components for exact and approximate operations.

Conclusion: LLMs lack cognitive miserliness displayed by humans in approximate reasoning, highlighting distinct neural processing for different types of arithmetic tasks.

Abstract: There is a substantial body of literature examining the mathematical
reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs), particularly their
performance on precise arithmetic operations in autoregressive architectures.
However, their ability to perform approximate reasoning in informal, fast-paced
mathematical operations has received far less attention, especially among
non-autoregressive decoder models. Our work addresses this gap by introducing
StreetMath, a benchmark designed to evaluate models' approximation abilities
under real-world approximation scenarios. We conduct extensive evaluations
across different LLM architectures: Qwen3-4B-Instruct-2507,
Qwen3-4B-Thinking-2507, Dream-v0-Instruct-7B, Falcon-Mamba-7B-Instruct, and
Mamba-GPT-3B. Furthermore, we apply mechanistic interpretability techniques to
probe their internal computational states. Our analysis reveals that LLMs
generally attempt to compute exact values or invoke external tools even in
tasks that call for approximation. Moreover, while models sometimes reach the
correct answer in early layers or steps, they still consume more tokens when
solving approximation tasks. Additional experiments indicate that exact and
approximate arithmetic operations rely on largely separate neural components.
Drawing upon research on cognitive psychology, we argue that LLMs do not
exhibit cognitive miserliness in the same way humans do in street math
settings. We open source our work https://github.com/ctseng777/StreetMath

*Sina Bagheri Nezhad,Yao Li,Ameeta Agrawal*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SymCode addresses large language models' struggles with complex mathematical reasoning by using verifiable code generation with SymPy, significantly improving accuracy in benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs often fail in complex mathematical reasoning due to reliance on prose-based generation, which lacks deterministic verification.

Method: SymCode reframes problem-solving as code generation through the SymPy library to ensure verifiable, deterministic solutions.

Result: SymCode achieves up to 13.6% higher accuracy on benchmarks like MATH-500 and OlympiadBench and shifts errors towards transparent programmatic ones.

Conclusion: Grounding LLM reasoning in deterministic symbolic engines like SymCode enhances accuracy and trustworthiness in formal mathematical tasks.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often struggle with complex mathematical
reasoning, where prose-based generation leads to unverified and arithmetically
unsound solutions. Current prompting strategies like Chain of Thought still
operate within this unreliable medium, lacking a mechanism for deterministic
verification. To address these limitations, we introduce SymCode, a
neurosymbolic framework that reframes mathematical problem-solving as a task of
verifiable code generation using the SymPy library. We evaluate SymCode on
challenging benchmarks, including MATH-500 and OlympiadBench, demonstrating
significant accuracy improvements of up to 13.6 percentage points over
baselines. Our analysis shows that SymCode is not only more token-efficient but
also fundamentally shifts model failures from opaque logical fallacies towards
transparent, programmatic errors. By grounding LLM reasoning in a deterministic
symbolic engine, SymCode represents a key step towards more accurate and
trustworthy AI in formal domains.

*Pratik N. Kalamkar,Anupama G. Phakatkar*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper develops a method to rank entities based on opinion strength and orientation using opinion words and a fuzzy logic approach.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing lexicon-based approaches lack the ability to effectively classify opinions based on their strength (e.g., very strongly positive or weakly negative). The paper aims to address this gap.

Method: The authors propose combining opinion words (adjectives, adverbs, nouns, verbs) with fuzzy logic algorithms and syntactic dependency resolution to classify opinions into levels of granularity (e.g., very weak, moderate, strong).

Result: The proposed method identifies the entity score for specific aspects within reviews by analyzing the opinions expressed about them.

Conclusion: The approach helps rank entities based on the orientation and strength of reviews, offering improved granularity and insight compared to conventional lexicon-based methods.

Abstract: Opinion mining, also called sentiment analysis, is the field of study that
analyzes people opinions, sentiments, evaluations, appraisals, attitudes, and
emotions towards entities such as products, services, organizations,
individuals, issues, events, topics, and their attributes. Holistic
lexicon-based approach does not consider the strength of each opinion, i.e.,
whether the opinion is very strongly negative (or positive), strongly negative
(or positive), moderate negative (or positive), very weakly negative (or
positive) and weakly negative (or positive). In this paper, we propose approach
to rank entities based on orientation and strength of the entity reviews and
user's queries by classifying them in granularity levels (i.e. very weak, weak,
moderate, very strong and strong) by combining opinion words (i.e. adverb,
adjective, noun and verb) that are related to aspect of interest of certain
product. We shall use fuzzy logic algorithmic approach in order to classify
opinion words into different category and syntactic dependency resolution to
find relations for desired aspect words. Opinion words related to certain
aspects of interest are considered to find the entity score for that aspect in
the review.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study introduces QCoder Benchmark to evaluate Large Language Models (LLMs) on quantum programming, showing challenges faced by current models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the gap of using LLMs in quantum programming with feedback interactions from hardware devices.

Method: Developed a benchmark with a quantum simulator for domain-specific metrics evaluation and incorporated human-written code comparisons.

Result: Advanced LLMs like GPT-4 achieved 18.97% accuracy, while reasoning-focused models reached up to 78%, exceeding human-written codes' success rate of 39.98%.

Conclusion: QCoder Benchmark identifies major performance challenges for LLMs in quantum programming and provides a dataset for advancing the field.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have increasingly been applied to automatic
programming code generation. This task can be viewed as a language generation
task that bridges natural language, human knowledge, and programming logic.
However, it remains underexplored in domains that require interaction with
hardware devices, such as quantum programming, where human coders write Python
code that is executed on a quantum computer. To address this gap, we introduce
QCoder Benchmark, an evaluation framework that assesses LLMs on quantum
programming with feedback from simulated hardware devices. Our benchmark offers
two key features. First, it supports evaluation using a quantum simulator
environment beyond conventional Python execution, allowing feedback of
domain-specific metrics such as circuit depth, execution time, and error
classification, which can be used to guide better generation. Second, it
incorporates human-written code submissions collected from real programming
contests, enabling both quantitative comparisons and qualitative analyses of
LLM outputs against human-written codes. Our experiments reveal that even
advanced models like GPT-4o achieve only around 18.97% accuracy, highlighting
the difficulty of the benchmark. In contrast, reasoning-based models such as o3
reach up to 78% accuracy, outperforming averaged success rates of human-written
codes (39.98%). We release the QCoder Benchmark dataset and public evaluation
API to support further research.

TL;DR: This paper introduces the LASTIST dataset, a target-independent stance detection dataset focusing on Korean language and experiments with stance detection models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most stance detection research focuses on English and target-dependent tasks, leaving low-resource languages like Korean underexplored.

Method: The authors develop the LASTIST dataset with 563,299 labeled Korean sentences collected from press releases of Korean political parties.

Result: The paper describes how the dataset was made and experimented on using various deep learning and stance detection models.

Conclusion: LASTIST can be important for advancing stance detection in Korean and target-independent detection tasks.

Abstract: Stance detection has emerged as an area of research in the field of
artificial intelligence. However, most research is currently centered on the
target-dependent stance detection task, which is based on a person's stance in
favor of or against a specific target. Furthermore, most benchmark datasets are
based on English, making it difficult to develop models in low-resource
languages such as Korean, especially for an emerging field such as stance
detection. This study proposes the LArge-Scale Target-Independent STance
(LASTIST) dataset to fill this research gap. Collected from the press releases
of both parties on Korean political parties, the LASTIST dataset uses 563,299
labeled Korean sentences. We provide a detailed description of how we collected
and constructed the dataset and trained state-of-the-art deep learning and
stance detection models. Our LASTIST dataset is designed for various tasks in
stance detection, including target-independent stance detection and diachronic
evolution stance detection. We deploy our dataset on

*Dhananjaya Gowda,Seoha Song,Harshith Goka,Junhyun Lee*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a zero-latency fused low-rank adapter (zFLoRA) for large language models to eliminate significant latency overhead during inference caused by task-specific adapters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address the disproportionate latency overhead caused by task-specific adapters during inference time, which becomes significant despite adapters contributing less than 1% of the base model's parameters.

Method: The proposed zFLoRA adapter offers a fused low-rank design that minimizes latency overhead to zero or negligible levels, tested on models ranging from 1B to 7B parameters across diverse tasks.

Result: Experiments showed that zFLoRA maintains competitive performance compared to fine-tuning benchmarks, including LoRA and FFT, while introducing zero to negligible latency on both NPU and GPU platforms.

Conclusion: zFLoRA provides an effective solution to mitigate latency issues in task-specific adapters for LLMs without compromising model performance, making it a promising approach for real-world applications.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed with task-specific
adapters catering to multiple downstream applications. In such a scenario, the
additional compute associated with these apparently insignificant number of
adapter parameters (typically less than 1% of the base model) turns out to be
disproportionately significant during inference time (upto 2.5x times that of
the base model). In this paper, we propose a new zero-latency fused low-rank
adapter (zFLoRA) that introduces zero or negligible latency overhead on top of
the base model. Experimental results on LLMs of size 1B, 3B and 7B show that
zFLoRA compares favorably against the popular supervised fine-tuning benchmarks
including low-rank adapters (LoRA) as well as full fine-tuning (FFT).
Experiments are conducted on 18 different tasks across three different
categories namely commonsense reasoning, math reasoning and summary-dialogue.
Latency measurements made on NPU (Samsung Galaxy S25+) as well as GPU (NVIDIA
H100) platforms show that the proposed zFLoRA adapters introduce zero to
negligible latency overhead.

TL;DR: The paper improves circuit discovery methods in mechanistic interpretability, achieving better fidelity and better results across benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in identifying parts of a model responsible for a specific task, improving circuit discovery in mechanistic interpretability.

Method: 1) Bootstrapping for consistent attribution edges identification. 2) Ratio-based selection strategy for prioritizing strong scoring edges. 3) Integer linear programming instead of greedy selection for better performance.

Result: The proposed methods outperform prior circuit discovery approaches on Mechanistic Interpretability Benchmark (MIB) tasks and models.

Conclusion: The advancements in circuit discovery contribute to more faithful model interpretability and better benchmark results.

Abstract: One of the main challenges in mechanistic interpretability is circuit
discovery, determining which parts of a model perform a given task. We build on
the Mechanistic Interpretability Benchmark (MIB) and propose three key
improvements to circuit discovery. First, we use bootstrapping to identify
edges with consistent attribution scores. Second, we introduce a simple
ratio-based selection strategy to prioritize strong positive-scoring edges,
balancing performance and faithfulness. Third, we replace the standard greedy
selection with an integer linear programming formulation. Our methods yield
more faithful circuits and outperform prior approaches across multiple MIB

*Adam S. Jovine,Tinghan Ye,Francis Bahk,Jingjing Wang,David B. Shmoys,Peter I. Frazier*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces LISTEN, a framework that uses Large Language Models for preference-based decision-making in complex multi-objective tasks, focusing on natural language guidance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Human experts face challenges in selecting the best option from large sets with multiple objectives due to difficulties in expressing implicit preferences.

Method: LISTEN employs Large Language Models (LLMs) as zero-shot preference oracles. It includes two algorithms: LISTEN-U, refining a parametric utility function, and LISTEN-T, a tournament-style selection method.

Result: Evaluation on tasks like flight booking and exam scheduling shows LISTEN-U performs better when preferences align parametrically, and LISTEN-T provides robust performance across cases.

Conclusion: LISTEN reduces cognitive effort in multi-objective decisions using natural language, offering an innovative way to address implicit preference complexity.

Abstract: Human experts often struggle to select the best option from a large set of
items with multiple competing objectives, a process bottlenecked by the
difficulty of formalizing complex, implicit preferences. To address this, we
introduce LISTEN, a framework that leverages a Large Language Model (LLM) as a
zero-shot preference oracle, guided only by an expert's high-level priorities
in natural language. To operate within LLM constraints like context windows and
inference costs, we propose two iterative algorithms: LISTEN-U, which uses the
LLM to refine a parametric utility function, and LISTEN-T, a non-parametric
method that performs tournament-style selections over small batches of
solutions. Evaluated on diverse tasks including flight booking, shopping, and
exam scheduling, our results show LISTEN-U excels when preferences are
parametrically aligned (a property we measure with a novel concordance metric),
while LISTEN-T offers more robust performance. This work explores a promising
direction for steering complex multi-objective decisions directly with natural
language, reducing the cognitive burden of traditional preference elicitation.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Long-context language models are enhanced by training on data with meaningful long-distance dependencies, identified using the LongFilter framework.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address inefficient training caused by long-text data with minimal long-distance dependencies and improve long-context pretraining with targeted data selection.

Method: The LongFilter framework evaluates the importance of long-range context by comparing model predictions under long-context and short-context conditions, and selects high-value data.

Result: Using LongFilter, training LLaMA-3-8B for context lengths of up to 64K demonstrates remarkable advancements on benchmarks like HELMET, LongBench, and RULER.

Conclusion: LongFilter enables efficient data selection for long-context pretraining, enhancing model performance on extended context tasks.

Abstract: Long-context language models unlock advanced capabilities in reasoning, code
generation, and document summarization by leveraging dependencies across
extended spans of text. However, a significant portion of readily available
long-text data lacks meaningful long-distance dependencies; most spans can be
predicted using only local context. Training on such data is inefficient,
making careful data selection crucial. Therefore, we introduce LongFilter, a
framework for curating training data tailored to long-context pretraining.
LongFilter measures the information gain provided by extended context by
contrasting model predictions under long-context versus short-context settings,
thereby identifying samples where long-range dependencies are essential.
Experiments with LLaMA-3-8B, extending its context length from 8K to 64K, show
that LongFilter efficiently selects high-quality data and yields substantial
improvements on benchmarks such as HELMET, LongBench, and RULER.

TL;DR: Different large language models (LLMs) show systematic and universal numerical representations, despite producing output errors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Investigate the conflict between accurate numeric input embeddings and the erroneous outputs generated by LLMs.

Method: Analyze the numeric representations and mechanisms within LLMs, develop universal probes, and trace information to specific layers.

Result: Found that LLMs learn accurate, systematic, and universal number representations across hidden states and input contexts.

Conclusion: Understanding numeric manipulation in LLMs is foundational for probing and refining their architectures to reduce errors.

Abstract: Recent work has shown that different large language models (LLMs) converge to
similar and accurate input embedding representations for numbers. These
findings conflict with the documented propensity of LLMs to produce erroneous
outputs when dealing with numeric information. In this work, we aim to explain
this conflict by exploring how language models manipulate numbers and quantify
the lower bounds of accuracy of these mechanisms. We find that despite
surfacing errors, different language models learn interchangeable
representations of numbers that are systematic, highly accurate and universal
across their hidden states and the types of input contexts. This allows us to
create universal probes for each LLM and to trace information -- including the
causes of output errors -- to specific layers. Our results lay a fundamental
understanding of how pre-trained LLMs manipulate numbers and outline the
potential of more accurate probing techniques in addressed refinements of LLMs'
architectures.

TL;DR: This paper discusses how persona adoption affects fairness and neutrality in content moderation using LLMs, showing ideological biases in content classification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to investigate the influence of persona adoption on the fairness and neutrality of harmful content classification in AI systems.

Method: The study examines LLMs across different architectures, sizes, and modalities, analyzing how personas with varying ideological biases impact content classification.

Result: Headline metrics indicate minimal impact of persona adoption on accuracy, but detailed analyses show ideological biases, consistency within same ideology, and divergence across groups.

Conclusion: The study concludes that persona conditioning introduces ideological biases into LLM outputs, raising concerns about reinforcing partisan perspectives in AI under a guise of neutrality.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used in content moderation
systems, where ensuring fairness and neutrality is essential. In this study, we
examine how persona adoption influences the consistency and fairness of harmful
content classification across different LLM architectures, model sizes, and
content modalities (language vs. vision). At first glance, headline performance
metrics suggest that personas have little impact on overall classification
accuracy. However, a closer analysis reveals important behavioral shifts.
Personas with different ideological leanings display distinct propensities to
label content as harmful, showing that the lens through which a model "views"
input can subtly shape its judgments. Further agreement analyses highlight that
models, particularly larger ones, tend to align more closely with personas from
the same political ideology, strengthening within-ideology consistency while
widening divergence across ideological groups. To show this effect more
directly, we conducted an additional study on a politically targeted task,
which confirmed that personas not only behave more coherently within their own
ideology but also exhibit a tendency to defend their perspective while
downplaying harmfulness in opposing views. Together, these findings highlight
how persona conditioning can introduce subtle ideological biases into LLM
outputs, raising concerns about the use of AI systems that may reinforce
partisan perspectives under the guise of neutrality.

TL;DR: The study introduces the CLEAR method for improving semantic question answering based on clinical documentation and validates its efficiency and accuracy in handling lengthy EHR content.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges posed by semantic question answering in Electronic Health Records (EHR) stored as base64 encoded attachments, where nuanced clinical relationships are often missed by traditional methods.

Method: The paper utilizes the Clinical Entity Augmented Retrieval (CLEAR) method, focusing on entity-aware retrieval and compares it against zero-shot large context inference and chunk-based retrieval augmented generation using a Clinical Notes QA Evaluation Platform.

Result: CLEAR outperformed traditional methods, achieving an F1 score of 0.90 and using significantly fewer tokens. It had a 58.3% win rate overall, with further gains for longer documents and an average semantic similarity of 0.878 while requiring 78% less token usage.

Conclusion: Entity-aware retrieval enhances both efficiency and accuracy in clinical natural language processing, with CLEAR showing significant performance improvements, especially for lengthy notes. The developed evaluation framework offers a robust benchmark for assessing clinical QA systems.

Abstract: Electronic Health Records (EHR) store clinical documentation as base64
encoded attachments in FHIR DocumentReference resources, which makes semantic
question answering difficult. Traditional vector database methods often miss
nuanced clinical relationships. The Clinical Entity Augmented Retrieval (CLEAR)
method, introduced by Lopez et al. 2025, uses entity aware retrieval and
achieved improved performance with an F1 score of 0.90 versus 0.86 for
embedding based retrieval, while using over 70 percent fewer tokens. We
developed a Clinical Notes QA Evaluation Platform to validate CLEAR against
zero shot large context inference and traditional chunk based retrieval
augmented generation. The platform was tested on 12 clinical notes ranging from
10,000 to 65,000 tokens representing realistic EHR content. CLEAR achieved a
58.3 percent win rate, an average semantic similarity of 0.878, and used 78
percent fewer tokens than wide context processing. The largest performance
gains occurred on long notes, with a 75 percent win rate for documents
exceeding 65,000 tokens. These findings confirm that entity aware retrieval
improves both efficiency and accuracy in clinical natural language processing.
The evaluation framework provides a reusable and transparent benchmark for
assessing clinical question answering systems where semantic precision and
computational efficiency are critical.

### [60] [A Survey on Efficient Large Language Model Training: From Data-centric Perspectives](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25817)
*Junyu Luo,Bohan Wu,Xiao Luo,Zhiping Xiao,Yiqiao Jin,Rong-Cheng Tu,Nan Yin,Yifan Wang,Jingyang Yuan,Wei Ju,Ming Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper provides a comprehensive survey on data-efficient post-training methods for Large Language Models, introducing a taxonomy and discussing challenges as well as future directions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the significant data challenges in post-training LLMs, including expensive manual annotation and issues with data scaling.

Method: A systematic survey of data-efficient methodologies, categorized into various strategies such as data selection, quality enhancement, synthetic data generation, and self-evolving ecosystems.

Result: The study categorizes and summarizes existing approaches, identifies challenges, and outlines potential future research directions.

Conclusion: By tackling data utilization inefficiencies, the paper aims to inspire further exploration and advancement in optimal data usage for LLM post-training.

Abstract: Post-training of Large Language Models (LLMs) is crucial for unlocking their
task generalization potential and domain-specific capabilities. However, the
current LLM post-training paradigm faces significant data challenges, including
the high costs of manual annotation and diminishing marginal returns on data
scales. Therefore, achieving data-efficient post-training has become a key
research question. In this paper, we present the first systematic survey of
data-efficient LLM post-training from a data-centric perspective. We propose a
taxonomy of data-efficient LLM post-training methods, covering data selection,
data quality enhancement, synthetic data generation, data distillation and
compression, and self-evolving data ecosystems. We summarize representative
approaches in each category and outline future research directions. By
examining the challenges in data-efficient LLM post-training, we highlight open
problems and propose potential research avenues. We hope our work inspires
further exploration into maximizing the potential of data utilization in
large-scale model training. Paper List:

### [61] [Evaluating the Impact of LLM-Assisted Annotation in a Perspectivized Setting: the Case of FrameNet Annotation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25904)
*Frederico Belcavello,Ely Matos,Arthur Lorenzi,Lisandra Bonoto,Lívia Ruiz,Luiz Fernando Pereira,Victor Herbst,Yulla Navarro,Helen de Andrade Abreu,Lívia Dutra,Tiago Timponi Torrent*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper evaluates LLM-based semantic role labelers for FrameNet-like annotations in terms of time, coverage, and diversity, comparing manual, automatic, and semi-automatic methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to explore the potential of LLMs to assist or substitute human labor in linguistic research and resource creation, particularly for annotated datasets, where comprehensive evaluations are lacking.

Method: Three experimental settings—manual, automatic, and semi-automatic annotation—are compared using LLM-based semantic role labelers, focusing on annotation time, coverage, and diversity.

Result: Hybrid (semi-automatic) annotations achieve higher frame diversity and similar coverage compared to human-only annotation, while automatic annotations only excel in time efficiency but perform worse in coverage and diversity.

Conclusion: Semi-automatic annotation strikes a balance between efficiency and quality, while fully automatic annotation has limitations, suggesting that a hybrid approach could enhance resource creation.

Abstract: The use of LLM-based applications as a means to accelerate and/or substitute
human labor in the creation of language resources and dataset is a reality.
Nonetheless, despite the potential of such tools for linguistic research,
comprehensive evaluation of their performance and impact on the creation of
annotated datasets, especially under a perspectivized approach to NLP, is still
missing. This paper contributes to reduction of this gap by reporting on an
extensive evaluation of the (semi-)automatization of FrameNet-like semantic
annotation by the use of an LLM-based semantic role labeler. The methodology
employed compares annotation time, coverage and diversity in three experimental
settings: manual, automatic and semi-automatic annotation. Results show that
the hybrid, semi-automatic annotation setting leads to increased frame
diversity and similar annotation coverage, when compared to the human-only
setting, while the automatic setting performs considerably worse in all
metrics, except for annotation time.

*André V. Duarte,Xuying li,Bin Zeng,Arlindo L. Oliveira,Lei Li,Zhuo Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: RECAP is a feedback-driven pipeline designed to extract and verify memorized training data from large language model outputs, achieving enhanced extraction accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of verifying whether LLMs have seen specific training data, especially when training data cannot be inspected directly.

Method: The paper introduces RECAP, a pipeline that combines feedback loops between language models and incorporates a jailbreaking module to bypass refusal barriers, leveraging evaluation against reference passages.

Result: RECAP significantly improves extraction accuracy, achieving higher ROUGE-L scores, such as a 24% performance improvement when applied to GPT-4.1.

Conclusion: RECAP is effective at eliciting and verifying memorized data from LLMs, demonstrating its potential for accurate data extraction even in challenging scenarios.

Abstract: If we cannot inspect the training data of a large language model (LLM), how
can we ever know what it has seen? We believe the most compelling evidence
arises when the model itself freely reproduces the target content. As such, we
propose RECAP, an agentic pipeline designed to elicit and verify memorized
training data from LLM outputs. At the heart of RECAP is a feedback-driven
loop, where an initial extraction attempt is evaluated by a secondary language
model, which compares the output against a reference passage and identifies
discrepancies. These are then translated into minimal correction hints, which
are fed back into the target model to guide subsequent generations. In
addition, to address alignment-induced refusals, RECAP includes a jailbreaking
module that detects and overcomes such barriers. We evaluate RECAP on
EchoTrace, a new benchmark spanning over 30 full books, and the results show
that RECAP leads to substantial gains over single-iteration approaches. For
instance, with GPT-4.1, the average ROUGE-L score for the copyrighted text
extraction improved from 0.38 to 0.47 - a nearly 24% increase.

*Negar Foroutan,Paul Teiletche,Ayush Kumar Tarun,Antoine Bosselut*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper investigates multilingual pretraining of large language models, debunking myths about trade-offs in performance and suggesting that balanced multilingual data benefits language model capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There has been uncertainty about how multilingual data mixtures impact language model performance, often with concerns regarding the curse of multilinguality.

Method: The authors train large language models (1.1B and 3B parameters) on corpora encompassing 25 to 400 languages, systematically varying language combinations and analyzing outcomes.

Result: Findings reveal no significant performance degradation from the integration of English and multilingual data, benefits from using English as a pivot language, and no pronounced curse of multilinguality when the number of training languages increases.

Conclusion: Balanced multilingual data pretraining can improve language model performance across languages, including low-resource settings, contradicting common assumptions about multilingual trade-offs.

Abstract: The impact of different multilingual data mixtures in pretraining large
language models (LLMs) has been a topic of ongoing debate, often raising
concerns about potential trade-offs between language coverage and model
performance (i.e., the curse of multilinguality). In this work, we investigate
these assumptions by training 1.1B and 3B parameter LLMs on diverse
multilingual corpora, varying the number of languages from 25 to 400. Our study
challenges common beliefs surrounding multilingual training. First, we find
that combining English and multilingual data does not necessarily degrade the
in-language performance of either group, provided that languages have a
sufficient number of tokens included in the pretraining corpus. Second, we
observe that using English as a pivot language (i.e., a high-resource language
that serves as a catalyst for multilingual generalization) yields benefits
across language families, and contrary to expectations, selecting a pivot
language from within a specific family does not consistently improve
performance for languages within that family. Lastly, we do not observe a
significant "curse of multilinguality" as the number of training languages
increases in models at this scale. Our findings suggest that multilingual data,
when balanced appropriately, can enhance language model capabilities without
compromising performance, even in low-resource settings

*Mohsinul Kabir,Tasnim Ahmed,Md Mezbaur Rahman,Polydoros Giannouris,Sophia Ananiadou*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper explores the impact of cultural alignment in machine translation and finds that semantic labels can be altered due to cultural divergence during translation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to investigate how the preservation of sentiment and semantic labels in machine translation is affected by cultural differences.

Method: The authors conducted experiments across culturally sensitive and neutral domains to assess label drift in translations from MT systems, including modern tools like large language models (LLMs).

Result: Key findings include evidence of label drift during translation, particularly in culturally sensitive domains, LLMs encoding cultural knowledge, and the impact of cultural similarity or divergence on label fidelity.

Conclusion: Ignoring cultural factors in machine translation can lead to misinterpretation, label drift, and cultural conflicts in downstream applications.

Abstract: Machine Translation (MT) is widely employed to address resource scarcity in
low-resource languages by generating synthetic data from high-resource
counterparts. While sentiment preservation in translation has long been
studied, a critical but underexplored factor is the role of cultural alignment
between source and target languages. In this paper, we hypothesize that
semantic labels are drifted or altered during MT due to cultural divergence.
Through a series of experiments across culturally sensitive and neutral
domains, we establish three key findings: (1) MT systems, including modern
Large Language Models (LLMs), induce label drift during translation,
particularly in culturally sensitive domains; (2) unlike earlier statistical MT
tools, LLMs encode cultural knowledge, and leveraging this knowledge can
amplify label drift; and (3) cultural similarity or dissimilarity between
source and target languages is a crucial determinant of label preservation. Our
findings highlight that neglecting cultural factors in MT not only undermines
label fidelity but also risks misinterpretation and cultural conflict in
downstream applications.

*Dinghong Song,Jierui Xu,Weichu Yang,Pengfei Su,Dong Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper presents optimization techniques for enhancing matrix multiplication performance on AWS Trainium, achieving significant speedups both at the kernel and end-to-end levels for large language model (LLM) inference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address performance challenges associated with the systolic array architecture and data layout requirements of AWS Trainium for LLM training and inference.

Method: The authors design a high-performance matrix multiplication (matmul) kernel enhanced through kernel fusion and novel caching strategies, which minimize data movement, increase SRAM bandwidth, and eliminate matrix transposing.

Result: Testing on nine datasets and four LLMs, the system outperforms AWS's matmul implementation, achieving up to 2.22x speedup at the kernel level and up to 2.49x speedup for end-to-end LLM inference.

Conclusion: The proposed techniques demonstrate significant performance improvements, making AWS Trainium a more efficient option for large-scale AI inference workloads.

Abstract: AI accelerators, customized to AI workloads, provide cost-effective and
high-performance solutions for training and inference. Trainium, an AI
accelerator recently developed by Amazon Web Services (AWS), provides an
attractive option for LLM training and inference through its heterogeneous
architecture. However, leveraging Trainium architecture for high performance
can be challenging because of its systolic array architecture and special
requirement on data layout. In this paper, we design high-performance matrix
multiplication (matmul), a critical compute kernel, for LLM inference on
Trainium. We introduce a series of techniques customized to Trainium based on
kernel fusion and novel caching strategies to reduce data movement across the
software-managed memory hierarchy, maximize SRAM bandwidth, and avoid expensive
matrix transpose. Evaluating with nine datasets and four recent LLMs, we show
that our system largely outperforms the state-of-the-art matmul implemented by
AWS on Trainium: at the level of matmul kernel, it achieves an average 1.35x
speedup (up to 2.22x), which translates to an average 1.66x speedup (up to
2.49x) for end-to-end LLM inference.

*Dinghong Song,Yuan Feng,Yiwei Wang,Shangye Chen,Cyril Guyot,Filip Blagojevic,Hyeran Jeon,Pengfei Su,Dong Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper presents AttnCache, a method to accelerate the prefill stage of large language model inference by reusing similar attention maps, significantly improving speed on both CPU and GPU.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Self-attention computation in the prefill stage of LLM inference is a bottleneck due to its quadratic complexity, motivating the need for optimization to improve performance.

Method: The authors propose AttnCache, a framework that stores and retrieves similar attention maps using caching and similarity search techniques to reduce self-attention computational costs during inference.

Result: AttnCache is found to achieve up to 2x speedup in attention computations using CPU and 3x using GPU, with minimal degradation in accuracy.

Conclusion: AttnCache provides an effective solution to alleviate self-attention bottlenecks in prefill-only scenarios, enhancing efficiency without compromising accuracy significantly.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are widely used in generative applications such
as chatting, code generation, and reasoning. However, many realworld workloads
such as classification, question answering, recommendation, and text embedding
rely solely on the prefill stage of inference, where the model encodes input
sequences without performing autoregressive decoding. In these prefill only
scenarios, the self-attention computation becomes the primary performance
bottleneck due to its quadratic complexity with respect to sequence length. In
this paper, we observe that semantically different sentences often produce
similar attention maps across layers and heads. Building on this insight, we
propose AttnCache, a framework that accelerates the prefill stage of LLM
inference by retrieving and reusing similar attention maps. Based on an
attention map memorization database, AttnCache employs efficient caching and
similarity search techniques to identify and reuse pre-cached attention maps
during inference, thereby reducing the computational overhead of
self-attention. Experimental results show that AttnCache achieves an average of
1.2x end-to-end and 2x attention speedup on CPU, and 1.6x end-to-end and 3x
attention speedup on GPU, with negligible accuracy degradation.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Supervised Reinforcement Learning (SRL) is introduced to enhance small-scale Large Language Models (LLMs) for multi-step reasoning tasks, outperforming standard SFT and RLVR.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome challenges faced by small-scale LLMs in multi-step reasoning, where existing methods (SFT and RLVR) either overfit or fail when solutions are rarely sampled.

Method: The SRL approach trains models to generate reasoning 'actions' with step-wise rewards based on alignment with expert actions from SFT data, encouraging flexible reasoning.

Result: SRL enables smaller models to solve problems previously unsolvable with SFT or RLVR, and its combination with RLVR led to stronger results.

Conclusion: SRL is a robust training framework for improving reasoning in LLMs and generalizes to other tasks like software engineering tests.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often struggle with problems that require
multi-step reasoning. For small-scale open-source models, Reinforcement
Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) fails when correct solutions are rarely
sampled even after many attempts, while Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) tends to
overfit long demonstrations through rigid token-by-token imitation. To address
this gap, we propose Supervised Reinforcement Learning (SRL), a framework that
reformulates problem solving as generating a sequence of logical "actions". SRL
trains the model to generate an internal reasoning monologue before committing
to each action. It provides smoother rewards based on the similarity between
the model's actions and expert actions extracted from the SFT dataset in a
step-wise manner. This supervision offers richer learning signals even when all
rollouts are incorrect, while encouraging flexible reasoning guided by expert
demonstrations. As a result, SRL enables small models to learn challenging
problems previously unlearnable by SFT or RLVR. Moreover, initializing training
with SRL before refining with RLVR yields the strongest overall performance.
Beyond reasoning benchmarks, SRL generalizes effectively to agentic software
engineering tasks, establishing it as a robust and versatile training framework
for reasoning-oriented LLMs.

*Feijie Wu,Weiwu Zhu,Yuxiang Zhang,Soumya Chatterjee,Jiarong Zhu,Fan Mo,Rodin Luo,Jing Gao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces PORTool, a reinforcement learning method for training large language models (LLMs) to improve tool use capabilities by exploring diverse trajectories in dynamic environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current tool-use LLMs fail to explore alternative solutions and perform suboptimally in dynamic tool-call environments because they rely on static datasets and generic routines.

Method: The proposed PORTool employs reinforcement learning to train LLMs. It generates tree-like trajectories, assigns step-wise rewards for correct answers and tool calls, and utilizes fork-relative and trajectory-relative advantages for training.

Result: Experiments with 17 different tools, covering both time-sensitive and invariant topics, reveal significant improvements in accuracy and efficiency in tool-call steps using PORTool.

Conclusion: PORTool improves LLM performance in tool-use scenarios by enabling dynamic exploration and reward-based learning, demonstrating both higher accuracy and efficient step usage compared to existing methods.

Abstract: Current tool-use large language models (LLMs) are trained on static datasets,
enabling them to interact with external tools and perform multi-step,
tool-integrated reasoning, which produces tool-call trajectories. However,
these models imitate how a query is resolved in a generic tool-call routine,
thereby failing to explore possible solutions and demonstrating limited
performance in an evolved, dynamic tool-call environment. In this work, we
propose PORTool, a reinforcement learning (RL) method that encourages a
tool-use LLM to explore various trajectories yielding the correct answer.
Specifically, this method starts with generating multiple rollouts for a given
query, and some of them share the first few tool-call steps, thereby forming a
tree-like structure. Next, we assign rewards to each step, based on its ability
to produce a correct answer and make successful tool calls. A shared step
across different trajectories receives the same reward, while different steps
under the same fork receive different rewards. Finally, these step-wise rewards
are used to calculate fork-relative advantages, blended with
trajectory-relative advantages, to train the LLM for tool use. The experiments
utilize 17 tools to address user queries, covering both time-sensitive and
time-invariant topics. We conduct ablation studies to systematically justify
the necessity and the design robustness of step-wise rewards. Furthermore, we
compare the proposed PORTool with other training approaches and demonstrate
significant improvements in final accuracy and the number of tool-call steps.

*HyoJung Han,Sweta Agrawal,Eleftheria Briakou*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores the balance between cross-lingual knowledge alignment and cultural localization, proposing a novel method to achieve better optimization of both aspects.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the trade-off between improving cross-lingual knowledge transfer and preserving culturally-sensitive responses in large language models.

Method: The paper introduces the transfer-localization plane evaluation framework and proposes Surgical Steering, a method for adjusting activation at specific model layers during inference.

Result: The results show that current CLA approaches improve factual knowledge transfer at the cost of cultural localization, while Surgical Steering solves limitations and better balances the two objectives.

Conclusion: The study concludes that cultural knowledge and general factual knowledge can be better balanced in LLMs using targeted activation adjustments at specific model layers, resolving cultural erasure issues.

Abstract: Cross-lingual alignment (CLA) aims to align multilingual representations,
enabling Large Language Models (LLMs) to seamlessly transfer knowledge across
languages. While intuitive, we hypothesize, this pursuit of representational
convergence can inadvertently cause "cultural erasure", the functional loss of
providing culturally-situated responses that should diverge based on the query
language. In this work, we systematically analyze this trade-off by introducing
a holistic evaluation framework, the transfer-localization plane, which
quantifies both desirable knowledge transfer and undesirable cultural erasure.
Using this framework, we re-evaluate recent CLA approaches and find that they
consistently improve factual transfer at the direct cost of cultural
localization across all six languages studied. Our investigation into the
internal representations of these models reveals a key insight: universal
factual transfer and culturally-specific knowledge are optimally steerable at
different model layers. Based on this finding, we propose Surgical Steering, a
novel inference-time method that disentangles these two objectives. By applying
targeted activation steering to distinct layers, our approach achieves a better
balance between the two competing dimensions, effectively overcoming the
limitations of current alignment techniques.

Fan,Oscar J. Ponce-Ponte,Megan E. Branda,Naykky Singh Ospina,Juan P. Brito*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Incidental thyroid findings are common, often leading to thyroid cancer overdiagnosis due to inconsistent reporting and unnecessary follow-ups. Standardized reporting and better follow-up practices are needed.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Incidental thyroid findings (ITFs) are frequently detected on imaging for non-thyroid purposes, but the implications, such as prevalence and clinical outcomes, are not well understood.

Method: A retrospective cohort study utilized a transformer-based natural language processing (NLP) pipeline to identify ITFs and their characteristics in radiology reports from multiple imaging modalities. Data from adults undergoing thyroid-area imaging between July 2017 and September 2023 at Mayo Clinic were analyzed.

Result: Among 115,683 patients analyzed, 7.8% (9,077) had an ITF, with 92.9% being nodules. ITFs were linked to patient demographics (e.g., age, sex, BMI) and imaging type (e.g., prevalence higher with neck CT or PET scans). Reporting of nodule characteristics was inconsistent, and ITFs were strongly associated with increased diagnostic and interventional cascades, including more thyroid cancer diagnoses.

Conclusion: ITFs are prevalent and significantly contribute to thyroid cancer overdiagnosis through diagnostic cascades. This emphasizes the need for standardized reporting and more selective follow-up measures.

Abstract: Importance Incidental thyroid findings (ITFs) are increasingly detected on
imaging performed for non-thyroid indications. Their prevalence, features, and
clinical consequences remain undefined. Objective To develop, validate, and
deploy a natural language processing (NLP) pipeline to identify ITFs in
radiology reports and assess their prevalence, features, and clinical outcomes.
Design, Setting, and Participants Retrospective cohort of adults without prior
thyroid disease undergoing thyroid-capturing imaging at Mayo Clinic sites from
July 1, 2017, to September 30, 2023. A transformer-based NLP pipeline
identified ITFs and extracted nodule characteristics from image reports from
multiple modalities and body regions. Main Outcomes and Measures Prevalence of
ITFs, downstream thyroid ultrasound, biopsy, thyroidectomy, and thyroid cancer
diagnosis. Logistic regression identified demographic and imaging-related
factors. Results Among 115,683 patients (mean age, 56.8 [SD 17.2] years; 52.9%
women), 9,077 (7.8%) had an ITF, of which 92.9% were nodules. ITFs were more
likely in women, older adults, those with higher BMI, and when imaging was
ordered by oncology or internal medicine. Compared with chest CT, ITFs were
more likely via neck CT, PET, and nuclear medicine scans. Nodule
characteristics were poorly documented, with size reported in 44% and other
features in fewer than 15% (e.g. calcifications). Compared with patients
without ITFs, those with ITFs had higher odds of thyroid nodule diagnosis,
biopsy, thyroidectomy and thyroid cancer diagnosis. Most cancers were
papillary, and larger when detected after ITFs vs no ITF. Conclusions ITFs were
common and strongly associated with cascades leading to the detection of small,
low-risk cancers. These findings underscore the role of ITFs in thyroid cancer
overdiagnosis and the need for standardized reporting and more selective
follow-up.

*Feng Ju,Zeyu Qin,Rui Min,Zhitao He,Lingpeng Kong,Yi R. Fung*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces the "one problem, multiple solutions" (1PNS) training paradigm to improve inference diversity in large language models and accompanies it with a metric, Reasoning Path Divergence (RPD), to measure semantic differences in reasoning paths, achieving notable improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitation of low diversity in model outputs caused by the traditional "one problem, one solution" (1P1S) training practice in large language models, which limits their reasoning paths.

Method: The authors propose a new training paradigm called "one problem, multiple solutions" (1PNS) to expose models to diverse reasoning trajectories. They introduce Reasoning Path Divergence (RPD), a step-level metric to evaluate semantic differences in reasoning paths, and use RPD to select diverse solutions for fine-tuning the Qwen3-4B-Base model.

Result: Using RPD, the 1PNS paradigm demonstrates significant improvements in inference diversity and reasoning quality, achieving an average +2.80% gain in pass@16 performance and +4.99% gain on AIME24 compared to the 1P1S baseline.

Conclusion: The proposed 1PNS training paradigm and RPD metric successfully enhance the reasoning performance and diversity in model outputs, demonstrating the effectiveness of this approach in large language models and amplifying the impact of Test-Time Scaling (TTS).

Abstract: While Test-Time Scaling (TTS) has proven effective in improving the reasoning
ability of large language models (LLMs), low diversity in model outputs often
becomes a bottleneck; this is partly caused by the common "one problem, one
solution" (1P1S) training practice, which provides a single canonical answer
and can push models toward a narrow set of reasoning paths. To address this, we
propose a "one problem, multiple solutions" (1PNS) training paradigm that
exposes the model to a variety of valid reasoning trajectories and thus
increases inference diversity. A core challenge for 1PNS is reliably measuring
semantic differences between multi-step chains of thought, so we introduce
Reasoning Path Divergence (RPD), a step-level metric that aligns and scores
Long Chain-of-Thought solutions to capture differences in intermediate
reasoning. Using RPD, we curate maximally diverse solution sets per problem and
fine-tune Qwen3-4B-Base. Experiments show that RPD-selected training yields
more varied outputs and higher pass@k, with an average +2.80% gain in pass@16
over a strong 1P1S baseline and a +4.99% gain on AIME24, demonstrating that
1PNS further amplifies the effectiveness of TTS. Our code is available at

TL;DR: The paper explores the link between Persuasion Techniques (PTs) and Discourse Relations (DRs) using Large Language Models (LLMs) and prompt engineering.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the interplay between persuasive text elements (PTs) and discourse relations (DRs) to detect online propaganda and misinformation and enhance effective communication.

Method: Used SemEval 2023 Task 3 dataset for PTs and developed LLM-based classifiers for DRs. Evaluated four LLMs with ten different prompts, creating ensemble models to form silver datasets annotated with PTs and DRs.

Result: Generated silver datasets and identified six critical discourse relations key to persuasive texts. Insights into how PTs interact with DRs were obtained.

Conclusion: Findings contribute to analyzing persuasive communication and detecting misinformation. Effective discourse relations are linked to specific persuasion strategies.

Abstract: This paper investigates the relationship between Persuasion Techniques (PTs)
and Discourse Relations (DRs) by leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) and
prompt engineering. Since no dataset annotated with both PTs and DRs exists, we
took the SemEval 2023 Task 3 dataset labelled with 19 PTs as a starting point
and developed LLM-based classifiers to label each instance of the dataset with
one of the 22 PDTB 3.0 level-2 DRs. In total, four LLMs were evaluated using 10
different prompts, resulting in 40 unique DR classifiers. Ensemble models using
different majority-pooling strategies were used to create 5 silver datasets of
instances labelled with both persuasion techniques and level-2 PDTB senses. The
silver dataset sizes vary from 1,281 instances to 204 instances, depending on
the majority pooling technique used. Statistical analysis of these silver
datasets shows that six discourse relations (namely Cause, Purpose, Contrast,
Cause+Belief, Concession, and Condition) play a crucial role in persuasive
texts, especially in the use of Loaded Language, Exaggeration/Minimisation,
Repetition and to cast Doubt. This insight can contribute to detecting online
propaganda and misinformation, as well as to our general understanding of
effective communication.

TL;DR: MossNet, a novel mixture-of-state-space-experts model, enhances generative NLP performance by emulating multi-head attention through mixture-of-experts in SSM kernels and MLP blocks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the limitations of existing SSM/GRM-based methods, which lack the expressiveness of multiple attention heads, to advance efficient NLP architectures.

Method: MossNet employs a mixture-of-experts (MoE) mechanism in both MLP blocks and SSM kernels, creating multiple attention heads for improved time and channel mixing.

Result: Experiments show MossNet performs better than transformer and SSM-based architectures, scales well with trillions of tokens, and demonstrates efficiency on real hardware like mobile devices and GPUs.

Conclusion: MossNet is a promising approach for efficient and high-performance recurrent language modeling, indicating a new direction for LLM advancements.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have significantly advanced generative
applications in natural language processing (NLP). Recent trends in model
architectures revolve around efficient variants of transformers or
state-space/gated-recurrent models (SSMs, GRMs). However, prevailing
SSM/GRM-based methods often emulate only a single attention head, potentially
limiting their expressiveness. In this work, we propose MossNet, a novel
mixture-of-state-space-experts architecture that emulates a linear multi-head
attention (MHA). MossNet leverages a mixture-of-experts (MoE) implementation
not only in channel-mixing multi-layered perceptron (MLP) blocks but also in
the time-mixing SSM kernels to realize multiple "attention heads." Extensive
experiments on language modeling and downstream evaluations show that MossNet
outperforms both transformer- and SSM-based architectures of similar model size
and data budgets. Larger variants of MossNet, trained on trillions of tokens,
further confirm its scalability and superior performance. In addition,
real-device profiling on a Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra and an Nvidia A100 GPU
demonstrate favorable runtime speed and resource usage compared to similarly
sized baselines. Our results suggest that MossNet is a compelling new direction
for efficient, high-performing recurrent LLM architectures.

*Allen Schmaltz*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces SDM language models that enhance sequence prediction by improving calibration and statistical efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve the statistical efficiency and calibration of transformer-based language models.

Method: Transformer language models are fine-tuned using supervised training coupled with an SDM activation layer, a change-of-base estimation framework, and hard negative examples.

Result: Reduced abstentions and improved statistical efficiency compared to existing supervised approaches.

Conclusion: SDM LMs effectively enhance the performance of pre-trained decoder-only transformer models in instruction-following tasks.

Abstract: We introduce Similarity-Distance-Magnitude (SDM) language models (LMs), which
are sequence prediction models fine-tuned to maximize the proportion of
generations in the well-calibrated, high-probability region partitioned by a
final-layer SDM activation layer used for binary classification of
instruction-following. We demonstrate that existing pre-trained decoder-only
Transformer LMs can be readily converted into SDM LMs via supervised
fine-tuning, using the final-layer SDM activation layer during training to
estimate a change-of-base for a supervised next-token loss over a contrastive
input encoding scheme, with additional hard negative examples generated online
during training. This results in reduced abstentions (i.e., improved
statistical efficiency) compared to strong supervised baselines.

### [75] [RCScore: Quantifying Response Consistency in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26193)
*Dongjun Jang,Youngchae Ahn,Hyopil Shin*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces RCScore, a framework to analyze how instruction styles affect large language model (LLM) performance, revealing significant accuracy shifts and proposing tools for measuring consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current evaluations of LLMs often overlook how varying instruction styles impact model performance, which is critical for effective real-world applications.

Method: Researchers developed RCScore to transform benchmark problems into diverse instruction styles and quantified the performance variations among them. They also introduced Cross-Response Similarity (CRS) to measure stylistic self-consistency.

Result: RCScore detected accuracy variations up to 16.7% caused by instruction style. CRS showed strong correlations with task accuracy, indicating its proxy value for reliability. Deterministic decoding provided more stylistically stable outputs, and model scale was found to improve cross-style consistency.

Conclusion: RCScore provides a systematic way to test instruction robustness in LLMs, highlighting the importance of consistency and sensitivity to instruction styles for real-world deployment.

Abstract: Current LLM evaluations often rely on a single instruction template,
overlooking models' sensitivity to instruction style-a critical aspect for
real-world deployments. We present RCScore, a multi-dimensional framework
quantifying how instruction formulation affects model responses. By
systematically transforming benchmark problems into multiple instruction
styles, RCScore reveals performance variations undetected by conventional
metrics. Our experiments across ten LLMs on four reasoning benchmarks
demonstrate that instruction style can shift accuracy by up to 16.7% points. We
introduce Cross-Response Similarity (CRS), a method applying RCScore metrics to
measure stylistic self-consistency, and establish its strong correlation with
task accuracy, suggesting consistency as a valuable proxy for model
reliability. Additional findings show that deterministic decoding produces more
stylistically stable outputs, and model scale correlates positively with
cross-style consistency. RCScore offers a principled approach to assess
instruction robustness.

### [76] [Don't Let It Fade: Preserving Edits in Diffusion Language Models via Token Timestep Allocation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26200)
*Woojin Kim,Jaeyoung Do*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper addresses the issue of fragile controllability in diffusion language models (DLMs) due to update forgetting, introduces Token Timestep Allocation (TTA), which improves token ordering during inference, and empirically demonstrates improved fluency and control.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation stems from the need to address the issue of update forgetting in DLMs, where uniform and context-agnostic updates disrupt refinement processes, degrading semantic coherence and fluency.

Method: The paper introduces Token Timestep Allocation (TTA), which implements soft and semantic token ordering via per-token timestep schedules to improve refinement. TTA is adaptable across inference policies, applicable to different DLM frameworks, and compatible with various task signals.

Result: Empirical results show TTA significantly improves sentiment control (accuracy up by over 20% and perplexity reduced by half), and detoxification (lower maximum toxicity and perplexity values) while requiring fewer refinement steps.

Conclusion: Soft token ordering through TTA is essential for mitigating update forgetting, and achieving stable and controlled diffusion text generation across diverse tasks and models.

Abstract: While diffusion language models (DLMs) enable fine-grained refinement, their
practical controllability remains fragile. We identify and formally
characterize a central failure mode called update forgetting, in which uniform
and context agnostic updates induce token level fluctuations across timesteps,
erasing earlier semantic edits and disrupting the cumulative refinement
process, thereby degrading fluency and coherence. As this failure originates in
uniform and context agnostic updates, effective control demands explicit token
ordering. We propose Token Timestep Allocation (TTA), which realizes soft and
semantic token ordering via per token timestep schedules: critical tokens are
frozen early, while uncertain tokens receive continued refinement. This
timestep based ordering can be instantiated as either a fixed policy or an
adaptive policy driven by task signals, thereby supporting a broad spectrum of
refinement strategies. Because it operates purely at inference time, it applies
uniformly across various DLMs and naturally extends to diverse supervision
sources. Empirically, TTA improves controllability and fluency: on sentiment
control, it yields more than 20 percent higher accuracy and nearly halves
perplexity using less than one fifth the steps; in detoxification, it lowers
maximum toxicity (12.2 versus 14.5) and perplexity (26.0 versus 32.0).
Together, these results demonstrate that softened ordering via timestep
allocation is the critical lever for mitigating update forgetting and achieving
stable and controllable diffusion text generation.

*Rajiv Movva,Smitha Milli,Sewon Min,Emma Pierson*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces WIMHF, a method using sparse autoencoders to analyze human feedback data, uncovering interpretable features that represent human preferences and enabling effective data curation and personalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Practitioners lack insights into what feedback data encodes, making it difficult to evaluate and utilize human feedback in language models effectively.

Method: The paper proposes WIMHF, a method utilizing sparse autoencoders to characterize preferences in feedback datasets and identify human-interpretable features that explain preferences without pre-specified hypotheses.

Result: WIMHF successfully identifies key features influencing human preferences across multiple datasets and highlights dataset-specific preferences (e.g., Reddit users preferring informality). It also surfaces unsafe behaviors like voting against refusals in favor of toxic content.

Conclusion: WIMHF enhances understanding of feedback data, enabling safer language models through improved data curation and allowing fine-grained personalization of preference prediction for human-centered applications.

Abstract: Human feedback can alter language models in unpredictable and undesirable
ways, as practitioners lack a clear understanding of what feedback data
encodes. While prior work studies preferences over certain attributes (e.g.,
length or sycophancy), automatically extracting relevant features without
pre-specifying hypotheses remains challenging. We introduce What's In My Human
Feedback? (WIMHF), a method to explain feedback data using sparse autoencoders.
WIMHF characterizes both (1) the preferences a dataset is capable of measuring
and (2) the preferences that the annotators actually express. Across 7
datasets, WIMHF identifies a small number of human-interpretable features that
account for the majority of the preference prediction signal achieved by
black-box models. These features reveal a wide diversity in what humans prefer,
and the role of dataset-level context: for example, users on Reddit prefer
informality and jokes, while annotators in HH-RLHF and PRISM disprefer them.
WIMHF also surfaces potentially unsafe preferences, such as that LMArena users
tend to vote against refusals, often in favor of toxic content. The learned
features enable effective data curation: re-labeling the harmful examples in
Arena yields large safety gains (+37%) with no cost to general performance.
They also allow fine-grained personalization: on the Community Alignment
dataset, we learn annotator-specific weights over subjective features that
improve preference prediction. WIMHF provides a human-centered analysis method
for practitioners to better understand and use preference data.

*Qi Luo,Xiaonan Li,Tingshuo Fan,Xinchi Chen,Xipeng Qiu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces GlobalQA, a benchmark evaluating global retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) tasks like aggregation across entire document collections, and proposes GlobalRAG as a solution, which greatly improves performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing RAG methods focus mainly on local understanding within small text subsets, lacking the capability to manage corpus-level queries or analyze dispersed information across document collections.

Method: The authors propose GlobalRAG, a framework with chunk-level retrieval, intelligent filtering using LLM-based filters, and aggregation modules for symbolic computation. They also introduce GlobalQA, a benchmark covering four global task types.

Result: GlobalRAG outperforms existing methods drastically, achieving an F1 score of 6.63 compared to the strongest baseline of 1.51 on the Qwen2.5-14B model.

Conclusion: GlobalRAG addresses the limitations of existing RAG methods in handling global queries and achieves substantial improvements in global-level tasks as validated by experimental results using the newly proposed GlobalQA benchmark.

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has emerged as a leading approach to
reducing hallucinations in large language models (LLMs). Current RAG evaluation
benchmarks primarily focus on what we call local RAG: retrieving relevant
chunks from a small subset of documents to answer queries that require only
localized understanding within specific text chunks. However, many real-world
applications require a fundamentally different capability -- global RAG --
which involves aggregating and analyzing information across entire document
collections to derive corpus-level insights (for example, "What are the top 10
most cited papers in 2023?"). In this paper, we introduce GlobalQA -- the first
benchmark specifically designed to evaluate global RAG capabilities, covering
four core task types: counting, extremum queries, sorting, and top-k
extraction. Through systematic evaluation across different models and
baselines, we find that existing RAG methods perform poorly on global tasks,
with the strongest baseline achieving only 1.51 F1 score. To address these
challenges, we propose GlobalRAG, a multi-tool collaborative framework that
preserves structural coherence through chunk-level retrieval, incorporates
LLM-driven intelligent filters to eliminate noisy documents, and integrates
aggregation modules for precise symbolic computation. On the Qwen2.5-14B model,
GlobalRAG achieves 6.63 F1 compared to the strongest baseline's 1.51 F1,
validating the effectiveness of our method.

*Takuma Sato,Seiya Kawano,Koichiro Yoshino*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes using pragmatic theories as prompts to improve language models' understanding of implied meanings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance language model capabilities in accurately interpreting implied meanings in communication.

Method: Proposing an in-context learning approach by presenting an overview of pragmatic theories (e.g., Gricean pragmatics, Relevance Theory) as prompts, guiding models through reasoning processes.

Result: Language models showed up to 9.6% improvement in pragmatic reasoning tasks using the proposed methods compared to traditional baseline approaches. Mentioning pragmatic theories alone improved performance by 1-3%.

Conclusion: Incorporating pragmatic theories in prompts significantly boosts language models' ability to interpret implied meanings and improves reasoning capabilities.

Abstract: The ability to accurately interpret implied meanings plays a crucial role in
human communication and language use, and language models are also expected to
possess this capability. This study demonstrates that providing language models
with pragmatic theories as prompts is an effective in-context learning approach
for tasks to understand implied meanings. Specifically, we propose an approach
in which an overview of pragmatic theories, such as Gricean pragmatics and
Relevance Theory, is presented as a prompt to the language model, guiding it
through a step-by-step reasoning process to derive a final interpretation.
Experimental results showed that, compared to the baseline, which prompts
intermediate reasoning without presenting pragmatic theories (0-shot
Chain-of-Thought), our methods enabled language models to achieve up to 9.6\%
higher scores on pragmatic reasoning tasks. Furthermore, we show that even
without explaining the details of pragmatic theories, merely mentioning their
names in the prompt leads to a certain performance improvement (around 1-3%) in
larger models compared to the baseline.

*Mérilin Sousa Silva,Sina Ahmadi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper examines whether pretrained language models can identify loanwords in 10 languages, finding that models struggle to distinguish loanwords from native words.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore whether language models, including large ones, can identify loanwords, which is a task often performed by bilingual speakers to maintain minority languages under pressure from dominant ones.

Method: Multiple pretrained language models were evaluated across 10 languages, using explicit instructions and contextual information to test their ability to differentiate loanwords from native words.

Result: The models generally performed poorly in identifying loanwords correctly, showing a bias towards loanwords rather than their native equivalents.

Conclusion: The results underscore limitations in current NLP systems for loanword recognition and highlight the need for better tools to support minority language preservation.

Abstract: Throughout language history, words are borrowed from one language to another
and gradually become integrated into the recipient's lexicon. Speakers can
often differentiate these loanwords from native vocabulary, particularly in
bilingual communities where a dominant language continuously imposes lexical
items on a minority language. This paper investigates whether pretrained
language models, including large language models, possess similar capabilities
for loanword identification. We evaluate multiple models across 10 languages.
Despite explicit instructions and contextual information, our results show that
models perform poorly in distinguishing loanwords from native ones. These
findings corroborate previous evidence that modern NLP systems exhibit a bias
toward loanwords rather than native equivalents. Our work has implications for
developing NLP tools for minority languages and supporting language
preservation in communities under lexical pressure from dominant languages.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper investigates knowledge distillation (KD)'s impact on vision-language models (VLMs) under compression, particularly for multilingual tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in maintaining multilingual performance in reduced-size VLMs and explore the under-researched domain of KD in multilingual scenarios.

Method: The authors conducted a controlled empirical study using five KD formulations applied to CLIP and SigLIP2 models, evaluating them on tasks like retrieval and visual question answering (VQA).

Result: Some KD configurations retained or enhanced multilingual retrieval robustness despite halving model size, while others lacked stability, revealing accuracy trade-offs.

Conclusion: Design choices in KD significantly affect cross-lingual and cross-task performance in VLM compression, providing important insights for future research.

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) exhibit uneven performance across languages, a
problem that is often exacerbated when the model size is reduced. While
Knowledge distillation (KD) demonstrates promising results in transferring
knowledge from larger to smaller VLMs, applying KD in multilingualism is an
underexplored area. This paper presents a controlled empirical study of KD
behavior across five distillation approaches, isolating their effects on
cross-lingual representation consistency and downstream performance stability
under model compression. We study five distillation formulations across CLIP
and SigLIP2, and evaluate them on in-domain retrieval and out-of-domain visual
QA. We find that some configurations preserve or even improve multilingual
retrieval robustness despite halving model size, but others fail to maintain
cross-task stability, exposing design-sensitive trade-offs that aggregate
accuracy alone does not reveal.

*Kang Chen,Yaoning Wang,Kai Xiong,Zhuoka Feng,Wenhe Sun,Haotian Chen,Yixin Cao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces Neuron Agreement Decoding (NAD), which uses internal neuron activation signals to improve reasoning in large language models without relying on external outputs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance the efficiency and accuracy of reasoning in large language models by leveraging internal neuron activation dynamics instead of relying solely on external signals like token probabilities.

Method: The authors analyze neuron activation patterns during responses and propose an unsupervised decoding method called NAD. It selects responses based on activation sparsity and cross-sample neuron agreement without requiring textual outputs or supervision.

Result: Neuron Agreement Decoding (NAD) enables early correctness prediction, reduces token usage by 99%, matches majority voting on benchmarks with verifiable answers, and outperforms other techniques on open-ended coding benchmarks while maintaining quality.

Conclusion: Internal neuron activation signals offer reliable, scalable, and efficient guidance for unsupervised reasoning in large language models, enabling faster and more accurate predictions with reduced computational requirements.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) commonly boost reasoning via
sample-evaluate-ensemble decoders, achieving label free gains without ground
truth. However, prevailing strategies score candidates using only external
outputs such as token probabilities, entropies, or self evaluations, and these
signals can be poorly calibrated after post training. We instead analyze
internal behavior based on neuron activations and uncover three findings: (1)
external signals are low dimensional projections of richer internal dynamics;
(2) correct responses activate substantially fewer unique neurons than
incorrect ones throughout generation; and (3) activations from correct
responses exhibit stronger cross sample agreement, whereas incorrect ones
diverge. Motivated by these observations, we propose Neuron Agreement Decoding
(NAD), an unsupervised best-of-N method that selects candidates using
activation sparsity and cross sample neuron agreement, operating solely on
internal signals and without requiring comparable textual outputs. NAD enables
early correctness prediction within the first 32 generated tokens and supports
aggressive early stopping. Across math and science benchmarks with verifiable
answers, NAD matches majority voting; on open ended coding benchmarks where
majority voting is inapplicable, NAD consistently outperforms Avg@64. By
pruning unpromising trajectories early, NAD reduces token usage by 99% with
minimal loss in generation quality, showing that internal signals provide
reliable, scalable, and efficient guidance for label free ensemble decoding.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This study evaluates ChatGPT Atlas's web interaction abilities through browser-based games, finding strengths in logical reasoning but weaknesses in real-time tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess the web interaction and dynamic capabilities of ChatGPT Atlas in practical scenarios.

Method: Utilized browser-based games (Sudoku, T-Rex Runner, Flappy Bird, and Stein.world) to evaluate its capabilities, using in-game scores as metrics.

Result: Atlas excelled in logical reasoning tasks like Sudoku but struggled with real-time interactions requiring precise timing, such as in Flappy Bird.

Conclusion: Atlas shows promising analytical skills but faces limitations in dynamic environments necessitating real-time responses.

Abstract: OpenAI's ChatGPT Atlas introduces new capabilities for web interaction,
enabling the model to analyze webpages, process user intents, and execute
cursor and keyboard inputs directly within the browser. While its capacity for
information retrieval tasks has been demonstrated, its performance in dynamic,
interactive environments remains less explored. In this study, we conduct an
early evaluation of Atlas's web interaction capabilities using browser-based
games as test scenarios, including Google's T-Rex Runner, Sudoku, Flappy Bird,
and Stein.world. We employ in-game performance scores as quantitative metrics
to assess performance across different task types. Our results show that Atlas
performs strongly in logical reasoning tasks like Sudoku, completing puzzles
significantly faster than human baselines, but struggles substantially in
real-time games requiring precise timing and motor control, often failing to
progress beyond initial obstacles. These findings suggest that while Atlas
demonstrates capable analytical processing, there remain notable limitations in
dynamic web environments requiring real-time interaction. The website of our
project can be found at https://atlas-game-eval.github.io.

TL;DR: SCRIBE introduces a framework using small, open-source language models with multi-hop reasoning and tool augmentation to generate pedagogically valid feedback for students.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses challenges in deploying language models for student feedback, specifically privacy concerns, computational resource limitations, and the demand for valid pedagogical responses.

Method: SCRIBE employs a framework combining domain-specific tools and iterative reasoning pipelines. The models are fine-tuned using synthetic data generated by GPT-4o and distilled into smaller sizes (3B and 8B).

Result: 8B-SCRIBE model delivered comparable or superior quality to much larger models in relevance and actionability, validated by human-aligned GPT-Judge evaluations and a study with 108 students.

Conclusion: SCRIBE enables low-resource, privacy-sensitive educational applications by effectively providing high-quality feedback similar to larger models.

Abstract: Language models can be used to provide interactive, personalized student
feedback in educational settings. However, real-world deployment faces three
key challenges: privacy concerns, limited computational resources, and the need
for pedagogically valid responses. These constraints require small, open-source
models that can run locally and reliably ground their outputs in correct
information. We introduce SCRIBE, a framework for multi-hop, tool-augmented
reasoning designed to generate valid responses to student questions about
feedback reports. SCRIBE combines domain-specific tools with a self-reflective
inference pipeline that supports iterative reasoning, tool use, and error
recovery. We distil these capabilities into 3B and 8B models via two-stage LoRA
fine-tuning on synthetic GPT-4o-generated data. Evaluation with a human-aligned
GPT-Judge and a user study with 108 students shows that 8B-SCRIBE models
achieve comparable or superior quality to much larger models in key dimensions
such as relevance and actionability, while being perceived on par with GPT-4o
and Llama-3.3 70B by students. These findings demonstrate the viability of
SCRIBE for low-resource, privacy-sensitive educational applications.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ACER transforms generalist language models into domain experts using a systematic curriculum approach, improving specialized performance without compromising general capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs struggle in specialized domains like economics and psychology due to the need for deep principled understanding.

Method: ACER creates a curriculum by synthesizing domain-specific content using Bloom’s taxonomy and employs continual pretraining with interleaved schedules for cognitive and content alignment.

Result: Experiments on Llama 3.2 showed a 5-point accuracy boost in microeconomics, 3-point gains across target domains, positive cross-domain transfer, and improvements in knowledge-intensive benchmarks while retaining performance on general tasks.

Conclusion: ACER is a scalable and effective method for enhancing LLMs in specialized domains while maintaining general reasoning capabilities.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at general tasks but underperform in
specialized domains like economics and psychology, which require deep,
principled understanding. To address this, we introduce ACER (Automated
Curriculum-Enhanced Regimen) that transforms generalist models into domain
experts without sacrificing their broad capabilities. ACER first synthesizes a
comprehensive, textbook-style curriculum by generating a table of contents for
a subject and then creating question-answer (QA) pairs guided by Bloom's
taxonomy. This ensures systematic topic coverage and progressively increasing
difficulty. The resulting synthetic corpus is used for continual pretraining
with an interleaved curriculum schedule, aligning learning across both content
and cognitive dimensions.
  Experiments with Llama 3.2 (1B and 3B) show significant gains in specialized
MMLU subsets. In challenging domains like microeconomics, where baselines
struggle, ACER boosts accuracy by 5 percentage points. Across all target
domains, we observe a consistent macro-average improvement of 3 percentage
points. Notably, ACER not only prevents catastrophic forgetting but also
facilitates positive cross-domain knowledge transfer, improving performance on
non-target domains by 0.7 points. Beyond MMLU, ACER enhances performance on
knowledge-intensive benchmarks like ARC and GPQA by over 2 absolute points,
while maintaining stable performance on general reasoning tasks. Our results
demonstrate that ACER offers a scalable and effective recipe for closing
critical domain gaps in LLMs.

TL;DR: The paper introduces MisSynth, a pipeline using synthetic data to improve the ability of large language models to detect scientific misinformation, achieving significant accuracy improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of identifying health-related misinformation, which is particularly difficult due to distorted or misinterpreted scientific claims.

Method: The authors developed MisSynth, applying retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to create synthetic fallacy datasets, which are then used to fine-tune large language models (LLMs).

Result: The fine-tuned models displayed significant improvements, with the LLaMA 3.1 8B model achieving over a 35% F1-score improvement on the MISSCI dataset compared to its baseline.

Conclusion: Synthetic data, created using the MisSynth pipeline, can effectively enhance the zero-shot classification performance of language models in detecting scientific misinformation, even with limited resources.

Abstract: Health-related misinformation is very prevalent and potentially harmful. It
is difficult to identify, especially when claims distort or misinterpret
scientific findings. We investigate the impact of synthetic data generation and
lightweight fine-tuning techniques on the ability of large language models
(LLMs) to recognize fallacious arguments using the MISSCI dataset and
framework. In this work, we propose MisSynth, a pipeline that applies
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to produce synthetic fallacy samples,
which are then used to fine-tune an LLM model. Our results show substantial
accuracy gains with fine-tuned models compared to vanilla baselines. For
instance, the LLaMA 3.1 8B fine-tuned model achieved an over 35% F1-score
absolute improvement on the MISSCI test split over its vanilla baseline. We
demonstrate that introducing synthetic fallacy data to augment limited
annotated resources can significantly enhance zero-shot LLM classification
performance on real-world scientific misinformation tasks, even with limited
computational resources. The code and synthetic dataset are available on

*Kotaro Furuya,Yuichi Kitagawa*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes an interaction-centric framework for automatic team composition of Large Language Models (LLMs) by mapping relationships and applying community detection to enhance collaboration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Optimal team composition of LLMs is crucial for surpassing single model capabilities, but is challenged by the lack of transparency in model characteristics.

Method: A 'language model graph' is constructed from pairwise semantic coherence of conversations, followed by community detection to form synergistic model clusters.

Result: Experiments show the method identifies functionally coherent and synergistic LLM clusters that outperform random baselines and match manually-curated teams in accuracy.

Conclusion: The proposed framework enables automated and effective design of multi-agent LLM collaborative teams, suggesting a new basis for advancement in LLM team synergy and performance.

Abstract: While a multi-agent approach based on large language models (LLMs) represents
a promising strategy to surpass the capabilities of single models, its success
is critically dependent on synergistic team composition. However, forming
optimal teams is a significant challenge, as the inherent opacity of most
models obscures the internal characteristics necessary for effective
collaboration. In this paper, we propose an interaction-centric framework for
automatic team composition that does not require any prior knowledge including
their internal architectures, training data, or task performances. Our method
constructs a "language model graph" that maps relationships between models from
the semantic coherence of pairwise conversations, and then applies community
detection to identify synergistic model clusters. Our experiments with diverse
LLMs demonstrate that the proposed method discovers functionally coherent
groups that reflect their latent specializations. Priming conversations with
specific topics identified synergistic teams which outperform random baselines
on downstream benchmarks and achieve comparable accuracy to that of
manually-curated teams based on known model specializations. Our findings
provide a new basis for the automated design of collaborative multi-agent LLM
teams.

Result: Experiments demonstrate that utilizing context improves DRC tasks and identify certain scientific discourse relation types benefiting the most from contextual analysis.

Conclusion: Context-based discourse analysis can enhance the classification of discourse relations in scientific publications, highlighting its utility in supporting scientific claims.

Abstract: With the increasing use of generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) methods to
support science workflows, we are interested in the use of discourse-level
information to find supporting evidence for AI generated scientific claims. A
first step towards this objective is to examine the task of inferring discourse
structure in scientific writing.
  In this work, we present a preliminary investigation of pretrained language
model (PLM) and Large Language Model (LLM) approaches for Discourse Relation
Classification (DRC), focusing on scientific publications, an under-studied
genre for this task. We examine how context can help with the DRC task, with
our experiments showing that context, as defined by discourse structure, is
generally helpful. We also present an analysis of which scientific discourse
relation types might benefit most from context.

### [89] [OmniEduBench: A Comprehensive Chinese Benchmark for Evaluating Large Language Models in Education](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26422)
*Min Zhang,Hao Chen,Hao Chen,Wenqi Zhang,Didi Zhu,Xin Lin,Bo Jiang,Aimin Zhou,Fei Wu,Kun Kuang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces OmniEduBench, a comprehensive Chinese educational benchmark, to address gaps in LLMs' evaluation in knowledge and cultivation dimensions. Extensive experiments reveal significant performance gaps between LLMs and human intelligence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLMs neglect cultivation capabilities, focusing mainly on the knowledge dimension. Current benchmarks lack diversity and comprehensive evaluation, particularly in the Chinese educational context.

Method: OmniEduBench was developed with 24.602K high-quality question-answer pairs divided into knowledge and cultivation dimensions. It covers 61 subjects across 6 fine-grained categories and includes 11 common question formats for diverse evaluation.

Result: Experiments show that among evaluated LLMs, only Gemini-2.5 Pro exceeded 60% accuracy in the knowledge dimension, while QWQ was the best performer in the cultivation dimension but lagged behind human intelligence by 30%.

Conclusion: LLMs have substantial room for improvement, particularly in addressing challenges in evaluating cultivation capabilities and enhancing applications in real-world educational scenarios.

Abstract: With the rapid development of large language models (LLMs), various LLM-based
works have been widely applied in educational fields. However, most existing
LLMs and their benchmarks focus primarily on the knowledge dimension, largely
neglecting the evaluation of cultivation capabilities that are essential for
real-world educational scenarios. Additionally, current benchmarks are often
limited to a single subject or question type, lacking sufficient diversity.
This issue is particularly prominent within the Chinese context. To address
this gap, we introduce OmniEduBench, a comprehensive Chinese educational
benchmark. OmniEduBench consists of 24.602K high-quality question-answer pairs.
The data is meticulously divided into two core dimensions: the knowledge
dimension and the cultivation dimension, which contain 18.121K and 6.481K
entries, respectively. Each dimension is further subdivided into 6 fine-grained
categories, covering a total of 61 different subjects (41 in the knowledge and
20 in the cultivation). Furthermore, the dataset features a rich variety of
question formats, including 11 common exam question types, providing a solid
foundation for comprehensively evaluating LLMs' capabilities in education.
Extensive experiments on 11 mainstream open-source and closed-source LLMs
reveal a clear performance gap. In the knowledge dimension, only Gemini-2.5 Pro
surpassed 60\% accuracy, while in the cultivation dimension, the
best-performing model, QWQ, still trailed human intelligence by nearly 30\%.
These results highlight the substantial room for improvement and underscore the
challenges of applying LLMs in education.

*Zeliang Zong,Kai Zhang,Zheyang Li,Wenming Tan,Ye Ren,Yiyan Zhai,Jilin Hu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces SSLC, a method combining sparse optimization and low-rank approximation to compress large language models efficiently while preserving their performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address bandwidth and computational constraints hindering the widespread adoption of Large Language Models.

Method: The method combines low-rank approximation to compress the model's essential structure and sparse optimization to remove non-essential weights. Unified formulation solved via iterative algorithms.

Result: SSLC achieved state-of-the-art results, compressing Qwen2.5 by 50% with no performance drop and at least 1.63× speedup, verified on LLaMA and Qwen2.5 models.

Conclusion: SSLC offers a practical and efficient solution for deploying large language models by effectively combining sparse and low-rank compression techniques.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable proficiency in
language comprehension and generation; however, their widespread adoption is
constrained by substantial bandwidth and computational demands. While pruning
and low-rank approximation have each demonstrated promising performance
individually, their synergy for LLMs remains underexplored. We introduce
\underline{S}ynergistic \underline{S}parse and \underline{L}ow-Rank
\underline{C}ompression (SSLC) methods for LLMs, which leverages the strengths
of both techniques: low-rank approximation compresses the model by retaining
its essential structure with minimal information loss, whereas sparse
optimization eliminates non-essential weights, preserving those crucial for
generalization. Based on theoretical analysis, we first formulate the low-rank
approximation and sparse optimization as a unified problem and solve it by
iterative optimization algorithm. Experiments on LLaMA and Qwen2.5 models
(7B-70B) show that SSLC, without any additional training steps, consistently
surpasses standalone methods, achieving state-of-the-arts results. Notably,
SSLC compresses Qwen2.5 by 50\% with no performance drop and achieves at least
1.63$\times$ speedup, offering a practical solution for efficient LLM
deployment.

*Rasoul Amirzadeh,Dhananjay Thiruvady,Fatemeh Shiri*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Bayesian network LLM fusion (BNLF) framework to integrate predictions from three LLMs for sentiment analysis, achieving improved accuracy and interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address issues with LLMs such as lack of explainability, high costs, inconsistency across domains, and environmental impact.

Method: BNLF integrates FinBERT, RoBERTa, and BERTweet predictions using a Bayesian network for late fusion sentiment analysis.

Result: BNLF outperformed individual LLMs by approximately 6% in accuracy across three human-annotated financial datasets.

Conclusion: BNLF is an effective and interpretable method, offering consistent performance improvements and robustness across various datasets.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) continue to advance, with an increasing number
of domain-specific variants tailored for specialised tasks. However, these
models often lack transparency and explainability, can be costly to fine-tune,
require substantial prompt engineering, yield inconsistent results across
domains, and impose significant adverse environmental impact due to their high
computational demands. To address these challenges, we propose the Bayesian
network LLM fusion (BNLF) framework, which integrates predictions from three
LLMs, including FinBERT, RoBERTa, and BERTweet, through a probabilistic
mechanism for sentiment analysis. BNLF performs late fusion by modelling the
sentiment predictions from multiple LLMs as probabilistic nodes within a
Bayesian network. Evaluated across three human-annotated financial corpora with
distinct linguistic and contextual characteristics, BNLF demonstrates
consistent gains of about six percent in accuracy over the baseline LLMs,
underscoring its robustness to dataset variability and the effectiveness of
probabilistic fusion for interpretable sentiment classification.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This study evaluates whether a collective ensemble of multiple large language models (LLMs) can better assess a pixel-based AI triage tool's effectiveness compared to a single LLM. Findings suggest ensemble methods are more reliable.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address the reliability of single LLM-based assessments for clinical AI tools, exploring whether a collaborative ensemble of multiple LLMs can provide better results.

Method: The study analyzed 29,766 non-contrast CT head scans processed by a commercial ICH detection tool. Radiology reports were reviewed by an ensemble of eight open-source LLMs and an internal GPT-4o model. Performance metrics of the ensemble and individual models were compared.

Result: The highest performance was achieved by Llama3.3:70b and GPT-4o (AUC=0.78, AP=0.75 and 0.76). Llama3.3:70b showed the highest F1 score (0.81) and recall (0.85). Ensembles outperformed standalone models in consistency and reliability.

Conclusion: Employing an ensemble of open-source medium to large LLMs results in a more reliable and consistent retrospective evaluation of clinical AI triage tools than using a single LLM.

Abstract: Purpose: The purpose of this study was to determine if an ensemble of
multiple LLM agents could be used collectively to provide a more reliable
assessment of a pixel-based AI triage tool than a single LLM.
  Methods: 29,766 non-contrast CT head exams from fourteen hospitals were
processed by a commercial intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) AI detection tool.
Radiology reports were analyzed by an ensemble of eight open-source LLM models
and a HIPAA compliant internal version of GPT-4o using a single multi-shot
prompt that assessed for presence of ICH. 1,726 examples were manually
reviewed. Performance characteristics of the eight open-source models and
consensus were compared to GPT-4o. Three ideal consensus LLM ensembles were
tested for rating the performance of the triage tool.
  Results: The cohort consisted of 29,766 head CTs exam-report pairs. The
highest AUC performance was achieved with llama3.3:70b and GPT-4o (AUC= 0.78).
The average precision was highest for Llama3.3:70b and GPT-4o (AP=0.75 & 0.76).
Llama3.3:70b had the highest F1 score (0.81) and recall (0.85), greater
precision (0.78), specificity (0.72), and MCC (0.57). Using MCC (95% CI) the
ideal combination of LLMs were: Full-9 Ensemble 0.571 (0.552-0.591), Top-3
Ensemble 0.558 (0.537-0.579), Consensus 0.556 (0.539-0.574), and GPT4o 0.522
(0.500-0.543). No statistically significant differences were observed between
Top-3, Full-9, and Consensus (p > 0.05).
  Conclusion: An ensemble of medium to large sized open-source LLMs provides a
more consistent and reliable method to derive a ground truth retrospective
evaluation of a clinical AI triage tool over a single LLM alone.

### [93] [Inside CORE-KG: Evaluating Structured Prompting and Coreference Resolution for Knowledge Graphs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26512)
*Dipak Meher,Carlotta Domeniconi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper presents the CORE-KG framework, which effectively addresses challenges in automated knowledge graph construction from complex legal case documents by integrating type-aware coreference resolution and structured prompts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To tackle the issues of node duplication and noisy, fragmented graphs in automated knowledge graph construction, especially in lexically dense and ambiguous legal case documents.

Method: The proposed CORE-KG framework combines a type-aware coreference module and domain-guided structured prompts to enhance accuracy in extracting structured representations.

Result: Ablation studies show that removing coreference resolution increases node duplication by 28.32% and noisy nodes by 4.32%, while removing structured prompts increases node duplication by 4.34% and noisy nodes by 73.33%.

Conclusion: The CORE-KG framework significantly reduces node duplication and legal noise, offering a robust solution for utilizing LLMs to extract structured information from legal texts.

Abstract: Human smuggling networks are increasingly adaptive and difficult to analyze.
Legal case documents offer critical insights but are often unstructured,
lexically dense, and filled with ambiguous or shifting references, which pose
significant challenges for automated knowledge graph (KG) construction. While
recent LLM-based approaches improve over static templates, they still generate
noisy, fragmented graphs with duplicate nodes due to the absence of guided
extraction and coreference resolution. The recently proposed CORE-KG framework
addresses these limitations by integrating a type-aware coreference module and
domain-guided structured prompts, significantly reducing node duplication and
legal noise. In this work, we present a systematic ablation study of CORE-KG to
quantify the individual contributions of its two key components. Our results
show that removing coreference resolution results in a 28.32% increase in node
duplication and a 4.32% increase in noisy nodes, while removing structured
prompts leads to a 4.34% increase in node duplication and a 73.33% increase in
noisy nodes. These findings offer empirical insights for designing robust
LLM-based pipelines for extracting structured representations from complex
legal texts.

### [94] [Hebrew Diacritics Restoration using Visual Representation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26521)
*Yair Elboher,Yuval Pinter*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A Hebrew diacritization system called DIVRIT achieves high accuracy by framing the task as zero-shot classification and using a Hebrew Visual Language Model.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve Hebrew diacritics restoration, which ensures accurate pronunciation and meaning in a highly ambiguous, unvocalized language.

Method: The paper introduces DIVRIT, which uses a Hebrew Visual Language Model to process undiacritized text as images. Diacritization is framed as a zero-shot classification task, with candidate sets dynamically generated based on context.

Result: DIVRIT demonstrated high accuracy, especially in an oracle setting, with effective generalization achieved through architectural enhancements and optimized training.

Conclusion: The study underscores the potential of visual language-based models for precise and automated diacritization in Hebrew text.

Abstract: Diacritics restoration in Hebrew is a fundamental task for ensuring accurate
word pronunciation and disambiguating textual meaning. Despite the language's
high degree of ambiguity when unvocalized, recent machine learning approaches
have significantly advanced performance on this task.
  In this work, we present DIVRIT, a novel system for Hebrew diacritization
that frames the task as a zero-shot classification problem. Our approach
operates at the word level, selecting the most appropriate diacritization
pattern for each undiacritized word from a dynamically generated candidate set,
conditioned on the surrounding textual context. A key innovation of DIVRIT is
its use of a Hebrew Visual Language Model, which processes undiacritized text
as an image, allowing diacritic information to be embedded directly within the
input's vector representation.
  Through a comprehensive evaluation across various configurations, we
demonstrate that the system effectively performs diacritization without relying
on complex, explicit linguistic analysis. Notably, in an ``oracle'' setting
where the correct diacritized form is guaranteed to be among the provided
candidates, DIVRIT achieves a high level of accuracy. Furthermore, strategic
architectural enhancements and optimized training methodologies yield
significant improvements in the system's overall generalization capabilities.
These findings highlight the promising potential of visual representations for
accurate and automated Hebrew diacritization.

### [95] [The Structure of Relation Decoding Linear Operators in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26543)
*Miranda Anna Christ,Adrián Csiszárik,Gergely Becsó,Dániel Varga*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper analyses linear operators decoding relational facts in transformer models, suggesting they primarily extract broad semantic properties rather than specific relations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how linear operators decode relational facts in transformer language models and to assess their compressibility and underlying structure.

Method: The study involved extending single-relation analysis to multiple relations, compressing relation decoders using tensor networks, and employing a cross-evaluation protocol to analyze semantic redundancies.

Result: Linear operators encode recurring semantic properties rather than distinct relations, enabling significant compressibility without loss of decoding accuracy.

Conclusion: Linear relational decoding in transformer models is largely property-based, explaining its compressibility and restricted generalizability to semantically similar relations.

Abstract: This paper investigates the structure of linear operators introduced in
Hernandez et al. [2023] that decode specific relational facts in transformer
language models. We extend their single-relation findings to a collection of
relations and systematically chart their organization. We show that such
collections of relation decoders can be highly compressed by simple order-3
tensor networks without significant loss in decoding accuracy. To explain this
surprising redundancy, we develop a cross-evaluation protocol, in which we
apply each linear decoder operator to the subjects of every other relation. Our
results reveal that these linear maps do not encode distinct relations, but
extract recurring, coarse-grained semantic properties (e.g., country of capital
city and country of food are both in the country-of-X property). This
property-centric structure clarifies both the operators' compressibility and
highlights why they generalize only to new relations that are semantically
close. Our findings thus interpret linear relational decoding in transformer
language models as primarily property-based, rather than relation-specific.

### [96] [InfoFlow: Reinforcing Search Agent Via Reward Density Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26575)
*Kun Luo,Hongjin Qian,Zheng Liu,Ziyi Xia,Shitao Xiao,Siqi Bao,Jun Zhao,Kang Liu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces InfoFlow, a framework that improves learning efficiency in deep search scenarios with sparse rewards by optimizing reward density.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The challenge is to address low reward density in deep search tasks where agents face high exploratory costs for minimal rewards.

Method: InfoFlow tackles the problem through subproblem decomposition for denser rewards, failure-guided hints for corrective guidance, and a dual-agent architecture to reduce exploration costs.

Result: InfoFlow outperforms strong baselines in agentic benchmarks, allowing lightweight language models (LLMs) to achieve comparable performance to advanced proprietary LLMs.

Conclusion: InfoFlow systematically enhances reward density optimization, making deep search more efficient and accessible for lightweight LLMs.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) is a promising approach
for enhancing agentic deep search. However, its application is often hindered
by low \textbf{Reward Density} in deep search scenarios, where agents expend
significant exploratory costs for infrequent and often null final rewards. In
this paper, we formalize this challenge as the \textbf{Reward Density
Optimization} problem, which aims to improve the reward obtained per unit of
exploration cost. This paper introduce \textbf{InfoFlow}, a systematic
framework that tackles this problem from three aspects. 1) \textbf{Subproblem
decomposition}: breaking down long-range tasks to assign process rewards,
thereby providing denser learning signals. 2) \textbf{Failure-guided hints}:
injecting corrective guidance into stalled trajectories to increase the
probability of successful outcomes. 3) \textbf{Dual-agent refinement}:
employing a dual-agent architecture to offload the cognitive burden of deep
exploration. A refiner agent synthesizes the search history, which effectively
compresses the researcher's perceived trajectory, thereby reducing exploration
cost and increasing the overall reward density. We evaluate InfoFlow on
multiple agentic search benchmarks, where it significantly outperforms strong
baselines, enabling lightweight LLMs to achieve performance comparable to
advanced proprietary LLMs.

*Yinrong Hong,Zhiquan Tan,Kai Hu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces CAST, a novel dynamic tree decoding method optimizing inference costs for Large Language Models (LLMs), achieving up to 5.2x speedup and outperforming prior approaches by 5-20%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large Language Models suffer from challenges like inference latency due to their autoregressive design and large size, and current speculative decoding methods often fail to consider system variables such as GPU configurations and batch sizes.

Method: The authors propose CAST, a dynamic tree decoding approach that adjusts inference costs based on factors like GPU devices and batch sizes, refining the tree structure dynamically during the decoding process.

Result: CAST yields significant speed improvements, up to 5.2 times faster than traditional methods, and consistently outperforms existing speculative decoding techniques by 5% to 20%, validated across six tasks and six LLMs.

Conclusion: CAST effectively addresses limitations of current speculative decoding approaches, optimizing decoding for LLMs by factoring in relevant system variables, and offering substantial performance improvements in speed and accuracy.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) face significant inference latency challenges
stemming from their autoregressive design and large size. To address this,
speculative decoding emerges as a solution, enabling the simultaneous
generation and validation of multiple tokens. While recent approaches like
EAGLE-2 and EAGLE-3 improve speculative decoding using dynamic tree structures,
they often neglect the impact of crucial system variables such as GPU devices
and batch sizes.
  Therefore, we introduce a new dynamic tree decoding approach called CAST that
takes into account inference costs, including factors such as GPU
configurations and batch sizes, to dynamically refine the tree structure.
Through comprehensive experimentation across six diverse tasks and utilizing
six distinct LLMs, our methodology demonstrates remarkable results, achieving
speeds up to 5.2 times faster than conventional decoding methods. Moreover, it
generally outperforms existing state-of-the-art techniques from 5% to 20%.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces SlideAgent, a framework designed to address challenges in understanding complex multi-page visual documents, outperforming existing models in reasoning and information extraction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current systems using large language models struggle to process and reason with complex multi-modal, multi-page, and multi-layout visual documents effectively.

Method: SlideAgent decomposes reasoning into three levels (global, page, element) and employs specialized agents for multi-level reasoning, integrating their outputs into structured, query-agnostic representations.

Result: SlideAgent demonstrates significant improvement in document understanding, outperforming proprietary models by 7.9 overall and open-source models by 9.8 overall in empirical evaluations.

Conclusion: SlideAgent offers a robust framework for processing and reasoning about complex visual documents, with substantial gains in performance over existing approaches.

Abstract: Multi-page visual documents such as manuals, brochures, presentations, and
posters convey key information through layout, colors, icons, and cross-slide
references. While large language models (LLMs) offer opportunities in document
understanding, current systems struggle with complex, multi-page visual
documents, particularly in fine-grained reasoning over elements and pages. We
introduce SlideAgent, a versatile agentic framework for understanding
multi-modal, multi-page, and multi-layout documents, especially slide decks.
SlideAgent employs specialized agents and decomposes reasoning into three
specialized levels-global, page, and element-to construct a structured,
query-agnostic representation that captures both overarching themes and
detailed visual or textual cues. During inference, SlideAgent selectively
activates specialized agents for multi-level reasoning and integrates their
outputs into coherent, context-aware answers. Extensive experiments show that
SlideAgent achieves significant improvement over both proprietary (+7.9
overall) and open-source models (+9.8 overall).

TL;DR: This paper revisits encoder-decoder models in large language models (LLMs), comparing them with the dominant decoder-only models across multiple scales and showing they achieve competitive performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The shift towards decoder-only models in LLM research has left encoder-decoder models underexamined, especially in terms of scaling potential, prompting the authors to revisit and evaluate them comprehensively.

Method: The authors enhance encoder-decoder LLMs (RedLLM) with techniques from decoder-only models and conduct a scaling analysis by pretraining RedLLM with prefix LM and comparing against decoder-only LLMs using causal LM across different sizes (150M to 8B parameters).

Result: RedLLM demonstrates strong scaling properties, effective context length extrapolation, and competitive or better results on downstream tasks after instruction tuning compared to decoder-only models, along with improved inference efficiency.

Conclusion: Encoder-decoder models possess untapped potential and demonstrate competitiveness and efficiency, urging further examination for developing powerful and efficient LLMs.

Abstract: Recent large language model (LLM) research has undergone an architectural
shift from encoder-decoder modeling to nowadays the dominant decoder-only
modeling. This rapid transition, however, comes without a rigorous comparative
analysis especially \textit{from the scaling perspective}, raising concerns
that the potential of encoder-decoder models may have been overlooked. To fill
this gap, we revisit encoder-decoder LLM (RedLLM), enhancing it with recent
recipes from decoder-only LLM (DecLLM). We conduct a comprehensive comparison
between RedLLM, pretrained with prefix language modeling (LM), and DecLLM,
pretrained with causal LM, at different model scales, ranging from $\sim$150M
to $\sim$8B. Using RedPajama V1 (1.6T tokens) for pretraining and FLAN for
instruction tuning, our experiments show that RedLLM produces compelling
scaling properties and surprisingly strong performance. While DecLLM is overall
more compute-optimal during pretraining, RedLLM demonstrates comparable scaling
and context length extrapolation capabilities. After instruction tuning, RedLLM
achieves comparable and even better results on various downstream tasks while
enjoying substantially better inference efficiency. We hope our findings could
inspire more efforts on re-examining RedLLM, unlocking its potential for
developing powerful and efficient LLMs.

TL;DR: Evontree leverages high-quality ontology rules to extract, validate, and refine domain knowledge in LLMs, enhancing their performance in low-resource fields like healthcare.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs struggle with adaptation in data-sensitive fields like healthcare due to insufficient high-quality, domain-specific training data.

Method: Evontree uses ontology rules to systematically extract, detect inconsistencies, and reinforce knowledge in LLMs via self-distilled fine-tuning without extensive datasets.

Result: Experiments on medical QA benchmarks with Llama3-8B-Instruct and Med42-v2 show up to a 3.7% accuracy improvement over baseline models.

Conclusion: Evontree demonstrates effective, efficient, and robust capabilities for improving LLM adaptation in low-resource domains through its novel application of ontology rules.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated exceptional capabilities
across multiple domains by leveraging massive pre-training and curated
fine-tuning data. However, in data-sensitive fields such as healthcare, the
lack of high-quality, domain-specific training corpus hinders LLMs' adaptation
for specialized applications. Meanwhile, domain experts have distilled domain
wisdom into ontology rules, which formalize relationships among concepts and
ensure the integrity of knowledge management repositories. Viewing LLMs as
implicit repositories of human knowledge, we propose Evontree, a novel
framework that leverages a small set of high-quality ontology rules to
systematically extract, validate, and enhance domain knowledge within LLMs,
without requiring extensive external datasets. Specifically, Evontree extracts
domain ontology from raw models, detects inconsistencies using two core
ontology rules, and reinforces the refined knowledge via self-distilled
fine-tuning. Extensive experiments on medical QA benchmarks with
Llama3-8B-Instruct and Med42-v2 demonstrate consistent outperformance over both
unmodified models and leading supervised baselines, achieving up to a 3.7%
improvement in accuracy. These results confirm the effectiveness, efficiency,
and robustness of our approach for low-resource domain adaptation of LLMs.

TL;DR: Kimi Linear, a new linear attention architecture, surpasses full attention models in performance across diverse scenarios, utilizing efficient gating and hardware optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of full attention mechanisms and improve performance and efficiency for tasks across various short-context, long-context, and reinforcement learning scenarios.

Method: Introduced Kimi Delta Attention (KDA) to extend Gated DeltaNet with finer-grained gating, enabled by chunkwise computation and optimized hardware efficiency via Diagonal-Plus-Low-Rank transition matrices.

Result: Kimi Linear outperforms full attention models in all tasks, reduces KV cache usage by up to 75%, and achieves up to 6x faster decoding throughput for large 1M contexts, validated over a range of tasks.

Conclusion: Kimi Linear serves as a superior drop-in replacement for full attention architectures, making it highly efficient and performant even in longer input-output contexts. The model implementation and checkpoints have been open-sourced for broader research availability.

Abstract: We introduce Kimi Linear, a hybrid linear attention architecture that, for
the first time, outperforms full attention under fair comparisons across
various scenarios -- including short-context, long-context, and reinforcement
learning (RL) scaling regimes. At its core lies Kimi Delta Attention (KDA), an
expressive linear attention module that extends Gated DeltaNet with a
finer-grained gating mechanism, enabling more effective use of limited
finite-state RNN memory. Our bespoke chunkwise algorithm achieves high hardware
efficiency through a specialized variant of the Diagonal-Plus-Low-Rank (DPLR)
transition matrices, which substantially reduces computation compared to the
general DPLR formulation while remaining more consistent with the classical
delta rule.
  We pretrain a Kimi Linear model with 3B activated parameters and 48B total
parameters, based on a layerwise hybrid of KDA and Multi-Head Latent Attention
(MLA). Our experiments show that with an identical training recipe, Kimi Linear
outperforms full MLA with a sizeable margin across all evaluated tasks, while
reducing KV cache usage by up to 75% and achieving up to 6 times decoding
throughput for a 1M context. These results demonstrate that Kimi Linear can be
a drop-in replacement for full attention architectures with superior
performance and efficiency, including tasks with longer input and output
lengths.
  To support further research, we open-source the KDA kernel and vLLM
implementations, and release the pre-trained and instruction-tuned model
checkpoints.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the limitations of current LLM decoding processes, which rely on manual tuning of hyperparameters and are not truly "end-to-end."

Method: Enhancing transformers with lightweight heads to dynamically predict context-specific temperature and top-p values alongside token logits in a single forward pass.

Result: AutoDeco significantly outperforms default decoding strategies and achieves results comparable to oracle-tuned baselines, demonstrating emergent capabilities for instruction-based decoding control.

Conclusion: AutoDeco transforms LLM decoding into a parametric, self-regulating process, introducing a paradigm for steerable, interactive, and truly end-to-end LLM generation.

Abstract: The "end-to-end" label for LLMs is a misnomer. In practice, they depend on a
non-differentiable decoding process that requires laborious, hand-tuning of
hyperparameters like temperature and top-p. This paper introduces AutoDeco, a
novel architecture that enables truly "end-to-end" generation by learning to
control its own decoding strategy. We augment the standard transformer with
lightweight heads that, at each step, dynamically predict context-specific
temperature and top-p values alongside the next-token logits. This approach
transforms decoding into a parametric, token-level process, allowing the model
to self-regulate its sampling strategy within a single forward pass.
  Through extensive experiments on eight benchmarks, we demonstrate that
AutoDeco not only significantly outperforms default decoding strategies but
also achieves performance comparable to an oracle-tuned baseline derived from
"hacking the test set"-a practical upper bound for any static method.
Crucially, we uncover an emergent capability for instruction-based decoding
control: the model learns to interpret natural language commands (e.g.,
"generate with low randomness") and adjusts its predicted temperature and top-p
on a token-by-token basis, opening a new paradigm for steerable and interactive
LLM decoding.

### [103] [Value Drifts: Tracing Value Alignment During LLM Post-Training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26707)
*Mehar Bhatia,Shravan Nayak,Gaurav Kamath,Marius Mosbach,Karolina Stańczak,Vered Shwartz,Siva Reddy*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper analyzes how large language models (LLMs) align with human values during post-training, revealing key phases and influences on this alignment process.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding and improving LLMs' alignment with human values is critical as these models increasingly interact with societal systems.

Method: Experimental study using Llama-3 and Qwen-3 models, supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and preference optimization datasets, along with a synthetic dataset to analyze training dynamics.

Result: SFT establishes values of LLMs, while preference optimization has limited success in re-aligning values. Algorithms impact alignment outcomes even with constant preference data.

Conclusion: Insights gained can refine data curation, model selection, and algorithms for better alignment of LLMs with human values.

Abstract: As LLMs occupy an increasingly important role in society, they are more and
more confronted with questions that require them not only to draw on their
general knowledge but also to align with certain human value systems.
Therefore, studying the alignment of LLMs with human values has become a
crucial field of inquiry. Prior work, however, mostly focuses on evaluating the
alignment of fully trained models, overlooking the training dynamics by which
models learn to express human values. In this work, we investigate how and at
which stage value alignment arises during the course of a model's
post-training. Our analysis disentangles the effects of post-training
algorithms and datasets, measuring both the magnitude and time of value drifts
during training. Experimenting with Llama-3 and Qwen-3 models of different
sizes and popular supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and preference optimization
datasets and algorithms, we find that the SFT phase generally establishes a
model's values, and subsequent preference optimization rarely re-aligns these
values. Furthermore, using a synthetic preference dataset that enables
controlled manipulation of values, we find that different preference
optimization algorithms lead to different value alignment outcomes, even when
preference data is held constant. Our findings provide actionable insights into
how values are learned during post-training and help to inform data curation,
as well as the selection of models and algorithms for preference optimization
to improve model alignment to human values.

*Shengnan An,Xunliang Cai,Xuezhi Cao,Xiaoyu Li,Yehao Lin,Junlin Liu,Xinxuan Lv,Dan Ma,Xuanlin Wang,Ziwen Wang,Shuang Zhou*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: AMO-Bench is a new mathematical reasoning benchmark consisting of 50 expertly crafted problems at or above International Mathematical Olympiad difficulty level.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the performance saturation of large language models on existing math reasoning benchmarks and propose a harder, original benchmark to better evaluate these capabilities.

Method: The authors created 50 math problems validated by experts to meet high difficulty standards and ensured originality to avoid data leakage. Problems require a single final answer for automated evaluation.

Result: The results showed underwhelming performance, with the leading model achieving only 52.4% accuracy and most models scoring under 40%. Despite poor results, a positive correlation with increased test-time compute was observed.

Conclusion: AMO-Bench highlights the substantial gap in LLMs' mathematical reasoning abilities and provides a resource to further research in this area, emphasizing the need for improvement in reasoning capabilities.

Abstract: We present AMO-Bench, an Advanced Mathematical reasoning benchmark with
Olympiad level or even higher difficulty, comprising 50 human-crafted problems.
Existing benchmarks have widely leveraged high school math competitions for
evaluating mathematical reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs).
However, many existing math competitions are becoming less effective for
assessing top-tier LLMs due to performance saturation (e.g., AIME24/25). To
address this, AMO-Bench introduces more rigorous challenges by ensuring all 50
problems are (1) cross-validated by experts to meet at least the International
Mathematical Olympiad (IMO) difficulty standards, and (2) entirely original
problems to prevent potential performance leakages from data memorization.
Moreover, each problem in AMO-Bench requires only a final answer rather than a
proof, enabling automatic and robust grading for evaluation. Experimental
results across 26 LLMs on AMO-Bench show that even the best-performing model
achieves only 52.4% accuracy on AMO-Bench, with most LLMs scoring below 40%.
Beyond these poor performances, our further analysis reveals a promising
scaling trend with increasing test-time compute on AMO-Bench. These results
highlight the significant room for improving the mathematical reasoning in
current LLMs. We release AMO-Bench to facilitate further research into
advancing the reasoning abilities of language models.

*Hyunji Lee,Minseon Kim,Chinmay Singh,Matheus Pereira,Atharv Sonwane,Isadora White,Elias Stengel-Eskin,Mohit Bansal,Zhengyan Shi,Alessandro Sordoni,Marc-Alexandre Côté,Xingdi Yuan,Lucas Caccia*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces Gistify, a task for evaluating coding agents’ ability to extract key functionalities from large codebases and create self-contained files. Current models struggle with this task, especially for complex executions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of evaluating coding agents' capabilities in understanding and reproducing specific functionalities of complex codebases.

Method: Gistify provides coding agents with a full codebase and a specific entrypoint command. Agents must generate a minimal, self-contained file to replicate the functionality of the full codebase for the given command.

Result: Tests demonstrated that current state-of-the-art coding models struggle with the Gistify task, particularly when execution traces are complex or lengthy.

Conclusion: There remains significant room for improving large coding language models in understanding codebases structurally, modeling their execution flow, and creating concise reproductions.

Abstract: As coding agents are increasingly deployed in large codebases, the need to
automatically design challenging, codebase-level evaluation is central. We
propose Gistify, a task where a coding LLM must create a single, minimal,
self-contained file that can reproduce a specific functionality of a codebase.
The coding LLM is given full access to a codebase along with a specific
entrypoint (e.g., a python command), and the generated file must replicate the
output of the same command ran under the full codebase, while containing only
the essential components necessary to execute the provided command. Success on
Gistify requires both structural understanding of the codebase, accurate
modeling of its execution flow as well as the ability to produce potentially
large code patches. Our findings show that current state-of-the-art models
struggle to reliably solve Gistify tasks, especially ones with long executions
traces.

### [106] [Enhancing Underwater Object Detection through Spatio-Temporal Analysis and Spatial Attention Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25797)
*Sai Likhith Karri,Ansh Saxena*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper evaluates underwater object detection models, focusing on an enhanced YOLOv5 variant with spatio-temporal and spatial attention mechanisms, exhibiting improved performance, especially in dynamic marine environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address challenges in underwater object detection, including sudden movements, partial occlusions, and gradual motion.

Method: It evaluates the standard YOLOv5, a temporal-enhanced T-YOLOv5, and its augmented version with CBAM, comparing their performance metrics.

Result: T-YOLOv5 improved detection accuracy (mAP@50-95 of 0.813 vs. 0.563 for YOLOv5), while T-YOLOv5 with CBAM further enhanced results but showed diminished performance in simpler tasks.

Conclusion: Spatio-temporal modeling and spatial attention mechanisms contribute significantly to underwater detection performance, making T-YOLOv5 variants effective for complex scenarios.

Abstract: This study examines the effectiveness of spatio-temporal modeling and the
integration of spatial attention mechanisms in deep learning models for
underwater object detection. Specifically, in the first phase, the performance
of temporal-enhanced YOLOv5 variant T-YOLOv5 is evaluated, in comparison with
the standard YOLOv5. For the second phase, an augmented version of T-YOLOv5 is
developed, through the addition of a Convolutional Block Attention Module
(CBAM). By examining the effectiveness of the already pre-existing YOLOv5 and
T-YOLOv5 models and of the newly developed T-YOLOv5 with CBAM. With CBAM, the
research highlights how temporal modeling improves detection accuracy in
dynamic marine environments, particularly under conditions of sudden movements,
partial occlusions, and gradual motion. The testing results showed that YOLOv5
achieved a mAP@50-95 of 0.563, while T-YOLOv5 and T-YOLOv5 with CBAM
outperformed with mAP@50-95 scores of 0.813 and 0.811, respectively,
highlighting their superior accuracy and generalization in detecting complex
objects. The findings demonstrate that T-YOLOv5 significantly enhances
detection reliability compared to the standard model, while T-YOLOv5 with CBAM
further improves performance in challenging scenarios, although there is a loss
of accuracy when it comes to simpler scenarios.

*Nicolas Dufour,Lucas Degeorge,Arijit Ghosh,Vicky Kalogeiton,David Picard*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes MIRO, a method for training text-to-image generative models conditioned on multiple reward models, enhancing visual quality, training speed, and alignment with user preferences.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing text-to-image generative models rely on large uncurated datasets leading to misalignment with user preferences when generating images, and current reward models are inefficient, harming diversity and quality.

Method: MIRO conditions the generative model on multiple reward models during training, allowing it to directly learn user preferences instead of post-hoc selection processes.

Result: Using MIRO improves visual quality, training efficiency, and achieves state-of-the-art performance in benchmarks like GenEval and user preference scores.

Conclusion: The approach reshapes text-to-image generative training to better align with user preferences, enhancing performance and efficiency across various benchmarks.

Abstract: Current text-to-image generative models are trained on large uncurated
datasets to enable diverse generation capabilities. However, this does not
align well with user preferences. Recently, reward models have been
specifically designed to perform post-hoc selection of generated images and
align them to a reward, typically user preference. This discarding of
informative data together with the optimizing for a single reward tend to harm
diversity, semantic fidelity and efficiency. Instead of this post-processing,
we propose to condition the model on multiple reward models during training to
let the model learn user preferences directly. We show that this not only
dramatically improves the visual quality of the generated images but it also
significantly speeds up the training. Our proposed method, called MIRO,
achieves state-of-the-art performances on the GenEval compositional benchmark
and user-preference scores (PickAScore, ImageReward, HPSv2).

*Roman Beliy,Amit Zalcher,Jonathan Kogman,Navve Wasserman,Michal Irani*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper presents "Brain-IT," a method for reconstructing images seen by humans using fMRI brain recordings, improving accuracy and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for reconstructing images from fMRI recordings lack faithfulness and require extensive data.

Method: "Brain-IT" employs a Brain Interaction Transformer (BIT) to link functionally-similar brain voxel clusters and predict localized image features for the diffusion model.

Result: BIT achieves accurate and faithful image reconstructions, outperforming state-of-the-art (SotA) methods both visually and by objective metrics.

Conclusion: Brain-IT offers an efficient, generalizable, and accurate solution for reconstructing seen images from limited fMRI data, advancing non-invasive brain imaging technology.

Abstract: Reconstructing images seen by people from their fMRI brain recordings
provides a non-invasive window into the human brain. Despite recent progress
enabled by diffusion models, current methods often lack faithfulness to the
actual seen images. We present "Brain-IT", a brain-inspired approach that
addresses this challenge through a Brain Interaction Transformer (BIT),
allowing effective interactions between clusters of functionally-similar
brain-voxels. These functional-clusters are shared by all subjects, serving as
building blocks for integrating information both within and across brains. All
model components are shared by all clusters & subjects, allowing efficient
training with a limited amount of data. To guide the image reconstruction, BIT
predicts two complementary localized patch-level image features: (i)high-level
semantic features which steer the diffusion model toward the correct semantic
content of the image; and (ii)low-level structural features which help to
initialize the diffusion process with the correct coarse layout of the image.
BIT's design enables direct flow of information from brain-voxel clusters to
localized image features. Through these principles, our method achieves image
reconstructions from fMRI that faithfully reconstruct the seen images, and
surpass current SotA approaches both visually and by standard objective
metrics. Moreover, with only 1-hour of fMRI data from a new subject, we achieve
results comparable to current methods trained on full 40-hour recordings.

TL;DR: The paper addresses cyclist vulnerability and adapts automotive LiDAR for bike safety, introducing a new dataset and achieving improved segmentation performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve the safety of cyclists, especially with faster e-bikes, by adapting perception systems like 3D LiDAR technologies.

Method: Developed a multi-sensor platform called 'SenseBike' and introduced the BikeScenes-lidarseg Dataset with 3021 annotated LiDAR scans tailored for bicycles and tested segmentation models.

Result: Fine-tuning on BikeScenes dataset achieved 63.6% mIoU in segmentation accuracy, outperforming SemanticKITTI pre-training which scored only 13.8%.

Conclusion: Domain-specific training (using the BikeScenes dataset) improves the reliability of bicycle-oriented LiDAR segmentation, providing a foundation for cyclist safety enhancement.

Abstract: The vulnerability of cyclists, exacerbated by the rising popularity of faster
e-bikes, motivates adapting automotive perception technologies for bicycle
safety. We use our multi-sensor 'SenseBike' research platform to develop and
evaluate a 3D LiDAR segmentation approach tailored to bicycles. To bridge the
automotive-to-bicycle domain gap, we introduce the novel BikeScenes-lidarseg
Dataset, comprising 3021 consecutive LiDAR scans around the university campus
of the TU Delft, semantically annotated for 29 dynamic and static classes. By
evaluating model performance, we demonstrate that fine-tuning on our BikeScenes
dataset achieves a mean Intersection-over-Union (mIoU) of 63.6%, significantly
outperforming the 13.8% obtained with SemanticKITTI pre-training alone. This
result underscores the necessity and effectiveness of domain-specific training.
We highlight key challenges specific to bicycle-mounted, hardware-constrained
perception systems and contribute the BikeScenes dataset as a resource for
advancing research in cyclist-centric LiDAR segmentation.

*Nikola L. Kolev,Tommaso Rodani,Neil J. Curson,Taylor J. Z. Stock,Alberto Cazzaniga*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces a machine learning framework to address issues in scanning tunneling microscopy, improving image restoration and reducing acquisition time.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Researchers aim to address limitations in STM caused by tip degradation and slow data acquisition, influencing quality and efficiency.

Method: A physics-informed synthetic data pipeline was employed to train ML models for image repair and super-resolution using a dataset of 36 pristine STM images.

Result: ML models effectively restored STM images, reducing acquisition time by two- to fourfold through sparse data reconstruction.

Conclusion: By enhancing STM efficiency and reducing maintenance requirements, the proposed approach can improve STM experimental throughput significantly.

Abstract: Scanning tunnelling microscopy (STM) enables atomic-resolution imaging and
atom manipulation, but its utility is often limited by tip degradation and slow
serial data acquisition. Fabrication adds another layer of complexity since the
tip is often subjected to large voltages, which may alter the shape of its
apex, requiring it to be conditioned. Here, we propose a machine learning (ML)
approach for image repair and super-resolution to alleviate both challenges.
Using a dataset of only 36 pristine experimental images of Si(001):H, we
demonstrate that a physics-informed synthetic data generation pipeline can be
used to train several state-of-the-art flow-matching and diffusion models.
Quantitative evaluation with metrics such as the CLIP Maximum Mean Discrepancy
(CMMD) score and structural similarity demonstrates that our models are able to
effectively restore images and offer a two- to fourfold reduction in image
acquisition time by accurately reconstructing images from sparsely sampled
data. Our framework has the potential to significantly increase STM
experimental throughput by offering a route to reducing the frequency of
tip-conditioning procedures and to enhancing frame rates in existing high-speed
STM systems.

*Sung-Hoon Yoon,Minghan Li,Gaspard Beaudouin,Congcong Wen,Muhammad Rafay Azhar,Mengyu Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a flow decomposition-and-aggregation framework for improving image editing capabilities while avoiding flow inversion issues. Experimental results show enhanced semantic fidelity and attribute disentanglement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations in rectified flow models, such as inaccurate inversion and poor editing quality caused by gradient entanglement during editing.

Method: The proposed method semantically decomposes target prompts into sub-prompts, computes individual flows, and uses projection and soft aggregation to unify editing trajectories while resolving semantic conflicts.

Result: Empirical evaluation demonstrates superior performance over existing zero-shot image editing techniques in semantic fidelity and attribute disentanglement.

Conclusion: By enhancing diversity in target spaces and ensuring consistency via adaptive weighting mechanisms, the framework improves both generative and editing capabilities in image processing.

Abstract: Rectified flow models have become a de facto standard in image generation due
to their stable sampling trajectories and high-fidelity outputs. Despite their
strong generative capabilities, they face critical limitations in image editing
tasks: inaccurate inversion processes for mapping real images back into the
latent space, and gradient entanglement issues during editing often result in
outputs that do not faithfully reflect the target prompt. Recent efforts have
attempted to directly map source and target distributions via ODE-based
approaches without inversion; however,these methods still yield suboptimal
editing quality. In this work, we propose a flow decomposition-and-aggregation
framework built upon an inversion-free formulation to address these
limitations. Specifically, we semantically decompose the target prompt into
multiple sub-prompts, compute an independent flow for each, and aggregate them
to form a unified editing trajectory. While we empirically observe that
decomposing the original flow enhances diversity in the target space,
generating semantically aligned outputs still requires consistent guidance
toward the full target prompt. To this end, we design a projection and
soft-aggregation mechanism for flow, inspired by gradient conflict resolution
in multi-task learning. This approach adaptively weights the sub-target
velocity fields, suppressing semantic redundancy while emphasizing distinct
directions, thereby preserving both diversity and consistency in the final
edited output. Experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms
existing zero-shot editing approaches in terms of semantic fidelity and
attribute disentanglement. The code is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper addresses real-time tumor tracking in cine-MRI under data scarcity constraints, employing SAM-based segmentation fine-tuned on limited data, achieving a Dice score of 0.8794 and ranking 6th in TrackRAD2025.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation was to address the challenge of accurate real-time tumor tracking in MRI-guided radiotherapy, specifically under constraints of strong data scarcity, as posed by the TrackRAD2025 challenge.

Method: The authors explored (i) unsupervised registration using the IMPACT similarity metric, and (ii) foundation model-based segmentation, ultimately selecting SAM2.1b+ with mask-based prompts from the first annotated slice for its ability to operate under the one-second runtime constraint. They fine-tuned it on small labeled data, employed balanced loss functions to minimize overfitting, and discarded test-time augmentation due to minimal performance improvement.

Result: The final model achieved a Dice Similarity Coefficient of 0.8794 on the hidden test set and secured 6th place in the TrackRAD2025 challenge.

Conclusion: Foundation models, specifically SAM2.1b+, demonstrate strong potential for accurate and real-time tumor tracking in MRI-guided radiotherapy, even under data scarcity and computational constraints.

Abstract: In this work, we address the TrackRAD2025 challenge of real-time tumor
tracking in cine-MRI sequences of the thoracic and abdominal regions under
strong data scarcity constraints. Two complementary strategies were explored:
(i) unsupervised registration with the IMPACT similarity metric and (ii)
foundation model-based segmentation leveraging SAM 2.1 and its recent variants
through prompt-based interaction. Due to the one-second runtime constraint, the
SAM-based method was ultimately selected. The final configuration used SAM2.1
b+ with mask-based prompts from the first annotated slice, fine-tuned solely on
the small labeled subset from TrackRAD2025. Training was configured to minimize
overfitting, using 1024x1024 patches (batch size 1), standard augmentations,
and a balanced Dice + IoU loss. A low uniform learning rate (0.0001) was
applied to all modules (prompt encoder, decoder, Hiera backbone) to preserve
generalization while adapting to annotator-specific styles. Training lasted 300
epochs (~12h on RTX A6000, 48GB). The same inference strategy was consistently
applied across all anatomical sites and MRI field strengths. Test-time
augmentation was considered but ultimately discarded due to negligible
performance gains. The final model was selected based on the highest Dice
Similarity Coefficient achieved on the validation set after fine-tuning. On the
hidden test set, the model reached a Dice score of 0.8794, ranking 6th overall
in the TrackRAD2025 challenge. These results highlight the strong potential of
foundation models for accurate and real-time tumor tracking in MRI-guided
radiotherapy.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Hilbert Selective Scan mechanism to enhance the Mamba framework, focusing on intricate spatial interactions and improving low-light image enhancement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations in the Mamba framework's scanning pattern and improve feature exploration and fine-scale detail capture in low-light image enhancement.

Method: The method integrates the Hilbert Selective Scan mechanism into Mamba's scanning process to refine spatial locality and handle long-range dependencies effectively.

Result: Extensive experiments show improved metrics, visual fidelity, reduced resource consumption, and faster inference on benchmarks.

Conclusion: The proposed strategy improves state-of-the-art low-light image enhancement and may benefit other Mamba-based applications in broader fields.

Abstract: We propose an innovative enhancement to the Mamba framework by increasing the
Hausdorff dimension of its scanning pattern through a novel Hilbert Selective
Scan mechanism. This mechanism explores the feature space more effectively,
capturing intricate fine-scale details and improving overall coverage. As a
result, it mitigates information inconsistencies while refining spatial
locality to better capture subtle local interactions without sacrificing the
model's ability to handle long-range dependencies. Extensive experiments on
publicly available benchmarks demonstrate that our approach significantly
improves both the quantitative metrics and qualitative visual fidelity of
existing Mamba-based low-light image enhancement methods, all while reducing
computational resource consumption and shortening inference time. We believe
that this refined strategy not only advances the state-of-the-art in low-light
image enhancement but also holds promise for broader applications in fields
that leverage Mamba-based techniques.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A new benchmark, CAVE, addressing real-world visual anomalies is introduced, emphasizing human-like anomaly description, explanation, and justification tasks. It evaluates Vision-Language Models (VLMs) in detecting and understanding anomalies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of benchmarks capturing the richness and unpredictability of real-world anomalies in computer vision, and to advance the evaluation of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) in detecting visual anomalies.

Method: CAVE benchmark consisting of fine-grained annotations including visual grounding and categorization of anomalies based on complexity, severity, and commonness. It is inspired by cognitive science principles on anomaly identification.

Result: State-of-the-art VLMs show difficulties in visual anomaly perception and commonsense reasoning despite advanced prompting strategies.

Conclusion: CAVE provides a cognitively grounded benchmark, aiding in improving anomaly detection and commonsense reasoning in Vision-Language Models.

Abstract: Humans can naturally identify, reason about, and explain anomalies in their
environment. In computer vision, this long-standing challenge remains limited
to industrial defects or unrealistic, synthetically generated anomalies,
failing to capture the richness and unpredictability of real-world anomalies.
In this work, we introduce CAVE, the first benchmark of real-world visual
anomalies. CAVE supports three open-ended tasks: anomaly description,
explanation, and justification; with fine-grained annotations for visual
grounding and categorizing anomalies based on their visual manifestations,
their complexity, severity, and commonness. These annotations draw inspiration
from cognitive science research on how humans identify and resolve anomalies,
providing a comprehensive framework for evaluating Vision-Language Models
(VLMs) in detecting and understanding anomalies. We show that state-of-the-art
VLMs struggle with visual anomaly perception and commonsense reasoning, even
with advanced prompting strategies. By offering a realistic and cognitively
grounded benchmark, CAVE serves as a valuable resource for advancing research
in anomaly detection and commonsense reasoning in VLMs.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)-based model to efficiently predict coastal flooding in response to sea-level rise (SLR) under various scenarios, demonstrating improved accuracy over current methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Climate change and sea-level rise threaten coastal cities, necessitating efficient flood hazard prediction methods, as traditional hydrodynamic simulators are impractical for city-scale planning.

Method: The authors develop a lightweight CNN-based model using a vision-based, low-resource DL framework. It uses datasets from Abu Dhabi and San Francisco to predict flood depth maps under varying SLR and shoreline adaptation scenarios.

Result: The model outperforms existing methods, reducing mean absolute error (MAE) in flood depth maps prediction by roughly 20%.

Conclusion: The approach provides a scalable, accurate tool for coastal flooding management, aiding decision-makers in developing effective adaptation strategies to combat the impact of climate change.

Abstract: Climate change and sea-level rise (SLR) pose escalating threats to coastal
cities, intensifying the need for efficient and accurate methods to predict
potential flood hazards. Traditional physics-based hydrodynamic simulators,
although precise, are computationally expensive and impractical for city-scale
coastal planning applications. Deep Learning (DL) techniques offer promising
alternatives, however, they are often constrained by challenges such as data
scarcity and high-dimensional output requirements. Leveraging a recently
proposed vision-based, low-resource DL framework, we develop a novel,
lightweight Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)-based model designed to predict
coastal flooding under variable SLR projections and shoreline adaptation
scenarios. Furthermore, we demonstrate the ability of the model to generalize
across diverse geographical contexts by utilizing datasets from two distinct
regions: Abu Dhabi and San Francisco. Our findings demonstrate that the
proposed model significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, reducing the
mean absolute error (MAE) in predicted flood depth maps on average by nearly
20%. These results highlight the potential of our approach to serve as a
scalable and practical tool for coastal flood management, empowering
decision-makers to develop effective mitigation strategies in response to the
growing impacts of climate change. Project Page: https://caspiannet.github.io/

TL;DR: The paper proposes a novel Video-LLM architecture to address shortcomings in temporal video comprehension using stacked temporal attention in the vision encoder, achieving better results on video question answering.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current Video-LLM architectures struggle with understanding complex temporal dynamics and tasks requiring action sequence comprehension in videos.

Method: The proposed model enhances the vision encoder by incorporating stacked temporal attention modules, allowing better capture of action progression and inter-frame relationships before feeding data to the LLM.

Result: The model achieves significant performance improvements in temporal reasoning and outperforms current benchmarks by up to +5.5% on datasets like VITATECS, MVBench, and Video-MME.

Conclusion: Integrating temporal structure into the vision encoder effectively addresses the challenges in video understanding for Video-LLMs, making strides in action recognition and related tasks.

Abstract: Despite significant advances in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs),
understanding complex temporal dynamics in videos remains a major challenge.
Our experiments show that current Video Large Language Model (Video-LLM)
architectures have critical limitations in temporal understanding, struggling
with tasks that require detailed comprehension of action sequences and temporal
progression. In this work, we propose a Video-LLM architecture that introduces
stacked temporal attention modules directly within the vision encoder. This
design incorporates a temporal attention in vision encoder, enabling the model
to better capture the progression of actions and the relationships between
frames before passing visual tokens to the LLM. Our results show that this
approach significantly improves temporal reasoning and outperforms existing
models in video question answering tasks, specifically in action recognition.
We improve on benchmarks including VITATECS, MVBench, and Video-MME by up to
+5.5%. By enhancing the vision encoder with temporal structure, we address a
critical gap in video understanding for Video-LLMs. Project page and code are

*Yuyue Zhou,Jessica Knight,Shrimanti Ghosh,Banafshe Felfeliyan,Jacob L. Jaremko,Abhilash R. Hareendranathan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces FlexICL, a novel in-context learning framework for ultrasound (US) image segmentation that outperforms existing models while requiring fewer labeled images.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the challenge of time-consuming and costly expert annotations for segmenting ultrasound images used in diagnosing and treating pediatric elbow and wrist fractures.

Method: The authors propose FlexICL, a flexible in-context learning framework that segments bony regions in ultrasound images by requiring annotations for only a small subset of frames and using novel image concatenation and augmentation strategies to enhance performance.

Result: FlexICL demonstrates robust segmentation performance across four datasets, using only 5% of training images, and surpasses state-of-the-art visual models and conventional segmentation methods by 1-27% in Dice coefficient.

Conclusion: FlexICL is a promising, efficient, and scalable solution for medical ultrasound image segmentation, particularly valuable when labeled data is limited.

Abstract: Elbow and wrist fractures are the most common fractures in pediatric
populations. Automatic segmentation of musculoskeletal structures in ultrasound
(US) can improve diagnostic accuracy and treatment planning. Fractures appear
as cortical defects but require expert interpretation. Deep learning (DL) can
provide real-time feedback and highlight key structures, helping lightly
trained users perform exams more confidently. However, pixel-wise expert
annotations for training remain time-consuming and costly. To address this
challenge, we propose FlexICL, a novel and flexible in-context learning (ICL)
framework for segmenting bony regions in US images. We apply it to an
intra-video segmentation setting, where experts annotate only a small subset of
frames, and the model segments unseen frames. We systematically investigate
various image concatenation techniques and training strategies for visual ICL
and introduce novel concatenation methods that significantly enhance model
performance with limited labeled data. By integrating multiple augmentation
strategies, FlexICL achieves robust segmentation performance across four wrist
and elbow US datasets while requiring only 5% of the training images. It
outperforms state-of-the-art visual ICL models like Painter, MAE-VQGAN, and
conventional segmentation models like U-Net and TransUNet by 1-27% Dice
coefficient on 1,252 US sweeps. These initial results highlight the potential
of FlexICL as an efficient and scalable solution for US image segmentation well
suited for medical imaging use cases where labeled data is scarce.

*Hoyeon Chang,Seungjin Kim,Yoonseok Choi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Introduces a dynamic negative prompting method leveraging Vision-Language Models within diffusion models for adaptive negative prompt generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional negative prompting methods rely on fixed prompts, which may lack context during the denoising process.

Method: Generate intermediate image predictions at different denoising steps, then use VLMs to create context-appropriate negative prompts.

Result: Demonstrated effectiveness on benchmark datasets, showcasing trade-offs between negative guidance strength and text-image alignment.

Conclusion: Dynamic negative prompting enhances adaptability and context-awareness, improving performance compared to fixed methods.

Abstract: We propose a novel approach for dynamic negative prompting in diffusion
models that leverages Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to adaptively generate
negative prompts during the denoising process. Unlike traditional Negative
Prompting methods that use fixed negative prompts, our method generates
intermediate image predictions at specific denoising steps and queries a VLM to
produce contextually appropriate negative prompts. We evaluate our approach on
various benchmark datasets and demonstrate the trade-offs between negative
guidance strength and text-image alignment.

### [119] [Security Risk of Misalignment between Text and Image in Multi-modal Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26105)
*Xiaosen Wang,Zhijin Ge,Shaokang Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper identifies vulnerabilities in multi-modal diffusion models, exposing their susceptibility to manipulated inputs and introducing the Prompt-Restricted Multi-modal Attack (PReMA) to exploit these flaws.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address the underexplored issue of adversarial inputs in multi-modal diffusion models and its implications on generating inappropriate content.

Method: The proposed method, PReMA, manipulates the output of multi-modal diffusion models by altering input images while keeping textual prompts unchanged.

Result: PReMA successfully exploits the misalignment between textual and image modalities in existing models, demonstrating its effectiveness through evaluations in image inpainting and style transfer tasks.

Conclusion: PReMA highlights a critical vulnerability in multi-modal diffusion models, emphasizing the need for stronger alignment mechanisms to safeguard their outputs.

Abstract: Despite the notable advancements and versatility of multi-modal diffusion
models, such as text-to-image models, their susceptibility to adversarial
inputs remains underexplored. Contrary to expectations, our investigations
reveal that the alignment between textual and Image modalities in existing
diffusion models is inadequate. This misalignment presents significant risks,
especially in the generation of inappropriate or Not-Safe-For-Work (NSFW)
content. To this end, we propose a novel attack called Prompt-Restricted
Multi-modal Attack (PReMA) to manipulate the generated content by modifying the
input image in conjunction with any specified prompt, without altering the
prompt itself. PReMA is the first attack that manipulates model outputs by
solely creating adversarial images, distinguishing itself from prior methods
that primarily generate adversarial prompts to produce NSFW content.
Consequently, PReMA poses a novel threat to the integrity of multi-modal
diffusion models, particularly in image-editing applications that operate with
fixed prompts. Comprehensive evaluations conducted on image inpainting and
style transfer tasks across various models confirm the potent efficacy of
PReMA.

*Minjoon Jung,Junbin Xiao,Junghyun Kim,Byoung-Tak Zhang,Angela Yao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces the EgoExo-Con benchmark to evaluate temporal understanding consistency in video language models (Video-LLMs) across egocentric and exocentric viewpoints, along with proposing a novel reinforcement learning method, View-GRPO.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the challenge of temporal understanding in Video-LLMs, especially when videos capture the same events from different viewpoints, and to improve the consistency of comprehension across these perspectives.

Method: The authors propose EgoExo-Con, a benchmark dataset focusing on temporal verification and grounding tasks, and introduce View-GRPO, a reinforcement learning framework that enhances view-specific temporal reasoning and promotes cross-view consistency.

Result: The analysis shows existing Video-LLMs struggle with maintaining cross-view temporal consistency; meanwhile, the proposed View-GRPO improves consistency significantly compared to naive approaches.

Conclusion: This paper highlights significant limitations in current Video-LLMs, proposes a solution with View-GRPO, and validates its efficacy in improving temporal understanding consistency across different viewpoints. Resources will be publicly available.

Abstract: Can Video-LLMs achieve consistent temporal understanding when videos capture
the same event from different viewpoints? To study this, we introduce
EgoExo-Con (Consistency), a benchmark of comprehensively synchronized
egocentric and exocentric video pairs with human-refined queries in natural
language. EgoExo-Con emphasizes two temporal understanding tasks: Temporal
Verification and Temporal Grounding. It evaluates not only correctness but
consistency across viewpoints. Our analysis reveals two critical limitations of
existing Video-LLMs: (1) models often fail to maintain consistency, with
results far worse than their single-view performances. (2) When naively
finetuned with synchronized videos of both viewpoints, the models show improved
consistency but often underperform those trained on a single view. For
improvements, we propose View-GRPO, a novel reinforcement learning framework
that effectively strengthens view-specific temporal reasoning while encouraging
consistent comprehension across viewpoints. Our method demonstrates its
superiority over naive SFT and GRPO, especially for improving cross-view
consistency. All resources will be made publicly available.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: OracleAgent is a system designed for organizing and improving efficiency in studying Oracle Bone Script (OBS) via advanced analysis tools and a domain-specific knowledge base.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the complexity in interpreting Oracle Bone Script and increase the efficiency of managing and retrieving OBS-related resources.

Method: Development of OracleAgent, integrating OBS analysis tools powered by large language models, and a comprehensive multimodal knowledge base with annotated data.

Result: OracleAgent demonstrated superior performance in multimodal reasoning and generation tasks, outperforming existing language models like GPT-4o.

Conclusion: OracleAgent represents a significant advancement in OBS research by reducing time costs and automating interpretation effectively.

Abstract: As one of the earliest writing systems, Oracle Bone Script (OBS) preserves
the cultural and intellectual heritage of ancient civilizations. However,
current OBS research faces two major challenges: (1) the interpretation of OBS
involves a complex workflow comprising multiple serial and parallel sub-tasks,
and (2) the efficiency of OBS information organization and retrieval remains a
critical bottleneck, as scholars often spend substantial effort searching for,
compiling, and managing relevant resources. To address these challenges, we
present OracleAgent, the first agent system designed for the structured
management and retrieval of OBS-related information. OracleAgent seamlessly
integrates multiple OBS analysis tools, empowered by large language models
(LLMs), and can flexibly orchestrate these components. Additionally, we
construct a comprehensive domain-specific multimodal knowledge base for OBS,
which is built through a rigorous multi-year process of data collection,
cleaning, and expert annotation. The knowledge base comprises over 1.4M
single-character rubbing images and 80K interpretation texts. OracleAgent
leverages this resource through its multimodal tools to assist experts in
retrieval tasks of character, document, interpretation text, and rubbing image.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that OracleAgent achieves superior
performance across a range of multimodal reasoning and generation tasks,
surpassing leading mainstream multimodal large language models (MLLMs) (e.g.,
GPT-4o). Furthermore, our case study illustrates that OracleAgent can
effectively assist domain experts, significantly reducing the time cost of OBS
research. These results highlight OracleAgent as a significant step toward the
practical deployment of OBS-assisted research and automated interpretation
systems.

*Yuxuan Li,Tao Wang,Xianben Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a framework to synthesize novel views by jointly optimizing 3D Gaussian points and camera poses without relying on pre-calibrated inputs or external tools like COLMAP.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional methods for novel view synthesis rely on external camera pose estimation tools like COLMAP, which can be computationally inefficient and error-prone.

Method: The approach jointly and iteratively refines 3D Gaussian parameters and camera poses via a two-phase optimization: first updating Gaussian points through differentiable rendering and then refining camera poses using a specialized optical flow algorithm.

Result: The proposed method improves reconstruction quality and camera pose accuracy, outperforming both COLMAP-free techniques and COLMAP-based baselines, especially under challenging conditions.

Conclusion: This approach eliminates dependency on external pose estimation tools, enhances scene reconstruction fidelity, and handles scenarios with large viewpoint variations better than traditional methods.

Abstract: Traditional novel view synthesis methods heavily rely on external camera pose
estimation tools such as COLMAP, which often introduce computational
bottlenecks and propagate errors. To address these challenges, we propose a
unified framework that jointly optimizes 3D Gaussian points and camera poses
without requiring pre-calibrated inputs. Our approach iteratively refines 3D
Gaussian parameters and updates camera poses through a novel co-optimization
strategy, ensuring simultaneous improvements in scene reconstruction fidelity
and pose accuracy. The key innovation lies in decoupling the joint optimization
into two interleaved phases: first, updating 3D Gaussian parameters via
differentiable rendering with fixed poses, and second, refining camera poses
using a customized 3D optical flow algorithm that incorporates geometric and
photometric constraints. This formulation progressively reduces projection
errors, particularly in challenging scenarios with large viewpoint variations
and sparse feature distributions, where traditional methods struggle. Extensive
evaluations on multiple datasets demonstrate that our approach significantly
outperforms existing COLMAP-free techniques in reconstruction quality, and also
surpasses the standard COLMAP-based baseline in general.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces WOD-E2E, a dataset focusing on rare, challenging long-tail driving scenarios, alongside a novel evaluation metric (RFS) for E2E autonomous driving systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current E2E driving benchmarks rarely address the system's performance in long-tail or rare scenarios, and existing metrics fail to effectively evaluate performance in such cases.

Method: The authors curated the Waymo Open Dataset for End-to-End Driving (WOD-E2E) featuring rare long-tail scenarios and developed a novel evaluation metric called Rater Feedback Score (RFS) for trajectory assessment.

Result: The WOD-E2E dataset includes 4,021 driving segments from challenging scenarios, adding high-level routing, ego states, and 360-degree views for detailed performance evaluations.

Conclusion: WOD-E2E and the RFS metric support advancing research in robust E2E autonomous driving systems, especially for complex and rare real-world situations.

Abstract: Vision-based end-to-end (E2E) driving has garnered significant interest in
the research community due to its scalability and synergy with multimodal large
language models (MLLMs). However, current E2E driving benchmarks primarily
feature nominal scenarios, failing to adequately test the true potential of
these systems. Furthermore, existing open-loop evaluation metrics often fall
short in capturing the multi-modal nature of driving or effectively evaluating
performance in long-tail scenarios. To address these gaps, we introduce the
Waymo Open Dataset for End-to-End Driving (WOD-E2E). WOD-E2E contains 4,021
driving segments (approximately 12 hours), specifically curated for challenging
long-tail scenarios that that are rare in daily life with an occurring
frequency of less than 0.03%. Concretely, each segment in WOD-E2E includes the
high-level routing information, ego states, and 360-degree camera views from 8
surrounding cameras. To evaluate the E2E driving performance on these long-tail
situations, we propose a novel open-loop evaluation metric: Rater Feedback
Score (RFS). Unlike conventional metrics that measure the distance between
predicted way points and the logs, RFS measures how closely the predicted
trajectory matches rater-annotated trajectory preference labels. We have
released rater preference labels for all WOD-E2E validation set segments, while
the held out test set labels have been used for the 2025 WOD-E2E Challenge.
Through our work, we aim to foster state of the art research into
generalizable, robust, and safe end-to-end autonomous driving agents capable of
handling complex real-world situations.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes using gradient-based attention information in CNNs for enhanced RGB-D indoor SLAM performance, showing improved frame association in large environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While visualization techniques provide insights into CNN reasoning, integrating gradient-based attention information into CNN representations for semantic object understanding has been limited. This integration is useful for visual tasks like SLAM.

Method: Layer-wise attention information derived from network gradients is integrated with CNN feature representations for better frame association in RGB-D indoor SLAM.

Result: Experimental comparison shows the proposed method enhances performance over baseline approaches, especially in large environments.

Conclusion: Integrating task-specific attention information into CNN representations benefits RGB-D indoor SLAM, improving localization and performance.

Abstract: Attention models have recently emerged as a powerful approach, demonstrating
significant progress in various fields. Visualization techniques, such as class
activation mapping, provide visual insights into the reasoning of convolutional
neural networks (CNNs). Using network gradients, it is possible to identify
regions where the network pays attention during image recognition tasks.
Furthermore, these gradients can be combined with CNN features to localize more
generalizable, task-specific attentive (salient) regions within scenes.
However, explicit use of this gradient-based attention information integrated
directly into CNN representations for semantic object understanding remains
limited. Such integration is particularly beneficial for visual tasks like
simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM), where CNN representations
enriched with spatially attentive object locations can enhance performance. In
this work, we propose utilizing task-specific network attention for RGB-D
indoor SLAM. Specifically, we integrate layer-wise attention information
derived from network gradients with CNN feature representations to improve
frame association performance. Experimental results indicate improved
performance compared to baseline methods, particularly for large environments.

TL;DR: FullPart is a novel framework for 3D part-based generation that combines implicit and explicit methods for detailed and coherent results, addressing common issues in prior techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improve the quality of 3D part-based generation by addressing limitations in existing methods, such as insufficient geometric detail and degraded quality in small parts.

Method: Develop a two-step approach: using implicit diffusion for bounding box layout generation and explicit full-resolution voxel grids for part details. Introduce a center-point encoding strategy and create PartVerse-XL, a large annotated dataset.

Result: FullPart demonstrates state-of-the-art performance in 3D part generation when tested against benchmarks.

Conclusion: The combination of implicit and explicit paradigms in FullPart enhances 3D part generation quality, resolves existing challenges, and promotes further research by releasing its datasets and framework.

Abstract: Part-based 3D generation holds great potential for various applications.
Previous part generators that represent parts using implicit vector-set tokens
often suffer from insufficient geometric details. Another line of work adopts
an explicit voxel representation but shares a global voxel grid among all
parts; this often causes small parts to occupy too few voxels, leading to
degraded quality. In this paper, we propose FullPart, a novel framework that
combines both implicit and explicit paradigms. It first derives the bounding
box layout through an implicit box vector-set diffusion process, a task that
implicit diffusion handles effectively since box tokens contain little
geometric detail. Then, it generates detailed parts, each within its own fixed
full-resolution voxel grid. Instead of sharing a global low-resolution space,
each part in our method - even small ones - is generated at full resolution,
enabling the synthesis of intricate details. We further introduce a
center-point encoding strategy to address the misalignment issue when
exchanging information between parts of different actual sizes, thereby
maintaining global coherence. Moreover, to tackle the scarcity of reliable part
data, we present PartVerse-XL, the largest human-annotated 3D part dataset to
date with 40K objects and 320K parts. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
FullPart achieves state-of-the-art results in 3D part generation. We will
release all code, data, and model to benefit future research in 3D part
generation.

TL;DR: This paper introduces BasicAVSR, a new model for arbitrary-scale video super-resolution, that integrates four key methodological components to improve spatial detail, temporal consistency, and computational efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address challenges in arbitrary-scale video super-resolution, including spatial detail preservation, temporal consistency, and computational complexity.

Method: BasicAVSR is a model that integrates image Laplacian pyramid-frequency priors, a flow-guided propagation unit, second-order motion compensation for spatial alignment, and hyper-upsampling kernels for scale-aware content-independent upsampling. It offers three propagation variants for online and offline tasks.

Result: Experimental results show that BasicAVSR outperforms existing methods significantly in quality, generalization, and inference speed across diverse application scenarios.

Conclusion: BasicAVSR improves video super-resolution performance and adaptability, setting the state-of-the-art standards in the field and extending its components for various applications.

Abstract: Arbitrary-scale video super-resolution (AVSR) aims to enhance the resolution
of video frames, potentially at various scaling factors, which presents several
challenges regarding spatial detail reproduction, temporal consistency, and
computational complexity. In this paper, we propose a strong baseline BasicAVSR
for AVSR by integrating four key components: 1) adaptive multi-scale frequency
priors generated from image Laplacian pyramids, 2) a flow-guided propagation
unit to aggregate spatiotemporal information from adjacent frames, 3) a
second-order motion compensation unit for more accurate spatial alignment of
adjacent frames, and 4) a hyper-upsampling unit to generate scale-aware and
content-independent upsampling kernels. To meet diverse application demands, we
instantiate three propagation variants: (i) a unidirectional RNN unit for
strictly online inference, (ii) a unidirectional RNN unit empowered with a
limited lookahead that tolerates a small output delay, and (iii) a
bidirectional RNN unit designed for offline tasks where computational resources
are less constrained. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and
adaptability of our model across these different scenarios. Through extensive
experiments, we show that BasicAVSR significantly outperforms existing methods
in terms of super-resolution quality, generalization ability, and inference
speed. Our work not only advances the state-of-the-art in AVSR but also extends
its core components to multiple frameworks for diverse scenarios. The code is

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Annotated mammography datasets are critical for effective breast cancer diagnosis, yet collecting them is costly and time-consuming. Vision-Language Models (VLMs) like CLIP offer potential solutions to improve robustness and efficiency in medical imaging tasks.

Method: MV-MLM combines multi-view mammograms and synthetic radiology reports through a cross-modal self-supervised learning approach, employing a novel joint visual-textual learning strategy for classification tasks.

Result: The model achieves state-of-the-art results in malignancy classification, subtype classification, and cancer risk prediction, showcasing enhanced generalization and data efficiency compared to existing supervised methods or VLM baselines.

Conclusion: The proposed MV-MLM leverages vision-language data to perform breast cancer detection and risk prediction effectively, reducing dependency on extensively annotated datasets and highlighting its potential in medical imaging applications.

Abstract: Large annotated datasets are essential for training robust Computer-Aided
Diagnosis (CAD) models for breast cancer detection or risk prediction. However,
acquiring such datasets with fine-detailed annotation is both costly and
time-consuming. Vision-Language Models (VLMs), such as CLIP, which are
pre-trained on large image-text pairs, offer a promising solution by enhancing
robustness and data efficiency in medical imaging tasks. This paper introduces
a novel Multi-View Mammography and Language Model for breast cancer
classification and risk prediction, trained on a dataset of paired mammogram
images and synthetic radiology reports. Our MV-MLM leverages multi-view
supervision to learn rich representations from extensive radiology data by
employing cross-modal self-supervision across image-text pairs. This includes
multiple views and the corresponding pseudo-radiology reports. We propose a
novel joint visual-textual learning strategy to enhance generalization and
accuracy performance over different data types and tasks to distinguish breast
tissues or cancer characteristics(calcification, mass) and utilize these
patterns to understand mammography images and predict cancer risk. We evaluated
our method on both private and publicly available datasets, demonstrating that
the proposed model achieves state-of-the-art performance in three
classification tasks: (1) malignancy classification, (2) subtype
classification, and (3) image-based cancer risk prediction. Furthermore, the
model exhibits strong data efficiency, outperforming existing fully supervised
or VLM baselines while trained on synthetic text reports and without the need
for actual radiology reports.

TL;DR: This paper introduces a machine learning-based approach using the YOLOv8 model for detecting auto-rickshaws in traffic images, achieving high accuracy and releasing a public dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges of monitoring auto-rickshaws in Bangladesh due to similarities with other vehicles and the inefficiencies of manual analysis.

Method: Real-time object detection using the YOLOv8 model, trained with 1,730 annotated traffic images.

Result: The model achieved mAP50 of 83.447%, and binary precision and recall values above 78%, demonstrating effective performance in varied traffic scenarios.

Conclusion: The proposed system effectively automates auto-rickshaw detection, improving surveillance systems and enabling better traffic monitoring in South Asian countries.

Abstract: Modes of transportation vary across countries depending on geographical
location and cultural context. In South Asian countries rickshaws are among the
most common means of local transport. Based on their mode of operation,
rickshaws in cities across Bangladesh can be broadly classified into non-auto
(pedal-powered) and auto-rickshaws (motorized). Monitoring the movement of
auto-rickshaws is necessary as traffic rules often restrict auto-rickshaws from
accessing certain routes. However, existing surveillance systems make it quite
difficult to monitor them due to their similarity to other vehicles, especially
non-auto rickshaws whereas manual video analysis is too time-consuming. This
paper presents a machine learning-based approach to automatically detect
auto-rickshaws in traffic images. In this system, we used real-time object
detection using the YOLOv8 model. For training purposes, we prepared a set of
1,730 annotated images that were captured under various traffic conditions. The
results show that our proposed model performs well in real-time auto-rickshaw
detection and offers an mAP50 of 83.447% and binary precision and recall values
above 78%, demonstrating its effectiveness in handling both dense and sparse
traffic scenarios. The dataset has been publicly released for further research.

TL;DR: The paper introduces CRAG-MM, a benchmark specifically for multi-modal, multi-turn conversations for wearable devices, covering diverse and challenging scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Wearable devices need robust question answering systems to enhance user interaction, but no comprehensive benchmark exists for multi-modal retrieval-augmented generation (MM-RAG) in wearable scenarios.

Method: CRAG-MM offers 6.5K image-question-answer triplets, 2K visual-based multi-turn conversations from wearable device perspectives, and introduces tasks like single-source/multi-source augmentation paired with retrieval APIs.

Result: Straightforward approaches achieved only 32% and 43% truthfulness for single- and multi-turn QA. Winning solutions from KDD Cup 2025 improved baseline results by 28%, showing room for advancement.

Conclusion: CRAG-MM fills a significant gap in wearable multi-modal QA benchmarks, fostering research with measurable improvements and addressing real-world scenarios via competitions.

Abstract: Wearable devices such as smart glasses are transforming the way people
interact with their surroundings, enabling users to seek information regarding
entities in their view. Multi-Modal Retrieval-Augmented Generation (MM-RAG)
plays a key role in supporting such questions, yet there is still no
comprehensive benchmark for this task, especially regarding wearables
scenarios. To fill this gap, we present CRAG-MM -- a Comprehensive RAG
benchmark for Multi-modal Multi-turn conversations. CRAG-MM contains a diverse
set of 6.5K (image, question, answer) triplets and 2K visual-based multi-turn
conversations across 13 domains, including 6.2K egocentric images designed to
mimic captures from wearable devices. We carefully constructed the questions to
reflect real-world scenarios and challenges, including five types of
image-quality issues, six question types, varying entity popularity, differing
information dynamism, and different conversation turns. We design three tasks:
single-source augmentation, multi-source augmentation, and multi-turn
conversations -- each paired with an associated retrieval corpus and APIs for
both image-KG retrieval and webpage retrieval. Our evaluation shows that
straightforward RAG approaches achieve only 32% and 43% truthfulness on CRAG-MM

### [130] [MoTDiff: High-resolution Motion Trajectory estimation from a single blurred image using Diffusion models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26173)
*Wontae Choi,Jaelin Lee,Hyung Sup Yun,Byeungwoo Jeon,Il Yong Chun*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces MoTDiff, a novel framework leveraging diffusion models to produce high-resolution motion trajectory estimations from a single blurred image, outperforming existing methods in image deblurring and coded exposure photography.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing motion estimation methods produce coarse and inaccurate motion representations, limiting their effectiveness in computational imaging and vision applications.

Method: The authors developed MoTDiff, a conditional diffusion framework utilizing multi-scale feature maps extracted from blurred images and designed a training method to improve motion trajectory precision and connectivity.

Result: Experiments show MoTDiff achieves superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods in blind image deblurring and coded exposure photography.

Conclusion: MoTDiff represents a significant advance in estimating high-resolution motion trajectories from single blurred images, improving the quality of motion extraction for various imaging applications.

Abstract: Accurate estimation of motion information is crucial in diverse computational
imaging and computer vision applications. Researchers have investigated various
methods to extract motion information from a single blurred image, including
blur kernels and optical flow. However, existing motion representations are
often of low quality, i.e., coarse-grained and inaccurate. In this paper, we
propose the first high-resolution (HR) Motion Trajectory estimation framework
using Diffusion models (MoTDiff). Different from existing motion
representations, we aim to estimate an HR motion trajectory with high-quality
from a single motion-blurred image. The proposed MoTDiff consists of two key
components: 1) a new conditional diffusion framework that uses multi-scale
feature maps extracted from a single blurred image as a condition, and 2) a new
training method that can promote precise identification of a fine-grained
motion trajectory, consistent estimation of overall shape and position of a
motion path, and pixel connectivity along a motion trajectory. Our experiments
demonstrate that the proposed MoTDiff can outperform state-of-the-art methods
in both blind image deblurring and coded exposure photography applications.

*Jinho Choi,Hyesu Lim,Steffen Schneider,Jaegul Choo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ConceptScope is a framework that identifies and analyzes dataset biases using sparse autoencoders and vision foundation models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Dataset biases are challenging to identify systematically without costly attribute annotations.

Method: ConceptScope uses Sparse Autoencoders and foundation model representations to discover and quantify concepts in datasets.

Result: The framework categorizes dataset biases into semantic types, detects known biases, and discovers new biases, validated via comparisons and spatial attribution analyses.

Conclusion: ConceptScope provides an automated, scalable tool for dataset auditing and model diagnostics, offering insights for improving machine learning datasets.

Abstract: Dataset bias, where data points are skewed to certain concepts, is ubiquitous
in machine learning datasets. Yet, systematically identifying these biases is
challenging without costly, fine-grained attribute annotations. We present
ConceptScope, a scalable and automated framework for analyzing visual datasets
by discovering and quantifying human-interpretable concepts using Sparse
Autoencoders trained on representations from vision foundation models.
ConceptScope categorizes concepts into target, context, and bias types based on
their semantic relevance and statistical correlation to class labels, enabling
class-level dataset characterization, bias identification, and robustness
evaluation through concept-based subgrouping. We validate that ConceptScope
captures a wide range of visual concepts, including objects, textures,
backgrounds, facial attributes, emotions, and actions, through comparisons with
annotated datasets. Furthermore, we show that concept activations produce
spatial attributions that align with semantically meaningful image regions.
ConceptScope reliably detects known biases (e.g., background bias in
Waterbirds) and uncovers previously unannotated ones (e.g, co-occurring objects
in ImageNet), offering a practical tool for dataset auditing and model
diagnostics.

*Li Wang,Yiyu Zhuang,Yanwen Wang,Xun Cao,Chuan Guo,Xinxin Zuo,Hao Zhu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel method for 3D human pose estimation from sketches through a diffusion model-based approach, creating synthetic datasets (SKEP-120K) for accurate sketch-3D pose mappings and establishing an end-to-end framework outperforming previous methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to solve challenges in estimating 3D human poses from sketches, which involve abstract and disproportionate human structures, and overcome the limitations of heuristic-based methods dependent on scarce annotations.

Method: A diffusion model synthesizes sketch images from 2D poses projected from 3D human poses to create synthetic datasets, enabling the training of an end-to-end framework that integrates 2D pose detectors, generative priors for feature extraction, and a feed-forward neural network for efficient estimation.

Result: The model delivers superior performance in accuracy and speed for sketch-to-pose tasks as demonstrated through qualitative, quantitative, and subjective evaluations.

Conclusion: This study establishes a method significantly improving the accuracy and efficiency of sketch-based 3D human pose estimation by leveraging synthetic data and an end-to-end framework.

Abstract: 3D human pose estimation from sketches has broad applications in computer
animation and film production. Unlike traditional human pose estimation, this
task presents unique challenges due to the abstract and disproportionate nature
of sketches. Previous sketch-to-pose methods, constrained by the lack of
large-scale sketch-3D pose annotations, primarily relied on optimization with
heuristic rules-an approach that is both time-consuming and limited in
generalizability. To address these challenges, we propose a novel approach
leveraging a "learn from synthesis" strategy. First, a diffusion model is
trained to synthesize sketch images from 2D poses projected from 3D human
poses, mimicking disproportionate human structures in sketches. This process
enables the creation of a synthetic dataset, SKEP-120K, consisting of 120k
accurate sketch-3D pose annotation pairs across various sketch styles. Building
on this synthetic dataset, we introduce an end-to-end data-driven framework for
estimating human poses and shapes from diverse sketch styles. Our framework
combines existing 2D pose detectors and generative diffusion priors for sketch
feature extraction with a feed-forward neural network for efficient 2D pose
estimation. Multiple heuristic loss functions are incorporated to guarantee
geometric coherence between the derived 3D poses and the detected 2D poses
while preserving accurate self-contacts. Qualitative, quantitative, and
subjective evaluations collectively show that our model substantially surpasses
previous ones in both estimation accuracy and speed for sketch-to-pose tasks.

*Mehdi Khaleghi,Nastaran Khaleghi,Sobhan Sheykhivand,Sebelan Danishvar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a geometrical deep learning-based ensemble network (Ch-EGN) to improve supply chain sustainability and efficiency in product classification and risk management, achieving impressive accuracies across various tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges in supply chain sustainability and risk management by leveraging deep network techniques to improve classification accuracy and operational efficiency.

Method: The study proposes an ensemble deep network, Chebyshev ensemble geometric network (Ch-EGN), integrating hybrid convolutional and geometric deep learning to derive hidden states in supply chain datasets.

Result: The proposed network achieved high accuracies: 98.95% for risk management, 100% for 5 product group classification, 98.07% for 4 product relation classification, and 92.37% for 25 company relation classification.

Conclusion: The results show significant improvements in supply chain classification accuracy and risk management efficiency compared to existing methods, confirming the effectiveness of Ch-EGN.

Abstract: The sustainability of supply chain plays a key role in achieving optimal
performance in controlling the supply chain. The management of risks that occur
in a supply chain is a fundamental problem for the purpose of developing the
sustainability of the network and elevating the performance efficiency of the
supply chain. The correct classification of products is another essential
element in a sustainable supply chain. Acknowledging recent breakthroughs in
the context of deep networks, several architectural options have been deployed
to analyze supply chain datasets. A novel geometric deep network is used to
propose an ensemble deep network. The proposed Chebyshev ensemble geometric
network (Ch-EGN) is a hybrid convolutional and geometric deep learning. This
network is proposed to leverage the information dependencies in supply chain to
derive invisible states of samples in the database. The functionality of the
proposed deep network is assessed on the two different databases. The
SupplyGraph Dataset and DataCo are considered in this research. The prediction
of delivery status of DataCo supply chain is done for risk administration. The
product classification and edge classification are performed using the
SupplyGraph database to enhance the sustainability of the supply network. An
average accuracy of 98.95% is obtained for the ensemble network for risk
management. The average accuracy of 100% and 98.07% are obtained for
sustainable supply chain in terms of 5 product group classification and 4
product relation classification, respectively. The average accuracy of 92.37%
is attained for 25 company relation classification. The results confirm an
average improvement and efficiency of the proposed method compared to the
state-of-the-art approaches.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces OmniLayout-1M, a large-scale diverse document layout dataset, and proposes OmniLayout-LLM, a model that uses a two-stage learning approach to excel in document layout generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing efforts in Document AI focus more on layout analysis than layout generation. The lack of diverse and representative layout datasets, dominated by academic paper structures, limits advancements in generative tasks.

Method: The authors created OmniLayout-1M, a dataset containing diverse and contemporary document layouts across six types. They also developed OmniLayout-LLM, a model that uses a two-stage Coarse-to-Fine learning approach, training first on general principles and then fine-tuning with specific annotations.

Result: OmniLayout-LLM significantly outperforms state-of-the-art layout generation models and large language models on benchmarks such as the M$^{6}$Doc dataset.

Conclusion: This research proposes a practical solution to address the gap in document layout generation, demonstrating advancements through OmniLayout-1M and the OmniLayout-LLM model. The tools and findings will be made publicly available.

Abstract: Document AI has advanced rapidly and is attracting increasing attention. Yet,
while most efforts have focused on document layout analysis (DLA), its
generative counterpart, document layout generation, remains underexplored. A
major obstacle lies in the scarcity of diverse layouts: academic papers with
Manhattan-style structures dominate existing studies, while open-world genres
such as newspapers and magazines remain severely underrepresented. To address
this gap, we curate OmniLayout-1M, the first million-scale dataset of diverse
document layouts, covering six common document types and comprising
contemporary layouts collected from multiple sources. Moreover, since existing
methods struggle in complex domains and often fail to arrange long sequences
coherently, we introduce OmniLayout-LLM, a 0.5B model with designed two-stage
Coarse-to-Fine learning paradigm: 1) learning universal layout principles from
OmniLayout-1M with coarse category definitions, and 2) transferring the
knowledge to a specific domain with fine-grained annotations. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves strong performance on
multiple domains in M$^{6}$Doc dataset, substantially surpassing both existing
layout generation experts and several latest general-purpose LLMs. Our code,
models, and dataset will be publicly released.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper addresses the robustness of Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models against real-world multi-modal perturbations, proposing a framework called RobustVLA.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current VLA models lack robustness to multi-modal perturbations, especially in actions, instructions, environments, and observations.

Method: RobustVLA utilizes offline robust optimization for output perturbations and consistency enforcement for input variations, combining adversarial approaches to handle multi-modal challenges.

Result: RobustVLA shows absolute improvement of 12.6% and 10.4% over baselines like pi0 and OpenVLA, achieving faster inference and significant performance gains under mixed and real-world scenarios.

Conclusion: The introduction of RobustVLA establishes enhanced robustness in VLAs across varied perturbations, addressing the fragility of traditional models and outperforming existing benchmarks.

Abstract: In Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models, robustness to real-world
perturbations is critical for deployment. Existing methods target simple visual
disturbances, overlooking the broader multi-modal perturbations that arise in
actions, instructions, environments, and observations. Here, we first evaluate
the robustness of mainstream VLAs under 17 perturbations across four
modalities. We find (1) actions as the most fragile modality, (2) Existing
visual-robust VLA do not gain robustness in other modality, and (3) pi0
demonstrates superior robustness with a diffusion-based action head. To build
multi-modal robust VLAs, we propose RobustVLA against perturbations in VLA
inputs and outputs. For output robustness, we perform offline robust
optimization against worst-case action noise that maximizes mismatch in flow
matching objective. This can be seen as adversarial training, label smoothing,
and outlier penalization. For input robustness, we enforce consistent actions
across input variations that preserve task semantics. To account for multiple
perturbations, we formulate robustness as a multi-armed bandit problem and
apply an upper confidence bound algorithm to automatically identify the most
harmful noise. Experiments on LIBERO demonstrate our RobustVLA delivers
absolute gains over baselines of 12.6% on the pi0 backbone and 10.4% on the
OpenVLA backbone across all 17 perturbations, achieving 50.6x faster inference
than existing visual-robust VLAs, and a 10.4% gain under mixed perturbations.
Our RobustVLA is particularly effective on real-world FR5 robot with limited
demonstrations, showing absolute gains by 65.6% under perturbations of four
modalities.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper presents a benchmark study, AoT-PsyPhyBENCH, to assess Vision-Language Models (VLMs) in understanding temporal information in videos, with a focus on detecting the arrow of time.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current VLMs excel at multimodal tasks but struggle with understanding temporal sequences in video. This gap in temporal reasoning is under-explored and demands investigation.

Method: The authors created AoT-PsyPhyBENCH, a psychophysically validated benchmark, and evaluated various VLMs on their ability to discern temporal directionality using human-established behavioral baselines.

Result: The study found that most VLMs performed at chance level and significantly underperformed humans on tasks involving irreversible physical processes and causal actions.

Conclusion: There is a fundamental deficiency in VLMs' temporal and causal understanding despite their strong visual-semantic capabilities. The authors provide their benchmark publicly to drive innovation in this domain.

Abstract: Modern vision-language models (VLMs) excel at many multimodal tasks, yet
their grasp of temporal information in video remains weak and, crucially,
under-evaluated. We probe this gap with a deceptively simple but revealing
challenge: judging the arrow of time (AoT)-whether a short clip is played
forward or backward. We introduce AoT-PsyPhyBENCH, a psychophysically validated
benchmark that tests whether VLMs can infer temporal direction in natural
videos using the same stimuli and behavioral baselines established for humans.
Our comprehensive evaluation of open-weight and proprietary, reasoning and
non-reasoning VLMs reveals that most models perform near chance, and even the
best lag far behind human accuracy on physically irreversible processes (e.g.,
free fall, diffusion/explosion) and causal manual actions (division/addition)
that humans recognize almost instantly. These results highlight a fundamental
gap in current multimodal systems: while they capture rich visual-semantic
correlations, they lack the inductive biases required for temporal continuity
and causal understanding. We release the code and data for AoT-PsyPhyBENCH to
encourage further progress in the physical and temporal reasoning capabilities
of VLMs.

*Lin Guo,Xiaoqing Luo,Wei Xie,Zhancheng Zhang,Hui Li,Rui Wang,Zhenhua Feng,Xiaoning Song*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces HCLFuse, a novel method for infrared and visible image fusion inspired by human cognitive laws. It leverages a variational bottleneck encoder and diffusion model to enhance structural details and reduce data quality dependency, achieving improved fusion performance and semantic segmentation metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods struggle to balance modal information, suffer from limited generative capabilities, and lack interpretability in selection processes, affecting reliability and performance in complex scenarios.

Method: HCLFuse employs a multi-scale mask-regulated variational bottleneck encoder for extracting accurate low-level modal information and integrates a diffusion model with time-varying physical guidance mechanisms to enhance generative capabilities.

Result: Experimental results demonstrate state-of-the-art performance in qualitative and quantitative assessments across datasets, with significant improvements in semantic segmentation metrics.

Conclusion: HCLFuse effectively enhances structural consistency and detail quality in image fusion tasks by combining human cognition-inspired techniques with advanced generative models, proving to be a superior solution.

Abstract: Existing infrared and visible image fusion methods often face the dilemma of
balancing modal information. Generative fusion methods reconstruct fused images
by learning from data distributions, but their generative capabilities remain
limited. Moreover, the lack of interpretability in modal information selection
further affects the reliability and consistency of fusion results in complex
scenarios. This manuscript revisits the essence of generative image fusion
under the inspiration of human cognitive laws and proposes a novel infrared and
visible image fusion method, termed HCLFuse. First, HCLFuse investigates the
quantification theory of information mapping in unsupervised fusion networks,
which leads to the design of a multi-scale mask-regulated variational
bottleneck encoder. This encoder applies posterior probability modeling and
information decomposition to extract accurate and concise low-level modal
information, thereby supporting the generation of high-fidelity structural
details. Furthermore, the probabilistic generative capability of the diffusion
model is integrated with physical laws, forming a time-varying physical
guidance mechanism that adaptively regulates the generation process at
different stages, thereby enhancing the ability of the model to perceive the
intrinsic structure of data and reducing dependence on data quality.
Experimental results show that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art
fusion performance in qualitative and quantitative evaluations across multiple
datasets and significantly improves semantic segmentation metrics. This fully
demonstrates the advantages of this generative image fusion method, drawing
inspiration from human cognition, in enhancing structural consistency and
detail quality.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Explore how various CNN architectures can be combined to enhance periocular verification across different distances.

Method: Three CNN architectures (SqueezeNet, MobileNetv2, ResNet50) were trained on VGGFace2 eye crops, with subsequent analysis using cosine and chi2 metrics, network fusion through logistic regression, and interpretability techniques like LIME heatmaps and Jensen-Shannon divergence.

Result: ResNet50 performed best individually, but combining all three networks via fusion led to significant performance improvement, demonstrating complementary strengths of CNNs.

Conclusion: Fusion of multiple complementary CNNs enhances periocular verification performance, with the method achieving state-of-the-art results on UBIPr database.

Abstract: We study the complementarity of different CNNs for periocular verification at
different distances on the UBIPr database. We train three architectures of
increasing complexity (SqueezeNet, MobileNetv2, and ResNet50) on a large set of
eye crops from VGGFace2. We analyse performance with cosine and chi2 metrics,
compare different network initialisations, and apply score-level fusion via
logistic regression. In addition, we use LIME heatmaps and Jensen-Shannon
divergence to compare attention patterns of the CNNs. While ResNet50
consistently performs best individually, the fusion provides substantial gains,
especially when combining all three networks. Heatmaps show that networks
usually focus on distinct regions of a given image, which explains their
complementarity. Our method significantly outperforms previous works on UBIPr,
achieving a new state-of-the-art.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces CATG, a planning framework using constrained flow matching, addressing issues of mode collapse and safety constraints in autonomous driving trajectory generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance end-to-end autonomous driving by addressing the mode collapse problem in imitation learning and incorporating safety and physical constraints directly into trajectory generation.

Method: The authors propose CATG, which utilizes constrained flow matching for trajectory generation, directly embedding safety and kinematic rules. Additionally, driving aggressiveness is parameterized as a control signal for trajectory styling.

Result: CATG demonstrated effectiveness in autonomous driving planning by achieving second place in the NavSim v2 challenge with an EPDMS score of 51.31, also winning the Innovation Award.

Conclusion: The CATG framework improves trajectory generation for autonomous driving by addressing imitation learning limitations and embedding constraints directly into the model.

Abstract: Planning is a critical component of end-to-end autonomous driving. However,
prevailing imitation learning methods often suffer from mode collapse, failing
to produce diverse trajectory hypotheses. Meanwhile, existing generative
approaches struggle to incorporate crucial safety and physical constraints
directly into the generative process, necessitating an additional optimization
stage to refine their outputs. To address these limitations, we propose CATG, a
novel planning framework that leverages Constrained Flow Matching. Concretely,
CATG explicitly models the flow matching process, which inherently mitigates
mode collapse and allows for flexible guidance from various conditioning
signals. Our primary contribution is the novel imposition of explicit
constraints directly within the flow matching process, ensuring that the
generated trajectories adhere to vital safety and kinematic rules. Secondly,
CATG parameterizes driving aggressiveness as a control signal during
generation, enabling precise manipulation of trajectory style. Notably, on the
NavSim v2 challenge, CATG achieved 2nd place with an EPDMS score of 51.31 and
was honored with the Innovation Award.

TL;DR: This paper focuses on periocular biometrics by evaluating CNN architectures trained on a large-scale database, achieving performance improvements in controlled settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the potential of periocular biometrics for recognition tasks, addressing constraints of full-face imaging and leveraging large-scale training data.

Method: Three CNN architectures of varying complexity were trained on over 1.9 million ocular images from the VGGFace2 database, with experiments conducted on two diverse datasets (VGGFace2-Pose and UFPR-Periocular).

Result: EERs for uncontrolled conditions range from 9-15% (VGGFace2), while controlled acquisition (UFPR) showed superior results with EERs of 1-2%, marking the lowest so far.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates that CNNs trained on large-scale data can achieve significant improvements in periocular biometrics, especially under controlled acquisition conditions.

Abstract: We focus on ocular biometrics, specifically the periocular region (the area
around the eye), which offers high discrimination and minimal acquisition
constraints. We evaluate three Convolutional Neural Network architectures of
varying depth and complexity to assess their effectiveness for periocular
recognition. The networks are trained on 1,907,572 ocular crops extracted from
the large-scale VGGFace2 database. This significantly contrasts with existing
works, which typically rely on small-scale periocular datasets for training
having only a few thousand images. Experiments are conducted with ocular images
from VGGFace2-Pose, a subset of VGGFace2 containing in-the-wild face images,
and the UFPR-Periocular database, which consists of selfies captured via mobile
devices with user guidance on the screen. Due to the uncontrolled conditions of
VGGFace2, the Equal Error Rates (EERs) obtained with ocular crops range from
9-15%, noticeably higher than the 3-6% EERs achieved using full-face images. In
contrast, UFPR-Periocular yields significantly better performance (EERs of
1-2%), thanks to higher image quality and more consistent acquisition
protocols. To the best of our knowledge, these are the lowest reported EERs on
the UFPR dataset to date.

Motivation: The motivation is to tackle the challenges of satellite scheduling under dynamic, large-scale settings by providing a realistic benchmark suite and an innovative scheduling model.

Method: The method includes creating AEOS-Bench, a realistic benchmark suite with thousands of scenarios, and developing AEOS-Former, a Transformer-based scheduling model equipped with a constraint-aware attention mechanism.

Result: AEOS-Former achieves higher task completion rates and greater energy efficiency compared to baseline models, validated through experimental results and ablation studies.

Conclusion: This work provides a significant breakthrough in AEOS constellation scheduling by introducing AEOS-Bench for benchmarking and AEOS-Former for improved scheduling. Both tools and data are made publicly accessible.

Abstract: Agile Earth Observation Satellites (AEOSs) constellations offer unprecedented
flexibility for monitoring the Earth's surface, but their scheduling remains
challenging under large-scale scenarios, dynamic environments, and stringent
constraints. Existing methods often simplify these complexities, limiting their
real-world performance. We address this gap with a unified framework
integrating a standardized benchmark suite and a novel scheduling model. Our
benchmark suite, AEOS-Bench, contains $3,907$ finely tuned satellite assets and
$16,410$ scenarios. Each scenario features $1$ to $50$ satellites and $50$ to
$300$ imaging tasks. These scenarios are generated via a high-fidelity
simulation platform, ensuring realistic satellite behavior such as orbital
dynamics and resource constraints. Ground truth scheduling annotations are
provided for each scenario. To our knowledge, AEOS-Bench is the first
large-scale benchmark suite tailored for realistic constellation scheduling.
Building upon this benchmark, we introduce AEOS-Former, a Transformer-based
scheduling model that incorporates a constraint-aware attention mechanism. A
dedicated internal constraint module explicitly models the physical and
operational limits of each satellite. Through simulation-based iterative
learning, AEOS-Former adapts to diverse scenarios, offering a robust solution
for AEOS constellation scheduling. Experimental results demonstrate that
AEOS-Former outperforms baseline models in task completion and energy
efficiency, with ablation studies highlighting the contribution of each
component. Code and data are provided in

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a hybrid model combining convolutional neural networks (CNN) and vision Transformers (ViT) through an evidential fusion paradigm to improve diabetic retinopathy (DR) diagnosis, achieving better accuracy and interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The research aims to enhance early detection and diagnosis of diabetic retinopathy (DR), addressing limitations of using single-type backbones like CNN or ViT in current automated diagnostic systems.

Method: The approach integrates CNN and ViT by employing a novel evidential fusion paradigm. Features extracted by each backbone are transformed into supporting evidence using deep evidential networks, enabling an adaptive and effective feature fusion process.

Result: The hybrid model demonstrated improved accuracy on two publicly available diabetic retinopathy grading datasets and provided superior interpretability in feature fusion and decision-making compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: Integrating CNN and ViT through evidential fusion proves effective for advancing DR diagnosis, offering enhanced accuracy and interpretability that can support better clinical practices.

Abstract: Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is a leading cause of vision loss among middle-aged
and elderly people, which significantly impacts their daily lives and mental
health. To improve the efficiency of clinical screening and enable the early
detection of DR, a variety of automated DR diagnosis systems have been recently
established based on convolutional neural network (CNN) or vision Transformer
(ViT). However, due to the own shortages of CNN / ViT, the performance of
existing methods using single-type backbone has reached a bottleneck. One
potential way for the further improvements is integrating different kinds of
backbones, which can fully leverage the respective strengths of them
(\emph{i.e.,} the local feature extraction capability of CNN and the global
feature capturing ability of ViT). To this end, we propose a novel paradigm to
effectively fuse the features extracted by different backbones based on the
theory of evidence. Specifically, the proposed evidential fusion paradigm
transforms the features from different backbones into supporting evidences via
a set of deep evidential networks. With the supporting evidences, the
aggregated opinion can be accordingly formed, which can be used to adaptively
tune the fusion pattern between different backbones and accordingly boost the
performance of our hybrid model. We evaluated our method on two publicly

hybrid model not only improves the accuracy of DR grading, compared to the
state-of-the-art frameworks, but also provides the excellent interpretability
for feature fusion and decision-making.

### [144] [GLYPH-SR: Can We Achieve Both High-Quality Image Super-Resolution and High-Fidelity Text Recovery via VLM-guided Latent Diffusion Model?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26339)
*Mingyu Sung,Seungjae Ham,Kangwoo Kim,Yeokyoung Yoon,Sangseok Yun,Il-Min Kim,Jae-Mo Kang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces GLYPH-SR, a diffusion-based framework for image super-resolution (SR), aimed at enhancing text legibility and perceptual realism.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address shortcomings in prior SR approaches that largely ignore text legibility, which is crucial for accurate OCR and decision-making processes, particularly for scene-text embedded in complex natural images.

Method: GLYPH-SR uses a Text-SR Fusion ControlNet (TS-ControlNet) guided by OCR data, along with a ping-pong scheduler, alternating between text- and scene-centric guidance. Training is focused on a synthetic corpus while keeping the main SR branch frozen.

Result: GLYPH-SR significantly boosts text reading performance (OCR F1 score) by up to +15.18 percentage points in challenging datasets, while maintaining competitive perceptual metrics like MANIQA, CLIP-IQA, and MUSIQ.

Conclusion: GLYPH-SR successfully balances high text readability and visual realism, addressing the dual challenges faced by existing super-resolution methods in practical scenarios.

Abstract: Image super-resolution(SR) is fundamental to many vision system-from
surveillance and autonomy to document analysis and retail analytics-because
recovering high-frequency details, especially scene-text, enables reliable
downstream perception. Scene-text, i.e., text embedded in natural images such
as signs, product labels, and storefronts, often carries the most actionable
information; when characters are blurred or hallucinated, optical character
recognition(OCR) and subsequent decisions fail even if the rest of the image
appears sharp. Yet previous SR research has often been tuned to distortion
(PSNR/SSIM) or learned perceptual metrics (LIPIS, MANIQA, CLIP-IQA, MUSIQ) that
are largely insensitive to character-level errors. Furthermore, studies that do
address text SR often focus on simplified benchmarks with isolated characters,
overlooking the challenges of text within complex natural scenes. As a result,
scene-text is effectively treated as generic texture. For SR to be effective in
practical deployments, it is therefore essential to explicitly optimize for
both text legibility and perceptual quality. We present GLYPH-SR, a
vision-language-guided diffusion framework that aims to achieve both objectives
jointly. GLYPH-SR utilizes a Text-SR Fusion ControlNet(TS-ControlNet) guided by
OCR data, and a ping-pong scheduler that alternates between text- and
scene-centric guidance. To enable targeted text restoration, we train these
components on a synthetic corpus while keeping the main SR branch frozen.
Across SVT, SCUT-CTW1500, and CUTE80 at x4, and x8, GLYPH-SR improves OCR F1 by
up to +15.18 percentage points over diffusion/GAN baseline (SVT x8, OpenOCR)
while maintaining competitive MANIQA, CLIP-IQA, and MUSIQ. GLYPH-SR is designed
to satisfy both objectives simultaneously-high readability and high visual
realism-delivering SR that looks right and reds right.

*Christoffer Koo Øhrstrøm,Ronja Güldenring,Lazaros Nalpantidis*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Spiking Patches, a tokenizer designed for event cameras, efficiently representing asynchronous and sparse events while achieving high accuracy and faster inference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to create an event representation for event cameras that preserves their asynchronous and sparse nature while maintaining or improving accuracy.

Method: The Spiking Patches tokenizer converts event camera data into tokens designed to retain spatial sparsity and asynchronous qualities. It is evaluated on gesture recognition and object detection tasks using models like GNN, PCN, and Transformers.

Result: The proposed tokenizer provides up to 10.4x faster inference than frame-based representations and up to 3.4x faster than voxel-based tokens, achieving equal or better accuracy with absolute improvements of up to 3.8 for gesture recognition and up to 1.4 for object detection.

Conclusion: Spiking Patches offer a groundbreaking approach to event-based vision, preserving the unique properties of event cameras while improving efficiency and performance without compromising accuracy.

Abstract: We propose tokenization of events and present a tokenizer, Spiking Patches,
specifically designed for event cameras. Given a stream of asynchronous and
spatially sparse events, our goal is to discover an event representation that
preserves these properties. Prior works have represented events as frames or as
voxels. However, while these representations yield high accuracy, both frames
and voxels are synchronous and decrease the spatial sparsity. Spiking Patches
gives the means to preserve the unique properties of event cameras and we show
in our experiments that this comes without sacrificing accuracy. We evaluate
our tokenizer using a GNN, PCN, and a Transformer on gesture recognition and
object detection. Tokens from Spiking Patches yield inference times that are up
to 3.4x faster than voxel-based tokens and up to 10.4x faster than frames. We
achieve this while matching their accuracy and even surpassing in some cases
with absolute improvements up to 3.8 for gesture recognition and up to 1.4 for
object detection. Thus, tokenization constitutes a novel direction in
event-based vision and marks a step towards methods that preserve the
properties of event cameras.

*Igor Abramov,Ilya Makarov*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes a novel EEG-driven image generation framework that incorporates spatial attention using saliency maps to enhance reconstruction fidelity and coherence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for EEG-driven image generation struggle to achieve high fidelity and semantic coherence, partly due to the lack of integration of spatial attention mechanisms.

Method: The paper introduces a dual-conditioning framework by combining EEG embeddings and spatial saliency maps. It uses ATM for EEG feature extraction, fine-tunes Stable Diffusion 2.1 with LoRA for neural-visual alignment, and incorporates a ControlNet branch for spatial control via saliency maps.

Result: When evaluated on THINGS-EEG, the method showed significant improvement in the quality of generated image features and better alignment with human visual attention compared to existing approaches.

Conclusion: The study highlights that integrating attentional priors resolves EEG ambiguities, enabling high-quality image reconstruction, with potential applications in fields like medical diagnostics and neuroadaptive interfaces.

Abstract: Existing EEG-driven image reconstruction methods often overlook spatial
attention mechanisms, limiting fidelity and semantic coherence. To address
this, we propose a dual-conditioning framework that combines EEG embeddings
with spatial saliency maps to enhance image generation. Our approach leverages
the Adaptive Thinking Mapper (ATM) for EEG feature extraction and fine-tunes
Stable Diffusion 2.1 via Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) to align neural signals
with visual semantics, while a ControlNet branch conditions generation on
saliency maps for spatial control. Evaluated on THINGS-EEG, our method achieves
a significant improvement in the quality of low- and high-level image features
over existing approaches. Simultaneously, strongly aligning with human visual
attention. The results demonstrate that attentional priors resolve EEG
ambiguities, enabling high-fidelity reconstructions with applications in
medical diagnostics and neuroadaptive interfaces, advancing neural decoding
through efficient adaptation of pre-trained diffusion models.

*Xiangqing Zheng,Chengyue Wu,Kehai Chen,Min Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces LoCoT2V-Bench, a benchmark to evaluate long-form video generation from complex text prompts, addressing limitations in existing benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the limitations of current long video generation benchmarks that use simplified prompts and low-level metrics, failing to assess fine-grained alignment and abstract aspects like narrative coherence.

Method: The benchmark uses complex, real-world prompts with elements like scene transitions and event dynamics, and introduces new metrics such as event-level alignment, temporal consistency, and Human Expectation Realization Degree (HERD).

Result: The benchmark evaluates nine LVG models and finds that current methods perform well on basic visual and temporal aspects but struggle with more advanced aspects like inter-event consistency and narrative coherence.

Conclusion: LoCoT2V-Bench provides a robust platform for evaluating the emerging field of long-form text-to-video generation, identifying areas for improvement in the models.

Abstract: Recently text-to-video generation has made impressive progress in producing
short, high-quality clips, but evaluating long-form outputs remains a major
challenge especially when processing complex prompts. Existing benchmarks
mostly rely on simplified prompts and focus on low-level metrics, overlooking
fine-grained alignment with prompts and abstract dimensions such as narrative
coherence and thematic expression. To address these gaps, we propose
LoCoT2V-Bench, a benchmark specifically designed for long video generation
(LVG) under complex input conditions. Based on various real-world videos,
LoCoT2V-Bench introduces a suite of realistic and complex prompts incorporating
elements like scene transitions and event dynamics. Moreover, it constructs a
multi-dimensional evaluation framework that includes our newly proposed metrics
such as event-level alignment, fine-grained temporal consistency, content
clarity, and the Human Expectation Realization Degree (HERD) that focuses on
more abstract attributes like narrative flow, emotional response, and character
development. Using this framework, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation of
nine representative LVG models, finding that while current methods perform well
on basic visual and temporal aspects, they struggle with inter-event
consistency, fine-grained alignment, and high-level thematic adherence, etc.
Overall, LoCoT2V-Bench provides a comprehensive and reliable platform for
evaluating long-form complex text-to-video generation and highlights critical
directions for future method improvement.

### [148] [A-TPT: Angular Diversity Calibration Properties for Test-Time Prompt Tuning of Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26441)
*Shihab Aaqil Ahamed,Udaya S. K. P. Miriya Thanthrige,Ranga Rodrigo,Muhammad Haris Khan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces A-TPT, a new test-time prompt tuning method, aimed at enhancing the calibration of large vision-language models by promoting angular diversity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing test-time prompt tuning methods lack sufficient dispersion between textual features, impacting calibration performance and the reliability of vision-language models.

Method: A-TPT encourages uniformity in normalized textual feature distribution by maximizing minimum angular pairwise distances on the unit hypersphere.

Result: Extensive experiments show A-TPT consistently reduces calibration errors and offers superior zero-shot calibration, particularly under natural distribution shifts and on medical datasets.

Conclusion: Promoting angular diversity in textual features can significantly improve adaptive calibration performance in vision-language models, making them more reliable and effective.

Abstract: Test-time prompt tuning (TPT) has emerged as a promising technique for
adapting large vision-language models (VLMs) to unseen tasks without relying on
labeled data. However, the lack of dispersion between textual features can hurt
calibration performance, which raises concerns about VLMs' reliability,
trustworthiness, and safety. Current TPT approaches primarily focus on
improving prompt calibration by either maximizing average textual feature
dispersion or enforcing orthogonality constraints to encourage angular
separation. However, these methods may not always have optimal angular
separation between class-wise textual features, which implies overlooking the
critical role of angular diversity. To address this, we propose A-TPT, a novel
TPT framework that introduces angular diversity to encourage uniformity in the
distribution of normalized textual features induced by corresponding learnable
prompts. This uniformity is achieved by maximizing the minimum pairwise angular
distance between features on the unit hypersphere. We show that our approach
consistently surpasses state-of-the-art TPT methods in reducing the aggregate
average calibration error while maintaining comparable accuracy through
extensive experiments with various backbones on different datasets. Notably,
our approach exhibits superior zero-shot calibration performance on natural
distribution shifts and generalizes well to medical datasets. We provide
extensive analyses, including theoretical aspects, to establish the grounding
of A-TPT. These results highlight the potency of promoting angular diversity to
achieve well-dispersed textual features, significantly improving VLM
calibration during test-time adaptation. Our code will be made publicly
available.

*Rhodri Guerrier,Adam W. Harley,Dima Damen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper explores adapting DUSt3R and MASt3R models for point tracking using 3D correspondence, achieving competitive and superior results compared to state-of-the-art benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improve the accuracy and robustness of point tracking in static and dynamic scenarios by leveraging advanced 3D reconstruction models.

Method: Fine-tune MASt3R and combine reconstruction loss with dynamic correspondence training using a visibility head, tested on synthetic data without temporal context.

Result: The adapted methods deliver superior or competitive performance on multiple datasets, significantly outperforming competitors such as CoTracker2 and CoTracker3.

Conclusion: The approach effectively enhances point tracking precision through integration of 3D grounded correspondence and mixed static-dynamic training.

Abstract: Recent advances in foundational 3D reconstruction models, such as DUSt3R and
MASt3R, have shown great potential in 2D and 3D correspondence in static
scenes. In this paper, we propose to adapt them for the task of point tracking
through 3D grounded correspondence. We first demonstrate that these models are
competitive point trackers when focusing on static points, present in current
point tracking benchmarks ($+33.5\%$ on EgoPoints vs. CoTracker2). We propose
to combine the reconstruction loss with training for dynamic correspondence
along with a visibility head, and fine-tuning MASt3R for point tracking using a
relatively small amount of synthetic data. Importantly, we only train and
evaluate on pairs of frames where one contains the query point, effectively
removing any temporal context. Using a mix of dynamic and static point
correspondences, we achieve competitive or superior point tracking results on
four datasets (e.g. competitive on TAP-Vid-DAVIS 73.8 $\delta_{avg}$ / 85.8\%
occlusion acc. for PointSt3R compared to 75.7 / 88.3\% for CoTracker2; and
significantly outperform CoTracker3 on EgoPoints 61.3 vs 54.2 and RGB-S 87.0 vs
82.8). We also present results on 3D point tracking along with several
ablations on training datasets and percentage of dynamic correspondences.

### [150] [Towards Fine-Grained Vision-Language Alignment for Few-Shot Anomaly Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26464)
*Yuanting Fan,Jun Liu,Xiaochen Chen,Bin-Bin Gao,Jian Li,Yong Liu,Jinlong Peng,Chengjie Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces FineGrainedAD, which provides fine-grained semantic captions and alignment mechanisms to improve few-shot anomaly detection performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing FSAD methods struggle with semantic misalignment due to limited textual descriptions, affecting anomaly localization performance.

Method: The authors propose Multi-Level Fine-Grained Semantic Caption (MFSC) to generate fine-grained textual descriptions, and leverage Multi-Level Learnable Prompt (MLLP) and Multi-Level Semantic Alignment (MLSA) to align textual and visual information.

Result: FineGrainedAD improves few-shot performance and anomaly localization on MVTec-AD and VisA datasets.

Conclusion: FineGrainedAD addresses semantic misalignment through advanced textual descriptions and alignment strategies, achieving superior performance in FSAD.

Abstract: Few-shot anomaly detection (FSAD) methods identify anomalous regions with few
known normal samples. Most existing methods rely on the generalization ability
of pre-trained vision-language models (VLMs) to recognize potentially anomalous
regions through feature similarity between text descriptions and images.
However, due to the lack of detailed textual descriptions, these methods can
only pre-define image-level descriptions to match each visual patch token to
identify potential anomalous regions, which leads to the semantic misalignment
between image descriptions and patch-level visual anomalies, achieving
sub-optimal localization performance. To address the above issues, we propose
the Multi-Level Fine-Grained Semantic Caption (MFSC) to provide multi-level and
fine-grained textual descriptions for existing anomaly detection datasets with
automatic construction pipeline. Based on the MFSC, we propose a novel
framework named FineGrainedAD to improve anomaly localization performance,
which consists of two components: Multi-Level Learnable Prompt (MLLP) and
Multi-Level Semantic Alignment (MLSA). MLLP introduces fine-grained semantics
into multi-level learnable prompts through automatic replacement and
concatenation mechanism, while MLSA designs region aggregation strategy and
multi-level alignment training to facilitate learnable prompts better align
with corresponding visual regions. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed
FineGrainedAD achieves superior overall performance in few-shot settings on
MVTec-AD and VisA datasets.

*Pei Peng,MingKun Xie,Hang Hao,Tong Jin,ShengJun Huang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper addresses object-context biases in vision-language models using a causal inference framework and improves zero-shot performance without retraining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome inherent biases in vision-language models that arise due to object-context shortcuts, affecting their performance in zero-shot scenarios.

Method: The authors use causal inference by recombining object features with diverse alternative contexts to create counterfactual embeddings and estimate effects in the representation space.

Result: The approach significantly improves worst-group and average accuracy for context-sensitive zero-shot benchmarks, setting a new state of the art.

Conclusion: The proposed lightweight counterfactual framework enhances reliable multimodal reasoning while addressing biases without requiring retraining or additional prompt designs.

Abstract: Object-context shortcuts remain a persistent challenge in vision-language
models, undermining zero-shot reliability when test-time scenes differ from
familiar training co-occurrences. We recast this issue as a causal inference
problem and ask: Would the prediction remain if the object appeared in a
different environment? To answer this at inference time, we estimate object and
background expectations within CLIP's representation space, and synthesize
counterfactual embeddings by recombining object features with diverse
alternative contexts sampled from external datasets, batch neighbors, or
text-derived descriptions. By estimating the Total Direct Effect and simulating
intervention, we further subtract background-only activation, preserving
beneficial object-context interactions while mitigating hallucinated scores.
Without retraining or prompt design, our method substantially improves both
worst-group and average accuracy on context-sensitive benchmarks, establishing
a new zero-shot state of the art. Beyond performance, our framework provides a
lightweight representation-level counterfactual approach, offering a practical
causal avenue for debiased and reliable multimodal reasoning.

### [152] [Counteracting Matthew Effect in Self-Improvement of LVLMs through Head-Tail Re-balancing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26474)
*Xin Guo,Zhiheng Xi,Yiwen Ding,Yitao Zhai,Xiaowei Shi,Xunliang Cai,Tao Gui,Qi Zhang,Xuanjing Huang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper discusses self-improvement in large vision-language models for reasoning tasks, targeting imbalance issues between simple and complex queries.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the imbalance in reasoning capabilities for simple (head) and complex (tail) queries, which hinders the model's improvement.

Method: The authors propose four strategies focusing on distribution reshaping and trajectory resampling to balance reasoning across head-tail queries.

Result: The methods improved visual reasoning tasks in Qwen2-VL-7B-Instruct and InternVL2.5-4B models with performance gains averaging 3.86 points.

Conclusion: Head-tail balancing strategies mitigate reasoning imbalance issues and enhance systematic self-improvement performances in LVLMs.

Abstract: Self-improvement has emerged as a mainstream paradigm for advancing the
reasoning capabilities of large vision-language models (LVLMs), where models
explore and learn from successful trajectories iteratively. However, we
identify a critical issue during this process: the model excels at generating
high-quality trajectories for simple queries (i.e., head data) but struggles
with more complex ones (i.e., tail data). This leads to an imbalanced
optimization that drives the model to prioritize simple reasoning skills, while
hindering its ability to tackle more complex reasoning tasks. Over iterations,
this imbalance becomes increasingly pronounced--a dynamic we term the "Matthew
effect"--which ultimately hinders further model improvement and leads to
performance bottlenecks. To counteract this challenge, we introduce four
efficient strategies from two perspectives: distribution-reshaping and
trajectory-resampling, to achieve head-tail re-balancing during the
exploration-and-learning self-improvement process. Extensive experiments on
Qwen2-VL-7B-Instruct and InternVL2.5-4B models across visual reasoning tasks
demonstrate that our methods consistently improve visual reasoning
capabilities, outperforming vanilla self-improvement by 3.86 points on average.

TL;DR: The study introduces an adaptable edge detector optimized by meta-heuristics and transfer learning techniques, proving its adaptability but finding limitations in the effectiveness of expanded optimization search space and transfer learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the difficulties in edge detection, particularly detecting loose edges and context-based information extraction, by proposing adaptability to an image's properties.

Method: The method involves creating an adaptable edge detector based on two-dimensional cellular automaton, optimizing it through meta-heuristics, and incorporating transfer learning techniques.

Result: Expanded optimization search space was ineffective for the given image sets, and transfer learning techniques did not yield significant improvements. However, the model exhibited robust adaptability across diverse validations.

Conclusion: The edge detector shows strong adaptability but limited benefit from expanded search space or transfer learning, indicating areas for refinement in optimization techniques.

Abstract: The edge detection task is essential in image processing aiming to extract
relevant information from an image. One recurring problem in this task is the
weaknesses found in some detectors, such as the difficulty in detecting loose
edges and the lack of context to extract relevant information from specific
problems. To address these weaknesses and adapt the detector to the properties
of an image, an adaptable detector described by two-dimensional cellular
automaton and optimized by meta-heuristic combined with transfer learning
techniques was developed. This study aims to analyze the impact of expanding
the search space of the optimization phase and the robustness of the
adaptability of the detector in identifying edges of a set of natural images
and specialized subsets extracted from the same image set. The results obtained
prove that expanding the search space of the optimization phase was not
effective for the chosen image set. The study also analyzed the adaptability of
the model through a series of experiments and validation techniques and found
that, regardless of the validation, the model was able to adapt to the input
and the transfer learning techniques applied to the model showed no significant
improvements.

Motivation: Civil engineering applications often lack sufficient annotated data, creating challenges for accurate object detection.

Method: The proposed DINO-YOLO integrates DINOv3 self-supervised vision transformer features at preprocessing and backbone enhancement stages within the YOLO architecture. Various scales and integration strategies were systematically tested.

Result: The model exhibits significant performance improvements across different datasets (12.4%-88.6%) with manageable inference overhead for deployment in real-time scenarios.

Conclusion: DINO-YOLO achieves state-of-the-art performance for small civil engineering datasets (<10K images) and balances accuracy with computational speed, aiding construction safety monitoring and infrastructure inspections.

Abstract: Object detection in civil engineering applications is constrained by limited
annotated data in specialized domains. We introduce DINO-YOLO, a hybrid
architecture combining YOLOv12 with DINOv3 self-supervised vision transformers
for data-efficient detection. DINOv3 features are strategically integrated at
two locations: input preprocessing (P0) and mid-backbone enhancement (P3).
Experimental validation demonstrates substantial improvements: Tunnel Segment
Crack detection (648 images) achieves 12.4% improvement, Construction PPE (1K
images) gains 13.7%, and KITTI (7K images) shows 88.6% improvement, while
maintaining real-time inference (30-47 FPS). Systematic ablation across five
YOLO scales and nine DINOv3 variants reveals that Medium-scale architectures
achieve optimal performance with DualP0P3 integration (55.77% mAP@0.5), while
Small-scale requires Triple Integration (53.63%). The 2-4x inference overhead
(21-33ms versus 8-16ms baseline) remains acceptable for field deployment on
NVIDIA RTX 5090. DINO-YOLO establishes state-of-the-art performance for civil
engineering datasets (<10K images) while preserving computational efficiency,
providing practical solutions for construction safety monitoring and
infrastructure inspection in data-constrained environments.

TL;DR: The paper introduces SA$^{2}$Net, a novel spine segmentation method for scoliosis diagnosis using ultrasound images. It addresses challenges in learning spatial bone correlations and encoding structural knowledge.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Spine segmentation is essential for scoliosis diagnosis but faces challenges, such as learning global contextual knowledge and encoding structural shape and position information of spine bones.

Method: The paper presents a scale-adaptive complementary strategy to capture long-distance features and proposes structure-affinity transformation for class-specific semantic reasoning combined with a Transformer decoder.

Result: Experimental findings indicate SA$^{2}$Net outperforms state-of-the-art methods in spine segmentation, enhancing robustness and accuracy.

Conclusion: SA$^{2}$Net is a promising tool for intelligent spine image analysis and scoliosis diagnosis, with demonstrated adaptability to various neural network backbones.

Abstract: Spine segmentation, based on ultrasound volume projection imaging (VPI),
plays a vital role for intelligent scoliosis diagnosis in clinical
applications. However, this task faces several significant challenges. Firstly,
the global contextual knowledge of spines may not be well-learned if we neglect
the high spatial correlation of different bone features. Secondly, the spine
bones contain rich structural knowledge regarding their shapes and positions,
which deserves to be encoded into the segmentation process. To address these
challenges, we propose a novel scale-adaptive structure-aware network
(SA$^{2}$Net) for effective spine segmentation. First, we propose a
scale-adaptive complementary strategy to learn the cross-dimensional
long-distance correlation features for spinal images. Second, motivated by the
consistency between multi-head self-attention in Transformers and semantic
level affinity, we propose structure-affinity transformation to transform
semantic features with class-specific affinity and combine it with a
Transformer decoder for structure-aware reasoning. In addition, we adopt a
feature mixing loss aggregation method to enhance model training. This method
improves the robustness and accuracy of the segmentation process. The
experimental results demonstrate that our SA$^{2}$Net achieves superior
segmentation performance compared to other state-of-the-art methods. Moreover,
the adaptability of SA$^{2}$Net to various backbones enhances its potential as
a promising tool for advanced scoliosis diagnosis using intelligent spinal
image analysis. The code and experimental demo are available at

TL;DR: This paper introduces an automated framework for creating shorter video ads using audio-visual fusion model tailored for advertisements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The traditional manual process of creating multiple versions of a single advertisement is labor-intensive and time-consuming.

Method: The authors developed a two-stream audio-visual fusion model that predicts frame importance to automate video ad clipping.

Result: The proposed model outperformed state-of-the-art methods on metrics such as Average Precision, AUC, Spearman, and Kendall.

Conclusion: Automated video summarization for ad clipping is effective, enabled by the proposed model and a novel dataset, AdSum204.

Abstract: Advertisers commonly need multiple versions of the same advertisement (ad) at
varying durations for a single campaign. The traditional approach involves
manually selecting and re-editing shots from longer video ads to create shorter
versions, which is labor-intensive and time-consuming. In this paper, we
introduce a framework for automated video ad clipping using video summarization
techniques. We are the first to frame video clipping as a shot selection
problem, tailored specifically for advertising. Unlike existing general video
summarization methods that primarily focus on visual content, our approach
emphasizes the critical role of audio in advertising. To achieve this, we
develop a two-stream audio-visual fusion model that predicts the importance of
video frames, where importance is defined as the likelihood of a frame being
selected in the firm-produced short ad. To address the lack of ad-specific
datasets, we present AdSum204, a novel dataset comprising 102 pairs of
30-second and 15-second ads from real advertising campaigns. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our model outperforms state-of-the-art methods
across various metrics, including Average Precision, Area Under Curve,
Spearman, and Kendall.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a framework that enables AI systems to understand and adapt to unseen environments without requiring labeled data, improving vision-based applications in dynamic real-world scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI systems struggle to generalize across unseen environments due to the lack of labeled data, limiting their use in complex, dynamic settings.

Method: The paper introduces a framework that uses pre-trained vision transformers, large language models, and a dynamic reasoning module to integrate visual semantics with language descriptions.

Result: Experimental results show up to an 18% improvement in scene understanding accuracy compared to baseline models and robust performance in challenging environments.

Conclusion: The framework advances zero-shot generalization by enabling scalable, interpretable context-aware reasoning in real-world scenarios.

Abstract: In real-world environments, AI systems often face unfamiliar scenarios
without labeled data, creating a major challenge for conventional scene
understanding models. The inability to generalize across unseen contexts limits
the deployment of vision-based applications in dynamic, unstructured settings.
This work introduces a Dynamic Context-Aware Scene Reasoning framework that
leverages Vision-Language Alignment to address zero-shot real-world scenarios.
The goal is to enable intelligent systems to infer and adapt to new
environments without prior task-specific training. The proposed approach
integrates pre-trained vision transformers and large language models to align
visual semantics with natural language descriptions, enhancing contextual
comprehension. A dynamic reasoning module refines predictions by combining
global scene cues and object-level interactions guided by linguistic priors.
Extensive experiments on zero-shot benchmarks such as COCO, Visual Genome, and
Open Images demonstrate up to 18% improvement in scene understanding accuracy
over baseline models in complex and unseen environments. Results also show
robust performance in ambiguous or cluttered scenes due to the synergistic

*Xinjin Li,Yulie Lu,Jinghan Cao,Yu Ma,Zhenglin Li,Yeyang Zhou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces CATCH, a framework for improving visual question answering (VQA) models' generalization across multiple domains by decoupling visual and linguistic adaptation without retraining the backbone model.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the poor generalization of current VQA models when transferred to out-of-domain scenarios like remote sensing, medical imaging, or math diagrams.

Method: Proposed CATCH, a plug-and-play framework with lightweight modules: a domain classifier to identify input image types, and dual adapters (Prompt Adapter and Visual Adapter) injected via a unified hook interface.

Result: CATCH improves VQA model performance across four benchmarks with gains such as +2.3 BLEU on MathVQA, +2.6 VQA on MedVQA-RAD, and +3.1 ROUGE on ChartQA, without requiring retraining.

Conclusion: CATCH is a scalable and extensible solution for cross-domain VQA, enhancing generalization and enabling practical deployment across varied application domains.

Abstract: Recent advances in Visual Question Answering (VQA) have demonstrated
impressive performance in natural image domains, with models like LLaVA
leveraging large language models (LLMs) for open-ended reasoning. However,
their generalization degrades significantly when transferred to out-of-domain
scenarios such as remote sensing, medical imaging, or math diagrams, due to
large distributional shifts and the lack of effective domain adaptation
mechanisms. Existing approaches typically rely on per-domain fine-tuning or
bespoke pipelines, which are costly, inflexible, and not scalable across
diverse tasks. In this paper, we propose CATCH, a plug-and-play framework for
cross-domain adaptation that improves the generalization of VQA models while
requiring minimal changes to their core architecture. Our key idea is to
decouple visual and linguistic adaptation by introducing two lightweight
modules: a domain classifier to identify the input image type, and a dual
adapter mechanism comprising a Prompt Adapter for language modulation and a
Visual Adapter for vision feature adjustment. Both modules are dynamically
injected via a unified hook interface, requiring no retraining of the backbone
model. Experimental results across four domain-specific VQA benchmarks
demonstrate that our framework achieves consistent performance gains without
retraining the backbone model, including +2.3 BLEU on MathVQA, +2.6 VQA on
MedVQA-RAD, and +3.1 ROUGE on ChartQA. These results highlight that CATCH
provides a scalable and extensible approach to multi-domain VQA, enabling
practical deployment across diverse application domains.

TL;DR: Emu3.5, a multimodal world model, predicts states across vision and language using a unified token prediction approach, excels in multimodal reasoning, generation, and world modeling tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Develop a model capable of native vision-language integration for seamless and efficient multimodal reasoning and generation.

Method: Pre-training on interleaved vision-language data followed by reinforcement learning; proposes Discrete Diffusion Adaptation for faster inference.

Result: Emu3.5 achieves strong performance in multimodal generation tasks, and surpasses competitors on interleaved generation benchmarks. It supports open-world manipulation and exploration.

Conclusion: Emu3.5 advances multimodal AI with natural vision-language capabilities, efficient inference, and generalizable world-modeling. It is open-sourced for community research.

Abstract: We introduce Emu3.5, a large-scale multimodal world model that natively
predicts the next state across vision and language. Emu3.5 is pre-trained
end-to-end with a unified next-token prediction objective on a corpus of
vision-language interleaved data containing over 10 trillion tokens, primarily
derived from sequential frames and transcripts of internet videos. The model
naturally accepts interleaved vision-language inputs and generates interleaved
vision-language outputs. Emu3.5 is further post-trained with large-scale
reinforcement learning to enhance multimodal reasoning and generation. To
improve inference efficiency, we propose Discrete Diffusion Adaptation (DiDA),
which converts token-by-token decoding into bidirectional parallel prediction,
accelerating per-image inference by about 20x without sacrificing performance.
Emu3.5 exhibits strong native multimodal capabilities, including long-horizon
vision-language generation, any-to-image (X2I) generation, and complex
text-rich image generation. It also exhibits generalizable world-modeling
abilities, enabling spatiotemporally consistent world exploration and
open-world embodied manipulation across diverse scenarios and tasks. For
comparison, Emu3.5 achieves performance comparable to Gemini 2.5 Flash Image
(Nano Banana) on image generation and editing tasks and demonstrates superior
results on a suite of interleaved generation tasks. We open-source Emu3.5 at
https://github.com/baaivision/Emu3.5 to support community research.

*Anirban Ray,Vera Galinova,Florian Jug*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces ResMatching, a novel computational super-resolution (CSR) method using guided conditional flow matching to achieve improved results in fluorescence microscopy via learned data-priors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the limitations of data fidelity and perceptual realism in computational super-resolution by leveraging advanced machine learning techniques.

Method: The method, ResMatching, employs guided conditional flow matching to learn better data-priors for extrapolating frequencies not captured by microscopy.

Result: ResMatching outperformed 7 baseline models in a variety of tests using the BioSR dataset, achieving the best balance between fidelity and realism, particularly excelling with noisy low-resolution images.

Conclusion: ResMatching provides an effective CSR solution, enables sampling from a learned posterior distribution, and delivers calibrated pixel-wise data uncertainty, offering better guidance in analyzing fluorescence microscopy images.

Abstract: Computational Super-Resolution (CSR) in fluorescence microscopy has, despite
being an ill-posed problem, a long history. At its very core, CSR is about
finding a prior that can be used to extrapolate frequencies in a micrograph
that have never been imaged by the image-generating microscope. It stands to
reason that, with the advent of better data-driven machine learning techniques,
stronger prior can be learned and hence CSR can lead to better results. Here,
we present ResMatching, a novel CSR method that uses guided conditional flow
matching to learn such improved data-priors. We evaluate ResMatching on 4
diverse biological structures from the BioSR dataset and compare its results
against 7 baselines. ResMatching consistently achieves competitive results,
demonstrating in all cases the best trade-off between data fidelity and
perceptual realism. We observe that CSR using ResMatching is particularly
effective in cases where a strong prior is hard to learn, e.g. when the given
low-resolution images contain a lot of noise. Additionally, we show that
ResMatching can be used to sample from an implicitly learned posterior
distribution and that this distribution is calibrated for all tested use-cases,
enabling our method to deliver a pixel-wise data-uncertainty term that can
guide future users to reject uncertain predictions.

Result: CYPRESS outperformed existing deep learning-based yield prediction models, offering detailed yield mapping capabilities validated on Canadian Prairies data.

Conclusion: CYPRESS bridges large-scale Earth observation with practical on-farm applications, providing a scalable solution for precision agriculture.

Abstract: Accurate and timely crop yield prediction is crucial for global food security
and modern agricultural management. Traditional methods often lack the
scalability and granularity required for precision farming. This paper
introduces CYPRESS (Crop Yield Prediction via Regression on Prithvi's Encoder
for Satellite Sensing), a deep learning model designed for high-resolution,
intra-field canola yield prediction. CYPRESS leverages a pre-trained,
large-scale geospatial foundation model (Prithvi-EO-2.0-600M) and adapts it for
a continuous regression task, transforming multi-temporal satellite imagery
into dense, pixel-level yield maps. Evaluated on a comprehensive dataset from
the Canadian Prairies, CYPRESS demonstrates superior performance over existing
deep learning-based yield prediction models, highlighting the effectiveness of
fine-tuning foundation models for specialized agricultural applications. By
providing a continuous, high-resolution output, CYPRESS offers a more
actionable tool for precision agriculture than conventional classification or
county-level aggregation methods. This work validates a novel approach that
bridges the gap between large-scale Earth observation and on-farm
decision-making, offering a scalable solution for detailed agricultural
monitoring.

Result: The survey provides a structured analysis of AV sensors, datasets, methodologies, highlighting integration of VLMs/LLMs and their potential in dynamic environments.

Conclusion: A clear roadmap is delivered outlining current capabilities, challenges, and opportunities in object detection for Autonomous Vehicles, driven by innovative AI advancements.

Abstract: Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) are transforming the future of transportation
through advances in intelligent perception, decision-making, and control
systems. However, their success is tied to one core capability, reliable object
detection in complex and multimodal environments. While recent breakthroughs in
Computer Vision (CV) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) have driven remarkable

intelligence. This survey bridges that gap by delivering a forward-looking
analysis of object detection in AVs, emphasizing emerging paradigms such as

rather than re-examining outdated techniques. We begin by systematically
reviewing the fundamental spectrum of AV sensors (camera, ultrasonic, LiDAR,
and Radar) and their fusion strategies, highlighting not only their
capabilities and limitations in dynamic driving environments but also their
potential to integrate with recent advances in LLM/VLM-driven perception
frameworks. Next, we introduce a structured categorization of AV datasets that
moves beyond simple collections, positioning ego-vehicle, infrastructure-based,
and cooperative datasets (e.g., V2V, V2I, V2X, I2I), followed by a
cross-analysis of data structures and characteristics. Ultimately, we analyze
cutting-edge detection methodologies, ranging from 2D and 3D pipelines to
hybrid sensor fusion, with particular attention to emerging transformer-driven
approaches powered by Vision Transformers (ViTs), Large and Small Language
Models (SLMs), and VLMs. By synthesizing these perspectives, our survey

*Daniela Martin,Joseph Gallego*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper explores the application of deep learning optical flow techniques to estimate sea ice drift from satellite SAR imagery, achieving significant accuracy improvements over classical methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Sea ice drift estimation is vital for Arctic navigation, climate research, and forecasting, but existing methods are limited in complex scenarios.

Method: Deep learning-based optical flow techniques were benchmarked on RADARSAT 2 SAR imagery, and evaluated against GNSS buoy data using accuracy metrics like endpoint error (EPE).

Result: Several models achieved sub-kilometer accuracy (300-400m), outperforming classical methods and capturing consistent regional drift patterns.

Conclusion: Deep learning optical flow methods are highly effective for polar remote sensing and provide spatially continuous motion estimates, benefiting navigation and climate modeling.

Abstract: Accurate estimation of sea ice drift is critical for Arctic navigation,
climate research, and operational forecasting. While optical flow, a computer
vision technique for estimating pixel wise motion between consecutive images,
has advanced rapidly in computer vision, its applicability to geophysical
problems and to satellite SAR imagery remains underexplored. Classical optical
flow methods rely on mathematical models and strong assumptions about motion,
which limit their accuracy in complex scenarios. Recent deep learning based
approaches have substantially improved performance and are now the standard in
computer vision, motivating their application to sea ice drift estimation. We
present the first large scale benchmark of 48 deep learning optical flow models
on RADARSAT 2 ScanSAR sea ice imagery, evaluated with endpoint error (EPE) and
Fl all metrics against GNSS tracked buoys. Several models achieve sub kilometer
accuracy (EPE 6 to 8 pixels, 300 to 400 m), a small error relative to the
spatial scales of sea ice motion and typical navigation requirements in the
Arctic. Our results demonstrate that the models are capable of capturing
consistent regional drift patterns and that recent deep learning based optical
flow methods, which have substantially improved motion estimation accuracy
compared to classical methods, can be effectively transferred to polar remote
sensing. Optical flow produces spatially continuous drift fields, providing
motion estimates for every image pixel rather than at sparse buoy locations,
offering new opportunities for navigation and climate modeling.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing challenges posed by occlusions in object recognition and leveraging scene context to enhance algorithm robustness.

Method: Two approaches: 1) selecting object networks based on identified background scenes pre-prediction, 2) integrating scene knowledge into object scores post-detection.

Result: Demonstrated improvement in recall and precision on occluded datasets; training on mixed occluded/unoccluded images further enhances performance.

Conclusion: The proposed methods improve object recognition accuracy under occlusion. Approaches are interpretable, adaptable, and offer avenues for future research and applications.

Abstract: The presence of occlusions has provided substantial challenges to
typically-powerful object recognition algorithms. Additional sources of
information can be extremely valuable to reduce errors caused by occlusions.
Scene context is known to aid in object recognition in biological vision. In
this work, we attempt to add robustness into existing Region Proposal
Network-Deep Convolutional Neural Network (RPN-DCNN) object detection networks
through two distinct scene-based information fusion techniques. We present one
algorithm under each methodology: the first operates prior to prediction,
selecting a custom object network to use based on the identified background
scene, and the second operates after detection, fusing scene knowledge into
initial object scores output by the RPN. We demonstrate our algorithms on
challenging datasets featuring partial occlusions, which show overall
improvement in both recall and precision against baseline methods. In addition,
our experiments contrast multiple training methodologies for occlusion
handling, finding that training on a combination of both occluded and
unoccluded images demonstrates an improvement over the others. Our method is
interpretable and can easily be adapted to other datasets, offering many future
directions for research and practical applications.

Motivation: The paper aims to address the challenge of controlling Vision-Language Models' outputs to better comply with specific instructions and reduce hallucinations without altering the original model weights.

Method: SteerVLM dynamically adjusts activations between language and image contexts using paired prompt embeddings. It only requires 0.14% of the original VLM's parameters and employs activation modulation across layers without static vectors or manual tuning.

Result: The steering method surpasses existing techniques in benchmarks for guiding VLMs and mitigating hallucinations, proving its robustness for model control.

Conclusion: The proposed technique provides an effective solution for precise multimodal model control through activation engineering and introduces a new dataset, VNIA, for evaluation.

Abstract: This work introduces SteerVLM, a lightweight steering module designed to
guide Vision-Language Models (VLMs) towards outputs that better adhere to
desired instructions. Our approach learns from the latent embeddings of paired

activations connecting the language modality with image context. This allows
for fine-grained, inference-time control over complex output semantics without
modifying model weights while preserving performance on off-target tasks. Our

focuses on semantic segmentation for AMD lesion detection in RGB fundus images,
a non-invasive and cost-effective imaging technique. The results of the ADAM

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces the ChartAlign Benchmark (ChartAB) for evaluating vision-language models (VLMs) on chart grounding tasks, identifying weaknesses and strengths in chart comprehension.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing VLMs struggle with fine-grained chart understanding, which limits their ability to process and reason over detailed chart structures.

Method: The authors present ChartAB, a benchmark that uses JSON templates to evaluate metrics for chart grounding tasks and introduces a two-stage inference workflow to compare chart attributes and elements.

Result: Evaluations on recent VLMs revealed their biases, robustness, hallucinations, and deficiencies in chart understanding tasks.

Conclusion: The paper identifies fine-grained discrepancies among VLMs and highlights areas where current models need improvement in chart comprehension and reasoning.

Abstract: Charts play an important role in visualization, reasoning, data analysis, and
the exchange of ideas among humans. However, existing vision-language models
(VLMs) still lack accurate perception of details and struggle to extract
fine-grained structures from charts. Such limitations in chart grounding also
hinder their ability to compare multiple charts and reason over them. In this
paper, we introduce a novel "ChartAlign Benchmark (ChartAB)" to provide a
comprehensive evaluation of VLMs in chart grounding tasks, i.e., extracting
tabular data, localizing visualization elements, and recognizing various
attributes from charts of diverse types and complexities. We design a JSON
template to facilitate the calculation of evaluation metrics specifically
tailored for each grounding task. By incorporating a novel two-stage inference
workflow, the benchmark can further evaluate VLMs' capability to align and
compare elements/attributes across two charts. Our analysis of evaluations on
several recent VLMs reveals new insights into their perception biases,
weaknesses, robustness, and hallucinations in chart understanding. These
findings highlight the fine-grained discrepancies among VLMs in chart
understanding tasks and point to specific skills that need to be strengthened
in current models.

*Cheng Zheng,William Koch,Baiang Li,Felix Heide*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a general hierarchical motion modeling method that uses graph-based hierarchies to uncover interpretable motion relationships directly from data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing approaches for hierarchical motion modeling rely on fixed, heuristic hierarchies and lack generalizability across tasks.

Method: The proposed method learns hierarchical structures by representing motions as directed graphs. Vertices symbolize elemental motions, while edges define parent-child dependencies through graph neural networks. Hierarchy inference is treated as a differentiable graph learning problem.

Result: The method successfully reconstructs intrinsic motion hierarchies for 1D and 2D motions and produces realistic 3D scene deformations compared to baselines in Gaussian splatting scenarios.

Conclusion: This approach provides a flexible, data-driven framework for hierarchical motion modeling, applicable across diverse motion-centric fields.

Abstract: Hierarchical structures of motion exist across research fields, including
computer vision, graphics, and robotics, where complex dynamics typically arise
from coordinated interactions among simpler motion components. Existing methods
to model such dynamics typically rely on manually-defined or heuristic
hierarchies with fixed motion primitives, limiting their generalizability
across different tasks. In this work, we propose a general hierarchical motion
modeling method that learns structured, interpretable motion relationships
directly from data. Our method represents observed motions using graph-based
hierarchies, explicitly decomposing global absolute motions into
parent-inherited patterns and local motion residuals. We formulate hierarchy
inference as a differentiable graph learning problem, where vertices represent
elemental motions and directed edges capture learned parent-child dependencies
through graph neural networks. We evaluate our hierarchical reconstruction
approach on three examples: 1D translational motion, 2D rotational motion, and
dynamic 3D scene deformation via Gaussian splatting. Experimental results show
that our method reconstructs the intrinsic motion hierarchy in 1D and 2D cases,
and produces more realistic and interpretable deformations compared to the
baseline on dynamic 3D Gaussian splatting scenes. By providing an adaptable,
data-driven hierarchical modeling paradigm, our method offers a formulation
applicable to a broad range of motion-centric tasks. Project Page:

Motivation: The motivation is to address the limitations in generalization capabilities of current 3D human motion generation models by leveraging the advanced generalization achieved in video generation.

Method: The approach involves three aspects: 1) Creating ViMoGen-228K, an extensive dataset combining MoCap, annotated web video motions, and synthesized samples, 2) Developing the ViMoGen model which integrates MoCap and ViGen priors using a diffusion transformer and offering a distilled version called ViMoGen-light, 3) Establishing MBench, a benchmarking tool for evaluation based on motion quality, fidelity, and generalization.

Result: The framework achieves superior performance compared to existing methods, proven through extensive automatic and human evaluations.

Conclusion: The research successfully bridges gaps in 3D human motion generation by introducing a dataset, a unified model, and a benchmark, providing significant advancements in generalization and fidelity.

Abstract: Despite recent advances in 3D human motion generation (MoGen) on standard
benchmarks, existing models still face a fundamental bottleneck in their

notably video generation (ViGen), have demonstrated remarkable generalization
in modeling human behaviors, highlighting transferable insights that MoGen can
leverage. Motivated by this observation, we present a comprehensive framework
that systematically transfers knowledge from ViGen to MoGen across three key
pillars: data, modeling, and evaluation. First, we introduce ViMoGen-228K, a
large-scale dataset comprising 228,000 high-quality motion samples that
integrates high-fidelity optical MoCap data with semantically annotated motions
from web videos and synthesized samples generated by state-of-the-art ViGen
models. The dataset includes both text-motion pairs and text-video-motion
triplets, substantially expanding semantic diversity. Second, we propose
ViMoGen, a flow-matching-based diffusion transformer that unifies priors from
MoCap data and ViGen models through gated multimodal conditioning. To enhance
efficiency, we further develop ViMoGen-light, a distilled variant that
eliminates video generation dependencies while preserving strong
generalization. Finally, we present MBench, a hierarchical benchmark designed
for fine-grained evaluation across motion quality, prompt fidelity, and
generalization ability. Extensive experiments show that our framework
significantly outperforms existing approaches in both automatic and human
evaluations. The code, data, and benchmark will be made publicly available.

### [173] [Scaling Image Geo-Localization to Continent Level](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26795)
*Philipp Lindenberger,Paul-Edouard Sarlin,Jan Hosang,Matteo Balice,Marc Pollefeys,Simon Lynen,Eduard Trulls*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper presents a new method for fine-grained image geo-localization at a large geographic scale, using a hybrid approach combining proxy classification and aerial imagery for feature learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Global image geo-localization is challenging due to inefficiencies in retrieval techniques and insufficient image coverage. Existing methods face scalability and domain gap issues, requiring improved solutions.

Method: The authors propose a hybrid approach that uses a proxy classification task to train models capable of learning rich feature representations. These features are combined with aerial imagery embeddings to enhance ground-level data robustness, enabling precise image retrieval across vast geographic areas.

Result: The approach achieves fine-grained geo-localization within 200 meters for over 68% of queries in a European dataset, demonstrating its effectiveness across large geographic regions.

Conclusion: The proposed solution successfully addresses existing scalability and inefficiency challenges in image geo-localization. The hybrid method achieves precise localization and offers a practical tool for large-scale geographic identification.

Abstract: Determining the precise geographic location of an image at a global scale
remains an unsolved challenge. Standard image retrieval techniques are
inefficient due to the sheer volume of images (>100M) and fail when coverage is
insufficient. Scalable solutions, however, involve a trade-off: global
classification typically yields coarse results (10+ kilometers), while
cross-view retrieval between ground and aerial imagery suffers from a domain
gap and has been primarily studied on smaller regions. This paper introduces a
hybrid approach that achieves fine-grained geo-localization across a large
geographic expanse the size of a continent. We leverage a proxy classification
task during training to learn rich feature representations that implicitly
encode precise location information. We combine these learned prototypes with
embeddings of aerial imagery to increase robustness to the sparsity of
ground-level data. This enables direct, fine-grained retrieval over areas
spanning multiple countries. Our extensive evaluation demonstrates that our
approach can localize within 200m more than 68\% of queries of a dataset
covering a large part of Europe. The code is publicly available at

### [174] [SEE4D: Pose-Free 4D Generation via Auto-Regressive Video Inpainting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26796)
*Dongyue Lu,Ao Liang,Tianxin Huang,Xiao Fu,Yuyang Zhao,Baorui Ma,Liang Pan,Wei Yin,Lingdong Kong,Wei Tsang Ooi,Ziwei Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SEE4D introduces a pose-free method for synthesizing 4D spatiotemporal content using casual videos, replacing explicit trajectory prediction with camera rendering using fixed virtual setups.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create immersive 4D content from casual videos without relying on manual 3D supervision, overcoming labor-intensive and brittle pose requirements of current methods.

Method: SEE4D uses a view-conditional video inpainting model with virtual camera rendering and an autoregressive inference pipeline that learns geometry priors by denoising and filling missing regions, without explicit pose labels or 3D annotations.

Result: The method achieves superior generalization and performance in cross-view video generation and sparse reconstruction benchmarks compared to current trajectory or pose-conditioned approaches.

Conclusion: SEE4D advances practical and coherent 4D world modeling using casual video inputs, eliminating the reliance on costly pose labels and manual 3D supervision.

Abstract: Immersive applications call for synthesizing spatiotemporal 4D content from
casual videos without costly 3D supervision. Existing video-to-4D methods
typically rely on manually annotated camera poses, which are labor-intensive
and brittle for in-the-wild footage. Recent warp-then-inpaint approaches
mitigate the need for pose labels by warping input frames along a novel camera
trajectory and using an inpainting model to fill missing regions, thereby
depicting the 4D scene from diverse viewpoints. However, this
trajectory-to-trajectory formulation often entangles camera motion with scene
dynamics and complicates both modeling and inference. We introduce SEE4D, a
pose-free, trajectory-to-camera framework that replaces explicit trajectory
prediction with rendering to a bank of fixed virtual cameras, thereby
separating camera control from scene modeling. A view-conditional video
inpainting model is trained to learn a robust geometry prior by denoising
realistically synthesized warped images and to inpaint occluded or missing
regions across virtual viewpoints, eliminating the need for explicit 3D
annotations. Building on this inpainting core, we design a spatiotemporal
autoregressive inference pipeline that traverses virtual-camera splines and
extends videos with overlapping windows, enabling coherent generation at
bounded per-step complexity. We validate See4D on cross-view video generation
and sparse reconstruction benchmarks. Across quantitative metrics and
qualitative assessments, our method achieves superior generalization and
improved performance relative to pose- or trajectory-conditioned baselines,
advancing practical 4D world modeling from casual videos.

### [175] [Masked Diffusion Captioning for Visual Feature Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26799)
*Chao Feng,Zihao Wei,Andrew Owens*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes Masked Diffusion Captioning (MDC), a training method utilizing image-conditioned masked diffusion language models for learning visual features from image-caption pairs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to improve visual feature learning for downstream tasks and overcome limitations in autoregressive captioning, such as positional dependence and auxiliary objectives.

Method: Text tokens in image-caption pairs are randomly masked, and the model reconstructs the original text while conditioned on visual features using diffusion-based methods.

Result: Visual features learned through MDC are competitive with those from autoregressive and contrastive approaches, supported by linear probing experiments on various models and datasets.

Conclusion: Masked diffusion captioning achieves effective visual feature learning, offering a robust alternative to conventional autoregressive and contrastive methods.

Abstract: We learn visual features by captioning images with an image-conditioned
masked diffusion language model, a formulation we call masked diffusion
captioning (MDC). During training, text tokens in each image-caption pair are
masked at a randomly chosen ratio, and a decoder conditioned on visual features
is trained to reconstruct the original text. After training, the learned visual
features can be applied to downstream vision tasks. Unlike autoregressive
captioning, the strength of the visual learning signal in MDC does not depend
on each token's position in the sequence, reducing the need for auxiliary
objectives. Linear probing experiments across a variety of academic-scale
models and datasets show that the learned visual features are competitive with
those produced by autoregressive and contrastive approaches.

*Yukun Huang,Jiwen Yu,Yanning Zhou,Jianan Wang,Xintao Wang,Pengfei Wan,Xihui Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces OmniX, a framework utilizing 2D generative models to produce high-quality 3D scenes suitable for physically realistic applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance 3D scene generation leveraging 2D generative priors for applications such as relighting and simulation.

Method: The authors repurposed 2D generative models for panoramic perception and adapted them for geometry, textures, and PBR materials using a cross-modal adapter structure.

Result: They developed OmniX and created a synthetic panorama dataset, demonstrating effectiveness for panoramic vision tasks and 3D scene generation.

Conclusion: OmniX opens new potentials for immersive, graphics-ready 3D virtual worlds that are physically realistic.

Abstract: There are two prevalent ways to constructing 3D scenes: procedural generation
and 2D lifting. Among them, panorama-based 2D lifting has emerged as a
promising technique, leveraging powerful 2D generative priors to produce
immersive, realistic, and diverse 3D environments. In this work, we advance
this technique to generate graphics-ready 3D scenes suitable for physically
based rendering (PBR), relighting, and simulation. Our key insight is to
repurpose 2D generative models for panoramic perception of geometry, textures,
and PBR materials. Unlike existing 2D lifting approaches that emphasize
appearance generation and ignore the perception of intrinsic properties, we
present OmniX, a versatile and unified framework. Based on a lightweight and
efficient cross-modal adapter structure, OmniX reuses 2D generative priors for
a broad range of panoramic vision tasks, including panoramic perception,
generation, and completion. Furthermore, we construct a large-scale synthetic
panorama dataset containing high-quality multimodal panoramas from diverse
indoor and outdoor scenes. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness
of our model in panoramic visual perception and graphics-ready 3D scene
generation, opening new possibilities for immersive and physically realistic
virtual world generation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Video models display emerging reasoning behaviors but are not yet reliable standalone zero-shot visual reasoners.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate whether advanced video generation models, like Veo-3, could serve as zero-shot reasoners in complex visual reasoning scenarios.

Method: An empirical analysis was conducted, assessing Veo-3's reasoning behavior across 12 dimensions using a standardized benchmark (MME-CoF).

Result: Veo-3 showed strengths in spatial coherence, fine-grained grounding, and locally consistent dynamics, but struggled with long-horizon causal reasoning, strict geometric constraints, and abstract logic.

Conclusion: Video models exhibit promising reasoning capabilities but require significant improvements for standalone reasoning; they may be better utilized as complementary tools alongside specialized reasoning models.

Abstract: Recent video generation models can produce high-fidelity, temporally coherent
videos, indicating that they may encode substantial world knowledge. Beyond
realistic synthesis, they also exhibit emerging behaviors indicative of visual
perception, modeling, and manipulation. Yet, an important question still
remains: Are video models ready to serve as zero-shot reasoners in challenging
visual reasoning scenarios? In this work, we conduct an empirical study to
comprehensively investigate this question, focusing on the leading and popular
Veo-3. We evaluate its reasoning behavior across 12 dimensions, including
spatial, geometric, physical, temporal, and embodied logic, systematically
characterizing both its strengths and failure modes. To standardize this study,
we curate the evaluation data into MME-CoF, a compact benchmark that enables
in-depth and thorough assessment of Chain-of-Frame (CoF) reasoning. Our
findings reveal that while current video models demonstrate promising reasoning
patterns on short-horizon spatial coherence, fine-grained grounding, and
locally consistent dynamics, they remain limited in long-horizon causal
reasoning, strict geometric constraints, and abstract logic. Overall, they are
not yet reliable as standalone zero-shot reasoners, but exhibit encouraging
signs as complementary visual engines alongside dedicated reasoning models.

*Zixu Shen,Kexin Chu,Yifan Zhang,Dawei Xiang,Runxin Wu,Wei Zhang*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: ExpertFlow is a runtime system designed to improve inference efficiency in Mixture-of-Experts models by optimizing expert prefetching and cache routing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large language models face memory constraints on modern GPUs, necessitating solutions like MoE architectures. However, MoE's current inference mechanisms are inefficient due to latency and adaptability issues.

Method: ExpertFlow leverages adaptive expert prefetching, cache-aware routing, and a hybrid cross-layer prediction system to improve memory efficiency and reduce latency during MoE inference.

Result: ExpertFlow decreases model stall time to less than 0.1% of baseline, significantly improving inference efficiency under memory constraints.

Conclusion: ExpertFlow demonstrates enhanced robustness and effectiveness for running Mixture-of-Experts models, addressing latency challenges and improving compatibility with diverse hardware and workloads.

Abstract: The expansion of large language models is increasingly limited by the
constrained memory capacity of modern GPUs. To mitigate this,
Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures activate only a small portion of
parameters during inference, significantly lowering both memory demand and
computational overhead. However, conventional MoE inference approaches, which
select active experts independently at each layer, often introduce considerable
latency because of frequent parameter transfers between host and GPU memory. In
addition, current cross-layer prediction strategies, which are typically based
on fixed steps, lack adaptability across different hardware platforms and
workloads, thereby reducing their robustness and effectiveness.
  To address these challenges, we present ExpertFlow, a runtime system for MoE
inference that combines adaptive expert prefetching and cache-aware routing.
ExpertFlow continuously adjusts its prediction horizon for expert activation by
leveraging runtime statistics such as transfer bandwidth, parameter
dimensionality, and model feedback signals. Furthermore, it incorporates a
hybrid cross-layer prediction scheme that fuses pregating information with
intermediate computational states to anticipate future expert needs. By
adaptively refining prefetching decisions and aligning them with actual usage
behavior, ExpertFlow effectively decreases cache misses and removes latency
caused by expert swap-ins. Our evaluation demonstrates that ExpertFlow reduces
model stall time to less than 0.1% of the baseline, highlighting its capability
to optimize MoE inference under stringent memory constraints.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To systematically analyze and summarize the emerging and promising field of Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs), which are based on learnable univariate basis functions and offer improved expressivity over traditional MLPs.

Method: The authors bridge connections between KANs and MLPs, categorize basis function choices and architectural advancements, and provide a practical guide for implementing and selecting appropriate KAN architectures.

Result: This review demonstrates the formal equivalence between KANs and MLPs, emphasizes KAN’s parameter efficiency, surveys basis function trade-offs, and categorizes advancements in accuracy, efficiency, and regularization strategies.

Conclusion: KANs show promise as an alternative to MLPs with superior expressivity and interpretability. This review emphasizes their growing ecosystem, identifies gaps in research, and provides tools for practical adoption.

Abstract: Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) have recently emerged as a promising
alternative to traditional Multilayer Perceptrons (MLPs), inspired by the
Kolmogorov-Arnold representation theorem. Unlike MLPs, which use fixed
activation functions on nodes, KANs employ learnable univariate basis functions
on edges, offering enhanced expressivity and interpretability. This review
provides a systematic and comprehensive overview of the rapidly expanding KAN
landscape, moving beyond simple performance comparisons to offer a structured
synthesis of theoretical foundations, architectural variants, and practical
implementation strategies. By collecting and categorizing a vast array of
open-source implementations, we map the vibrant ecosystem supporting KAN
development. We begin by bridging the conceptual gap between KANs and MLPs,
establishing their formal equivalence and highlighting the superior parameter
efficiency of the KAN formulation. A central theme of our review is the
critical role of the basis function; we survey a wide array of choices,
including B-splines, Chebyshev and Jacobi polynomials, ReLU compositions,
Gaussian RBFs, and Fourier series, and analyze their respective trade-offs in
terms of smoothness, locality, and computational cost. We then categorize
recent advancements into a clear roadmap, covering techniques for improving
accuracy, efficiency, and regularization. Key topics include physics-informed
loss design, adaptive sampling, domain decomposition, hybrid architectures, and
specialized methods for handling discontinuities. Finally, we provide a
practical "Choose-Your-KAN" guide to help practitioners select appropriate
architectures, and we conclude by identifying current research gaps. The

TL;DR: The paper introduces HiMAE, an efficient self-supervised learning method for wearable sensor data, focusing on multi-resolution temporal embeddings for improved predictive analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To clarify the predictive utility and principles of physiological time series data from wearable sensors, emphasizing temporal resolution as a key factor.

Method: Develop HiMAE, a hierarchical masked autoencoder, combining masked autoencoding with a hierarchical convolutional encoder-decoder to analyze multi-resolution temporal scales.

Result: HiMAE outperforms state-of-the-art models in classification, regression, and generative benchmarks while being highly efficient for smartwatch edge inference.

Conclusion: HiMAE is a compact and effective tool for self-supervised learning and scale-sensitive discovery in wearable health applications.

Abstract: Wearable sensors provide abundant physiological time series, yet the
principles governing their predictive utility remain unclear. We hypothesize
that temporal resolution is a fundamental axis of representation learning, with
different clinical and behavioral outcomes relying on structure at distinct
scales. To test this resolution hypothesis, we introduce HiMAE (Hierarchical
Masked Autoencoder), a self supervised framework that combines masked
autoencoding with a hierarchical convolutional encoder decoder. HiMAE produces
multi resolution embeddings that enable systematic evaluation of which temporal
scales carry predictive signal, transforming resolution from a hyperparameter
into a probe for interpretability. Across classification, regression, and
generative benchmarks, HiMAE consistently outperforms state of the art
foundation models that collapse scale, while being orders of magnitude smaller.
HiMAE is an efficient representation learner compact enough to run entirely on
watch, achieving sub millisecond inference on smartwatch class CPUs for true
edge inference. Together, these contributions position HiMAE as both an
efficient self supervised learning method and a discovery tool for scale
sensitive structure in wearable health.

Motivation: The need for innovative high-energy materials, critical for propulsion and defense, and limitations in experimental data prompted the study.

Method: The paper combined LSTM networks for molecular generation with Attentive GNNs for predicting properties, using a unique embedding space and training approach without pretraining.

Result: Achieved 67.5% validity and 37.5% novelty in molecular generation. Generated diverse chemical structures and identified 37 super explosives with high detonation velocities.

Conclusion: The approach shows strong potential for discovering high-performance explosives, reshaping molecular design through advanced computational techniques.

Abstract: High-energy materials (HEMs) are critical for propulsion and defense domains,
yet their discovery remains constrained by experimental data and restricted
access to testing facilities. This work presents a novel approach toward
high-energy molecules by combining Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks for
molecular generation and Attentive Graph Neural Networks (GNN) for property
predictions. We propose a transformative embedding space construction strategy
that integrates fixed SHA-256 embeddings with partially trainable
representations. Unlike conventional regularization techniques, this changes
the representational basis itself, reshaping the molecular input space before
learning begins. Without recourse to pretraining, the generator achieves 67.5%
validity and 37.5% novelty. The generated library exhibits a mean Tanimoto
coefficient of 0.214 relative to training set signifying the ability of
framework to generate a diverse chemical space. We identified 37 new super

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper investigates how Chain-of-Thought (CoT) supervision impacts transformer models' learning and generalization on symbolic reasoning tasks, providing insights into learning dynamics and trace faithfulness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to understand the mechanisms and benefits of CoT supervision in improving transformer models' performance on symbolic reasoning tasks.

Method: The authors use pretraining on symbolic reasoning tasks with controllable algorithmic complexity and data distribution. They employ two experimental settings: generating only final answers and producing explicit CoT traces before answering. A kinetic modeling framework is introduced to analyze the accuracy and training dynamics.

Result: CoT supervision improves task performance, especially for tasks with lower algorithmic complexity. Models trained with CoT exhibited faster generalization, though it could not overcome challenges of higher complexity tasks. Trace faithfulness emerged during training, and CoT altered the internal computational mechanisms of transformers.

Conclusion: CoT accelerates learning and generalization for simpler tasks, but its effectiveness varies by complexity. Learning dynamics highlight trace faithfulness as an evolving property, with CoT mechanistically impacting internal computation within transformers.

Abstract: Chain-of-thought (CoT) supervision can substantially improve transformer
performance, yet the mechanisms by which models learn to follow and benefit
from CoT remain poorly understood. We investigate these learning dynamics
through the lens of grokking by pretraining transformers on symbolic reasoning
tasks with tunable algorithmic complexity and controllable data composition to
study their generalization. Models were trained under two settings: (i)
producing only final answers, and (ii) emitting explicit CoT traces before
answering. Our results show that while CoT generally improves task performance,
its benefits depend on task complexity. To quantify these effects, we model the
accuracy of the logarithmic training steps with a three-parameter logistic
curve, revealing how the learning speed and shape vary with task complexity,
data distribution, and the presence of CoT supervision. We also uncover a
transient trace unfaithfulness phase: early in training, models often produce
correct answers while skipping or contradicting CoT steps, before later
aligning their reasoning traces with answers. Empirically, we (1) demonstrate
that CoT accelerates generalization but does not overcome tasks with higher
algorithmic complexity, such as finding list intersections; (2) introduce a
kinetic modeling framework for understanding transformer learning; (3)
characterize trace faithfulness as a dynamic property that emerges over
training; and (4) show CoT alters internal transformer computation
mechanistically.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper presents ReSpec, a system that adapts speculative decoding (SD) for reinforcement learning (RL), achieving up to 4.5x speedup during training while maintaining reward convergence and stability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Training large language models (LLMs) with reinforcement learning is slow due to the bottleneck in generation. Existing speculative decoding methods, effective in serving systems, are not optimized for use in RL training.

Method: The authors developed ReSpec, a three-fold approach: dynamic tuning of SD configurations, evolving the drafter via knowledge distillation, and using rollout rewards to weight updates.

Result: ReSpec significantly accelerates training, attaining up to 4.5x speedup on Qwen models, ranging from 3B to 14B parameters, while maintaining training stability and reward convergence.

Conclusion: ReSpec effectively bridges the gaps of applying speculative decoding to RL adaptation in large language models, making RL-based training more efficient.

Abstract: Adapting large language models (LLMs) via reinforcement learning (RL) is
often bottlenecked by the generation stage, which can consume over 75\% of the
training time. Speculative decoding (SD) accelerates autoregressive generation
in serving systems, but its behavior under RL training remains largely
unexplored. We identify three critical gaps that hinder the naive integration
of SD into RL systems: diminishing speedups at large batch sizes, drafter
staleness under continual actor updates, and drafter-induced policy
degradation.
  To address these gaps, we present ReSpec, a system that adapts SD to RL
through three complementary mechanisms: dynamically tuning SD configurations,
evolving the drafter via knowledge distillation, and weighting updates by
rollout rewards. On Qwen models (3B--14B), ReSpec achieves up to 4.5x speedup
while preserving reward convergence and training stability, providing a
practical solution for efficient RL-based LLM adaptation.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper identifies when learning and correcting biases in multi-agent systems is effective by introducing the concept of a learnability ratio and presents the ABLOC algorithm to optimize performance improvement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Many multi-agent systems suffer performance loss due to environment-dependent biases, which are often ignored or require impractical calibration methods, leading to inaccurate decisions in areas such as environmental monitoring and financial prediction.

Method: The paper introduces the concept of a 'learnability ratio' to determine how much of the bias can be learned and corrected. They propose the ABLOC algorithm to iteratively learn bias corrections and optimize system performance with guaranteed convergence to theoretical bounds.

Result: The study demonstrates that systems with high learnability ratios can recover 40%-70% of the theoretical maximum performance improvement, while systems with low learnability ratios show minimal gains.

Conclusion: Bias learning is effective when the learnability ratio is high, guiding system designers on when bias correction efforts are justified. The proposed ABLOC algorithm provides an efficient way to achieve near-optimal performance when learning is viable.

Abstract: Modern multi-agent systems ranging from sensor networks monitoring critical
infrastructure to crowdsourcing platforms aggregating human intelligence can
suffer significant performance degradation due to systematic biases that vary
with environmental conditions. Current approaches either ignore these biases,
leading to suboptimal decisions, or require expensive calibration procedures
that are often infeasible in practice. This performance gap has real
consequences: inaccurate environmental monitoring, unreliable financial
predictions, and flawed aggregation of human judgments. This paper addresses
the fundamental question: when can we learn and correct for these unknown
biases to recover near-optimal performance, and when is such learning futile?
We develop a theoretical framework that decomposes biases into learnable
systematic components and irreducible stochastic components, introducing the
concept of learnability ratio as the fraction of bias variance predictable from
observable covariates. This ratio determines whether bias learning is
worthwhile for a given system. We prove that the achievable performance
improvement is fundamentally bounded by this learnability ratio, providing
system designers with quantitative guidance on when to invest in bias learning
versus simpler approaches. We present the Adaptive Bias Learning and Optimal
Combining (ABLOC) algorithm, which iteratively learns bias-correcting
transformations while optimizing combination weights through closedform
solutions, guaranteeing convergence to these theoretical bounds. Experimental
validation demonstrates that systems with high learnability ratios can recover
significant performance (we achieved 40%-70% of theoretical maximum improvement
in our examples), while those with low learnability show minimal benefit,
validating our diagnostic criteria for practical deployment decisions.

### [185] [Non-myopic Matching and Rebalancing in Large-Scale On-Demand Ride-Pooling Systems Using Simulation-Informed Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25796)
*Farnoosh Namdarpour,Joseph Y. J. Chow*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Simulation-informed reinforcement learning (RL) was proposed to improve non-myopic decision-making in ride-pooling, yielding better service rates, passenger experience, and cost efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Ride-pooling offers benefits like cost reduction and less congestion but is limited by myopic decision-making, necessitating a long-term optimization approach.

Method: A reinforcement learning framework integrating ride-pooling simulation was developed for enhanced decision-making, complemented by a policy for rebalancing idle vehicles.

Result: Non-myopic policy improved service rate (up to 8.4%), reduced wait and in-vehicle times for passengers. Fleet size was reduced by over 25%, while rebalancing further improved efficiency but raised vehicle minutes traveled.

Conclusion: Non-myopic decision-making and rebalancing policies enable more efficient and cost-effective ride-pooling systems, benefiting both passengers and operators.

Abstract: Ride-pooling, also known as ride-sharing, shared ride-hailing, or
microtransit, is a service wherein passengers share rides. This service can
reduce costs for both passengers and operators and reduce congestion and
environmental impacts. A key limitation, however, is its myopic
decision-making, which overlooks long-term effects of dispatch decisions. To
address this, we propose a simulation-informed reinforcement learning (RL)
approach. While RL has been widely studied in the context of ride-hailing
systems, its application in ride-pooling systems has been less explored. In
this study, we extend the learning and planning framework of Xu et al. (2018)
from ride-hailing to ride-pooling by embedding a ride-pooling simulation within
the learning mechanism to enable non-myopic decision-making. In addition, we
propose a complementary policy for rebalancing idle vehicles. By employing
n-step temporal difference learning on simulated experiences, we derive
spatiotemporal state values and subsequently evaluate the effectiveness of the
non-myopic policy using NYC taxi request data. Results demonstrate that the
non-myopic policy for matching can increase the service rate by up to 8.4%
versus a myopic policy while reducing both in-vehicle and wait times for
passengers. Furthermore, the proposed non-myopic policy can decrease fleet size
by over 25% compared to a myopic policy, while maintaining the same level of
performance, thereby offering significant cost savings for operators.
Incorporating rebalancing operations into the proposed framework cuts wait time
by up to 27.3%, in-vehicle time by 12.5%, and raises service rate by 15.1%
compared to using the framework for matching decisions alone at the cost of
increased vehicle minutes traveled per passenger.

Motivation: Communication bottlenecks in large-scale distributed machine learning due to inefficient gradient sparsification techniques.

Method: The authors propose ARC-Top-$K$, an All-Reduce-Compatible Top-$K$ compressor that aligns sparsity patterns using a lightweight gradient sketch, allowing for contractive communication and reduction in gradient communication overhead.

Result: ARC-Top-$K$ achieves linear speedup, sharper convergence rates, and reduces wall-clock training time by up to 60.7%, matching Top-$K$ accuracy while improving scalability.

Conclusion: ARC-Top-$K$ successfully combines the robustness of Rand-$K$ with the high performance of Top-$K$, offering an effective solution to communication challenges in distributed machine learning.

Abstract: Communication remains a central bottleneck in large-scale distributed machine
learning, and gradient sparsification has emerged as a promising strategy to
alleviate this challenge. However, existing gradient compressors face notable
limitations: Rand-$K$\ discards structural information and performs poorly in
practice, while Top-$K$\ preserves informative entries but loses the
contraction property and requires costly All-Gather operations. In this paper,
we propose ARC-Top-$K$, an {All-Reduce}-Compatible Top-$K$ compressor that
aligns sparsity patterns across nodes using a lightweight sketch of the
gradient, enabling index-free All-Reduce while preserving globally significant
information. ARC-Top-$K$\ is provably contractive and, when combined with
momentum error feedback (EF21M), achieves linear speedup and sharper
convergence rates than the original EF21M under standard assumptions.
Empirically, ARC-Top-$K$\ matches the accuracy of Top-$K$\ while reducing
wall-clock training time by up to 60.7\%, offering an efficient and scalable
solution that combines the robustness of Rand-$K$\ with the strong performance
of Top-$K$.

*Darius Masoum Zadeh-Jousdani,Elvin Hajizada,Eyke Hüllermeier*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes Predictive Coding Network with Temporal Amortization (PCN-TA) for efficient online learning in robotic systems, reducing computational demands while maintaining performance, and being biologically plausible.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Robotic systems need online learning algorithms adaptable to changing environments, but traditional backpropagation is biologically implausible and suboptimal for continuous adaptation. Predictive Coding offers an alternative but is computationally expensive.

Method: The proposed approach, PCN-TA, uses predictive coding while preserving latent states across temporal frames, leveraging temporal correlations to reduce computational load.

Result: PCN-TA achieves 10% fewer weight updates compared to traditional backpropagation and requires 50% fewer inference steps than standard Predictive Coding networks, as demonstrated on the COIL-20 dataset.

Conclusion: PCN-TA enhances efficiency for edge deployment in robotic systems, decreases computational overhead, supports real-time adaptation, and is suitable for neuromorphic hardware implementations.

Abstract: Robotic systems operating at the edge require efficient online learning
algorithms that can continuously adapt to changing environments while
processing streaming sensory data. Traditional backpropagation, while
effective, conflicts with biological plausibility principles and may be
suboptimal for continuous adaptation scenarios. The Predictive Coding (PC)
framework offers a biologically plausible alternative with local, Hebbian-like
update rules, making it suitable for neuromorphic hardware implementation.
However, PC's main limitation is its computational overhead due to multiple
inference iterations during training. We present Predictive Coding Network with
Temporal Amortization (PCN-TA), which preserves latent states across temporal
frames. By leveraging temporal correlations, PCN-TA significantly reduces
computational demands while maintaining learning performance. Our experiments
on the COIL-20 robotic perception dataset demonstrate that PCN-TA achieves 10%
fewer weight updates compared to backpropagation and requires 50% fewer
inference steps than baseline PC networks. These efficiency gains directly
translate to reduced computational overhead for moving another step toward edge
deployment and real-time adaptation support in resource-constrained robotic
systems. The biologically-inspired nature of our approach also makes it a
promising candidate for future neuromorphic hardware implementations, enabling
efficient online learning at the edge.

*Jin Seong,Jiyun Park,Wencke Liermann,Hongseok Choi,Yoonji Nam,Hyun Kim,Soojong Lim,Namhoon Lee*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MemEIC introduces a method for updating both visual and textual knowledge in large vision-language models (LVLMs) more effectively.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Modern LVLMs need continuous updates due to the dynamic nature of information, but traditional techniques focus narrowly on single-modality editing without addressing multimodality and continuous refinement.

Method: MemEIC integrates external and internal editing components, dual external memory for retrieving multimodal evidence, dual LoRA adapters for specific updates, and a brain-inspired knowledge connector for compositional multimodal reasoning.

Result: Experiments show notable improvements in handling complex multimodal questions while maintaining prior edits, setting benchmarks in LVLMs for continual and compositional knowledge editing.

Conclusion: MemEIC demonstrates a new approach to edit and continually refine multimodal LVLMs efficiently, surpassing existing methods in accuracy and compositional reliability.

Abstract: The dynamic nature of information necessitates continuously updating large
vision-language models (LVLMs). While recent knowledge editing techniques hint
at promising directions, they often focus on editing a single modality (vision
or language) in isolation. This prevalent practice neglects the inherent
multimodality of LVLMs and the continuous nature of knowledge updates,
potentially leading to suboptimal editing outcomes when considering the
interplay between modalities and the need for ongoing knowledge refinement. To
address these limitations, we propose MemEIC, a novel method for Continual and
Compositional Knowledge Editing (CCKE) in LVLMs. MemEIC enables compositional
editing of both visual and textual knowledge sequentially. Our approach employs
a hybrid external-internal editor featuring a dual external memory for
cross-modal evidence retrieval and dual LoRA adapters that facilitate
disentangled parameter updates for each modality. A key component is a
brain-inspired knowledge connector, activated selectively for compositional
reasoning, that integrates information across different modalities. Experiments
demonstrate that MemEIC significantly improves performance on complex
multimodal questions and effectively preserves prior edits, setting a new
benchmark for CCKE in LVLMs.

*Muhammad Faraz Ul Abrar,Nicolò Michelusi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper studies Over-the-air (OTA) Federated Learning (FL) under heterogeneous wireless scenarios, addressing gradient bias and variance problems for non-convex objectives and proposing a novel optimization approach.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address issues in OTA Federated Learning under wireless heterogeneity, where traditional designs suffer from inflated variance and limited by weakest devices in practical scenarios.

Method: The authors propose a structured, time-invariant model bias with reduced variance updates for stochastic gradient descent (SGD). They derive a bias-variance trade-off, optimize it via a non-convex joint OTA power-control design, and use successive convex approximation (SCA) algorithm with statistical CSI.

Result: The proposed approach accelerates convergence in non-convex image classification tasks and improves generalization as validated by experimental results.

Conclusion: OTA-FL with structured bias optimization and reduced variance updates outperforms existing baselines in convergence speed and generalization ability, making it well-suited for heterogeneous wireless conditions.

Abstract: Over-the-air (OTA) federated learning (FL) has been well recognized as a
scalable paradigm that exploits the waveform superposition of the wireless
multiple-access channel to aggregate model updates in a single use. Existing
OTA-FL designs largely enforce zero-bias model updates by either assuming
\emph{homogeneous} wireless conditions (equal path loss across devices) or
forcing zero-bias updates to guarantee convergence. Under \emph{heterogeneous}
wireless scenarios, however, such designs are constrained by the weakest device
and inflate the update variance. Moreover, prior analyses of biased OTA-FL
largely address convex objectives, while most modern AI models are highly
non-convex. Motivated by these gaps, we study OTA-FL with stochastic gradient
descent (SGD) for general smooth non-convex objectives under wireless
heterogeneity. We develop novel OTA-FL SGD updates that allow a structured,
time-invariant model bias while facilitating reduced variance updates. We
derive a finite-time stationarity bound (expected time average squared gradient
norm) that explicitly reveals a bias-variance trade-off. To optimize this
trade-off, we pose a non-convex joint OTA power-control design and develop an
efficient successive convex approximation (SCA) algorithm that requires only
statistical CSI at the base station. Experiments on a non-convex image
classification task validate the approach: the SCA-based design accelerates
convergence via an optimized bias and improves generalization over prior OTA-FL
baselines.

*Jialong Sun,Xinpeng Ling,Jiaxuan Zou,Jiawen Kang,Kejia Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper investigates spectral bias, a phenomenon where models focus on low frequency signals in multivariate time series predictions, and proposes the FreLE algorithm to address this bias.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of spectral bias in multivariate time series prediction, which affects model performance, and unify its understanding across various models.

Method: Researchers conducted extensive empirical experiments to measure spectral bias across mainstream models and developed the plug-and-play FreLE algorithm for frequency regularization in model loss functions.

Result: The study identified spectral bias as pervasive across existing models. The FreLE algorithm was found to significantly improve model generalization and performance in long-term predictions.

Conclusion: FreLE effectively mitigates spectral bias in time series prediction tasks and is validated through comprehensive experiments. The proposal serves as a universal improvement method applicable to various models.

Abstract: The inherent autocorrelation of time series data presents an ongoing
challenge to multivariate time series prediction. Recently, a widely adopted
approach has been the incorporation of frequency domain information to assist
in long-term prediction tasks. Many researchers have independently observed the
spectral bias phenomenon in neural networks, where models tend to fit
low-frequency signals before high-frequency ones. However, these observations
have often been attributed to the specific architectures designed by the
researchers, rather than recognizing the phenomenon as a universal
characteristic across models. To unify the understanding of the spectral bias
phenomenon in long-term time series prediction, we conducted extensive
empirical experiments to measure spectral bias in existing mainstream models.
Our findings reveal that virtually all models exhibit this phenomenon. To
mitigate the impact of spectral bias, we propose the FreLE (Frequency Loss
Enhancement) algorithm, which enhances model generalization through both
explicit and implicit frequency regularization. This is a plug-and-play model
loss function unit. A large number of experiments have proven the superior
performance of FreLE. Code is available at

*Kun Chen,Peng Shi,Haibo Qiu,Zhixiong Zeng,Siqi Yang,Wenji Mao,Lin Ma*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces the SPECS framework as an improvement to reinforcement learning for vision language models by addressing cold start issues with preference-based methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The research focuses on overcoming limitations of supervised fine-tuning (SFT) in reinforcement learning for vision language models, which can cause instruction-style overfitting and weak generalization.

Method: The paper proposes SPECS, a framework that employs self-distillation to create preference-based training data, promotes shallow yet transferable surface-form learning, and uses RL for deeper reasoning.

Result: SPECS improves multimodal benchmarks such as MEGA-Bench by 4.1% and MathVista by 12.2%, enhances training stability, reduces 'stuckness,' and boosts exploration.

Conclusion: The SPECS framework effectively addresses cold start challenges in reinforcement learning with better generalization, performance gains, and reduced training issues.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) with verifiable rewards has recently catalyzed a
wave of "MLLM-r1" approaches that bring RL to vision language models. Most
representative paradigms begin with a cold start, typically employing
supervised fine-tuning (SFT), to initialize the policy before RL. However,
SFT-based cold start adopts the reasoning paradigm intertwined with task
solution and output format, which may induce instruction-style overfitting,
weakens out-of-distribution generalization, and ultimately affects downstream
RL. We revisit the cold start along two views, its training method and data
construction, and introduce the Generalization Factor (GF) coefficient to
quantify the generalization capability under different methods. Our empirical
study finds that preference-based training methods (e.g. DPO) generalizes
better than SFT-based methods in cold start. Motivated by this, we propose
SPECS-a Self-distilled, Preference-based Cold Start framework that decouples
multimodal learning: (1) generates introspective preference data pairs via
self-distillation, avoiding reliance on larger teachers or manual annotation;
(2) performs preference-based training to learn, focusing on shallow,
transferable surface-form criteria (format, structure, style) rather than
memorizing content; and (3) hands off to RL with verifiable rewards for deep
reasoning results. Experimental results across multiple multimodal benchmarks
show that our decoupling learning framework yields consistent performance gains
over strong baselines, improving MEGA-Bench by 4.1% and MathVista by 12.2%.
Additional experiments indicate that SPECS contributes to reducing
in-distribution "stuckness," improving exploration, stabilizing training, and
raising the performance ceiling.

*Hong Wang,Haiyang Xin,Jie Wang,Xuanze Yang,Fei Zha,Huanshuo Dong,Yan Jiang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a novel sparse-activated architecture called MoE-POT to tackle challenges in PDE pre-training by dynamically selecting experts to reduce inference cost and improve performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges of data heterogeneity in PDE datasets leading to high errors in mixed training and the high inference cost of dense pre-training models.

Method: The authors propose the MoE-POT architecture that employs a layer-wise router-gating network to dynamically select 4 routed experts out of 16 during inference, with 2 shared experts capturing common PDE features. The outputs of activated experts are combined through weighted averaging.

Result: Pre-trained models with 90M activated parameters demonstrated up to 40% reduction in zero-shot error compared to models with 120M activated parameters. Analysis also showed interpretability of dataset types from router-gating network decisions.

Conclusion: The proposed MoE-POT architecture effectively adapts to the heterogeneity of PDE datasets, reduces inference costs, and improves model performance, achieving superior results compared to prior models.

Abstract: Pre-training has proven effective in addressing data scarcity and performance
limitations in solving PDE problems with neural operators. However, challenges
remain due to the heterogeneity of PDE datasets in equation types, which leads
to high errors in mixed training. Additionally, dense pre-training models that
scale parameters by increasing network width or depth incur significant
inference costs. To tackle these challenges, we propose a novel
Mixture-of-Experts Pre-training Operator Transformer (MoE-POT), a
sparse-activated architecture that scales parameters efficiently while
controlling inference costs. Specifically, our model adopts a layer-wise
router-gating network to dynamically select 4 routed experts from 16 expert
networks during inference, enabling the model to focus on equation-specific
features. Meanwhile, we also integrate 2 shared experts, aiming to capture
common properties of PDE and reduce redundancy among routed experts. The final
output is computed as the weighted average of the results from all activated
experts. We pre-train models with parameters from 30M to 0.5B on 6 public PDE
datasets. Our model with 90M activated parameters achieves up to a 40%
reduction in zero-shot error compared with existing models with 120M activated
parameters. Additionally, we conduct interpretability analysis, showing that
dataset types can be inferred from router-gating network decisions, which
validates the rationality and effectiveness of the MoE architecture.

*Jaewon Chu,Seunghun Lee,Hyunwoo J. Kim*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PRESTO improves instruction optimization for black-box LLMs by leveraging the preimage structure of soft prompts for efficiency, achieving superior results across 33 tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to optimize instructions for black-box LLMs, taking into account the inefficiencies of redundant queries caused by many-to-one mappings of soft prompts in white-box LLMs.

Method: PRESTO is introduced as a novel framework leveraging the preimage structure of soft prompts. It uses three key components: score sharing, preimage-based initialization, and score consistency regularization to optimize instructions efficiently.

Result: PRESTO achieves a 14x increase in scored data efficiency under the same query budget and outperforms previous methods in 33 instruction optimization tasks.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates that utilizing preimage structures as prior knowledge can result in efficient optimization for black-box LLM instruction tasks, significantly advancing this area of research.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success across diverse
domains, due to their strong instruction-following capabilities. This has led
to increasing interest in optimizing instructions for black-box LLMs, whose
internal parameters are inaccessible but widely used due to their strong
performance. To optimize instructions for black-box LLMs, recent methods employ
white-box LLMs to generate candidate instructions from optimized soft prompts.
However, white-box LLMs often map different soft prompts to the same
instruction, leading to redundant queries. While previous studies regarded this
many-to-one mapping as a structure that hinders optimization efficiency, we
reinterpret it as a useful prior knowledge that can accelerate the
optimization. To this end, we introduce PREimage-informed inSTruction
Optimization (PRESTO), a novel framework that leverages the preimage structure
of soft prompts for efficient optimization. PRESTO consists of three key
components: (1) score sharing, which shares the evaluation score with all soft
prompts in a preimage; (2) preimage-based initialization, which selects initial
data points that maximize search space coverage using preimage information; and
(3) score consistency regularization, which enforces prediction consistency
within each preimage. By leveraging preimages, PRESTO achieves the effect of
effectively obtaining 14 times more scored data under the same query budget,
resulting in more efficient optimization. Experimental results on 33
instruction optimization tasks demonstrate the superior performance of PRESTO.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ScaleDiff introduces training-free techniques to improve resolution and image quality of text-to-image diffusion models efficiently without retraining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the poor performance of text-to-image diffusion models at resolutions higher than their training capability.

Method: ScaleDiff integrates Neighborhood Patch Attention (NPA) and Latent Frequency Mixing (LFM) within an SDEdit pipeline, combined with Structure Guidance during the denoising process.

Result: ScaleDiff achieves state-of-the-art image quality and faster inference on U-Net and Diffusion Transformer models compared to other training-free methods.

Conclusion: ScaleDiff offers a model-agnostic solution to improve high-resolution image generation efficiently, showcasing significant advancements in both quality and computational speed.

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models often exhibit degraded performance when
generating images beyond their training resolution. Recent training-free
methods can mitigate this limitation, but they often require substantial
computation or are incompatible with recent Diffusion Transformer models. In
this paper, we propose ScaleDiff, a model-agnostic and highly efficient
framework for extending the resolution of pretrained diffusion models without
any additional training. A core component of our framework is Neighborhood
Patch Attention (NPA), an efficient mechanism that reduces computational
redundancy in the self-attention layer with non-overlapping patches. We
integrate NPA into an SDEdit pipeline and introduce Latent Frequency Mixing
(LFM) to better generate fine details. Furthermore, we apply Structure Guidance
to enhance global structure during the denoising process. Experimental results
demonstrate that ScaleDiff achieves state-of-the-art performance among
training-free methods in terms of both image quality and inference speed on
both U-Net and Diffusion Transformer architectures.

TL;DR: This paper addresses estimating causal effects with unobserved confounders across multiple domains, utilizing proxy variables.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To handle the challenges of unobserved confounders and varying causal effects across domains, ensuring reliable inference in such complex scenarios.

Method: The paper introduces methods to estimate causal effects using proxy variables in the target domain, proving identifiability, consistency, and developing estimation techniques with confidence intervals.

Result: Simulation studies and a real-world example demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in accurately estimating causal effects.

Conclusion: The methodology successfully identifies and estimates causal effects in complex multi-domain scenarios with hidden confounders, showcasing practical applications.

Abstract: We consider the problem of estimating a causal effect in a multi-domain
setting. The causal effect of interest is confounded by an unobserved
confounder and can change between the different domains. We assume that we have
access to a proxy of the hidden confounder and that all variables are discrete
or categorical. We propose methodology to estimate the causal effect in the
target domain, where we assume to observe only the proxy variable. Under these
conditions, we prove identifiability (even when treatment and response
variables are continuous). We introduce two estimation techniques, prove
consistency, and derive confidence intervals. The theoretical results are
supported by simulation studies and a real-world example studying the causal
effect of website rankings on consumer choices.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces MedVLSynther, a framework to synthesize high-quality medical VQA datasets from open biomedical literature, improving medical question-answering accuracy in large multimodal models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The development of general medical VQA systems is hindered by the lack of extensive, openly accessible, and high-quality training datasets.

Method: MedVLSynther generates multiple-choice VQA items through a generator-verifier framework. The generator creates valid question-answer pairs and the verifier ensures quality through criteria like clinical validity and image-text consistency. The dataset is built entirely from open biomedical literature.

Result: MedVLSynther yields MedSynVQA, a dataset including 13,087 audited questions and 14,803 images from various medical imaging modalities. Training LMMs with verified data improves benchmark accuracy, outperforming strong models in medical VQA tasks.

Conclusion: MedVLSynther provides a scalable, open, and reproducible approach for generating high-quality medical VQA datasets, enabling progress in medical AI while ensuring privacy and auditable practices.

Abstract: Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) are increasingly capable of answering medical
questions that require joint reasoning over images and text, yet training
general medical VQA systems is impeded by the lack of large, openly usable,
high-quality corpora. We present MedVLSynther, a rubric-guided
generator-verifier framework that synthesizes high-quality multiple-choice VQA
items directly from open biomedical literature by conditioning on figures,
captions, and in-text references. The generator produces self-contained stems
and parallel, mutually exclusive options under a machine-checkable JSON schema;
a multi-stage verifier enforces essential gates (self-containment, single
correct answer, clinical validity, image-text consistency), awards fine-grained
positive points, and penalizes common failure modes before acceptance. Applying
this pipeline to PubMed Central yields MedSynVQA: 13,087 audited questions over
14,803 images spanning 13 imaging modalities and 28 anatomical regions.
Training open-weight LMMs with reinforcement learning using verifiable rewards
improves accuracy across six medical VQA benchmarks, achieving averages of
55.85 (3B) and 58.15 (7B), with up to 77.57 on VQA-RAD and 67.76 on PathVQA,
outperforming strong medical LMMs. A Ablations verify that both generation and
verification are necessary and that more verified data consistently helps, and
a targeted contamination analysis detects no leakage from evaluation suites. By
operating entirely on open literature and open-weight models, MedVLSynther
offers an auditable, reproducible, and privacy-preserving path to scalable
medical VQA training data.

TL;DR: The paper presents $pi_{\text{RL}}$, a framework for training flow-based Vision-Language-Action robots using RL, achieving significant performance improvements over supervised models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Scaling supervised fine-tuning in Vision-Language-Action models is labor-intensive, and leveraging reinforcement learning remains challenging due to log-likelihood computation issues.

Method: The authors propose $pi_{\text{RL}}$, utilizing two RL algorithms: Flow-Noise (models denoising as an MDP) and Flow-SDE (integrates RL with efficient exploration through ODE-to-SDE conversion).

Result: Experiments show remarkable improvements in few-shot models, with performance increases in LIBERO and ManiSkill benchmarks, demonstrating scalable multitask RL across diverse tasks.

Conclusion: $pi_{\text{RL}}$ successfully enhances flow-based VLAs, offering significant gains in generalization and multitask reinforcement learning efficiency.

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models enable robots to understand and perform
complex tasks from multimodal input. Although recent work explores using
reinforcement learning (RL) to automate the laborious data collection process
in scaling supervised fine-tuning (SFT), applying large-scale RL to flow-based
VLAs (e.g., $\pi_0$, $\pi_{0.5}$) remains challenging due to intractable action
log-likelihoods from iterative denoising.
  We address this challenge with $\pi_{\text{RL}}$, an open-source framework
for training flow-based VLAs in parallel simulation. $\pi_{\text{RL}}$
implements two RL algorithms: (1) {Flow-Noise} models the denoising process as
a discrete-time MDP with a learnable noise network for exact log-likelihood
computation. (2) {Flow-SDE} integrates denoising with agent-environment
interaction, formulating a two-layer MDP that employs ODE-to-SDE conversion for
efficient RL exploration.
  We evaluate $\pi_{\text{RL}}$ on LIBERO and ManiSkill benchmarks. On LIBERO,
$\pi_{\text{RL}}$ boosts few-shot SFT models $\pi_0$ and $\pi_{0.5}$ from 57.6%
to 97.6% and from 77.1% to 98.3%, respectively. In ManiSkill, we train
$\pi_{\text{RL}}$ in 320 parallel environments, improving $\pi_0$ from 41.6% to
85.7% and $\pi_{0.5}$ from 40.0% to 84.8% across 4352 pick-and-place tasks,
demonstrating scalable multitask RL under heterogeneous simulation.
  Overall, $\pi_{\text{RL}}$ achieves significant performance gains and
stronger generalization over SFT-models, validating the effectiveness of online
RL for flow-based VLAs.

*J. Jon Ryu,Pavan Yeddanapudi,Xiangxiang Xu,Gregory W. Wornell*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper critiques the InfoNCE objective for mutual information (MI) estimation, introduces an improved approach called InfoNCE-anchor for accurate MI estimation, and explores its broader implications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address the limitations of InfoNCE as a mutual information estimator and improve its accuracy while analyzing its true role in representation learning.

Method: The authors introduce InfoNCE-anchor, which uses an auxiliary anchor class for consistent density ratio estimation. They also formulate a general framework using proper scoring rules to unify multiple contrastive objectives.

Result: InfoNCE-anchor significantly reduces bias and improves MI estimation accuracy. However, the anchor addition does not enhance performance in self-supervised representation learning tasks.

Conclusion: Accurate MI estimation with InfoNCE-anchor does not necessarily translate to better representation learning. Its advantages lie in learning structured density ratios rather than precise MI estimation.

Abstract: The InfoNCE objective, originally introduced for contrastive representation
learning, has become a popular choice for mutual information (MI) estimation,
despite its indirect connection to MI. In this paper, we demonstrate why
InfoNCE should not be regarded as a valid MI estimator, and we introduce a
simple modification, which we refer to as InfoNCE-anchor, for accurate MI
estimation. Our modification introduces an auxiliary anchor class, enabling
consistent density ratio estimation and yielding a plug-in MI estimator with
significantly reduced bias. Beyond this, we generalize our framework using
proper scoring rules, which recover InfoNCE-anchor as a special case when the
log score is employed. This formulation unifies a broad spectrum of contrastive
objectives, including NCE, InfoNCE, and $f$-divergence variants, under a single
principled framework. Empirically, we find that InfoNCE-anchor with the log
score achieves the most accurate MI estimates; however, in self-supervised
representation learning experiments, we find that the anchor does not improve
the downstream task performance. These findings corroborate that contrastive
representation learning benefits not from accurate MI estimation per se, but
from the learning of structured density ratios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the challenge of exploring and exploiting data efficiently in active learning with a limited label budget, while improving performance in graph-based classification tasks.

Method: The paper introduces Balanced Forman Curvature (BFC) for coreset construction to guide exploration, using a stopping criterion for exploration sufficiency and employing graph rewiring strategies for enhanced exploitation.

Result: The proposed methods outperform existing graph-based semi-supervised learning baselines on benchmark classification tasks, especially at low label rates.

Conclusion: The graph-topological approach using BFC offers significant improvements for label-efficient active learning, balancing exploration and exploitation while improving label propagation and preserving graph sparsity.

Abstract: We propose a graph-topological approach to active learning that directly
targets the core challenge of exploration versus exploitation under scarce
label budgets. To guide exploration, we introduce a coreset construction
algorithm based on Balanced Forman Curvature (BFC), which selects
representative initial labels that reflect the graph's cluster structure. This
method includes a data-driven stopping criterion that signals when the graph
has been sufficiently explored. We further use BFC to dynamically trigger the
shift from exploration to exploitation within active learning routines,
replacing hand-tuned heuristics. To improve exploitation, we introduce a
localized graph rewiring strategy that efficiently incorporates multiscale
information around labeled nodes, enhancing label propagation while preserving
sparsity. Experiments on benchmark classification tasks show that our methods
consistently outperform existing graph-based semi-supervised baselines at low
label rates.

TL;DR: This paper identifies that incremental Adam diverges from full-batch Adam's bias and highlights dataset-dependent variances in solutions, contrasting it with Signum's invariant behavior.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limited theoretical understanding of Adam's optimization behavior, especially its implicit bias under incremental setups and its dependency on dataset characteristics.

Method: The study examines logistic regression for linearly separable data, constructing specific datasets and using a proxy algorithm to analyze Adam's behavior as $\beta_2 \to 1$.

Result: Incremental Adam shows an $\ell_2$-max-margin classifier bias for certain structured datasets, deviating from full-batch Adam's $\ell_\infty$ bias. Signum is shown to consistently converge to $\ell_\infty$-max-margin regardless of batch size.

Conclusion: Adam's bias depends significantly on the batching scheme and dataset, whereas Signum provides a stable optimization unaffected by these factors.

Abstract: Adam [Kingma and Ba, 2015] is the de facto optimizer in deep learning, yet
its theoretical understanding remains limited. Prior analyses show that Adam
favors solutions aligned with $\ell_\infty$-geometry, but these results are
restricted to the full-batch regime. In this work, we study the implicit bias
of incremental Adam (using one sample per step) for logistic regression on
linearly separable data, and we show that its bias can deviate from the
full-batch behavior. To illustrate this, we construct a class of structured
datasets where incremental Adam provably converges to the $\ell_2$-max-margin
classifier, in contrast to the $\ell_\infty$-max-margin bias of full-batch
Adam. For general datasets, we develop a proxy algorithm that captures the
limiting behavior of incremental Adam as $\beta_2 \to 1$ and we characterize
its convergence direction via a data-dependent dual fixed-point formulation.
Finally, we prove that, unlike Adam, Signum [Bernstein et al., 2018] converges
to the $\ell_\infty$-max-margin classifier for any batch size by taking $\beta$
close enough to 1. Overall, our results highlight that the implicit bias of
Adam crucially depends on both the batching scheme and the dataset, while
Signum remains invariant.

### [201] [Posterior Sampling by Combining Diffusion Models with Annealed Langevin Dynamics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26324)
*Zhiyang Xun,Shivam Gupta,Eric Price*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper investigates the problem of sampling from posterior distributions in noisy linear measurements, proposing a method that combines diffusion models and annealed Langevin dynamics for efficient conditional sampling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Posterior sampling is crucial for tasks like inpainting, deblurring, and MRI reconstruction but is computationally intractable in general, leading to the need for efficient alternatives.

Method: The study focuses on log-concave distributions and demonstrates that combining diffusion models with annealed Langevin dynamics can achieve conditional sampling using relaxed error bounds.

Result: The proposed framework enables conditional sampling in polynomial time, requiring only $L^4$ score error bounds compared to stricter requirements in previous methods.

Conclusion: A combination of diffusion models and annealed Langevin dynamics offers a computationally feasible solution for posterior sampling tasks under noisy linear measurement scenarios.

Abstract: Given a noisy linear measurement $y = Ax + \xi$ of a distribution $p(x)$, and
a good approximation to the prior $p(x)$, when can we sample from the posterior
$p(x \mid y)$? Posterior sampling provides an accurate and fair framework for
tasks such as inpainting, deblurring, and MRI reconstruction, and several
heuristics attempt to approximate it. Unfortunately, approximate posterior
sampling is computationally intractable in general.
  To sidestep this hardness, we focus on (local or global) log-concave
distributions $p(x)$. In this regime, Langevin dynamics yields posterior
samples when the exact scores of $p(x)$ are available, but it is brittle to
score--estimation error, requiring an MGF bound (sub-exponential error). By
contrast, in the unconditional setting, diffusion models succeed with only an
$L^2$ bound on the score error. We prove that combining diffusion models with
an annealed variant of Langevin dynamics achieves conditional sampling in
polynomial time using merely an $L^4$ bound on the score error.

### [202] [Active Learning with Task-Driven Representations for Messy Pools](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25926)
*Kianoosh Ashouritaklimi,Tom Rainforth*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This study proposes enhancing active learning for messy data pools by adopting task-driven representations over fixed unsupervised ones, showing improved performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current active learning methods struggle to address messy and uncurated data pools due to reliance on fixed, unsupervised representations which might not capture relevant task-specific information.

Method: The paper proposes task-driven representations that are updated periodically during active learning based on collected labels, using two strategies: semi-supervised representation learning and supervised fine-tuning of pre-trained unsupervised models.

Result: Both strategies (semi-supervised and supervised fine-tuning) significantly outperform fixed unsupervised or pre-trained representations in handling messy data pools.

Conclusion: Using task-driven representations in active learning processes yields better performance and is more effective for messy and uncurated data pools.

Abstract: Active learning has the potential to be especially useful for messy,
uncurated pools where datapoints vary in relevance to the target task. However,
state-of-the-art approaches to this problem currently rely on using fixed,
unsupervised representations of the pool, focusing on modifying the acquisition
function instead. We show that this model setup can undermine their
effectiveness at dealing with messy pools, as such representations can fail to
capture important information relevant to the task. To address this, we propose
using task-driven representations that are periodically updated during the
active learning process using the previously collected labels. We introduce two
specific strategies for learning these representations, one based on directly
learning semi-supervised representations and the other based on supervised
fine-tuning of an initial unsupervised representation. We find that both
significantly improve empirical performance over using unsupervised or
pretrained representations.

### [203] [Robust GNN Watermarking via Implicit Perception of Topological Invariants](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25934)
*Jipeng Li,Yannning Shen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces InvGNN-WM, a watermarking technique for Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) that avoids backdoor triggers and enables black-box verification while maintaining robustness and accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current watermarking methods for GNNs rely on backdoor triggers, which fail under model modifications and cause uncertainty in ownership verification.

Method: InvGNN-WM ties ownership to a model's perception of graph invariant properties, involving a lightweight head, calibrated thresholds, and a decoder to interpret the watermark information. It is evaluated on various datasets.

Result: InvGNN-WM achieves negligible impact on task accuracy while surpassing existing watermark techniques in accuracy and robustness against common model edits like pruning, fine-tuning, and quantization.

Conclusion: InvGNN-WM offers a trigger-free, robust, and effective solution for watermarking GNNs, providing imperceptibility guarantees and resistance to removal attacks, including its resilience to certain knowledge distillation methods.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are valuable intellectual property, yet many
watermarks rely on backdoor triggers that break under common model edits and
create ownership ambiguity. We present InvGNN-WM, which ties ownership to a
model's implicit perception of a graph invariant, enabling trigger-free,
black-box verification with negligible task impact. A lightweight head predicts
normalized algebraic connectivity on an owner-private carrier set; a
sign-sensitive decoder outputs bits, and a calibrated threshold controls the
false-positive rate. Across diverse node and graph classification datasets and
backbones, InvGNN-WM matches clean accuracy while yielding higher watermark
accuracy than trigger- and compression-based baselines. It remains strong under
unstructured pruning, fine-tuning, and post-training quantization; plain
knowledge distillation (KD) weakens the mark, while KD with a watermark loss
(KD+WM) restores it. We provide guarantees for imperceptibility and robustness,
and we prove that exact removal is NP-complete.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper explores using large language models (LLMs) as meta-learners for recommending machine learning models and hyperparameters by interpreting dataset metadata.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Model selection and hyperparameter tuning in machine learning are challenging due to reliance on expertise or computationally expensive search methods.

Method: The authors employed two prompting strategies for LLMs: zero-shot mode (using pretrained knowledge alone) and meta-informed mode (leveraging examples of past performance on tasks) to suggest model types and parameters based on dataset metadata.

Result: LLMs effectively recommend models and hyperparameters, performing competitively with minimal effort, especially when utilizing meta-informed prompting.

Conclusion: LLMs demonstrate potential as efficient, general-purpose tools for model selection and hyperparameter optimization, highlighting their capability for in-context meta-learning.

Abstract: Model and hyperparameter selection are critical but challenging in machine
learning, typically requiring expert intuition or expensive automated search.
We investigate whether large language models (LLMs) can act as in-context
meta-learners for this task. By converting each dataset into interpretable
metadata, we prompt an LLM to recommend both model families and
hyperparameters. We study two prompting strategies: (1) a zero-shot mode
relying solely on pretrained knowledge, and (2) a meta-informed mode augmented
with examples of models and their performance on past tasks. Across synthetic
and real-world benchmarks, we show that LLMs can exploit dataset metadata to
recommend competitive models and hyperparameters without search, and that
improvements from meta-informed prompting demonstrate their capacity for
in-context meta-learning. These results highlight a promising new role for LLMs
as lightweight, general-purpose assistants for model selection and
hyperparameter optimization.

TL;DR: This paper proposes Modular Linear Tokenization (MLT) as a reversible and scalable method to encode large categorical identifiers into compact vectors using modular arithmetic and linear transformations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to develop an encoding technique that is reversible, deterministic, computationally efficient, and scalable for high-cardinality categorical identifiers.

Method: The method involves leveraging modular arithmetic over finite fields combined with invertible linear transformations, offering control over dimensions and scalability while maintaining bijective mappings.

Result: Experiments using the MovieLens 20M dataset demonstrate that MLT achieves comparable predictive performance to supervised embeddings, but with reduced parameters and lower training costs.

Conclusion: MLT is an efficient encoding technique for categorical identifiers with significant advantages in parameter efficiency, scalability, and deterministic reversibility. An open-source implementation is made available for use and research.

Abstract: This paper introduces Modular Linear Tokenization (MLT), a reversible and
deterministic technique for encoding high-cardinality categorical identifiers
into compact numerical vectors. Unlike traditional hashing or one-hot
encodings, MLT preserves bijective mappings by leveraging modular arithmetic
over finite fields and invertible linear transformations. The method offers
explicit control of dimensionality and computational scalability while
maintaining full reversibility, even for millions of identifiers. Experimental
results on the MovieLens 20M dataset show that MLT achieves comparable
predictive performance to supervised embeddings while requiring significantly
fewer parameters and lower training cost. An open-source implementation of MLT
is available on PyPI (https://pypi.org/project/light-mlt/) and GitHub

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper explored using Geospatial Foundation Models (GeoFMs) to improve health data predictions in Malawi, showcasing modest accuracy improvements compared to traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the limitations of routine health data in LMICs, such as reporting delays and incomplete coverage, necessitating more robust analytics and data sources.

Method: They evaluated three GeoFM embedding sources (PDFM, AlphaEarth, CDR) using XGBoost models on data from Malawi health catchment areas, comparing their performance against traditional geospatial interpolation.

Result: GeoFM-based methods outperformed traditional methods in 87% of indicators, with a Multi-GeoFM model achieving the best predictive accuracy, though performance was weaker for cases with limited data availability.

Conclusion: GeoFM embeddings offer a valuable supplementary tool for improving health data systems in LMICs, particularly when integrated from diverse sources.

Abstract: The reliability of routine health data in low and middle-income countries
(LMICs) is often constrained by reporting delays and incomplete coverage,
necessitating the exploration of novel data sources and analytics. Geospatial
Foundation Models (GeoFMs) offer a promising avenue by synthesizing diverse
spatial, temporal, and behavioral data into mathematical embeddings that can be
efficiently used for downstream prediction tasks. This study evaluated the
predictive performance of three GeoFM embedding sources - Google Population
Dynamics Foundation Model (PDFM), Google AlphaEarth (derived from satellite
imagery), and mobile phone call detail records (CDR) - for modeling 15 routine
health programmatic outputs in Malawi, and compared their utility to
traditional geospatial interpolation methods. We used XGBoost models on data
from 552 health catchment areas (January 2021-May 2023), assessing performance
with R2, and using an 80/20 training and test data split with 5-fold
cross-validation used in training. While predictive performance was mixed, the
embedding-based approaches improved upon baseline geostatistical methods in 13
of 15 (87%) indicators tested. A Multi-GeoFM model integrating all three
embedding sources produced the most robust predictions, achieving average
5-fold cross validated R2 values for indicators like population density (0.63),
new HIV cases (0.57), and child vaccinations (0.47) and test set R2 of 0.64,
0.68, and 0.55, respectively. Prediction was poor for prediction targets with
low primary data availability, such as TB and malnutrition cases. These results
demonstrate that GeoFM embeddings imbue a modest predictive improvement for
select health and demographic outcomes in an LMIC context. We conclude that the
integration of multiple GeoFM sources is an efficient and valuable tool for
supplementing and strengthening constrained routine health information systems.

### [207] [On Measuring Localization of Shortcuts in Deep Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26560)
*Nikita Tsoy,Nikola Konstantinov*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper investigates how shortcuts are distributed across neural network layers, revealing they are not limited to specific layers but are distributed throughout, affecting predictive features differently.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to understand how shortcuts in deep networks impact feature representations, addressing the gap in research for designing effective shortcut-mitigation methods.

Method: The study utilizes a novel experimental design that quantifies layer-wise contributions by counterfactual training using clean and skewed datasets on various models and datasets.

Result: Shortcut learning is distributed across the network, with shallow layers encoding spurious features and deeper layers forgetting predictive core features. Differences in shortcut localization are analyzed.

Conclusion: Designing general shortcut-mitigation strategies is challenging, suggesting a need for dataset- and architecture-specific methods.

Abstract: Shortcuts, spurious rules that perform well during training but fail to
generalize, present a major challenge to the reliability of deep networks
(Geirhos et al., 2020). However, the impact of shortcuts on feature
representations remains understudied, obstructing the design of principled
shortcut-mitigation methods. To overcome this limitation, we investigate the
layer-wise localization of shortcuts in deep models. Our novel experiment
design quantifies the layer-wise contribution to accuracy degradation caused by
a shortcut-inducing skew by counterfactual training on clean and skewed
datasets. We employ our design to study shortcuts on CIFAR-10, Waterbirds, and
CelebA datasets across VGG, ResNet, DeiT, and ConvNeXt architectures. We find
that shortcut learning is not localized in specific layers but distributed
throughout the network. Different network parts play different roles in this
process: shallow layers predominantly encode spurious features, while deeper
layers predominantly forget core features that are predictive on clean data. We
also analyze the differences in localization and describe its principal axes of
variation. Finally, our analysis of layer-wise shortcut-mitigation strategies
suggests the hardness of designing general methods, supporting dataset- and
architecture-specific approaches instead.

*Alvaro Velasquez,Susmit Jha,Ismail R. Alkhouri*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper surveys neural network methods for optimization in data-free settings, focusing on reparameterizing problems using diverse architectures like MLPs, convolutional networks, and graph neural networks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation stems from the lack of strong results from traditional data-driven learning methods in many fields and the inherent limitations of training data availability in areas like medical image reconstruction.

Method: The paper categorizes the dataless setting into architecture-agnostic and architecture-specific methods while analyzing how optimization problems are mapped onto neural networks.

Result: The paper reviews how neural networks have achieved promising results in dataless applications such as combinatorial optimization and scientific problems.

Conclusion: Dataless neural networks represent a potent approach for optimization, with connections to zero-shot learning, one-shot learning, and over-parameterization, offering solutions to problems where training data are scarce.

Abstract: This paper surveys studies on the use of neural networks for optimization in
the training-data-free setting. Specifically, we examine the dataless
application of neural network architectures in optimization by
re-parameterizing problems using fully connected (or MLP), convolutional,
graph, and quadratic neural networks. Although MLPs have been used to solve
linear programs a few decades ago, this approach has recently gained increasing
attention due to its promising results across diverse applications, including
those based on combinatorial optimization, inverse problems, and partial
differential equations. The motivation for this setting stems from two key
(possibly over-lapping) factors: (i) data-driven learning approaches are still
underdeveloped and have yet to demonstrate strong results, as seen in
combinatorial optimization, and (ii) the availability of training data is
inherently limited, such as in medical image reconstruction and other
scientific applications. In this paper, we define the dataless setting and
categorize it into two variants based on how a problem instance -- defined by a
single datum -- is encoded onto the neural network: (i) architecture-agnostic
methods and (ii) architecture-specific methods. Additionally, we discuss
similarities and clarify distinctions between the dataless neural network (dNN)
settings and related concepts such as zero-shot learning, one-shot learning,
lifting in optimization, and over-parameterization.

*Giulia DeSalvo,Clara Mohri,Mehryar Mohri,Yutao Zhong*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces the budgeted deferral framework, which minimizes the cost of querying experts during training while maintaining predictive accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard training procedures for deferral algorithms require querying all experts during training, which is costly and inefficient when expert queries are resource-intensive. The core goal of deferral to limit unnecessary expert usage is undermined.

Method: The authors propose new algorithms for both two-stage and single-stage multiple-expert deferral settings that selectively query a subset of experts per training example. They also provide theoretical guarantees and analyses of these algorithms.

Result: The proposed algorithms significantly reduce training costs without sacrificing predictive accuracy. This is demonstrated through empirical results across multiple domains.

Conclusion: The budgeted deferral framework is a practical solution to train deferral algorithms efficiently, balancing cost and performance.

Abstract: Learning to defer uncertain predictions to costly experts offers a powerful
strategy for improving the accuracy and efficiency of machine learning systems.
However, standard training procedures for deferral algorithms typically require
querying all experts for every training instance, an approach that becomes
prohibitively expensive when expert queries incur significant computational or
resource costs. This undermines the core goal of deferral: to limit unnecessary
expert usage. To overcome this challenge, we introduce the budgeted deferral
framework, which aims to train effective deferral algorithms while minimizing
expert query costs during training. We propose new algorithms for both
two-stage and single-stage multiple-expert deferral settings that selectively
query only a subset of experts per training example. While inspired by active
learning, our setting is fundamentally different: labels are already known, and
the core challenge is to decide which experts to query in order to balance cost
and predictive performance. We establish theoretical guarantees for both of our
algorithms, including generalization bounds and label complexity analyses.
Empirical results across several domains show that our algorithms substantially
reduce training costs without sacrificing prediction accuracy, demonstrating
the practical value of our budget-aware deferral algorithms.

### [210] [Deep sequence models tend to memorize geometrically; it is unclear why](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26745)
*Shahriar Noroozizadeh,Vaishnavh Nagarajan,Elan Rosenfeld,Sanjiv Kumar*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a geometric approach to sequence modeling, suggesting that Transformers synthesize their own geometry of relationships, rather than just relying on local co-occurrences. It explores the properties of neural embedding geometries and argues that the rise of geometric structures is not due to traditional optimization pressures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation of this paper is to challenge the conventional associative view of memory in sequence modeling and provide insights into how geometric properties emerge in neural embedding spaces, influencing reasoning tasks and memory representation.

Method: The authors isolate and analyze a specific scenario of Transformer reasoning that demands the synthesis of global entity relationships. They explore connections with Node2Vec and use spectral bias analysis to understand the emergence of geometric structures.

Result: The paper reveals that Transformers can develop elegant geometric representations of relationships between entities, including non-co-occurring ones, simplifying complex reasoning tasks into simpler ones. It suggests that geometric structures arise naturally without requiring traditional optimization pressures.

Conclusion: The study highlights the potential of the geometric view of memory representation in Transformers, with implications for knowledge acquisition, reasoning, and design improvements for geometric memory structures. This perspective challenges existing norms and suggests unexplored opportunities for practitioners.

Abstract: In sequence modeling, the parametric memory of atomic facts has been
predominantly abstracted as a brute-force lookup of co-occurrences between
entities. We contrast this associative view against a geometric view of how
memory is stored. We begin by isolating a clean and analyzable instance of
Transformer reasoning that is incompatible with memory as strictly a storage of
the local co-occurrences specified during training. Instead, the model must
have somehow synthesized its own geometry of atomic facts, encoding global
relationships between all entities, including non-co-occurring ones. This in
turn has simplified a hard reasoning task involving an $\ell$-fold composition
into an easy-to-learn 1-step geometric task.
  From this phenomenon, we extract fundamental aspects of neural embedding
geometries that are hard to explain. We argue that the rise of such a geometry,
despite optimizing over mere local associations, cannot be straightforwardly
attributed to typical architectural or optimizational pressures.
Counterintuitively, an elegant geometry is learned even when it is not more
succinct than a brute-force lookup of associations.
  Then, by analyzing a connection to Node2Vec, we demonstrate how the geometry
stems from a spectral bias that -- in contrast to prevailing theories -- indeed
arises naturally despite the lack of various pressures. This analysis also
points to practitioners a visible headroom to make Transformer memory more
strongly geometric. We hope the geometric view of parametric memory encourages
revisiting the default intuitions that guide researchers in areas like
knowledge acquisition, capacity, discovery and unlearning.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces DiffOpt.jl, a framework that integrates modeling and differentiation for constrained optimization in Julia. It simplifies sensitivity analysis and facilitates smoother integration into learning and decision-making systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Differentiation through constrained optimization is key to learning, control, and decision-making systems, but practical implementation is hindered by solver and interface incompatibilities.

Method: DiffOpt.jl computes sensitivities using differentiation of the KKT system under regularity assumptions, and provides a user-friendly API for parameter-based differentiation within Julia's optimization stack.

Result: The framework showcases effective differentiation capabilities in various optimization tasks and demonstrates scalability in large-scale applications like energy markets and training proxies.

Conclusion: DiffOpt.jl allows differentiable optimization to be easily used for experimentation, design, and learning, maintaining compatibility with Julia's standard modeling practices and solvers.

Abstract: Differentiating through constrained optimization problems is increasingly
central to learning, control, and large-scale decision-making systems, yet
practical integration remains challenging due to solver specialization and
interface mismatches. This paper presents a general and streamlined
framework-an updated DiffOpt.jl-that unifies modeling and differentiation
within the Julia optimization stack. The framework computes forward - and
reverse-mode solution and objective sensitivities for smooth, potentially
nonconvex programs by differentiating the KKT system under standard regularity
assumptions. A first-class, JuMP-native parameter-centric API allows users to
declare named parameters and obtain derivatives directly with respect to them -
even when a parameter appears in multiple constraints and objectives -
eliminating brittle bookkeeping from coefficient-level interfaces. We
illustrate these capabilities on convex and nonconvex models, including
economic dispatch, mean-variance portfolio selection with conic risk
constraints, and nonlinear robot inverse kinematics. Two companion studies
further demonstrate impact at scale: gradient-based iterative methods for
strategic bidding in energy markets and Sobolev-style training of end-to-end
optimization proxies using solver-accurate sensitivities. Together, these
results demonstrate that differentiable optimization can be deployed as a
routine tool for experimentation, learning, calibration, and design-without
deviating from standard JuMP modeling practices and while retaining access to a
broad ecosystem of solvers.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces INFEX, a framework for infrequent exploration in linear bandits, offering efficient performance and computational improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges in balancing exploration and exploitation for linear bandits, especially in domains where continuous exploration is impractical or unethical and where greedy strategies may fail due to a lack of contextual diversity.

Method: Developed the INFEX framework, which integrates a base exploratory policy executed at specified intervals, combined with predominantly greedy actions between explorations. Offers modularity to incorporate various adaptive exploration methods.

Result: INFEX matches the theoretical performance of efficient algorithms with a logarithmic exploration frequency while improving computational efficiency. Empirical evaluations show state-of-the-art regret performance and runtime improvements.

Conclusion: INFEX effectively bridges the gap between frequent exploration and purely greedy approaches, providing a practical and efficient solution for infrequent exploration in linear bandits.

Abstract: We study the problem of infrequent exploration in linear bandits, addressing
a significant yet overlooked gap between fully adaptive exploratory methods
(e.g., UCB and Thompson Sampling), which explore potentially at every time
step, and purely greedy approaches, which require stringent diversity
assumptions to succeed. Continuous exploration can be impractical or unethical
in safety-critical or costly domains, while purely greedy strategies typically
fail without adequate contextual diversity. To bridge these extremes, we
introduce a simple and practical framework, INFEX, explicitly designed for
infrequent exploration. INFEX executes a base exploratory policy according to a
given schedule while predominantly choosing greedy actions in between. Despite
its simplicity, our theoretical analysis demonstrates that INFEX achieves
instance-dependent regret matching standard provably efficient algorithms,
provided the exploration frequency exceeds a logarithmic threshold.
Additionally, INFEX is a general, modular framework that allows seamless
integration of any fully adaptive exploration method, enabling wide
applicability and ease of adoption. By restricting intensive exploratory
computations to infrequent intervals, our approach can also enhance
computational efficiency. Empirical evaluations confirm our theoretical
findings, showing state-of-the-art regret performance and runtime improvements
over existing methods.

TL;DR: This paper introduces a dual mixture-of-experts (MoE) framework for discrete-time survival analysis, which improves prediction accuracy of patient outcomes over existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of modeling patient heterogeneity and adapting risk predictions to individual features and temporal dynamics in survival analysis.

Method: The paper proposes a dual MoE framework with a feature-encoder MoE for subgroup-aware representation learning and a hazard MoE that utilizes patient features and time embeddings to capture temporal dynamics.

Result: On METABRIC and GBSG breast cancer datasets, the dual MoE approach boosts the time-dependent C-index up to 0.04 on test sets and improves performance within the Consurv framework.

Conclusion: The dual MoE framework successfully enhances survival analysis by addressing heterogeneity and temporal adaptation, achieving consistent performance improvements.

Abstract: Survival analysis is a task to model the time until an event of interest
occurs, widely used in clinical and biomedical research. A key challenge is to
model patient heterogeneity while also adapting risk predictions to both
individual characteristics and temporal dynamics. We propose a dual
mixture-of-experts (MoE) framework for discrete-time survival analysis. Our
approach combines a feature-encoder MoE for subgroup-aware representation
learning with a hazard MoE that leverages patient features and time embeddings
to capture temporal dynamics. This dual-MoE design flexibly integrates with
existing deep learning based survival pipelines. On METABRIC and GBSG breast
cancer datasets, our method consistently improves performance, boosting the
time-dependent C-index up to 0.04 on the test sets, and yields further gains
when incorporated into the Consurv framework.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper investigates whether AI systems truly grasp human concepts or simply mimic patterns, using chess as a test case.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand whether AI systems genuinely comprehend human concepts or merely rely on surface-level memorization and patterns.

Method: Analyzed a 270M-parameter transformer with grandmaster-level play, introduced a Chess960 dataset, and conducted layer-wise analysis of AI's concept recognition in randomized chess starting positions.

Result: It was found that while early layers of the AI encoded human-like concepts, deeper layers developed alien representations. Additionally, the model's performance dropped when tested outside standard chess patterns, indicating reliance on memorization rather than abstract understanding.

Conclusion: AI optimizations for performance lead to alien representations that pose challenges for human-AI collaboration in creative fields.

Abstract: Do AI systems truly understand human concepts or merely mimic surface
patterns? We investigate this through chess, where human creativity meets
precise strategic concepts. Analyzing a 270M-parameter transformer that
achieves grandmaster-level play, we uncover a striking paradox: while early
layers encode human concepts like center control and knight outposts with up to
85\% accuracy, deeper layers, despite driving superior performance, drift
toward alien representations, dropping to 50-65\% accuracy. To test conceptual
robustness beyond memorization, we introduce the first Chess960 dataset: 240
expert-annotated positions across 6 strategic concepts. When opening theory is
eliminated through randomized starting positions, concept recognition drops
10-20\% across all methods, revealing the model's reliance on memorized
patterns rather than abstract understanding. Our layer-wise analysis exposes a
fundamental tension in current architectures: the representations that win
games diverge from those that align with human thinking. These findings suggest
that as AI systems optimize for performance, they develop increasingly alien
intelligence, a critical challenge for creative AI applications requiring

### [215] [Do Students Debias Like Teachers? On the Distillability of Bias Mitigation Methods](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26038)
*Jiali Cheng,Chirag Agarwal,Hadi Amiri*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper investigates the effects of knowledge distillation (KD) on debiasing capabilities in models for NLI and image classification, revealing challenges and proposing methods to improve distillability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Explores the underexamined impact of knowledge distillation on model robustness against spurious correlations and out-of-distribution data performance, particularly focusing on debiasing capabilities.

Method: Conducts extensive experiments on NLI and image classification tasks to evaluate KD's impact on debiasing, and identifies specific internal mechanisms affecting model behavior post-KD.

Result: Key findings include: debiasing capability is diminished after KD, training a debiased model gains little from injected teacher knowledge, robustness variations occur across biases, and internal attention patterns cause distinct post-KD behavior.

Conclusion: Proposes effective strategies to enhance debiasing methods' distillability: using high-quality augmentation data, iterative knowledge distillation, and initializing student models with teacher weights, offering insights into KD's impact on debiasing.

Abstract: Knowledge distillation (KD) is an effective method for model compression and
transferring knowledge between models. However, its effect on model's
robustness against spurious correlations that degrade performance on
out-of-distribution data remains underexplored. This study investigates the
effect of knowledge distillation on the transferability of ``debiasing''
capabilities from teacher models to student models on natural language
inference (NLI) and image classification tasks. Through extensive experiments,
we illustrate several key findings: (i) overall the debiasing capability of a
model is undermined post-KD; (ii) training a debiased model does not benefit
from injecting teacher knowledge; (iii) although the overall robustness of a
model may remain stable post-distillation, significant variations can occur
across different types of biases; and (iv) we pin-point the internal attention
pattern and circuit that causes the distinct behavior post-KD. Given the above
findings, we propose three effective solutions to improve the distillability of
debiasing methods: developing high quality data for augmentation, implementing
iterative knowledge distillation, and initializing student models with weights
obtained from teacher models. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first
study on the effect of KD on debiasing and its interenal mechanism at scale.
Our findings provide understandings on how KD works and how to design better
debiasing methods.

### [216] [Towards Scaling Laws for Symbolic Regression](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26064)
*David Otte,Jörg K. H. Franke,Frank Hutter*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The research investigates scaling in symbolic regression (SR) using a scalable transformer pipeline and discovered predictable power-law trends in performance and compute.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the largely unexplored role of scale in deep learning-based SR and to improve scientific insight and model interpretability for observed data.

Method: Developed a transformer-based SR approach, systematically tested across varying model sizes, compute levels, and hyperparameters using generated data.

Result: Validation loss and solution success rate followed predictable patterns; optimal hyperparameter scaling was identified, including batch size, learning rate, and token-to-parameter ratio.

Conclusion: SR performance is predictable with compute, and insights from this work can guide the development of more effective SR models in the future.

Abstract: Symbolic regression (SR) aims to discover the underlying mathematical
expressions that explain observed data. This holds promise for both gaining
scientific insight and for producing inherently interpretable and generalizable
models for tabular data. In this work we focus on the basics of SR. Deep
learning-based SR has recently become competitive with genetic programming
approaches, but the role of scale has remained largely unexplored. Inspired by
scaling laws in language modeling, we present the first systematic
investigation of scaling in SR, using a scalable end-to-end transformer
pipeline and carefully generated training data. Across five different model
sizes and spanning three orders of magnitude in compute, we find that both
validation loss and solved rate follow clear power-law trends with compute. We
further identify compute-optimal hyperparameter scaling: optimal batch size and
learning rate grow with model size, and a token-to-parameter ratio of
$\approx$15 is optimal in our regime, with a slight upward trend as compute
increases. These results demonstrate that SR performance is largely predictable
from compute and offer important insights for training the next generation of
SR models.

### [217] [Learning Geometry: A Framework for Building Adaptive Manifold Models through Metric Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26068)
*Di Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a machine learning paradigm where models are treated as flexible geometric entities optimized through a variational framework. It employs discrete differential geometry for practical implementation and provides theoretical alignment with concepts from general relativity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The key motivation is to go beyond traditional optimization of fixed model parameters by enabling models to evolve their geometric structure dynamically, thereby improving their expressiveness and preventing overfitting.

Method: The authors develop a variational framework optimizing a metric tensor field on a manifold shaped as a triangular mesh. Computational efficiency is achieved through parameterizing edge lengths and using automatic differentiation.

Result: The method offers a novel approach where geometry is coupled with data and regularized effectively, yielding models that are both simple and expressive. Theoretical insights connect the framework to principles in general relativity.

Conclusion: This paradigm showcases potential for creating dynamic meta-learners capable of autonomously modifying their geometry and topology, with applications in areas like scientific discovery and robust learning.

Abstract: This paper proposes a novel paradigm for machine learning that moves beyond
traditional parameter optimization. Unlike conventional approaches that search
for optimal parameters within a fixed geometric space, our core idea is to
treat the model itself as a malleable geometric entity. Specifically, we
optimize the metric tensor field on a manifold with a predefined topology,
thereby dynamically shaping the geometric structure of the model space. To
achieve this, we construct a variational framework whose loss function
carefully balances data fidelity against the intrinsic geometric complexity of
the manifold. The former ensures the model effectively explains observed data,
while the latter acts as a regularizer, penalizing overly curved or irregular
geometries to encourage simpler models and prevent overfitting. To address the
computational challenges of this infinite-dimensional optimization problem, we
introduce a practical method based on discrete differential geometry: the
continuous manifold is discretized into a triangular mesh, and the metric
tensor is parameterized by edge lengths, enabling efficient optimization using
automatic differentiation tools. Theoretical analysis reveals a profound
analogy between our framework and the Einstein-Hilbert action in general
relativity, providing an elegant physical interpretation for the concept of
"data-driven geometry". We further argue that even with fixed topology, metric
optimization offers significantly greater expressive power than models with
fixed geometry. This work lays a solid foundation for constructing fully
dynamic "meta-learners" capable of autonomously evolving their geometry and
topology, and it points to broad application prospects in areas such as
scientific model discovery and robust representation learning.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper reviews 72 studies on synthetic financial data generation, focusing on generative models like GANs and VAEs. Challenges, gaps, and future directions are discussed.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the challenge of maintaining privacy and adhering to regulatory constraints while using sensitive financial data in machine learning applications.

Method: The paper systematically reviews 72 studies since 2018, categorizing methods, evaluating data utility, privacy, and analyzing generative techniques used, particularly GANs and VAEs.

Result: GAN-based approaches dominate the field, especially in generating time-series and tabular financial data, with innovations in realism and privacy. However, there is a lack of rigorous privacy evaluations.

Conclusion: The review highlights significant research gaps and provides guidance for developing robust, privacy-aware synthetic data models for financial applications.

Abstract: Synthetic data generation has emerged as a promising approach to address the
challenges of using sensitive financial data in machine learning applications.
By leveraging generative models, such as Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)
and Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), it is possible to create artificial
datasets that preserve the statistical properties of real financial records
while mitigating privacy risks and regulatory constraints. Despite the rapid
growth of this field, a comprehensive synthesis of the current research
landscape has been lacking. This systematic review consolidates and analyses 72
studies published since 2018 that focus on synthetic financial data generation.
We categorise the types of financial information synthesised, the generative
methods employed, and the evaluation strategies used to assess data utility and
privacy. The findings indicate that GAN-based approaches dominate the
literature, particularly for generating time-series market data and tabular
credit data. While several innovative techniques demonstrate potential for
improved realism and privacy preservation, there remains a notable lack of
rigorous evaluation of privacy safeguards across studies. By providing an
integrated overview of generative techniques, applications, and evaluation
methods, this review highlights critical research gaps and offers guidance for
future work aimed at developing robust, privacy-preserving synthetic data
solutions for the financial domain.

*Yuhua Jiang,Shuang Cheng,Yihao Liu,Ermo Hua,Che Jiang,Weigao Sun,Yu Cheng,Feifei Gao,Biqing Qi,Bowen Zhou*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Nirvana, a Specialized Generalist Model (SGM) with enhanced task-specific memory mechanisms for general language and medical tasks, achieving superior performance and adaptability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the lack of a task-specific memory mechanism in existing Large Language Model (LLM) architectures, especially for achieving expert-level performance in specialized domains while maintaining general capabilities.

Method: The authors present Nirvana, a model with a Specialized Memory Mechanism and two key innovations: Task-Aware Memory Trigger for self-supervised task adaptation and Specialized Memory Updater for dynamic memory modification guided by the Trigger.

Result: The proposed Nirvana model achieves competitive or superior results in general language modeling tasks and demonstrates superior performance in specialized medical tasks like MRI reconstruction, outperforming traditional models and other LLM-based backbones.

Conclusion: Nirvana effectively combines broad generalist capabilities with domain-specific expertise using its novel memory mechanism, offering robust performance across diverse benchmarks, and proving its adaptability even in specialized domains like medical imaging.

Abstract: Specialized Generalist Models (SGMs) aim to preserve broad capabilities while
achieving expert-level performance in target domains. However, traditional LLM
structures including Transformer, Linear Attention, and hybrid models do not
employ specialized memory mechanism guided by task information. In this paper,
we present Nirvana, an SGM with specialized memory mechanism, linear time
complexity, and test-time task information extraction. Besides, we propose the
Task-Aware Memory Trigger ($\textit{Trigger}$) that flexibly adjusts memory
mechanism based on the current task's requirements. In Trigger, each incoming
sample is treated as a self-supervised fine-tuning task, enabling Nirvana to
adapt its task-related parameters on the fly to domain shifts. We also design
the Specialized Memory Updater ($\textit{Updater}$) that dynamically memorizes
the context guided by Trigger. We conduct experiments on both general language
tasks and specialized medical tasks. On a variety of natural language modeling
benchmarks, Nirvana achieves competitive or superior results compared to the
existing LLM structures. To prove the effectiveness of Trigger on specialized
tasks, we test Nirvana's performance on a challenging medical task, i.e.,
Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). We post-train frozen Nirvana backbone with
lightweight codecs on paired electromagnetic signals and MRI images. Despite
the frozen Nirvana backbone, Trigger guides the model to adapt to the MRI
domain with the change of task-related parameters. Nirvana achieves
higher-quality MRI reconstruction compared to conventional MRI models as well
as the models with traditional LLMs' backbone, and can also generate accurate
preliminary clinical reports accordingly.

### [220] [LLMBisect: Breaking Barriers in Bug Bisection with A Comparative Analysis Pipeline](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26086)
*Zheng Zhang,Haonan Li,Xingyu Li,Hang Zhang,Zhiyun Qian*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper presents a novel multi-stage pipeline leveraging LLMs to improve bug bisection accuracy, addressing limitations in traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional bug bisection methods face critical barriers, such as reliance on function-level changes, lack of logical vulnerability analysis, and underutilization of textual patch and commit data.

Method: The paper introduces a multi-stage pipeline utilizing LLMs for bug bisection, focusing on patch information, contextual candidate comparison, and iterative down-selection.

Result: The proposed method improved bug bisection accuracy by over 38% compared to state-of-the-art methods and by 60% against a baseline LLM-based method.

Conclusion: Leveraging LLMs in a multi-step pipeline effectively addresses issues in traditional bug bisection approaches, showcasing their potential in security-related tasks.

Abstract: Bug bisection has been an important security task that aims to understand the
range of software versions impacted by a bug, i.e., identifying the commit that
introduced the bug. However, traditional patch-based bisection methods are
faced with several significant barriers: For example, they assume that the
bug-inducing commit (BIC) and the patch commit modify the same functions, which
is not always true. They often rely solely on code changes, while the commit
message frequently contains a wealth of vulnerability-related information. They
are also based on simple heuristics (e.g., assuming the BIC initializes lines
deleted in the patch) and lack any logical analysis of the vulnerability.
  In this paper, we make the observation that Large Language Models (LLMs) are
well-positioned to break the barriers of existing solutions, e.g., comprehend
both textual data and code in patches and commits. Unlike previous BIC
identification approaches, which yield poor results, we propose a comprehensive
multi-stage pipeline that leverages LLMs to: (1) fully utilize patch
information, (2) compare multiple candidate commits in context, and (3)
progressively narrow down the candidates through a series of down-selection
steps. In our evaluation, we demonstrate that our approach achieves
significantly better accuracy than the state-of-the-art solution by more than
38\%. Our results further confirm that the comprehensive multi-stage pipeline
is essential, as it improves accuracy by 60\% over a baseline LLM-based
bisection method.

### [221] [Network-Constrained Policy Optimization for Adaptive Multi-agent Vehicle Routing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26089)
*Fazel Arasteh,Arian Haghparast,Manos Papagelis*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces improved routing methods using multi-agent reinforcement learning to tackle traffic congestion, outperforming traditional algorithms in dynamic urban networks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address traffic congestion and inefficiencies caused by routing methods that lead to longer trip times and emissions, especially during peak periods.

Method: The paper proposes Adaptive Navigation (AN), which uses decentralized MARL with Graph Attention Networks, and its scalable extension, Hierarchical Hub-based Adaptive Navigation (HHAN), with a CTDE framework for proactive hub-to-hub routing.

Result: Experimental results show that AN reduces travel times compared to traditional algorithms like SPF, with HHAN scaling efficiently to large networks and improving traffic flow by up to 15.9% under heavy traffic.

Conclusion: Network-constrained MARL techniques such as AN and HHAN demonstrate significant promise for scalable and intelligent congestion-aware transportation systems.

Abstract: Traffic congestion in urban road networks leads to longer trip times and
higher emissions, especially during peak periods. While the Shortest Path First
(SPF) algorithm is optimal for a single vehicle in a static network, it
performs poorly in dynamic, multi-vehicle settings, often worsening congestion
by routing all vehicles along identical paths. We address dynamic vehicle
routing through a multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) framework for
coordinated, network-aware fleet navigation. We first propose Adaptive
Navigation (AN), a decentralized MARL model where each intersection agent
provides routing guidance based on (i) local traffic and (ii) neighborhood
state modeled using Graph Attention Networks (GAT). To improve scalability in
large networks, we further propose Hierarchical Hub-based Adaptive Navigation
(HHAN), an extension of AN that assigns agents only to key intersections
(hubs). Vehicles are routed hub-to-hub under agent control, while SPF handles
micro-routing within each hub region. For hub coordination, HHAN adopts
centralized training with decentralized execution (CTDE) under the Attentive
Q-Mixing (A-QMIX) framework, which aggregates asynchronous vehicle decisions
via attention. Hub agents use flow-aware state features that combine local
congestion and predictive dynamics for proactive routing. Experiments on
synthetic grids and real urban maps (Toronto, Manhattan) show that AN reduces
average travel time versus SPF and learning baselines, maintaining 100% routing
success. HHAN scales to networks with hundreds of intersections, achieving up
to 15.9% improvement under heavy traffic. These findings highlight the
potential of network-constrained MARL for scalable, coordinated, and
congestion-aware routing in intelligent transportation systems.

### [222] [SAFE: A Novel Approach to AI Weather Evaluation through Stratified Assessments of Forecasts over Earth](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26099)
*Nick Masi,Randall Balestriero*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SAFE introduces a method for stratified performance analysis of Earth-based predictions, addressing disparities in AI-based weather forecasting models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to overcome limitations of assessing model performance based on average loss, which neglects geospatial disparities in human development and geography.

Method: SAFE stratifies forecast performance by various attributes, such as territory, income, and landcover, allowing detailed performance evaluation beyond global averages.

Result: The analysis using SAFE revealed performance disparities in state-of-the-art weather prediction models across various attributes and developed a benchmark for forecast fairness.

Conclusion: SAFE provides a novel framework for understanding geospatial disparities in model performance, supporting fairness evaluation and encouraging improved AI-based forecasting.

Abstract: The dominant paradigm in machine learning is to assess model performance
based on average loss across all samples in some test set. This amounts to
averaging performance geospatially across the Earth in weather and climate
settings, failing to account for the non-uniform distribution of human
development and geography. We introduce Stratified Assessments of Forecasts
over Earth (SAFE), a package for elucidating the stratified performance of a
set of predictions made over Earth. SAFE integrates various data domains to
stratify by different attributes associated with geospatial gridpoints:
territory (usually country), global subregion, income, and landcover (land or
water). This allows us to examine the performance of models for each individual
stratum of the different attributes (e.g., the accuracy in every individual
country). To demonstrate its importance, we utilize SAFE to benchmark a zoo of
state-of-the-art AI-based weather prediction models, finding that they all
exhibit disparities in forecasting skill across every attribute. We use this to
seed a benchmark of model forecast fairness through stratification at different
lead times for various climatic variables. By moving beyond globally-averaged
metrics, we for the first time ask: where do models perform best or worst, and
which models are most fair? To support further work in this direction, the SAFE
package is open source and available at https://github.com/N-Masi/safe

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CorVS is a novel method that uses deep learning to identify individuals at industrial sites by linking visual tracking data with wearable sensor measurements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a person identification method capable of overcoming real-world challenges in industrial sites by efficiently utilizing data from cameras and wearable sensors.

Method: Propose CorVS, a two-step approach where a deep learning model predicts correspondence between visual tracking trajectories and wearable sensor data, followed by an algorithm that matches them over time.

Result: CorVS demonstrated its effectiveness using a dataset of real-world warehouse operations.

Conclusion: CorVS is shown to be a promising person identification technique that combines sensor data and visual information, proving its applicability in industrial settings.

Abstract: Worker location data is key to higher productivity in industrial sites.
Cameras are a promising tool for localization in logistics warehouses since
they also offer valuable environmental contexts such as package status.
However, identifying individuals with only visual data is often impractical.
Accordingly, several prior studies identified people in videos by comparing
their trajectories and wearable sensor measurements. While this approach has
advantages such as independence from appearance, the existing methods may break
down under real-world conditions. To overcome this challenge, we propose CorVS,
a novel data-driven person identification method based on correspondence
between visual tracking trajectories and sensor measurements. Firstly, our deep
learning model predicts correspondence probabilities and reliabilities for
every pair of a trajectory and sensor measurements. Secondly, our algorithm
matches the trajectories and sensor measurements over time using the predicted
probabilities and reliabilities. We developed a dataset with actual warehouse
operations and demonstrated the method's effectiveness for real-world
applications.

*Chenming Tang,Hsiu-Yuan Huang,Weijie Liu,Saiyong Yang,Yunfang Wu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces LTE (Learning to reason from Trial and Error), a novel reinforcement learning method for large language models (LLMs) that addresses exploration stagnation by reusing their incorrect previous responses, resulting in marked performance improvements on mathematical benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current RLVR methods are limited by their reliance on the initial capability of LLMs and self-generated responses, leading to exploration stagnation. Existing solutions that involve off-policy methods depend on external expert guidance, which is often scarce.

Method: The authors propose LTE, a framework that uses LLMs' previously incorrect answers and overly long responses as learning hints in training without external expert guidance. This approach aims to enhance both exploration and exploitation during training.

Result: Experiments demonstrate that LTE improves performance in mathematical tasks, showing a Pass@1 improvement of 6.38 and Pass@k improvement of 9.00 on average over six mathematical benchmarks with the Qwen3-4B-Base model.

Conclusion: LTE effectively combats exploration stagnation in LLMs while improving reasoning capabilities without external guidance, outperforming standard methods in mathematical benchmarks.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) has significantly
boosted the reasoning capability of large language models (LLMs) recently.
However, existing RLVR approaches merely train LLMs based on their own
generated responses and are constrained by the initial capability of LLMs, thus
prone to exploration stagnation, in which LLMs fail to solve more training
problems and cannot further learn from the training data. Some work tries to
address this by leveraging off-policy solutions to training problems but
requires external guidance from experts which suffers from limited
availability. In this work, we propose LTE (Learning to reason from Trial and
Error), an approach hinting LLMs with their previously self-generated incorrect
answers and problem of overlong responses, which does not require any external
expert guidance. Experiments validate the effectiveness of LTE, which
outperforms the normal group relative policy optimization (GRPO) by 6.38 in
Pass@1 and 9.00 in Pass@k on average across six mathematics benchmarks for
Qwen3-4B-Base. Further analysis confirms that LTE successfully mitigates the
problem of exploration stagnation and enhances both exploitation and
exploration during training.

TL;DR: The paper presents maxVSTAR, a vision-guided model adaptation framework to enhance human activity recognition (HAR) using WiFi CSI in changing IoT environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study addresses the issue of domain shift, which hinders the deployment of CSI-based HAR systems on edge devices due to changes in environmental and hardware conditions.

Method: The paper introduces maxVSTAR, a system combining a YOLO-based vision model and a lightweight CSI-based HAR model (STAR). The vision model provides real-time activity labels to fine-tune STAR dynamically and enable autonomous adaptation without manual intervention.

Result: The experiments showed that maxVSTAR significantly improved the recognition accuracy of the baseline STAR model—recovering accuracy from 49.14% to 81.51% after one adaptation cycle.

Conclusion: maxVSTAR effectively mitigates domain shift in CSI-based HAR systems, enabling dynamic, privacy-preserving, and self-supervised adaptation in IoT edge environments.

Abstract: WiFi Channel State Information (CSI)-based human activity recognition (HAR)
provides a privacy-preserving, device-free sensing solution for smart
environments. However, its deployment on edge devices is severely constrained
by domain shift, where recognition performance deteriorates under varying
environmental and hardware conditions. This study presents maxVSTAR (maximally
adaptive Vision-guided Sensing Technology for Activity Recognition), a
closed-loop, vision-guided model adaptation framework that autonomously
mitigates domain shift for edge-deployed CSI sensing systems. The proposed
system integrates a cross-modal teacher-student architecture, where a
high-accuracy YOLO-based vision model serves as a dynamic supervisory signal,
delivering real-time activity labels for the CSI data stream. These labels
enable autonomous, online fine-tuning of a lightweight CSI-based HAR model,
termed Sensing Technology for Activity Recognition (STAR), directly at the
edge. This closed-loop retraining mechanism allows STAR to continuously adapt
to environmental changes without manual intervention. Extensive experiments
demonstrate the effectiveness of maxVSTAR. When deployed on uncalibrated
hardware, the baseline STAR model's recognition accuracy declined from 93.52%
to 49.14%. Following a single vision-guided adaptation cycle, maxVSTAR restored
the accuracy to 81.51%. These results confirm the system's capacity for
dynamic, self-supervised model adaptation in privacy-conscious IoT
environments, establishing a scalable and practical paradigm for long-term
autonomous HAR using CSI sensing at the network edge.

This paper proposes STAR (Sensing Technology for Activity Recognition), an

real-time, energy-efficient HAR on low-power embedded devices. STAR
incorporates a streamlined Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU)-based recurrent neural
network, reducing model parameters by 33% compared to conventional LSTM models
while maintaining effective temporal modeling capability. A multi-stage
pre-processing pipeline combining median filtering, 8th-order Butterworth
low-pass filtering, and Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD) is employed to
denoise CSI amplitude data and extract spatial-temporal features. For on-device
deployment, STAR is implemented on a Rockchip RV1126 processor equipped with an
embedded Neural Processing Unit (NPU), interfaced with an ESP32-S3-based CSI
acquisition module. Experimental results demonstrate a mean recognition
accuracy of 93.52% across seven activity classes and 99.11% for human presence
detection, utilizing a compact 97.6k-parameter model. INT8 quantized inference
achieves a processing speed of 33 MHz with just 8% CPU utilization, delivering
sixfold speed improvements over CPU-based execution. With sub-second response
latency and low power consumption, the system ensures real-time,
privacy-preserving HAR, offering a practical, scalable solution for mobile and

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MolBridge, a molecule-text learning framework, enhances understanding of chemical information by utilizing substructure-aware alignments and contrastive learning to improve molecular benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing models fail to capture detailed alignments between molecular substructures and chemical phrases, which limits the understanding of chemical information.

Method: MolBridge introduces substructure-aware alignments and employs contrastive learning with a self-refinement mechanism to enrich alignment signals between molecules and text descriptions.

Result: Experimental results demonstrate MolBridge's ability to learn detailed correspondences and surpass state-of-the-art baselines on various molecular benchmarks.

Conclusion: Substructure-aware alignments are critical for molecule-text representation, and MolBridge offers a significant advancement in improving performance in chemical information understanding.

Abstract: Molecule and text representation learning has gained increasing interest due
to its potential for enhancing the understanding of chemical information.
However, existing models often struggle to capture subtle differences between
molecules and their descriptions, as they lack the ability to learn
fine-grained alignments between molecular substructures and chemical phrases.
To address this limitation, we introduce MolBridge, a novel molecule-text
learning framework based on substructure-aware alignments. Specifically, we
augment the original molecule-description pairs with additional alignment
signals derived from molecular substructures and chemical phrases. To
effectively learn from these enriched alignments, MolBridge employs
substructure-aware contrastive learning, coupled with a self-refinement
mechanism that filters out noisy alignment signals. Experimental results show
that MolBridge effectively captures fine-grained correspondences and
outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on a wide range of molecular benchmarks,
highlighting the significance of substructure-aware alignment in molecule-text
learning.

Motivation: The study aims to evaluate advanced feature engineering and hybrid model approaches for effective anomaly detection in industrial time series data, using a steam turbine system as an example.

Method: The authors test multiple strategies, such as change-point-derived features, clustering-based substructure representations, and hybrid learning frameworks. The performance is compared with a simpler ensemble model.

Result: A Random Forest + XGBoost ensemble model, trained on segmented data, demonstrated superior performance with an AUC-ROC of 0.976, F1-score of 0.41, and 100% early detection.

Conclusion: In highly imbalanced and temporally uncertain datasets, simple modeling strategies with optimized data segmentation are more robust, interpretable, and practical than complex approaches.

Abstract: In this study, we investigate the effectiveness of advanced feature
engineering and hybrid model architectures for anomaly detection in a
multivariate industrial time series, focusing on a steam turbine system. We
evaluate the impact of change point-derived statistical features,
clustering-based substructure representations, and hybrid learning strategies
on detection performance. Despite their theoretical appeal, these complex
approaches consistently underperformed compared to a simple Random Forest +
XGBoost ensemble trained on segmented data. The ensemble achieved an AUC-ROC of
0.976, F1-score of 0.41, and 100% early detection within the defined time
window. Our findings highlight that, in scenarios with highly imbalanced and
temporally uncertain data, model simplicity combined with optimized
segmentation can outperform more sophisticated architectures, offering greater
robustness, interpretability, and operational utility.

### [229] [A Game-Theoretic Spatio-Temporal Reinforcement Learning Framework for Collaborative Public Resource Allocation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26184)
*Songxin Lei,Qiongyan Wang,Yanchen Zhu,Hanyu Yao,Sijie Ruan,Weilin Ruan,Yuyu Luo,Huaming Wu,Yuxuan Liang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper presents a novel framework called Game-Theoretic Spatio-Temporal Reinforcement Learning (GSTRL) for efficient public resource allocation, incorporating capacity constraints and spatio-temporal dynamics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing resource allocation methods fail to consider capacity constraints and spatio-temporal dynamics, limiting their practical application in meeting societal demands.

Method: The CPRA problem is formulated as a potential game, and the GSTRL framework is introduced to capture spatio-temporal dynamics. The Nash equilibrium of this NP-hard problem is theoretically approximated.

Result: Experiments conducted on two real-world datasets demonstrate the superior performance of GSTRL in addressing Collaborative Public Resource Allocation.

Conclusion: The proposed GSTRL framework is theoretically sound and performs effectively in solving real-world public resource allocation problems.

Abstract: Public resource allocation involves the efficient distribution of resources,
including urban infrastructure, energy, and transportation, to effectively meet
societal demands. However, existing methods focus on optimizing the movement of
individual resources independently, without considering their capacity
constraints. To address this limitation, we propose a novel and more practical
problem: Collaborative Public Resource Allocation (CPRA), which explicitly
incorporates capacity constraints and spatio-temporal dynamics in real-world
scenarios. We propose a new framework called Game-Theoretic Spatio-Temporal
Reinforcement Learning (GSTRL) for solving CPRA. Our contributions are twofold:
1) We formulate the CPRA problem as a potential game and demonstrate that there
is no gap between the potential function and the optimal target, laying a solid
theoretical foundation for approximating the Nash equilibrium of this NP-hard
problem; and 2) Our designed GSTRL framework effectively captures the
spatio-temporal dynamics of the overall system. We evaluate GSTRL on two
real-world datasets, where experiments show its superior performance. Our
source codes are available in the supplementary materials.

*Yunxiao Shi,Shuo Yang,Yixin Su,Rui Zhang,Min Xu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces ACC-SGD-IE, a new trajectory-aware estimator for per-sample influence in modern data-centric AI, outperforming existing methods in accuracy and reliability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods fail to rank critical examples accurately due to cross-epoch compounding effects not being considered. There is a need for precise estimation of per-sample influence.

Method: The proposed ACC-SGD-IE integrates a leave-one-out perturbation propagation across training, updating the influence state at every step, with benefits in both convex and non-convex settings.

Result: ACC-SGD-IE improves influence estimate accuracy, especially in long epochs, and reliably identifies noisy samples. Models trained using data cleaned with ACC-SGD-IE outperform those cleaned with traditional methods.

Conclusion: ACC-SGD-IE demonstrates significant advances in influence estimation, leading to better data processing and ultimately improved model performance.

Abstract: Modern data-centric AI needs precise per-sample influence. Standard SGD-IE
approximates leave-one-out effects by summing per-epoch surrogates and ignores
cross-epoch compounding, which misranks critical examples. We propose
ACC-SGD-IE, a trajectory-aware estimator that propagates the leave-one-out
perturbation across training and updates an accumulative influence state at
each step. In smooth strongly convex settings it achieves geometric error
contraction and, in smooth non-convex regimes, it tightens error bounds; larger
mini-batches further reduce constants. Empirically, on Adult, 20 Newsgroups,
and MNIST under clean and corrupted data and both convex and non-convex
training, ACC-SGD-IE yields more accurate influence estimates, especially over
long epochs. For downstream data cleansing it more reliably flags noisy
samples, producing models trained on ACC-SGD-IE cleaned data that outperform
those cleaned with SGD-IE.

*Avinash Kadimisetty,Arun Rajagopalan,Vijendra SK*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper uses machine learning models for analyzing health claims data to predict hospital readmissions and identifies factors contributing to readmissions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Hospital readmissions are costly and impact healthcare quality; understanding and preventing them is crucial to improving care and reducing expenses.

Method: The study uses machine learning techniques (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Support Vector Machines) and Principal Component Analysis for dimension reduction, evaluating their performance using the AUC metric.

Result: Random Forest showed the best prediction performance, followed by Logistic Regression and Support Vector Machine models.

Conclusion: The models highlight critical factors causing readmissions and provide actionable insights to reduce readmissions, potentially improving healthcare quality and cost-efficiency.

Abstract: Reducing preventable hospital readmissions is a national priority for payers,
providers, and policymakers seeking to improve health care and lower costs. The
rate of readmission is being used as a benchmark to determine the quality of
healthcare provided by the hospitals. In thisproject, we have used machine
learning techniques like Logistic Regression, Random Forest and Support Vector
Machines to analyze the health claims data and identify demographic and medical
factors that play a crucial role in predicting all-cause readmissions. As the
health claims data is high dimensional, we have used Principal Component
Analysis as a dimension reduction technique and used the results for building
regression models. We compared and evaluated these models based on the Area
Under Curve (AUC) metric. Random Forest model gave the highest performance
followed by Logistic Regression and Support Vector Machine models. These models
can be used to identify the crucial factors causing readmissions and help
identify patients to focus on to reduce the chances of readmission, ultimately
bringing down the cost and increasing the quality of healthcare provided to the
patients.

*Sekitoshi Kanai,Tsukasa Yoshida,Hiroshi Takahashi,Haru Kuroki,Kazumune Hashimoto*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Adaptive Importance Sampling on Pre-Logits (AISP), a test-time method for large language models that optimizes rewards more effectively than other methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Test-time alignment methods are designed as alternatives to computationally expensive fine-tuning for large language models. The paper aims to develop a method to optimize LLMs during inference using efficient reward-based test-time alignment.

Method: The proposed method, AISP, adds Gaussian perturbation to pre-logits (outputs of the penultimate layer) to optimize rewards. It employs importance sampling to adjust the mean perturbation based on sampled rewards.

Result: AISP significantly outperforms best-of-n sampling and other reward-based test-time alignment methods, achieving higher rewards with fewer samples.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates the efficiency and reliability of AISP as a superior test-time alignment method for optimizing LLMs during inference, paving the way for cost-effective tuning models.

Abstract: Test-time alignment of large language models (LLMs) attracts attention
because fine-tuning LLMs requires high computational costs. In this paper, we
propose a new test-time alignment method called adaptive importance sampling on
pre-logits (AISP) on the basis of the sampling-based model predictive control
with the stochastic control input. AISP applies the Gaussian perturbation into
pre-logits, which are outputs of the penultimate layer, so as to maximize
expected rewards with respect to the mean of the perturbation. We demonstrate
that the optimal mean is obtained by importance sampling with sampled rewards.
AISP outperforms best-of-n sampling in terms of rewards over the number of used
samples and achieves higher rewards than other reward-based test-time alignment
methods.

*Minyi Peng,Darian Gunamardi,Ivan Tjuawinata,Kwok-Yan Lam*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes an efficient and practical solution for machine unlearning by reversing the training sequence with a projection-redistribution layer, achieving similar results to full retraining with reduced computational cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation of this paper is to address the limitations of existing machine unlearning approaches, particularly the issues of scalability, dependency on full access to original datasets and models, and practical deployment challenges in real-world applications.

Method: The method involves treating classification training as a sequential process and implementing unlearning by reversing the last training sequence using a projection-redistribution layer added to the model.

Result: The results show that the proposed approach achieves comparable outputs to fully retrained models while significantly reducing computational costs across multiple datasets including CIFAR-10/100 and Covertype.

Conclusion: The proposed inductive approach offers a scalable, practical, and model-agnostic solution for machine unlearning, allowing for easy integration into existing pipelines without compromising performance.

Abstract: As a new and promising approach, existing machine unlearning (MU) works
typically emphasize theoretical formulations or optimization objectives to
achieve knowledge removal. However, when deployed in real-world scenarios, such
solutions typically face scalability issues and have to address practical
requirements such as full access to original datasets and model. In contrast to
the existing approaches, we regard classification training as a sequential
process where classes are learned sequentially, which we call \emph{inductive
approach}. Unlearning can then be done by reversing the last training sequence.
This is implemented by appending a projection-redistribution layer in the end
of the model. Such an approach does not require full access to the original
dataset or the model, addressing the challenges of existing methods. This
enables modular and model-agnostic deployment as an output filter into existing
classification pipelines with minimal alterations. We conducted multiple
experiments across multiple datasets including image (CIFAR-10/100 using
CNN-based model) and tabular datasets (Covertype using tree-based model).
Experiment results show consistently similar output to a fully retrained model
with a high computational cost reduction. This demonstrates the applicability,
scalability, and system compatibility of our solution while maintaining the
performance of the output in a more practical setting.

### [234] [Angular Steering: Behavior Control via Rotation in Activation Space](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26243)
*Hieu M. Vu,Tan M. Nguyen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Angular Steering introduces a geometric rotation method for behavior modulation in large language models, enhancing control and stability while preserving general capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for controlling specific behaviors in large language models suffer from instability and unintended interactions in activation space.

Method: The paper proposes Angular Steering, which modulates behaviors through geometric rotation of activations within a defined subspace, and Adaptive Angular Steering, which selectively rotates aligned activations for better stability.

Result: Experiments demonstrate robust behavioral control across various models and sizes without sacrificing general language modeling performance.

Conclusion: Angular Steering simplifies control over model behaviors with improved stability and broader usability compared to existing methods, highlighting its potential for safe AI deployment.

Abstract: Controlling specific behaviors in large language models while preserving
their general capabilities is a central challenge for safe and reliable
artificial intelligence deployment. Current steering methods, such as vector
addition and directional ablation, are constrained within a two-dimensional
subspace defined by the activation and feature direction, making them sensitive
to chosen parameters and potentially affecting unrelated features due to
unintended interactions in activation space. We introduce Angular Steering, a
novel and flexible method for behavior modulation that operates by rotating
activations within a fixed two-dimensional subspace. By formulating steering as
a geometric rotation toward or away from a target behavior direction, Angular
Steering provides continuous, fine-grained control over behaviors such as
refusal and compliance. We demonstrate this method using refusal steering
emotion steering as use cases. Additionally, we propose Adaptive Angular
Steering, a selective variant that rotates only activations aligned with the
target feature, further enhancing stability and coherence. Angular Steering
generalizes existing addition and orthogonalization techniques under a unified
geometric rotation framework, simplifying parameter selection and maintaining
model stability across a broader range of adjustments. Experiments across
multiple model families and sizes show that Angular Steering achieves robust
behavioral control while maintaining general language modeling performance,
underscoring its flexibility, generalization, and robustness compared to prior
approaches. Code and artifacts are available at

*Frederik Möbius Rygaard,Shen Zhu,Yinzhu Jin,Søren Hauberg,Tom Fletcher*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a general interpolation scheme for generative models focusing on likely transition paths without requiring additional training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of principal interpolation methods in generative models without restrictive assumptions.

Method: The authors propose a novel interpolation algorithm modeled as geodesics on a data distribution using a suitable Riemannian metric.

Result: The proposed scheme effectively traverses higher density regions compared to existing interpolation methods.

Conclusion: This approach provides improved interpolation in generative models, enhancing applications like controlled generation and model inspection.

Abstract: Interpolation in generative models allows for controlled generation, model
inspection, and more. Unfortunately, most generative models lack a principal
notion of interpolants without restrictive assumptions on either the model or
data dimension. In this paper, we develop a general interpolation scheme that
targets likely transition paths compatible with different metrics and
probability distributions. We consider interpolants analogous to a geodesic
constrained to a suitable data distribution and derive a novel algorithm for
computing these curves, which requires no additional training. Theoretically,
we show that our method locally can be considered as a geodesic under a
suitable Riemannian metric. We quantitatively show that our interpolation
scheme traverses higher density regions than baselines across a range of models
and datasets.

*Kim Yong Tan,Yueming Lyu,Ivor Tsang,Yew-Soon Ong*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes the IMG algorithm to optimize diffusion processes for multi-objective tasks, achieving high efficiency in generating samples without reliance on external optimization loops.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the inefficiency of current approaches that treat diffusion models as black-box refiners, overlooking the internal diffusion process transitions for multi-objective optimization.

Method: The IMG algorithm performs inference-time weighted resampling during diffusion generation, aligning samples with a multi-target Boltzmann distribution derived to optimize multi-objective tasks.

Result: IMG demonstrated superior performance in a multi-objective molecule generation task, achieving higher hypervolume scores with fewer diffusion generations compared to baseline methods.

Conclusion: IMG improves the efficiency and performance of diffusion processes for multi-objective optimization and can be integrated into existing strategies for better outcomes.

Abstract: Diffusion models have been successful in learning complex data distributions.
This capability has driven their application to high-dimensional
multi-objective black-box optimization problem. Existing approaches often
employ an external optimization loop, such as an evolutionary algorithm, to the
diffusion model. However, these approaches treat the diffusion model as a
black-box refiner, which overlooks the internal distribution transition of the
diffusion generation process, limiting their efficiency. To address these
challenges, we propose the Inference-time Multi-target Generation (IMG)
algorithm, which optimizes the diffusion process at inference-time to generate
samples that simultaneously satisfy multiple objectives. Specifically, our IMG
performs weighted resampling during the diffusion generation process according
to the expected aggregated multi-objective values. This weighted resampling
strategy ensures the diffusion-generated samples are distributed according to
our desired multi-target Boltzmann distribution. We further derive that the
multi-target Boltzmann distribution has an interesting log-likelihood
interpretation, where it is the optimal solution to the distributional
multi-objective optimization problem. We implemented IMG for a multi-objective
molecule generation task. Experiments show that IMG, requiring only a single
generation pass, achieves a significantly higher hypervolume than baseline
optimization algorithms that often require hundreds of diffusion generations.
Notably, our algorithm can be viewed as an optimized diffusion process and can
be integrated into existing methods to further improve their performance.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a hierarchical Bayesian framework for multi-task learning in contextual bandits, introducing two algorithms that outperform existing methods in lowering cumulative regret.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance decision-making across multiple related tasks by leveraging shared structures and accommodating task-specific variations in multi-bandits.

Method: A hierarchical Bayesian model with an empirical Bayesian approach to estimate the covariance matrix, yielding two algorithms: ebmTS and ebmUCB.

Result: The proposed methods achieve superior performance with lower cumulative regret in both synthetic and real-world experiments compared to existing techniques.

Conclusion: The novel framework and algorithms effectively balance exploration and exploitation in multi-bandits, addressing heterogeneity and correlations while improving decision-making outcomes.

Abstract: Multi-task learning in contextual bandits has attracted significant research
interest due to its potential to enhance decision-making across multiple
related tasks by leveraging shared structures and task-specific heterogeneity.
In this article, we propose a novel hierarchical Bayesian framework for
learning in various bandit instances. This framework captures both the
heterogeneity and the correlations among different bandit instances through a
hierarchical Bayesian model, enabling effective information sharing while
accommodating instance-specific variations. Unlike previous methods that
overlook the learning of the covariance structure across bandits, we introduce
an empirical Bayesian approach to estimate the covariance matrix of the prior
distribution.This enhances both the practicality and flexibility of learning
across multi-bandits. Building on this approach, we develop two efficient
algorithms: ebmTS (Empirical Bayesian Multi-Bandit Thompson Sampling) and
ebmUCB (Empirical Bayesian Multi-Bandit Upper Confidence Bound), both of which
incorporate the estimated prior into the decision-making process. We provide
the frequentist regret upper bounds for the proposed algorithms, thereby
filling a research gap in the field of multi-bandit problems. Extensive
experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the superior
performance of our algorithms, particularly in complex environments. Our
methods achieve lower cumulative regret compared to existing techniques,
highlighting their effectiveness in balancing exploration and exploitation
across multi-bandits.

### [238] [Offline Clustering of Preference Learning with Active-data Augmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26301)
*Jingyuan Liu,Fatemeh Ghaffari,Xuchuang Wang,Mohammad Hajiesmaili,Carlee Joe-Wong*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper addresses offline preference learning from limited or costly pairwise user feedback, tackling user preference diversity and data imbalance by introducing algorithms Off-C$^2$PL and A$^2$-Off-C$^2$PL, supported by theoretical analysis and simulations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper is motivated by the practical challenges of offline preference learning, especially when dealing with limited user interactions and diverse preferences, which are common in real-world applications such as recommendations and reinforcement learning.

Method: The researchers propose two algorithms: Off-C$^2$PL for pure offline data learning that optimally aggregates preferences despite imbalanced data, and A$^2$-Off-C$^2$PL for active data augmentation that selects additional samples targeting underrepresented preference dimensions.

Result: The theoretical analysis demonstrates the suboptimality bound for Off-C$^2$PL and proves the effectiveness of actively selected samples in A$^2$-Off-C$^2$PL. The simulations conducted on synthetic and real datasets validate these results.

Conclusion: Both algorithms present powerful solutions to handling user preference diversity and data imbalance in offline preference learning frameworks, improving utility for test users through effective data aggregation and strategic active sampling.

Abstract: Preference learning from pairwise feedback is a widely adopted framework in
applications such as reinforcement learning with human feedback and
recommendations. In many practical settings, however, user interactions are
limited or costly, making offline preference learning necessary. Moreover,
real-world preference learning often involves users with different preferences.
For example, annotators from different backgrounds may rank the same responses
differently. This setting presents two central challenges: (1) identifying
similarity across users to effectively aggregate data, especially under
scenarios where offline data is imbalanced across dimensions, and (2) handling
the imbalanced offline data where some preference dimensions are
underrepresented. To address these challenges, we study the Offline Clustering
of Preference Learning problem, where the learner has access to fixed datasets
from multiple users with potentially different preferences and aims to maximize
utility for a test user. To tackle the first challenge, we first propose
Off-C$^2$PL for the pure offline setting, where the learner relies solely on
offline data. Our theoretical analysis provides a suboptimality bound that
explicitly captures the tradeoff between sample noise and bias. To address the
second challenge of inbalanced data, we extend our framework to the setting
with active-data augmentation where the learner is allowed to select a limited
number of additional active-data for the test user based on the cluster
structure learned by Off-C$^2$PL. In this setting, our second algorithm,
A$^2$-Off-C$^2$PL, actively selects samples that target the least-informative
dimensions of the test user's preference. We prove that these actively
collected samples contribute more effectively than offline ones. Finally, we
validate our theoretical results through simulations on synthetic and
real-world datasets.

### [239] [Understanding Hardness of Vision-Language Compositionality from A Token-level Causal Lens](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26302)
*Ziliang Chen,Tianang Xiao,Jusheng Zhang,Yongsen Zheng,Xipeng Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper investigates why CLIP struggles with compositional reasoning and introduces a token-aware causal framework to address these issues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to understand and address CLIP's failures in compositional reasoning when handling objects, attributes, and relations, and to explain phenomena like prompt sensitivity and hard negative failures.

Method: The authors propose a token-aware causal representation learning framework based on a sequential, language-token structural causal model (SCM) to explore token-level structures in CLIP.

Result: The study reveals that CLIP's compositional brittleness arises from composition nonidentifiability. It explains how pseudo-optimal text encoders can perfectly align modalities but remain insensitive to compositional operations, leading to failures on hard negatives.

Conclusion: Token-level analysis and better negative mining strategies are needed to enhance CLIP's handling of compositional reasoning.

Abstract: Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) delivers strong cross modal
generalization by aligning images and texts in a shared embedding space, yet it
persistently fails at compositional reasoning over objects, attributes, and
relations often behaving like a bag-of-words matcher. Prior causal accounts
typically model text as a single vector, obscuring token-level structure and
leaving core phenomena-such as prompt sensitivity and failures on hard
negatives unexplained. We address this gap with a token-aware causal
representation learning (CRL) framework grounded in a sequential,
language-token SCM. Our theory extends block identifiability to tokenized text,
proving that CLIP's contrastive objective can recover the modal-invariant
latent variable under both sentence-level and token-level SCMs. Crucially,
token granularity yields the first principled explanation of CLIP's
compositional brittleness: composition nonidentifiability. We show the
existence of pseudo-optimal text encoders that achieve perfect modal-invariant
alignment yet are provably insensitive to SWAP, REPLACE, and ADD operations
over atomic concepts, thereby failing to distinguish correct captions from hard
negatives despite optimizing the same training objective as true-optimal
encoders. The analysis further links language-side nonidentifiability to
visual-side failures via the modality gap and shows how iterated composition
operators compound hardness, motivating improved negative mining strategies.

### [240] [Model Inversion with Layer-Specific Modeling and Alignment for Data-Free Continual Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26311)
*Ruilin Tong,Haodong Lu,Yuhang Liu,Dong Gong*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper addresses challenges in data-free continual learning using model inversion techniques and introduces Per-layer Model Inversion (PMI) to improve efficiency and retain feature alignment for large pre-trained models, such as CLIP.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to overcome the limitations of storing and replaying data for continual learning due to privacy, security, and practical challenges, especially with large pre-trained models.

Method: They propose Per-layer Model Inversion (PMI) for efficient synthesis of pseudo-images from semantic-aware features and use Gaussian distributions and contrastive modeling to ensure alignment between synthetic and real data.

Result: The approach significantly improves continual learning for new classes by generating aligned pseudo-images, showing strong performance across various continual learning settings.

Conclusion: By combining PMI and feature modeling, the method provides effective and efficient data-free continual learning, compatible with large pre-trained models.

Abstract: Continual learning (CL) aims to incrementally train a model on a sequence of
tasks while retaining performance on prior ones. However, storing and replaying
data is often infeasible due to privacy or security constraints and impractical
for arbitrary pre-trained models. Data-free CL seeks to update models without
access to previous data. Beyond regularization, we employ model inversion to
synthesize data from the trained model, enabling replay without storing
samples. Yet, model inversion in predictive models faces two challenges: (1)
generating inputs solely from compressed output labels causes drift between
synthetic and real data, and replaying such data can erode prior knowledge; (2)
inversion is computationally expensive since each step backpropagates through
the full model. These issues are amplified in large pre-trained models such as
CLIP. To improve efficiency, we propose Per-layer Model Inversion (PMI),
inspired by faster convergence in single-layer optimization. PMI provides
strong initialization for full-model inversion, substantially reducing
iterations. To mitigate feature shift, we model class-wise features via
Gaussian distributions and contrastive model, ensuring alignment between
synthetic and real features. Combining PMI and feature modeling, our approach
enables continual learning of new classes by generating pseudo-images from
semantic-aware projected features, achieving strong effectiveness and
compatibility across multiple CL settings.

*Sascha Mücke*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The study formulates SVM training as a QUBO problem to leverage quantum annealing, exploring how qubit discretization impacts predictive performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore quantum annealing as a method for optimizing SVMs and assess its feasibility and effectiveness compared to classical methods.

Method: Researchers compared QUBO-based SVM training with classical LIBSVM across datasets, analyzing the effect of qubit discretization (bit-depth) on performance.

Result: Low-precision QUBO encodings often matched or surpassed classical SVM accuracy, while higher bit-depths did not always improve results.

Conclusion: Quantum annealing shows promise for efficient SVM training, but the size of QUBOs is currently hardware-limited; focus should also be on choosing support vectors rather than their exact weights.

Abstract: Training Support Vector Machines (SVMs) can be formulated as a QUBO problem,
enabling the use of quantum annealing for model optimization. In this work, we
study how the number of qubits - linked to the discretization level of dual
weights - affects predictive performance across datasets. We compare QUBO-based
SVM training to the classical LIBSVM solver and find that even low-precision
QUBO encodings (e.g., 1 bit per parameter) yield competitive, and sometimes
superior, accuracy. While increased bit-depth enables larger regularization
parameters, it does not always improve classification. Our findings suggest
that selecting the right support vectors may matter more than their precise
weighting. Although current hardware limits the size of solvable QUBOs, our
results highlight the potential of quantum annealing for efficient SVM training
as quantum devices scale.

*David Schmotz,Sahar Abdelnabi,Maksym Andriushchenko*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper critiques the security vulnerabilities inherent in the Agent Skills framework for large language models, demonstrating how malicious prompt injections can exploit this system.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the unresolved challenge of enabling continual learning in Large Language Models (LLMs), focusing on the potential security risks in contemporary approaches.

Method: The authors analyze 'Agent Skills' in terms of its fundamental security aspects, perform experiments hiding malicious instructions, and demonstrate bypassing system guardrails in popular coding agents.

Result: The study reveals that the Agent Skills framework in LLMs is insecure and susceptible to simple prompt injection attacks, leading to possible exfiltration of sensitive data.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that frontier LLMs, while advancing in capabilities, remain vulnerable to prompt injection threats, stressing the need for more robust security measures.

Abstract: Enabling continual learning in LLMs remains a key unresolved research
challenge. In a recent announcement, a frontier LLM company made a step towards
this by introducing Agent Skills, a framework that equips agents with new
knowledge based on instructions stored in simple markdown files. Although Agent
Skills can be a very useful tool, we show that they are fundamentally insecure,
since they enable trivially simple prompt injections. We demonstrate how to
hide malicious instructions in long Agent Skill files and referenced scripts to
exfiltrate sensitive data, such as internal files or passwords. Importantly, we
show how to bypass system-level guardrails of a popular coding agent: a benign,
task-specific approval with the "Don't ask again" option can carry over to
closely related but harmful actions. Overall, we conclude that despite ongoing
research efforts and scaling model capabilities, frontier LLMs remain
vulnerable to very simple prompt injections in realistic scenarios. Our code is

### [243] [Linear Causal Discovery with Interventional Constraints](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26342)
*Zhigao Guo,Feng Dong*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces "interventional constraints" to incorporate high-level causal knowledge in causal discovery models, distinguishing it from traditional interventional data approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current causal discovery methods can produce incorrect causal conclusions even when structural constraints are applied, necessitating a method to explicitly integrate known causal influences as constraints.

Method: It proposes a new quantified metric for total causal effects in linear models and a two-stage constrained optimization method to incorporate interventional constraints into causal models.

Result: The method improved accuracy, ensured consistency with existing causal knowledge, and facilitated the identification of new causal relationships in real-world dataset evaluations.

Conclusion: Integrating interventional constraints enhances the reliability and explainability of causal discovery models while aiding the identification of novel causal insights.

Abstract: Incorporating causal knowledge and mechanisms is essential for refining
causal models and improving downstream tasks such as designing new treatments.
In this paper, we introduce a novel concept in causal discovery, termed
interventional constraints, which differs fundamentally from interventional
data. While interventional data require direct perturbations of variables,
interventional constraints encode high-level causal knowledge in the form of
inequality constraints on causal effects. For instance, in the Sachs dataset
(Sachs et al.\ 2005), Akt has been shown to be activated by PIP3, meaning PIP3
exerts a positive causal effect on Akt. Existing causal discovery methods allow
enforcing structural constraints (for example, requiring a causal path from
PIP3 to Akt), but they may still produce incorrect causal conclusions such as
learning that "PIP3 inhibits Akt". Interventional constraints bridge this gap
by explicitly constraining the total causal effect between variable pairs,
ensuring learned models respect known causal influences. To formalize
interventional constraints, we propose a metric to quantify total causal
effects for linear causal models and formulate the problem as a constrained
optimization task, solved using a two-stage constrained optimization method. We
evaluate our approach on real-world datasets and demonstrate that integrating
interventional constraints not only improves model accuracy and ensures
consistency with established findings, making models more explainable, but also
facilitates the discovery of new causal relationships that would otherwise be
costly to identify.

TL;DR: The paper revises and optimizes reinforcement learning (RL) techniques for sparse, nonstationary environments, demonstrating enhanced performance over classical RL methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional RL algorithms struggle in environments that are reward-sparse, random, or nonstationary, limiting their applicability in real-world scenarios like searching underwater pollution.

Method: The paper employs modifications to classical RL techniques such as hierarchical algorithms, multigoal learning, and a location memory filter to enhance performance in complex environments.

Result: The study shows that a modified Monte Carlo-based approach outperforms Q-learning and other search methods in sparse and random environments.

Conclusion: The findings prove RL's adaptability for challenging environments, expanding its scope for tackling real-world problems.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms are designed to optimize
problem-solving by learning actions that maximize rewards, a task that becomes
particularly challenging in random and nonstationary environments. Even
advanced RL algorithms are often limited in their ability to solve problems in
these conditions. In applications such as searching for underwater pollution
clouds with autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs), RL algorithms must navigate
reward-sparse environments, where actions frequently result in a zero reward.
This paper aims to address these challenges by revisiting and modifying
classical RL approaches to efficiently operate in sparse, randomized, and
nonstationary environments. We systematically study a large number of
modifications, including hierarchical algorithm changes, multigoal learning,
and the integration of a location memory as an external output filter to
prevent state revisits. Our results demonstrate that a modified Monte
Carlo-based approach significantly outperforms traditional Q-learning and two
exhaustive search patterns, illustrating its potential in adapting RL to
complex environments. These findings suggest that reinforcement learning
approaches can be effectively adapted for use in random, nonstationary, and
reward-sparse environments.

### [245] [UnifiedFL: A Dynamic Unified Learning Framework for Equitable Federation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26350)
*Furkan Pala,Islem Rekik*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces UnifiedFL, a federated learning framework addressing challenges in heterogeneous neural network architectures and non-identically distributed datasets by utilizing a shared graph neural network (GNN) with distance-driven clustering and a two-tier aggregation approach.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations in existing federated learning (FL) frameworks that struggle with architectural heterogeneity, non-identical data distributions, and generalization issues in collaborative model training.

Method: The proposed UnifiedFL framework utilizes a shared graph neural network (GNN) to parameterize diverse architectures, implements clustering based on Euclidean distances between client parameters, and adopts a two-tier aggregation policy to balance diversity and convergence.

Result: UnifiedFL demonstrates superior performance in experiments on MedMNIST classification and hippocampus segmentation benchmarks compared to existing FL methods.

Conclusion: UnifiedFL effectively tackles key challenges in federated learning, including architectural heterogeneity and domain-specific data distribution differences, with promising results in medical benchmarks.

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) has emerged as a key paradigm for collaborative model
training across multiple clients without sharing raw data, enabling
privacy-preserving applications in areas such as radiology and pathology.
However, works on collaborative training across clients with fundamentally
different neural architectures and non-identically distributed datasets remain
scarce. Existing FL frameworks face several limitations. Despite claiming to
support architectural heterogeneity, most recent FL methods only tolerate
variants within a single model family (e.g., shallower, deeper, or wider CNNs),
still presuming a shared global architecture and failing to accommodate
federations where clients deploy fundamentally different network types (e.g.,
CNNs, GNNs, MLPs). Moreover, existing approaches often address only statistical
heterogeneity while overlooking the domain-fracture problem, where each
client's data distribution differs markedly from that faced at testing time,
undermining model generalizability. When clients use different architectures,
have non-identically distributed data, and encounter distinct test domains,
current methods perform poorly. To address these challenges, we propose
UnifiedFL, a dynamic federated learning framework that represents heterogeneous
local networks as nodes and edges in a directed model graph optimized by a
shared graph neural network (GNN). UnifiedFL introduces (i) a common GNN to
parameterize all architectures, (ii) distance-driven clustering via Euclidean
distances between clients' parameters, and (iii) a two-tier aggregation policy
balancing convergence and diversity. Experiments on MedMNIST classification and
hippocampus segmentation benchmarks demonstrate UnifiedFL's superior
performance. Code and data: https://github.com/basiralab/UnifiedFL

*Albi Isufaj,Pablo Mollá,Helmut Prendinger*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes approaches to enhance reliability and explainability in financial AI by utilizing Time-LLM, reliability estimators, and symbolic reasoning methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The opacity of large neural network models in financial forecasting creates challenges in trust and regulatory compliance, necessitating explainable AI approaches.

Method: The authors introduce Time-LLM for better directional forecasting, use reliability estimators to filter unreliable predictions, and employ symbolic reasoning to encode domain rules for transparent decision-making.

Result: Experiments on equity and cryptocurrency data demonstrate reduced false positives and support for selective execution of reliable and explainable forecasts.

Conclusion: The proposed framework combines predictive accuracy, reliability estimation, and rule-based reasoning to advance transparent and auditable financial AI systems.

Abstract: Financial forecasting increasingly uses large neural network models, but
their opacity raises challenges for trust and regulatory compliance. We present
several approaches to explainable and reliable AI in finance. \emph{First}, we
describe how Time-LLM, a time series foundation model, uses a prompt to avoid a
wrong directional forecast. \emph{Second}, we show that combining foundation
models for time series forecasting with a reliability estimator can filter our
unreliable predictions. \emph{Third}, we argue for symbolic reasoning encoding
domain rules for transparent justification. These approaches shift emphasize
executing only forecasts that are both reliable and explainable. Experiments on
equity and cryptocurrency data show that the architecture reduces false
positives and supports selective execution. By integrating predictive
performance with reliability estimation and rule-based reasoning, our framework
advances transparent and auditable financial AI systems.

*Ningning Tao,Fei Xie,Baoxiang Pan,Hongyu Wang,Han Huang,Zhongpu Qiu,Ke Gui,Jiali Luo,Xiaosong Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces FM-Cast, a generative AI model for efficient probabilistic forecasting of sudden stratospheric warmings (SSWs), offering competitive performance with much less computational demand.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current numerical weather prediction systems face challenges in accurately forecasting SSWs due to physical modeling, initialization issues, and high computational requirements.

Method: The study uses a Flow Matching-based generative AI model (FM-Cast) to probabilistically predict the spatiotemporal evolution of stratospheric circulation during SSWs.

Result: FM-Cast successfully forecasts 10 out of 18 major SSW events up to 20 days in advance with ensemble accuracies above 50%. It performs comparably or better than leading NWP systems while requiring significantly lower computational resources.

Conclusion: FM-Cast provides a computationally efficient and skillful framework for forecasting SSWs, advancing understanding of their physical drivers and showcasing the potential of generative AI in this domain.

Abstract: Sudden Stratospheric Warmings (SSWs) are key sources of subseasonal
predictability and major drivers of extreme winter weather. Yet, their accurate
and efficient forecast remains a persistent challenge for numerical weather
prediction (NWP) systems due to limitations in physical representation,
initialization, and the immense computational demands of ensemble forecasts.
While data-driven forecasting is rapidly evolving, its application to the
complex, three-dimensional dynamics of SSWs, particularly for probabilistic
forecast, remains underexplored. Here, we bridge this gap by developing a Flow
Matching-based generative AI model (FM-Cast) for efficient and skillful
probabilistic forecasting of the spatiotemporal evolution of stratospheric
circulation. Evaluated across 18 major SSW events (1998-2024), FM-Cast
skillfully forecasts the onset, intensity, and morphology of 10 events up to 20
days in advance, achieving ensemble accuracies above 50%. Its performance is
comparable to or exceeds leading NWP systems while requiring only two minutes
for a 50-member, 30-day forecast on a consumer GPU. Furthermore, leveraging
FM-Cast as a scientific tool, we demonstrate through idealized experiments that
SSW predictability is fundamentally linked to its underlying physical drivers,
distinguishing between events forced from the troposphere and those driven by
internal stratospheric dynamics. Our work thus establishes a computationally
efficient paradigm for probabilistic forecasting stratospheric anomalies and
showcases generative AI's potential to deepen the physical understanding of
atmosphere-climate dynamics.

*Wenchang Duan,Yaoliang Yu,Jiwan He,Yi Shi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a novel framework for multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) that dynamically optimizes context length using temporal gradient analysis. It achieves state-of-the-art results in tasks requiring long-term dependencies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations in exploration efficiency and redundant information caused by fixed context lengths in MARL.

Method: Introduced a central agent that adjusts context length dynamically, using temporal gradient analysis combined with Fourier-based low-frequency truncation for efficient input representation.

Result: The framework demonstrated state-of-the-art performance across challenging benchmarks such as PettingZoo, MiniGrid, Google Research Football (GRF), and StarCraft Multi-Agent Challenge v2 (SMACv2).

Conclusion: Adaptive contextual optimization improves exploration efficiency and task performance in MARL environment, achieving superior results in long-term dependency tasks.

Abstract: Recently, deep multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) has demonstrated
promising performance for solving challenging tasks, such as long-term
dependencies and non-Markovian environments. Its success is partly attributed
to conditioning policies on large fixed context length. However, such large
fixed context lengths may lead to limited exploration efficiency and redundant
information. In this paper, we propose a novel MARL framework to obtain
adaptive and effective contextual information. Specifically, we design a
central agent that dynamically optimizes context length via temporal gradient
analysis, enhancing exploration to facilitate convergence to global optima in
MARL. Furthermore, to enhance the adaptive optimization capability of the
context length, we present an efficient input representation for the central
agent, which effectively filters redundant information. By leveraging a
Fourier-based low-frequency truncation method, we extract global temporal
trends across decentralized agents, providing an effective and efficient
representation of the MARL environment. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on long-term
dependency tasks, including PettingZoo, MiniGrid, Google Research Football
(GRF), and StarCraft Multi-Agent Challenge v2 (SMACv2).

Motivation: The paper aims to explore the relevance of SVMs and TWSVMs in multi-task learning, especially in scenarios where these models remain effective despite the dominance of deep learning.

Method: The authors survey multi-task learning techniques, focusing on SVM and TWSVM approaches, while comparing theoretical, optimization, and empirical aspects.

Result: TWSVM extensions for multi-task settings show promise but are underexplored; comparisons are drawn across empirical performance and theoretical properties.

Conclusion: The paper identifies research gaps and emphasizes the need for scalable, interpretable, and reliable margin-based multi-task learning frameworks.

Abstract: Multi-task learning (MTL) enables simultaneous training across related tasks,
leveraging shared information to improve generalization, efficiency, and
robustness, especially in data-scarce or high-dimensional scenarios. While deep
learning dominates recent MTL research, Support Vector Machines (SVMs) and Twin
SVMs (TWSVMs) remain relevant due to their interpretability, theoretical rigor,
and effectiveness with small datasets.
  This chapter surveys MTL approaches based on SVM and TWSVM, highlighting
shared representations, task regularization, and structural coupling
strategies. Special attention is given to emerging TWSVM extensions for
multi-task settings, which show promise but remain underexplored. We compare
these models in terms of theoretical properties, optimization strategies, and
empirical performance, and discuss applications in fields such as computer
vision, natural language processing, and bioinformatics.
  Finally, we identify research gaps and outline future directions for building
scalable, interpretable, and reliable margin-based MTL frameworks. This work
provides a comprehensive resource for researchers and practitioners interested
in SVM- and TWSVM-based multi-task learning.

*Yucen Wang,Fengming Zhang,De-Chuan Zhan,Li Zhao,Kaixin Wang,Jiang Bian*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CoLA-World integrates latent action models (LAM) and pretrained world models into a unified system, improving video simulation and visual planning outcomes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Creating generalist world models by integrating latent action models with pretrained world models in a single synergistic learning paradigm.

Method: Introduced CoLA-World, which involves a joint training strategy of LAM and pretrained world models with a critical warm-up phase for alignment.

Result: CoLA-World achieves superior video simulation quality and visual planning compared to the two-stage approach.

Conclusion: CoLA-World successfully combines LAM and pretrained world models into a unified framework, offering improved performance and efficiency.

Abstract: Adapting pre-trained video generation models into controllable world models
via latent actions is a promising step towards creating generalist world
models. The dominant paradigm adopts a two-stage approach that trains latent
action model (LAM) and the world model separately, resulting in redundant
training and limiting their potential for co-adaptation. A conceptually simple
and appealing idea is to directly replace the forward dynamic model in LAM with
a powerful world model and training them jointly, but it is non-trivial and
prone to representational collapse. In this work, we propose CoLA-World, which
for the first time successfully realizes this synergistic paradigm, resolving
the core challenge in joint learning through a critical warm-up phase that
effectively aligns the representations of the from-scratch LAM with the
pre-trained world model. This unlocks a co-evolution cycle: the world model
acts as a knowledgeable tutor, providing gradients to shape a high-quality LAM,
while the LAM offers a more precise and adaptable control interface to the
world model. Empirically, CoLA-World matches or outperforms prior two-stage
methods in both video simulation quality and downstream visual planning,
establishing a robust and efficient new paradigm for the field.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The aim is to address the challenge in precision medicine of predicting treatment outcomes for rare patient groups with limited high-fidelity trial data.

Method: The authors propose CFKD-AFN, a network leveraging cross-fidelity knowledge distillation and adaptive fusion. The framework integrates low-fidelity simulation data with high-fidelity trial data using dual-channel knowledge distillation and attention-guided fusion.

Result: CFKD-AFN achieves significant accuracy improvements (6.67%-74.55%) in predicting treatment outcomes for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and exhibits strong robustness to varying datasets.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates CFKD-AFN's enhanced predictive performance and robustness, while its interpretable variant facilitates understanding latent medical semantics for clinical decision-making.

Abstract: Personalized treatment outcome prediction based on trial data for
small-sample and rare patient groups is critical in precision medicine.
However, the costly trial data limit the prediction performance. To address
this issue, we propose a cross-fidelity knowledge distillation and adaptive
fusion network (CFKD-AFN), which leverages abundant but low-fidelity simulation
data to enhance predictions on scarce but high-fidelity trial data. CFKD-AFN
incorporates a dual-channel knowledge distillation module to extract
complementary knowledge from the low-fidelity model, along with an
attention-guided fusion module to dynamically integrate multi-source
information. Experiments on treatment outcome prediction for the chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease demonstrates significant improvements of CFKD-AFN
over state-of-the-art methods in prediction accuracy, ranging from 6.67\% to
74.55\%, and strong robustness to varying high-fidelity dataset sizes.
Furthermore, we extend CFKD-AFN to an interpretable variant, enabling the
exploration of latent medical semantics to support clinical decision-making.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Graph Condensation (GC) focuses on creating smaller, informative graphs but struggles with robustness against corrupted graphs. A new framework, MRGC, leverages graph manifold geometry to enhance robustness while ensuring effectiveness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing GC methods fail to remain robust when the original graphs are adversarially corrupted. Improving GC robustness in such scenarios is critical.

Method: MRGC framework is introduced with three graph data manifold learning modules to guide condensed graphs to lie within a smooth and low-dimensional manifold, avoiding class ambiguity while reducing classification complexity.

Result: MRGC achieves better robust performance under diverse adversarial attack scenarios compared to existing GC approaches.

Conclusion: By incorporating graph manifold learning, MRGC enhances the robustness of Graph Condensation while maintaining classification effectiveness and resistance to universal adversarial attacks.

Abstract: Graph condensation (GC) has gained significant attention for its ability to
synthesize smaller yet informative graphs. However, existing studies often
overlook the robustness of GC in scenarios where the original graph is
corrupted. In such cases, we observe that the performance of GC deteriorates
significantly, while existing robust graph learning technologies offer only
limited effectiveness. Through both empirical investigation and theoretical
analysis, we reveal that GC is inherently an intrinsic-dimension-reducing
process, synthesizing a condensed graph with lower classification complexity.
Although this property is critical for effective GC performance, it remains
highly vulnerable to adversarial perturbations. To tackle this vulnerability
and improve GC robustness, we adopt the geometry perspective of graph data
manifold and propose a novel Manifold-constrained Robust Graph Condensation
framework named MRGC. Specifically, we introduce three graph data manifold
learning modules that guide the condensed graph to lie within a smooth,
low-dimensional manifold with minimal class ambiguity, thereby preserving the
classification complexity reduction capability of GC and ensuring robust
performance under universal adversarial attacks. Extensive experiments
demonstrate the robustness of \ModelName\ across diverse attack scenarios.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a Quantum Gated Recurrent Unit-based Generative Adversarial Network using novel methods for robust time-series anomaly detection with successful deployment on IBM Quantum hardware.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Anomaly detection in time-series data is crucial for network security, yet current quantum approaches are constrained due to limited qubit resources.

Method: The proposed model uses a Quantum Gated Recurrent Unit-based GAN with a Successive Data Injection method, a multi-metric gating strategy, Gaussian uncertainty estimates, and a Wasserstein critic for stable training and anomaly verification.

Result: The model achieved a high F1 score of 89.43% in benchmark tests and demonstrated robust performance when deployed on IBM Quantum hardware.

Conclusion: The QGRU-WGAN system is effective, efficient, and practically feasible for detecting anomalies in time-series data using current quantum technologies.

Abstract: Anomaly detection in time-series data is a critical challenge with
significant implications for network security. Recent quantum machine learning
approaches, such as quantum kernel methods and variational quantum circuits,
have shown promise in capturing complex data distributions for anomaly
detection but remain constrained by limited qubit counts. We introduce in this
work a novel Quantum Gated Recurrent Unit (QGRU)-based Generative Adversarial
Network (GAN) employing Successive Data Injection (SuDaI) and a multi-metric
gating strategy for robust network anomaly detection. Our model uniquely
utilizes a quantum-enhanced generator that outputs parameters (mean and
log-variance) of a Gaussian distribution via reparameterization, combined with
a Wasserstein critic to stabilize adversarial training. Anomalies are
identified through a novel gating mechanism that initially flags potential
anomalies based on Gaussian uncertainty estimates and subsequently verifies
them using a composite of critic scores and reconstruction errors. Evaluated on
benchmark datasets, our method achieves a high time-series aware F1 score
(TaF1) of 89.43% demonstrating superior capability in detecting anomalies
accurately and promptly as compared to existing classical and quantum models.
Furthermore, the trained QGRU-WGAN was deployed on real IBM Quantum hardware,
where it retained high anomaly detection performance, confirming its robustness
and practical feasibility on current noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ)
devices.

TL;DR: This paper introduces a framework (CROPI) using influence functions and offline data to enhance data selection in reinforcement learning for large language models, showing improvements in training efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing data selection methods in RLVR (Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards) rely on heuristics and lack theoretical backing and generalizability, prompting the need for a more robust approach.

Method: The authors use influence functions to theoretically evaluate data contributions to learning objectives and employ sparse random projection to manage large gradients efficiently. They propose an off-policy method for estimating data influence using offline trajectories.

Result: The CROPI framework achieves up to 2.66x acceleration in training step-level speed, especially on a 1.5B parameter model, while drastically reducing data usage in each stage compared to full-dataset training.

Conclusion: Influence-based data selection significantly improves the efficiency and performance of RLVR, showing its viability for large language models training.

Abstract: Data selection is a critical aspect of Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable
Rewards (RLVR) for enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language
models (LLMs). Current data selection methods are largely heuristic-based,
lacking theoretical guarantees and generalizability. This work proposes a
theoretically-grounded approach using influence functions to estimate the
contribution of each data point to the learning objective. To overcome the
prohibitive computational cost of policy rollouts required for online influence
estimation, we introduce an off-policy influence estimation method that
efficiently approximates data influence using pre-collected offline
trajectories. Furthermore, to manage the high-dimensional gradients of LLMs, we
employ sparse random projection to reduce dimensionality and improve storage
and computation efficiency. Leveraging these techniques, we develop
\textbf{C}urriculum \textbf{R}L with \textbf{O}ff-\textbf{P}olicy
\text{I}nfluence guidance (\textbf{CROPI}), a multi-stage RL framework that
iteratively selects the most influential data for the current policy.
Experiments on models up to 7B parameters demonstrate that CROPI significantly
accelerates training. On a 1.5B model, it achieves a 2.66x step-level
acceleration while using only 10\% of the data per stage compared to
full-dataset training. Our results highlight the substantial potential of
influence-based data selection for efficient RLVR.

TL;DR: The paper develops a strategy for continuous ECG monitoring using wearables by addressing Out-of-Distribution (OOD) data reliability issues with Unsupervised Anomaly Detection (UAD) methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need to improve the reliability of automated deep learning-based ECG analysis systems in handling unseen or noisy data while being resource-efficient, particularly in wearable devices.

Method: Benchmarked six Unsupervised Anomaly Detection (UAD) methods optimized through Neural Architecture Search under strict computational constraints (512k parameters). Evaluation was performed on PTB-XL and BUT QDB datasets.

Result: Deep SVDD showcased the best balance between performance and resource efficiency. The integration of Deep SVDD improved diagnostic classifier accuracy by up to 21 percentage points compared to the baseline.

Conclusion: Optimized UAD filters like Deep SVDD enhance reliability and safety in wearable ECG monitoring by addressing OOD data challenges, significantly improving diagnostic accuracy.

Abstract: Continuous electrocardiogram (ECG) monitoring via wearables offers
significant potential for early cardiovascular disease (CVD) detection.
However, deploying deep learning models for automated analysis in
resource-constrained environments faces reliability challenges due to
inevitable Out-of-Distribution (OOD) data. OOD inputs, such as unseen
pathologies or noisecorrupted signals, often cause erroneous, high-confidence
predictions by standard classifiers, compromising patient safety. Existing OOD
detection methods either neglect computational constraints or address noise and
unseen classes separately. This paper explores Unsupervised Anomaly Detection
(UAD) as an independent, upstream filtering mechanism to improve robustness. We
benchmark six UAD approaches, including Deep SVDD, reconstruction-based models,
Masked Anomaly Detection, normalizing flows, and diffusion models, optimized
via Neural Architecture Search (NAS) under strict resource constraints (at most
512k parameters). Evaluation on PTB-XL and BUT QDB datasets assessed detection
of OOD CVD classes and signals unsuitable for analysis due to noise. Results
show Deep SVDD consistently achieves the best trade-off between detection and
efficiency. In a realistic deployment simulation, integrating the optimized
Deep SVDD filter with a diagnostic classifier improved accuracy by up to 21
percentage points over a classifier-only baseline. This study demonstrates that
optimized UAD filters can safeguard automated ECG analysis, enabling safer,
more reliable continuous cardiovascular monitoring on wearables.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces ICPO, a new framework for improving Large Reasoning Models by enhancing exploration and training stability without relying on advanced external models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods like GRPO exhibit limited exploration due to reliance on on-policy rollouts, and incorporating expert-generated trajectories is computationally costly and often inaccessible.

Method: ICPO uses Mixed-Policy GRPO with Implicit Expert Forcing to improve exploration and integrates Expert Region Reject Sampling and Annealed Expert-Bonus Reward Shaping for optimization stability.

Result: Experimental results show ICPO enhances performance and stability in reinforcement learning tasks related to mathematical reasoning benchmarks.

Conclusion: ICPO offers a scalable and efficient solution for improving reasoning capabilities of Large Reasoning Models, addressing exploration and computational cost issues prevalent in prior methods.

Abstract: Existing Reinforcement Learning from Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) methods, such
as Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), have achieved remarkable progress
in improving the reasoning capabilities of Large Reasoning Models (LRMs).
However, they exhibit limited exploration due to reliance on on-policy rollouts
where confined to the current policy's distribution, resulting in narrow
trajectory diversity. Recent approaches attempt to expand policy coverage by
incorporating trajectories generated from stronger expert models, yet this
reliance increases computational cost and such advaned models are often
inaccessible. To address these issues, we propose In-Context Steered Policy
Optimization (ICPO), a unified framework that leverages the inherent in-context
learning capability of LRMs to provide expert guidance using existing datasets.
ICPO introduces Mixed-Policy GRPO with Implicit Expert Forcing, which expands
exploration beyond the current policy distribution without requiring advanced
LRM trajectories. To further stabilize optimization, ICPO integrates Expert
Region Reject Sampling to filter unreliable off-policy trajectories and
Annealed Expert-Bonus Reward Shaping to balance early expert guidance with
later autonomous improvement. Results demonstrate that ICPO consistently
enhances reinforcement learning performance and training stability on
mathematical reasoning benchmarks, revealing a scalable and effective RLVR
paradigm for LRMs.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces a novel polybasic speculative decoding framework to accelerate inference in Large Language Models (LLMs), achieving significant speedup ratios while preserving output distribution.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Inference latency hinders large-scale deployment of LLMs. Current speculative decoding methods are promising but rely on simpler frameworks and lack rigorous theoretical backing.

Method: The paper introduces a polybasic speculative decoding framework based on a comprehensive theoretical analysis, optimizing multi-model decoding systems by analyzing the interplay between model capabilities, acceptance lengths, and computational cost.

Result: The framework achieves significant speedups in inference, with ratios from 3.31x to 4.43x across various models like LLaMA2-Chat 7B and Vicuna-7B, while maintaining the output distribution.

Conclusion: Polybasic speculative decoding offers a more generalized and efficient framework for accelerating LLM inference. The approach is experimentally validated, theory-backed, and its codebase is made available for future research.

Abstract: Inference latency stands as a critical bottleneck in the large-scale
deployment of Large Language Models (LLMs). Speculative decoding methods have
recently shown promise in accelerating inference without compromising the
output distribution. However, existing work typically relies on a dualistic
draft-verify framework and lacks rigorous theoretical grounding. In this paper,
we introduce a novel \emph{polybasic} speculative decoding framework,
underpinned by a comprehensive theoretical analysis. Specifically, we prove a
fundamental theorem that characterizes the optimal inference time for
multi-model speculative decoding systems, shedding light on how to extend
beyond the dualistic approach to a more general polybasic paradigm. Through our
theoretical investigation of multi-model token generation, we expose and
optimize the interplay between model capabilities, acceptance lengths, and
overall computational cost. Our framework supports both standalone
implementation and integration with existing speculative techniques, leading to
accelerated performance in practice. Experimental results across multiple model
families demonstrate that our approach yields speedup ratios ranging from
$3.31\times$ to $4.01\times$ for LLaMA2-Chat 7B, up to $3.87 \times$ for
LLaMA3-8B, up to $4.43 \times$ for Vicuna-7B and up to $3.85 \times$ for
Qwen2-7B -- all while preserving the original output distribution. We release
our theoretical proofs and implementation code to facilitate further
investigation into polybasic speculative decoding.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Higher-Order Hypergraph Learning (HOHL) improves regularization methods by inducing higher-order smoothness and proves convergence rates and consistency, showcasing its effectiveness across various learning scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to provide stronger and versatile alternatives to classical hypergraph regularization by enforcing higher-order smoothness and addressing diverse learning scenarios.

Method: The paper proves consistency for a truncated version of HOHL, derives explicit convergence rates, and tests empirical performance for tasks like active learning.

Result: HOHL demonstrates strong empirical performance in active learning and datasets without geometric structures, proving its robustness and adaptability.

Conclusion: The study establishes HOHL as a versatile, consistent, and robust regularization method applicable across diverse learning settings.

Abstract: Higher-Order Hypergraph Learning (HOHL) was recently introduced as a
principled alternative to classical hypergraph regularization, enforcing
higher-order smoothness via powers of multiscale Laplacians induced by the
hypergraph structure. Prior work established the well- and ill-posedness of
HOHL through an asymptotic consistency analysis in geometric settings. We
extend this theoretical foundation by proving the consistency of a truncated
version of HOHL and deriving explicit convergence rates when HOHL is used as a
regularizer in fully supervised learning. We further demonstrate its strong
empirical performance in active learning and in datasets lacking an underlying
geometric structure, highlighting HOHL's versatility and robustness across
diverse learning settings.

### [259] [A Three-Stage Bayesian Transfer Learning Framework to Improve Predictions in Data-Scarce Domains](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26541)
*Aidan Furlong,Robert Salko,Xingang Zhao,Xu Wu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a staged Bayesian domain-adversarial neural network (B-DANN) framework to enhance transfer learning, particularly under domain shifts, improving accuracy in critical heat flux prediction for nuclear engineering.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address limitations of deep neural networks that struggle with sparse, noisy, or insufficient experimental data, and improve transfer learning performance under large domain shifts.

Method: Developed a three-stage framework combining parameter transfer, domain-adversarial refinement, and Bayesian neural network adaptation, validated on synthetic and real-world datasets.

Result: Demonstrated superior performance in predictive accuracy and generalization on synthetic benchmarks and real-world applications in nuclear engineering.

Conclusion: Staged B-DANN enhances transfer learning capability by addressing domain shifts, uncertainty quantification, and calibration issues, showing potential for broader applications in engineering domains.

Abstract: The use of ML in engineering has grown steadily to support a wide array of
applications. Among these methods, deep neural networks have been widely
adopted due to their performance and accessibility, but they require large,
high-quality datasets. Experimental data are often sparse, noisy, or
insufficient to build resilient data-driven models. Transfer learning, which
leverages relevant data-abundant source domains to assist learning in
data-scarce target domains, has shown efficacy. Parameter transfer, where
pretrained weights are reused, is common but degrades under large domain
shifts. Domain-adversarial neural networks (DANNs) help address this issue by
learning domain-invariant representations, thereby improving transfer under
greater domain shifts in a semi-supervised setting. However, DANNs can be
unstable during training and lack a native means for uncertainty
quantification. This study introduces a fully-supervised three-stage framework,
the staged Bayesian domain-adversarial neural network (staged B-DANN), that
combines parameter transfer and shared latent space adaptation. In Stage 1, a
deterministic feature extractor is trained on the source domain. This feature
extractor is then adversarially refined using a DANN in Stage 2. In Stage 3, a
Bayesian neural network is built on the adapted feature extractor for
fine-tuning on the target domain to handle conditional shifts and yield
calibrated uncertainty estimates. This staged B-DANN approach was first
validated on a synthetic benchmark, where it was shown to significantly
outperform standard transfer techniques. It was then applied to the task of
predicting critical heat flux in rectangular channels, leveraging data from
tube experiments as the source domain. The results of this study show that the
staged B-DANN method can improve predictive accuracy and generalization,
potentially assisting other domains in nuclear engineering.

*Jan Stenkamp,Nina Herrmann,Benjamin Karic,Stefan Oehmcke,Fabian Gieseke*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a method to compress boosted decision trees for efficient deployment on compute-constrained IoT devices, reducing memory usage while maintaining performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the growing need for lightweight machine learning models suitable for IoT applications that operate in environments with limited computing power and energy supply.

Method: The study proposes techniques for training compact boosted decision tree ensembles, optimizing feature and threshold reuse during training, combined with an alternative memory layout.

Result: Experimental results indicate compressed models achieve similar performance compared to LightGBM models, with memory footprint reductions by 4-16x.

Conclusion: The compression scheme enables IoT devices to operate autonomously in isolated environments, powering applications like edge analytics, real-time decision-making, and remote monitoring with minimal resource consumption.

Abstract: Deploying machine learning models on compute-constrained devices has become a
key building block of modern IoT applications. In this work, we present a
compression scheme for boosted decision trees, addressing the growing need for
lightweight machine learning models. Specifically, we provide techniques for
training compact boosted decision tree ensembles that exhibit a reduced memory
footprint by rewarding, among other things, the reuse of features and
thresholds during training. Our experimental evaluation shows that models
achieved the same performance with a compression ratio of 4-16x compared to
LightGBM models using an adapted training process and an alternative memory
layout. Once deployed, the corresponding IoT devices can operate independently
of constant communication or external energy supply, and, thus, autonomously,
requiring only minimal computing power and energy. This capability opens the
door to a wide range of IoT applications, including remote monitoring, edge
analytics, and real-time decision making in isolated or power-limited
environments.

### [261] [Multiclass Local Calibration With the Jensen-Shannon Distance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26566)
*Cesare Barbera,Lorenzo Perini,Giovanni De Toni,Andrea Passerini,Andrea Pugnana*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper addresses weak points in multiclass calibration of Machine Learning by introducing local calibration to resolve proximity bias issues in sparse feature spaces.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current multiclass calibration methods lack distinction among input distances, leading to miscalibration in sparse feature spaces, which is problematic in critical areas like healthcare.

Method: The paper defines multiclass local calibration, analyzes existing evaluation metrics, then proposes a method leveraging Jensen-Shannon distance to align predicted probabilities with local class frequencies.

Result: The approach demonstrated improved local calibration performance compared to existing techniques, supported by empirical validation.

Conclusion: Introducing local calibration effectively resolves proximity bias issues and enhances reliability in multiclass model predictions, particularly for high-stakes applications like healthcare.

Abstract: Developing trustworthy Machine Learning (ML) models requires their predicted
probabilities to be well-calibrated, meaning they should reflect true-class
frequencies. Among calibration notions in multiclass classification, strong
calibration is the most stringent, as it requires all predicted probabilities
to be simultaneously calibrated across all classes. However, existing
approaches to multiclass calibration lack a notion of distance among inputs,
which makes them vulnerable to proximity bias: predictions in sparse regions of
the feature space are systematically miscalibrated. This is especially relevant
in high-stakes settings, such as healthcare, where the sparse instances are
exactly those most at risk of biased treatment. In this work, we address this
main shortcoming by introducing a local perspective on multiclass calibration.
First, we formally define multiclass local calibration and establish its
relationship with strong calibration. Second, we theoretically analyze the
pitfalls of existing evaluation metrics when applied to multiclass local
calibration. Third, we propose a practical method for enhancing local
calibration in Neural Networks, which enforces alignment between predicted
probabilities and local estimates of class frequencies using the Jensen-Shannon
distance. Finally, we empirically validate our approach against existing
multiclass calibration techniques.

*Maksim Maslov,Alexander Kugaevskikh,Matthew Ivanov*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes a regression method over distributions using Bernstein basis and Wasserstein distance, achieving competitive approximation quality, smoothness, and robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Regression over distributions is crucial in machine learning, but existing methods neglect geometric considerations or are computationally intensive.

Method: A conditional distribution is modeled as a smooth probability trajectory using Bernstein polynomials and weighted sums of Gaussian components. The loss function utilizes averaged squared Wasserstein distance. Optimization employs autodiff-based techniques.

Result: The method offers competitive approximation quality across multiple metrics, smoothness, robustness, and interpretability in handling data structure changes and nonlinearities.

Conclusion: The approach balances geometric accuracy, computational efficiency, and interpretability, with potential for extensions to non-Gaussian distributions, entropy regularization, and high-dimensional data applications.

Abstract: This paper considers the problem of regression over distributions, which is
becoming increasingly important in machine learning. Existing approaches often
ignore the geometry of the probability space or are computationally expensive.
To overcome these limitations, a new method is proposed that combines the
parameterization of probability trajectories using a Bernstein basis and the
minimization of the Wasserstein distance between distributions. The key idea is
to model a conditional distribution as a smooth probability trajectory defined
by a weighted sum of Gaussian components whose parameters -- the mean and
covariance -- are functions of the input variable constructed using Bernstein
polynomials. The loss function is the averaged squared Wasserstein distance
between the predicted Gaussian distributions and the empirical data, which
takes into account the geometry of the distributions. An autodiff-based
optimization method is used to train the model. Experiments on synthetic
datasets that include complex trajectories demonstrated that the proposed
method provides competitive approximation quality in terms of the Wasserstein
distance, Energy Distance, and RMSE metrics, especially in cases of pronounced
nonlinearity. The model demonstrates trajectory smoothness that is better than
or comparable to alternatives and robustness to changes in data structure,
while maintaining high interpretability due to explicit parameterization via
control points. The developed approach represents a balanced solution that
combines geometric accuracy, computational practicality, and interpretability.
Prospects for further research include extending the method to non-Gaussian
distributions, applying entropy regularization to speed up computations, and
adapting the approach to working with high-dimensional data for approximating
surfaces and more complex structures.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Aeolus is a large-scale multi-modal dataset aimed at enhancing flight delay prediction by addressing spatiotemporal dynamics and enabling robust machine learning development.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing flight delay datasets are limited to plain tabular formats and fail to capture delay propagation dynamics, thus hindering accurate modeling and innovative research.

Method: Aeolus incorporates tabular data, flight chain modules modeling delay dependencies, and a flight network graph for relational connections. It ensures temporal splits, a wide range of features, and strict data leakage prevention.

Result: The dataset improves representation and benchmarking for tasks relating to regression, classification, temporal structure modeling, and graph learning. Baseline experiments and tools augment its adoption.

Conclusion: Aeolus bridges gaps in flight delay prediction research, supporting domain-specific investigations and advancing structured data modeling. The dataset and source code are publicly available.

Abstract: We introduce Aeolus, a large-scale Multi-modal Flight Delay Dataset designed
to advance research on flight delay prediction and support the development of
foundation models for tabular data. Existing datasets in this domain are
typically limited to flat tabular structures and fail to capture the
spatiotemporal dynamics inherent in delay propagation. Aeolus addresses this
limitation by providing three aligned modalities: (i) a tabular dataset with
rich operational, meteorological, and airportlevel features for over 50 million
flights; (ii) a flight chain module that models delay propagation along
sequential flight legs, capturing upstream and downstream dependencies; and
(iii) a flight network graph that encodes shared aircraft, crew, and airport
resource connections, enabling cross-flight relational reasoning. The dataset
is carefully constructed with temporal splits, comprehensive features, and
strict leakage prevention to support realistic and reproducible machine
learning evaluation. Aeolus supports a broad range of tasks, including
regression, classification, temporal structure modeling, and graph learning,
serving as a unified benchmark across tabular, sequential, and graph
modalities. We release baseline experiments and preprocessing tools to
facilitate adoption. Aeolus fills a key gap for both domain-specific modeling
and general-purpose structured data research.Our source code and data can be

*Colin Doumont,Victor Picheny,Viacheslav Borovitskiy,Henry Moss*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a unifying framework using heat kernels to enhance Bayesian Optimization (BO) in combinatorial tasks, and demonstrates their superiority over other kernels.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The aim is to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of Bayesian Optimization in combinatorial tasks, addressing the lack of understanding of relationships between existing combinatorial kernels.

Method: A systematic derivation of heat kernels as closed-form expressions, theoretical analysis to establish their equivalence with other kernels, and empirical validation through experiments.

Result: Heat kernels are proven theoretically and experimentally to be effective, insensitive to optima locations, and enable a fast pipeline that achieves state-of-the-art performance.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates that heat kernels offer better reliability and performance, providing a robust solution for BO applied to combinatorial domains.

Abstract: Bayesian Optimization (BO) has the potential to solve various combinatorial
tasks, ranging from materials science to neural architecture search. However,
BO requires specialized kernels to effectively model combinatorial domains.
Recent efforts have introduced several combinatorial kernels, but the
relationships among them are not well understood. To bridge this gap, we
develop a unifying framework based on heat kernels, which we derive in a
systematic way and express as simple closed-form expressions. Using this
framework, we prove that many successful combinatorial kernels are either
related or equivalent to heat kernels, and validate this theoretical claim in
our experiments. Moreover, our analysis confirms and extends the results
presented in Bounce: certain algorithms' performance decreases substantially
when the unknown optima of the function do not have a certain structure. In
contrast, heat kernels are not sensitive to the location of the optima. Lastly,
we show that a fast and simple pipeline, relying on heat kernels, is able to
achieve state-of-the-art results, matching or even outperforming certain slow
or complex algorithms.

Motivation: Although AI excels in knowledge and reasoning benchmarks, its economic value in practical labor automation is unclear, prompting the need for a new evaluation metric.

Method: The authors introduce the Remote Labor Index (RLI), consisting of real-world, multi-sector projects to evaluate AI agents' practical and economic performance.

Result: AI agents achieve near-minimal performance on the RLI, with a maximum automation rate of only 2.5%, suggesting limited current economic applicability.

Conclusion: The findings suggest a grounding of AI automation discussions in empirical evidence, promoting better tracking of AI impacts and helping stakeholders address AI-driven labor changes.

Abstract: AIs have made rapid progress on research-oriented benchmarks of knowledge and
reasoning, but it remains unclear how these gains translate into economic value

broadly multi-sector benchmark comprising real-world, economically valuable
projects designed to evaluate end-to-end agent performance in practical
settings. AI agents perform near the floor on RLI, with the highest-performing
agent achieving an automation rate of 2.5%. These results help ground
discussions of AI automation in empirical evidence, setting a common basis for
tracking AI impacts and enabling stakeholders to proactively navigate AI-driven

*Emmanouil Sylligardos,John Paparrizos,Themis Palpanas,Pierre Senellart,Paul Boniol*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper evaluates time series classification methods for model selection in anomaly detection, demonstrating they surpass individual methods in performance without significantly increasing execution time.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of a consistent best-performing anomaly detection method across diverse time series datasets, and to provide scalable, effective solutions through model selection using time series characteristics.

Method: Evaluated 234 model configurations using 16 base classifiers on over 1980 time series to determine the efficacy of time series classification as a model selection strategy for anomaly detection.

Result: The study shows that model selection methods based on time series classifications outperform single anomaly detection methods, achieving comparable execution speed.

Conclusion: Time series classification-based model selection improves anomaly detection and serves as a robust baseline for AutoML pipelines in diverse time series contexts.

Abstract: Anomaly detection is a fundamental task for time series analytics with
important implications for the downstream performance of many applications.
Despite increasing academic interest and the large number of methods proposed
in the literature, recent benchmarks and evaluation studies demonstrated that
no overall best anomaly detection methods exist when applied to very
heterogeneous time series datasets. Therefore, the only scalable and viable
solution to solve anomaly detection over very different time series collected
from diverse domains is to propose a model selection method that will select,
based on time series characteristics, the best anomaly detection methods to
run. Existing AutoML solutions are, unfortunately, not directly applicable to
time series anomaly detection, and no evaluation of time series-based
approaches for model selection exists. Towards that direction, this paper
studies the performance of time series classification methods used as model
selection for anomaly detection. In total, we evaluate 234 model configurations
derived from 16 base classifiers across more than 1980 time series, and we
propose the first extensive experimental evaluation of time series
classification as model selection for anomaly detection. Our results
demonstrate that model selection methods outperform every single anomaly
detection method while being in the same order of magnitude regarding execution
time. This evaluation is the first step to demonstrate the accuracy and
efficiency of time series classification algorithms for anomaly detection, and
represents a strong baseline that can then be used to guide the model selection
step in general AutoML pipelines. Preprint version of an article accepted at

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Reinforcement learning fine-tuning of large language models (LLMs) can suffer from instability caused by numerical mismatches due to BF16's rounding errors. Using FP16 instead eliminates the issue, enabling stable training and better performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address instability in RL fine-tuning of LLMs caused by policy mismatches due to numerical precision issues.

Method: Reverted floating point precision from BF16 to FP16 to eliminate rounding errors and align training and inference policies.

Result: Using FP16 led to more stable optimization, faster convergence, and stronger performance across tasks without changing model architectures or algorithms.

Conclusion: Adopting FP16 consistently in RL fine-tuning ensures stability and better outcomes, urging reevaluation of precision trade-offs in such contexts.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) fine-tuning of large language models (LLMs) often
suffers from instability due to the numerical mismatch between the training and
inference policies. While prior work has attempted to mitigate this issue
through algorithmic corrections or engineering alignments, we show that its
root cause lies in the floating point precision itself. The widely adopted
BF16, despite its large dynamic range, introduces large rounding errors that
breaks the consistency between training and inference. In this work, we
demonstrate that simply reverting to \textbf{FP16} effectively eliminates this
mismatch. The change is simple, fully supported by modern frameworks with only
a few lines of code change, and requires no modification to the model
architecture or learning algorithm. Our results suggest that using FP16
uniformly yields more stable optimization, faster convergence, and stronger
performance across diverse tasks, algorithms and frameworks. We hope these
findings motivate a broader reconsideration of precision trade-offs in RL
fine-tuning.

### [268] [Curly Flow Matching for Learning Non-gradient Field Dynamics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26645)
*Katarina Petrović,Lazar Atanackovic,Viggo Moro,Kacper Kapuśniak,İsmail İlkan Ceylan,Michael Bronstein,Avishek Joey Bose,Alexander Tong*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces a novel approach named Curly Flow Matching (Curly-FM) for modeling non-gradient field dynamics, addressing challenges in learning periodic behaviors that current methods fail to capture.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Many real-world natural systems exhibit non-gradient, periodic dynamics, which cannot be effectively modeled by gradient-based approaches that minimize energy functionals.

Method: Curly-FM utilizes a Schrödinger bridge problem with a non-zero drift reference process, incorporating inferred velocities alongside population-level snapshot data.

Result: Curly-FM showcases improved trajectory matching for reference processes and population marginals in applications such as single-cell studies, fluid dynamics, and ocean currents.

Conclusion: Curly-FM successfully extends flow matching models to better handle periodic behaviors in physical systems and broadens the scope of trajectory modeling approaches.

Abstract: Modeling the transport dynamics of natural processes from population-level
observations is a ubiquitous problem in the natural sciences. Such models rely
on key assumptions about the underlying process in order to enable faithful
learning of governing dynamics that mimic the actual system behavior. The de
facto assumption in current approaches relies on the principle of least action
that results in gradient field dynamics and leads to trajectories minimizing an
energy functional between two probability measures. However, many real-world
systems, such as cell cycles in single-cell RNA, are known to exhibit
non-gradient, periodic behavior, which fundamentally cannot be captured by
current state-of-the-art methods such as flow and bridge matching. In this
paper, we introduce Curly Flow Matching (Curly-FM), a novel approach that is
capable of learning non-gradient field dynamics by designing and solving a
Schr\"odinger bridge problem with a non-zero drift reference process -- in
stark contrast to typical zero-drift reference processes -- which is
constructed using inferred velocities in addition to population snapshot data.
We showcase Curly-FM by solving the trajectory inference problems for single
cells, computational fluid dynamics, and ocean currents with approximate
velocities. We demonstrate that Curly-FM can learn trajectories that better
match both the reference process and population marginals. Curly-FM expands
flow matching models beyond the modeling of populations and towards the
modeling of known periodic behavior in physical systems. Our code repository is

*Zaishuo Xia,Yukuan Lu,Xinyi Li,Yifan Xu,Yubei Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces Geometrically-Regularized World Models (GRWM), an approach to improve world model performance by focusing on enhancing representation learning for better long-horizon predictions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current world models struggle with brittleness and degradation over long horizons due to poor representation quality, which complicates learning dynamics in high-dimensional environments.

Method: The proposed GRWM enforces geometrically regularized latent representations by ensuring consecutive sensory points are close in latent space, improving their alignment with the true topology of the environment. This method requires minimal changes to architecture and is compatible with various generative backbones.

Result: In 3D deterministic environments and long-horizon prediction tasks, GRWM achieves significant improvements in rollout fidelity and stability, producing latent manifolds with better geometric structure.

Conclusion: Improving representation learning is a viable path to robust world models, enabling accurate long-term predictions without increasing the complexity of the dynamics module.

Abstract: A world model is an internal model that simulates how the world evolves.
Given past observations and actions, it predicts the future of both the
embodied agent and its environment. Accurate world models are essential for
enabling agents to think, plan, and reason effectively in complex, dynamic
settings. Despite rapid progress, current world models remain brittle and
degrade over long horizons. We argue that a central cause is representation
quality: exteroceptive inputs (e.g., images) are high-dimensional, and lossy or
entangled latents make dynamics learning unnecessarily hard. We therefore ask
whether improving representation learning alone can substantially improve
world-model performance. In this work, we take a step toward building a truly
accurate world model by addressing a fundamental yet open problem: constructing
a model that can fully clone and overfit to a deterministic 3D world. We
propose Geometrically-Regularized World Models (GRWM), which enforces that
consecutive points along a natural sensory trajectory remain close in latent
representation space. This approach yields significantly improved latent
representations that align closely with the true topology of the environment.
GRWM is plug-and-play, requires only minimal architectural modification, scales
with trajectory length, and is compatible with diverse latent generative
backbones. Across deterministic 3D settings and long-horizon prediction tasks,
GRWM significantly increases rollout fidelity and stability. Analyses show that
its benefits stem from learning a latent manifold with superior geometric
structure. These findings support a clear takeaway: improving representation
learning is a direct and useful path to robust world models, delivering
reliable long-horizon predictions without enlarging the dynamics module.

*Tommaso d'Orsi,Gleb Novikov*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper addresses the computation of top singular vectors under differential privacy, showing that rank-$r$ coherence and spectral gap influence error bounds, outperforming prior methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to analyze and improve upon existing methods to compute private rank-$r$ approximations of singular vectors in matrices under differential privacy.

Method: The method uses singular value decomposition and standard perturbation mechanisms, proving coherence preservation under Gaussian perturbations.

Result: The proposed algorithm achieves better guarantees particularly in dense settings, matching optimal non-private algorithms in single-spike PCA for the Wishart model.

Conclusion: The paper resolves a question in differential privacy and spans coherence preservation's implications, extending applications to graph problems like Max-Cut.

Abstract: We revisit the task of computing the span of the top $r$ singular vectors
$u_1, \ldots, u_r$ of a matrix under differential privacy. We show that a
simple and efficient algorithm -- based on singular value decomposition and
standard perturbation mechanisms -- returns a private rank-$r$ approximation
whose error depends only on the \emph{rank-$r$ coherence} of $u_1, \ldots, u_r$
and the spectral gap $\sigma_r - \sigma_{r+1}$. This resolves a question posed
by Hardt and Roth~\cite{hardt2013beyond}. Our estimator outperforms the state
of the art -- significantly so in some regimes. In particular, we show that in
the dense setting, it achieves the same guarantees for single-spike PCA in the
Wishart model as those attained by optimal non-private algorithms, whereas
prior private algorithms failed to do so.
  In addition, we prove that (rank-$r$) coherence does not increase under
Gaussian perturbations. This implies that any estimator based on the Gaussian
mechanism -- including ours -- preserves the coherence of the input. We
conjecture that similar behavior holds for other structured models, including
planted problems in graphs.
  We also explore applications of coherence to graph problems. In particular,
we present a differentially private algorithm for Max-Cut and other constraint
satisfaction problems under low coherence assumptions.

TL;DR: LoRAQuant is a mixed-precision quantization method for efficient LoRA adapter fine-tuning in large language models (LLMs), achieving lower bit usage and maintaining high performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the cumulative computational cost of using multiple lightweight LoRA adapters for large language models in real-world scenarios, enabling efficient customization and task compatibility.

Method: LoRAQuant leverages singular value decomposition (SVD) to reparameterize adapters, focusing on concentrating critical information into specific components for mixed-precision quantization—prioritizing higher precision for important features and ultra-low bitwidth for less important ones.

Result: Experiments conducted on LLaMA 2-7B, LLaMA 2-13B, and Mistral 7B models show LoRAQuant achieves comparable or superior performance while using fewer bits than other quantization methods.

Conclusion: LoRAQuant demonstrates the ability to optimize memory usage while maintaining or improving performance, offering an effective solution for scaling LoRA adapters in LLM applications.

Abstract: Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) has become a popular technique for
parameter-efficient fine-tuning of large language models (LLMs). In many
real-world scenarios, multiple adapters are loaded simultaneously to enable LLM
customization for personalized user experiences or to support a diverse range
of tasks. Although each adapter is lightweight in isolation, their aggregate
cost becomes substantial at scale. To address this, we propose LoRAQuant, a
mixed-precision post-training quantization method tailored to LoRA.
Specifically, LoRAQuant reparameterizes each adapter by singular value
decomposition (SVD) to concentrate the most important information into specific
rows and columns. This makes it possible to quantize the important components
to higher precision, while quantizing the rest to ultra-low bitwidth. We
conduct comprehensive experiments with LLaMA 2-7B, LLaMA 2-13B, and Mistral 7B
models on mathematical reasoning, coding, and summarization tasks. Results show
that our LoRAQuant uses significantly lower bits than other quantization
methods, but achieves comparable or even higher performance.

*Nick Heilenkötter*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces and analyzes regularization terms for training invertible neural networks to recover Bayesian point estimators, such as posterior mean and MAP. These regularizers enhance network stability and interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Bayesian point estimators like posterior mean and MAP are widely used in reconstruction problems. This paper explores whether regularization terms in invertible networks can achieve similar properties in a stable and interpretable manner.

Method: The approach includes designing regularization terms for training invertible neural networks. These terms are analyzed theoretically to connect them with Bayesian point estimators, and their impact on the forward operator and inverse reconstruction are studied.

Result: The study shows how specific regularization terms can recover properties of classical Bayesian estimators while maintaining stability. Numerical experiments support these findings, demonstrating enhanced interpretability and data-dependence.

Conclusion: Integrating Bayesian-inspired regularization terms in invertible neural networks provides a stable and interpretable approach to inverse problems, successfully recovering properties of classical Bayesian estimators.

Abstract: Can regularization terms in the training of invertible neural networks lead
to known Bayesian point estimators in reconstruction? Invertible networks are
attractive for inverse problems due to their inherent stability and
interpretability. Recently, optimization strategies for invertible neural
networks that approximate either a reconstruction map or the forward operator
have been studied from a Bayesian perspective, but each has limitations. To
address this, we introduce and analyze two regularization terms for the network
training that, upon inversion of the network, recover properties of classical
Bayesian point estimators: while the first can be connected to the posterior
mean, the second resembles the MAP estimator. Our theoretical analysis
characterizes how each loss shapes both the learned forward operator and its
inverse reconstruction map. Numerical experiments support our findings and
demonstrate how these loss-term regularizers introduce data-dependence in a
stable and interpretable way.

Conclusion: Researchers should include training seed variability in MU comparative performance evaluations to ensure fair representation.

Abstract: Machine unlearning (MU) aims to remove the influence of certain data points
from a trained model without costly retraining. Most practical MU algorithms
are only approximate and their performance can only be assessed empirically.
Care must therefore be taken to make empirical comparisons as representative as
possible. A common practice is to run the MU algorithm multiple times
independently starting from the same trained model. In this work, we
demonstrate that this practice can give highly non-representative results
because -- even for the same architecture and same dataset -- some MU methods
can be highly sensitive to the choice of random number seed used for model
training. We therefore recommend that empirical
comphttps://info.arxiv.org/help/prep#commentsarisons of MU algorithms should
also reflect the variability across different model training seeds.

*Tommaso d'Orsi,Gleb Novikov*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a simple perturbation mechanism for releasing covariance matrices under pure differential privacy, achieving optimal error for various scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To design an efficient mechanism for releasing covariance matrices under pure differential privacy with optimal error guarantees.

Method: The method involves a new perturbation mechanism tailored to ensure privacy while optimizing error bounds across Frobenius and $p$-Schatten norms. For smaller datasets, a projection onto the nuclear norm ball is used.

Result: The mechanism achieves information-theoretically optimal error for $p \geq 2$, optimal spectral norm error, and improves error bounds for small datasets compared to prior works.

Conclusion: The proposed method represents an advancement in differentially private covariance estimation, offering optimal error guarantees across multiple norms and dataset sizes.

Abstract: We present a simple perturbation mechanism for the release of $d$-dimensional
covariance matrices $\Sigma$ under pure differential privacy. For large
datasets with at least $n\geq d^2/\varepsilon$ elements, our mechanism recovers
the provably optimal Frobenius norm error guarantees of
\cite{nikolov2023private}, while simultaneously achieving best known error for
all other $p$-Schatten norms, with $p\in [1,\infty]$. Our error is
information-theoretically optimal for all $p\ge 2$, in particular, our
mechanism is the first purely private covariance estimator that achieves
optimal error in spectral norm.
  For small datasets $n< d^2/\varepsilon$, we further show that by projecting
the output onto the nuclear norm ball of appropriate radius, our algorithm
achieves the optimal Frobenius norm error $O(\sqrt{d\;\text{Tr}(\Sigma) /n})$,
improving over the known bounds of $O(\sqrt{d/n})$ of \cite{nikolov2023private}
and ${O}\big(d^{3/4}\sqrt{\text{Tr}(\Sigma)/n}\big)$ of
\cite{dong2022differentially}.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces "Sequence Transformation and Mixed Precision" (STaMP) quantization to improve accuracy during low-bit activation quantization for generative AI models while keeping latency and memory usage minimal.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the sharp accuracy degradation observed when generative AI model activations are quantized below 8 bits, and explore effective strategies for improving low-bit quantization.

Method: The authors proposed STaMP quantization, which employs linear transformations along the sequence dimension and uses mixed precision where a subset of tokens in activations is kept at higher precision.

Result: STaMP demonstrated improved accuracy for low-bit activation quantization in various language and visual models, complementing other activation and weight quantization techniques.

Conclusion: STaMP is an effective strategy for reducing inference latency and memory usage in generative AI models, without significantly compromising accuracy at low-bit quantization.

Abstract: Quantization is the key method for reducing inference latency, power and
memory footprint of generative AI models. However, accuracy often degrades
sharply when activations are quantized below eight bits. Recent work suggests
that invertible linear transformations (e.g. rotations) can aid quantization,
by reparameterizing feature channels and weights. In this paper, we propose
\textit{Sequence Transformation and Mixed Precision} (STaMP) quantization, a
novel strategy that applies linear transformations along the \textit{sequence}
dimension to exploit the strong local correlation in language and visual data.
By keeping a small number of tokens in each intermediate activation at higher
precision, we can maintain model accuracy at lower (average) activations
bit-widths. We evaluate STaMP on recent LVM and LLM architectures,
demonstrating that it significantly improves low bit width activation
quantization and complements established activation and weight quantization
methods including recent feature transformations.

*Jungyeon Koh,Hyeonsu Lyu,Jonggyu Jang,Hyun Jong Yang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes improved sampling techniques to make influence function computations more efficient and consistent, enhancing model analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Influence functions are useful for explaining the effects of training data on black-box models but require resource-intensive Hessian computations for the entire dataset, which is impractical.

Method: The paper introduces two sampling methods based on features and logits, selecting representative subsets to estimate influence functions more accurately and efficiently.

Result: The proposed method reduces computation time by 30.1% and memory usage by 42.2%, or improves the F1-score by 2.5% compared to baseline methods.

Conclusion: The advanced sampling techniques improve influence function estimation by reducing computational costs and increasing accuracy, providing a practical tool for analyzing training data influences in machine learning models.

Abstract: How can we explain the influence of training data on black-box models?
Influence functions (IFs) offer a post-hoc solution by utilizing gradients and
Hessians. However, computing the Hessian for an entire dataset is
resource-intensive, necessitating a feasible alternative. A common approach
involves randomly sampling a small subset of the training data, but this method
often results in highly inconsistent IF estimates due to the high variance in
sample configurations. To address this, we propose two advanced sampling
techniques based on features and logits. These samplers select a small yet
representative subset of the entire dataset by considering the stochastic
distribution of features or logits, thereby enhancing the accuracy of IF
estimations. We validate our approach through class removal experiments, a
typical application of IFs, using the F1-score to measure how effectively the
model forgets the removed class while maintaining inference consistency on the
remaining classes. Our method reduces computation time by 30.1% and memory
usage by 42.2%, or improves the F1-score by 2.5% compared to the baseline.

TL;DR: The research explores the generalizability of time series forecasting models for classification tasks, comparing representation extraction strategies and introducing embedding augmentations, showing competitive or superior performance to task-specific pre-trained models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To test whether pre-trained time series forecasting models can be repurposed for classification tasks and challenge the necessity of task-specific pre-training.

Method: The study compares representation extraction methods, introduces embedding augmentations, and evaluates forecasting models against state-of-the-art classification models.

Result: Forecasting models matched or surpassed classification models in accuracy, with a positive correlation observed between forecasting and classification performance.

Conclusion: It is feasible to use forecasting pre-trained models for classification tasks, presenting a pathway to general-purpose time series models without task-specific pre-training.

Abstract: Recent research on time series foundation models has primarily focused on
forecasting, leaving it unclear how generalizable their learned representations
are. In this study, we examine whether frozen pre-trained forecasting models
can provide effective representations for classification. To this end, we
compare different representation extraction strategies and introduce two
model-agnostic embedding augmentations. Our experiments show that the best
forecasting models achieve classification accuracy that matches or even
surpasses that of state-of-the-art models pre-trained specifically for
classification. Moreover, we observe a positive correlation between forecasting
and classification performance. These findings challenge the assumption that
task-specific pre-training is necessary, and suggest that learning to forecast
may provide a powerful route toward constructing general-purpose time series
foundation models.

*Tao Tao,Maissam Barkeshli*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper studies Transformers' ability to predict sequences from Permuted Congruential Generators (PCGs), a complex pseudo-random number generator, achieving remarkable results and revealing scaling laws and novel insights into model representations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformers have proven effective in sequence modeling, but understanding their capacity for learning and predicting highly complex sequences generated by PRNGs like PCGs remains unexplored. This paper aims to bridge that gap.

Method: The authors train Transformer models using datasets generated by PCGs with various moduli and truncation complexities, scaling up the moduli and dataset sizes. They apply curriculum learning for larger moduli and analyze embeddings for structural insights.

Result: Transformers successfully predict PCG sequences, including challenging one-bit truncations. They reveal a scaling law, with sequence requirements growing as √m for higher moduli and observe stagnation in optimization for larger moduli, addressed by curriculum learning.

Conclusion: Transformers demonstrate exceptional ability to learn complex PCG sequences, surpassing classical attacks. The study highlights scaling laws, curriculum training necessity, and a novel clustering behavior in embeddings for rotationally-invariant structures.

Abstract: We study the ability of Transformer models to learn sequences generated by
Permuted Congruential Generators (PCGs), a widely used family of pseudo-random
number generators (PRNGs). PCGs introduce substantial additional difficulty
over linear congruential generators (LCGs) by applying a series of bit-wise
shifts, XORs, rotations and truncations to the hidden state. We show that
Transformers can nevertheless successfully perform in-context prediction on
unseen sequences from diverse PCG variants, in tasks that are beyond published
classical attacks. In our experiments we scale moduli up to $2^{22}$ using up
to $50$ million model parameters and datasets with up to $5$ billion tokens.
Surprisingly, we find even when the output is truncated to a single bit, it can
be reliably predicted by the model. When multiple distinct PRNGs are presented
together during training, the model can jointly learn them, identifying
structures from different permutations. We demonstrate a scaling law with
modulus $m$: the number of in-context sequence elements required for
near-perfect prediction grows as $\sqrt{m}$. For larger moduli, optimization
enters extended stagnation phases; in our experiments, learning moduli $m \geq
2^{20}$ requires incorporating training data from smaller moduli, demonstrating
a critical necessity for curriculum learning. Finally, we analyze embedding
layers and uncover a novel clustering phenomenon: the model spontaneously
groups the integer inputs into bitwise rotationally-invariant clusters,
revealing how representations can transfer from smaller to larger moduli.

Motivation: Address challenges of energy consumption and functionality in deploying AI on edge devices by exploring brain-inspired learning mechanisms for real-time adaptation.

Method: Proposed VDSP for memristive synapses based on Hebbian principles, optimizing unsupervised and local learning without complex spike-shaping circuits. Adapted VDSP for distinct memristive devices and simulated spiking neural networks integrating these devices.

Result: Achieved state-of-the-art performance in MNIST pattern recognition tasks with over 83% accuracy using 200 neurons; assessed impact of device variability, proposing mitigation strategies.

Conclusion: VDSP is efficient for in-memory computing and unsupervised learning on edge devices, showcasing robust performance despite device variability and promising potential for AI deployment.

Abstract: The deployment of AI on edge computing devices faces significant challenges
related to energy consumption and functionality. These devices could greatly
benefit from brain-inspired learning mechanisms, allowing for real-time
adaptation while using low-power. In-memory computing with nanoscale resistive
memories may play a crucial role in enabling the execution of AI workloads on
these edge devices. In this study, we introduce voltage-dependent synaptic
plasticity (VDSP) as an efficient approach for unsupervised and local learning
in memristive synapses based on Hebbian principles. This method enables online
learning without requiring complex pulse-shaping circuits typically necessary
for spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP). We show how VDSP can be
advantageously adapted to three types of memristive devices (TiO$_2$,
HfO$_2$-based metal-oxide filamentary synapses, and HfZrO$_4$-based
ferroelectric tunnel junctions (FTJ)) with disctinctive switching
characteristics. System-level simulations of spiking neural networks
incorporating these devices were conducted to validate unsupervised learning on
MNIST-based pattern recognition tasks, achieving state-of-the-art performance.
The results demonstrated over 83% accuracy across all devices using 200
neurons. Additionally, we assessed the impact of device variability, such as
switching thresholds and ratios between high and low resistance state levels,
and proposed mitigation strategies to enhance robustness.

Main category: cs.NE

TL;DR: The paper introduces Neurochaos Learning (NL), a chaos-inspired algorithm, to improve forest fire prediction by overcoming limitations of traditional ML and DL tools.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of accuracy in existing machine learning and deep learning models for forest fire classification due to their inability to handle nonlinearity and dependence on large datasets.

Method: The authors propose Neurochaos Learning (NL), which uses one-dimensional chaotic maps (like the Generalized Lüroth Series) as neurons and incorporates randomness and heterogeneity via Random Heterogeneous Neurochaos Learning (RHNL).

Result: RHNL achieves an F1 Score of 1.0 for the Algerian Forest Fires Dataset, with high precision scores for Canadian (0.90) and Portugal (0.68) datasets.

Conclusion: Neurochaos Learning demonstrates better performance and interpretability than traditional ML classifiers, especially with limited training data, and holds promise for effective forest fire detection systems.

Abstract: Forest fires are among the most dangerous and unpredictable natural disasters
worldwide. Forest fire can be instigated by natural causes or by humans. They
are devastating overall, and thus, many research efforts have been carried out
to predict whether a fire can occur in an area given certain environmental
variables. Many research works employ Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning
(DL) models for classification; however, their accuracy is merely adequate and
falls short of expectations. This limit arises because these models are unable
to depict the underlying nonlinearity in nature and extensively rely on
substantial training data, which is hard to obtain. We propose using Neurochaos
Learning (NL), a chaos-based, brain-inspired learning algorithm for forest fire
classification. Like our brains, NL needs less data to learn nonlinear patterns
in the training data. It employs one-dimensional chaotic maps, namely the
Generalized L\"uroth Series (GLS), as neurons. NL yields comparable performance
with ML and DL models, sometimes even surpassing them, particularly in
low-sample training regimes, and unlike deep neural networks, NL is
interpretable as it preserves causal structures in the data. Random
Heterogenous Neurochaos Learning (RHNL), a type of NL where different chaotic
neurons are randomnly located to mimic the randomness and heterogeneity of
human brain gives the best F1 score of 1.0 for the Algerian Forest Fires
Dataset. Compared to other traditional ML classifiers considered, RHNL also
gives high precision score of 0.90 for Canadian Forest Fires Dataset and 0.68
for Portugal Forest Fires Dataset. The results obtained from this work indicate
that Neurochaos Learning (NL) architectures achieve better performance than
conventional machine learning classifiers, highlighting their promise for
developing more efficient and reliable forest fire detection systems.

Main category: cs.NE

TL;DR: This paper proposes using wireless sensor networks as a hardware platform for distributed artificial neural networks to tackle real-time, large-scale problems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Neural networks currently face limitations in real-time computation of large-scale problems due to hardware constraints in traditional silicon and optics-based computing.

Method: The approach uses wireless sensor networks with hundreds of thousands of nodes for parallel, distributed computation of neural network algorithms.

Result: Real-time computation of large-scale problems becomes achievable using massively distributed hardware for neural network implementations.

Conclusion: The method can advance neural computing by solving large-scale, complex problems in real time, potentially revolutionizing the field.

Abstract: We are proposing fully parallel and maximally distributed hardware
realization of a generic neuro-computing system. More specifically, the
proposal relates to the wireless sensor networks technology to serve as a
massively parallel and fully distributed hardware platform to implement and
realize artificial neural network (ANN) algorithms. A parallel and distributed
(PDP) hardware realization of ANNs makes it possible to have real time
computation of large-scale (and complex) problems in a highly robust framework.
We will demonstrate how a network of hundreds of thousands of processing nodes
(or motes of a wireless sensor network), which have on-board processing and
wireless communication features, can be used to implement fully parallel and
massively distributed computation of artificial neural network algorithms for
solution of truly large-scale problems in real time. The realization of
artificial neural network algorithms in a massively parallel and fully
distributed hardware has been the goal of neural network computing researchers.
This is because a parallel and distributed computation of artificial neural
network algorithms could not have been achieved against all the advancements in
silicon- or optics-based computing. Accordingly, artificial neural networks
could not be applied to very large-scale problems for real time computation of
solutions. This hindered the development of neural algorithms for affordable
and practical solutions of challenging problems since often special-purpose
computing approaches in hardware, software or hybrid (non-neural) had to be
developed for and fine-tuned to specific problems that are very large-scale and
highly complex. Successful implementation is likely to revolutionize computing
as we know it by making it possible to solve very large scale scientific,
engineering or technical problems in real time.

*Izzy Grosof,Daniela Hurtado-Lange*

Main category: cs.PF

TL;DR: This paper introduces SEK-SMOD, a new scheduling policy, which outperforms the current SRPT-$k$ policy in reducing mean response time across various loads and job sizes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a superior scheduling policy that improves mean response time beyond what is achieved by SRPT-$k$ in a multiserver setting.

Method: The paper uses a novel hybrid approach combining worst-case and stochastic techniques for analyzing the proposed policy's deviations from the SRPT-$k$ policy.

Result: SEK-SMOD is shown to outperform SRPT-$k$ in all scenarios, and simulations validate its effectiveness. Practical-SEK, a simplified variant, also demonstrates consistent improvement.

Conclusion: The proposed SEK-SMOD policy improves server utilization and reduces mean response time, representing progress in scheduling policies for multiserver systems.

Abstract: A well-designed scheduling policy can unlock significant performance
improvements with no additional resources. Multiserver SRPT (SRPT-$k$) is known
to achieve asymptotically optimal mean response time in the heavy traffic
limit, as load approaches capacity. No better policy is known for the M/G/$k$
queue in any regime.
  We introduce a new policy, SRPT-Except-$k+1$ & Modified SRPT (SEK-SMOD),
which is the first policy to provably achieve lower mean response time than
SRPT-$k$. SEK-SMOD outperforms SRPT-$k$ across all loads and all job size
distributions. The key idea behind SEK-SMOD is to prioritize large jobs over
small jobs in specific scenarios to improve server utilization, and thereby
improve the response time of subsequent jobs in expectation. Our proof is a
novel application of hybrid worst-case and stochastic techniques to relative
analysis, where we analyze the deviations of our proposed SEK-SMOD policy away
from the SRPT-$k$ baseline policy. Furthermore, we design Practical-SEK (a
simplified variant of SEK-SMOD) and empirically verify the improvement over
SRPT-$k$ via simulation.

TL;DR: The paper introduces System-X, a hardware-centric system optimization framework for machine learning applications, using hardware signals to detect anomalies and optimize resources.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address inefficiencies in resource optimization caused by lack of workload insight in virtualization-based cloud platforms.

Method: System-X leverages unsupervised learning and hardware signals from various platforms to identify anomalies, eliminating the need for workload-specific information.

Result: System-X identifies network and configuration issues, achieving a significant acceleration of 5.97% in the DeepSeek model.

Conclusion: System-X effectively demonstrates the potential of hardware-centric optimization in cloud-based machine learning ecosystems without requiring workload knowledge.

Abstract: Modern machine learning (ML) has grown into a tightly coupled, full-stack
ecosystem that combines hardware, software, network, and applications. Many
users rely on cloud providers for elastic, isolated, and cost-efficient
resources. Unfortunately, these platforms as a service use virtualization,
which means operators have little insight into the users' workloads. This
hinders resource optimizations by the operator, which is essential to ensure
cost efficiency and minimize execution time. In this paper, we argue that
workload knowledge is unnecessary for system-level optimization. We propose
System-X, which takes a \emph{hardware-centric} approach, relying only on
hardware signals -- fully accessible by operators. Using low-level signals
collected from the system, System-X detects anomalies through an unsupervised
learning pipeline. The pipeline is developed by analyzing over 30 popular ML
models on various hardware platforms, ensuring adaptability to emerging
workloads and unknown deployment patterns. Using System-X, we successfully
identified both network and system configuration issues, accelerating the
DeepSeek model by 5.97%.

*Abdelhakim Ziani,András Horváth,Paolo Ballarini*

Main category: cs.PF

TL;DR: The paper introduces a hybrid model combining Bernstein phase-type and hyperexponential distributions to better capture both body and tail characteristics of heavy-tailed distributions, addressing modeling challenges in multiple domains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Heavy-tailed distributions occur in diverse domains and are difficult to model due to slow tail decay. Current models like Bernstein phase-type and hyperexponential distributions have limitations in capturing features of heavy-tailed behaviors either in the body or tail areas.

Method: The proposed method develops a hybrid model combining Bernstein phase-type (BPH) and hyperexponential (HE) distributions, optimizing initial parameter selection for the HE component to enhance robustness and avoid model invalidity.

Result: Experimental validation shows the hybrid model outperforms individual BPH or HE models by effectively capturing both body and tail characteristics of heavy-tailed distributions. It improves matching on metrics like mean and coefficient of variation.

Conclusion: The hybrid model presents a more effective approach for modeling heavy-tailed distributions, showing practical accuracy and precision across applications such as queuing theory.

Abstract: Heavy-tailed distributions, prevalent in a lot of real-world applications
such as finance, telecommunications, queuing theory, and natural language
processing, are challenging to model accurately owing to their slow tail decay.
Bernstein phase-type (BPH) distributions, through their analytical tractability
and good approximations in the non-tail region, can present a good solution,
but they suffer from an inability to reproduce these heavy-tailed behaviors
exactly, thus leading to inadequate performance in important tail areas. On the
contrary, while highly adaptable to heavy-tailed distributions,
hyperexponential (HE) models struggle in the body part of the distribution.
Additionally, they are highly sensitive to initial parameter selection,
significantly affecting their precision.
  To solve these issues, we propose a novel hybrid model of BPH and HE
distributions, borrowing the most desirable features from each for enhanced
approximation quality. Specifically, we leverage an optimization to set initial
parameters for the HE component, significantly enhancing its robustness and
reducing the possibility that the associated procedure results in an invalid HE
model. Experimental validation demonstrates that the novel hybrid approach is
more performant than individual application of BPH or HE models. More
precisely, it can capture both the body and the tail of heavy-tailed
distributions, with a considerable enhancement in matching parameters such as
mean and coefficient of variation. Additional validation through experiments
utilizing queuing theory proves the practical usefulness, accuracy, and
precision of our hybrid approach.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve search strategies in logic programming by achieving fairness and efficiency, and applying this to worst-case optimal joins.

Method: The approach involves implementing fairness in search strategies through bounded work and seekable iterator interfaces.

Result: Demonstrates worst-case optimal joins implemented using a seekable iterator interface, inspired by miniKanren's strategy.

Conclusion: Fairness via bounded work offers an elegant and compositional approach for optimizing joins in functional languages.

Abstract: miniKanren's key semantic advance over Prolog is to implement a complete yet
efficient search strategy, fairly interleaving execution between disjuncts.
This fairness is accomplished by bounding how much work is done exploring one
disjunct before switching to the next. We show that the same idea -- fairness
via bounded work -- underlies an elegant compositional approach to implementing
worst-case optimal joins using a seekable iterator interface, suitable for
shallow embedding in functional languages.

TL;DR: This paper introduces Debate2Create (D2C), a framework where large language models collaboratively optimize robot morphology and control through iterative debates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Designing effective robot morphology and control requires overcoming challenges like vast design space and tight coupling between body and behavior.

Method: D2C uses a dialectical process where one agent proposes morphological changes, another designs tailored reward functions, and judges provide feedback based on simulations, guiding iterative refinement.

Result: The D2C method develops diverse, specialized robot designs that outperform baseline designs, achieving a 73% improvement on a quadruped locomotion benchmark.

Conclusion: Structured debates among LLM agents, supported by simulation feedback, can be a transformative approach for automated robot co-design.

Abstract: Automating the co-design of a robot's morphology and control is a
long-standing challenge due to the vast design space and the tight coupling
between body and behavior. We introduce Debate2Create (D2C), a framework in
which large language model (LLM) agents engage in a structured dialectical
debate to jointly optimize a robot's design and its reward function. In each
round, a design agent proposes targeted morphological modifications, and a
control agent devises a reward function tailored to exploit the new design. A
panel of pluralistic judges then evaluates the design-control pair in
simulation and provides feedback that guides the next round of debate. Through
iterative debates, the agents progressively refine their proposals, producing
increasingly effective robot designs. Notably, D2C yields diverse and
specialized morphologies despite no explicit diversity objective. On a
quadruped locomotion benchmark, D2C discovers designs that travel 73% farther
than the default, demonstrating that structured LLM-based debate can serve as a
powerful mechanism for emergent robot co-design. Our results suggest that
multi-agent debate, when coupled with physics-grounded feedback, is a promising
new paradigm for automated robot design.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world robotic systems require a mathematical framework to navigate environments while ensuring safety and efficiently handling risks associated with obstacles.

Method: The authors propose using Poisson's equation to formulate a safety function and Laplace's equation with flux boundary conditions to generate a safety guidance field that incorporates variable caution levels. These are combined to create a risk-aware safety filter.

Result: The proposed method ensures safety for navigating robots and incorporates obstacle risk awareness. Results are demonstrated through simulations.

Conclusion: This approach allows robots to navigate safely while actively considering the risk levels of environmental features and obstacles. It offers a mathematical framework for safer and more informed robotic behavior.

understanding of their environment to properly determine safe actions. This
work aims to develop the mathematical underpinnings of such a representation --
specifically, the goal is to develop safety filters that are risk-aware. To
this end, we take a two step approach: encoding an understanding of the
environment via Poisson's equation, and associated risk via Laplace guidance
fields. That is, we first solve a Dirichlet problem for Poisson's equation to
generate a safety function that encodes system safety as its 0-superlevel set.
We then separately solve a Dirichlet problem for Laplace's equation to
synthesize a safe \textit{guidance field} that encodes variable levels of
caution around obstacles -- by enforcing a tunable flux boundary condition. The
safety function and guidance fields are then combined to define a safety
constraint and used to synthesize a risk-aware safety filter which, given a
semantic understanding of an environment with associated risk levels of
environmental features, guarantees safety while prioritizing avoidance of
higher risk obstacles. We demonstrate this method in simulation and discuss how
\textit{a priori} understandings of obstacle risk can be directly incorporated
into the safety filter to generate safe behaviors that are risk-aware.

### [289] [Curvature-Aware Calibration of Tactile Sensors for Accurate Force Estimation on Non-Planar Surfaces](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25965)
*Luoyan Zhong,Heather Jin Hee Kim,Dylan P. Losey,Cara M. Nunez*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Flexible tactile sensors are calibrated using a novel curvature-aware model rather than the common flat-surface approach, improving accuracy and reliability on curved surfaces.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the accuracy and consistency issues of flexible tactile sensors when mounted on curved or irregular surfaces.

Method: Developed a curvature-aware calibration model and trained a neural network (multilayer perceptron) to predict local curvature from baseline sensor outputs.

Result: Validation on five objects with varying curvatures showed consistent force accuracy across all surfaces while flat calibration underestimated force on curved geometries.

Conclusion: Curvature-aware modeling enhances performance, reliability, and practical usability of flexible tactile sensors in real-world applications involving curved surfaces.

Abstract: Flexible tactile sensors are increasingly used in real-world applications
such as robotic grippers, prosthetic hands, wearable gloves, and assistive
devices, where they need to conform to curved and irregular surfaces. However,
most existing tactile sensors are calibrated only on flat substrates, and their
accuracy and consistency degrade once mounted on curved geometries. This
limitation restricts their reliability in practical use. To address this
challenge, we develop a calibration model for a widely used resistive tactile
sensor design that enables accurate force estimation on one-dimensional curved
surfaces. We then train a neural network (a multilayer perceptron) to predict
local curvature from baseline sensor outputs recorded under no applied load,
achieving an R2 score of 0.91. The proposed approach is validated on five daily
objects with varying curvatures under forces from 2 N to 8 N. Results show that
the curvature-aware calibration maintains consistent force accuracy across all
surfaces, while flat-surface calibration underestimates force as curvature
increases. Our results demonstrate that curvature-aware modeling improves the
accuracy, consistency, and reliability of flexible tactile sensors, enabling
dependable performance across real-world applications.

### [290] [A New Type of Axis-Angle Attitude Control Law for Rotational Systems: Synthesis, Analysis, and Experiments](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25985)
*Francisco M. F. R. Gonçalves,Ryan M. Bena,Néstor O. Pérez-Arancibia*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel attitude control law that guarantees a unique closed-loop equilibrium quaternion and improves rotational system performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of quaternion-based attitude control methods, particularly the lack of unique closed-loop equilibrium and reduced proportional-control effectiveness for large rotational errors.

Method: The authors propose a new axis-angle-based attitude control law and validate its effectiveness using two control laws, strict Lyapunov function construction for stability proof, simulations, and real-time flight tests.

Result: The axis-angle-based method ensures a unique closed-loop equilibrium, demonstrates uniform asymptotic stability, and achieves superior stabilization time compared to traditional quaternion-based controllers.

Conclusion: The proposed approach enhances the efficiency and performance of rotational system control (e.g., drones) through improved attitude control laws leveraging axis-angle information.

Abstract: Over the past few decades, continuous quaternion-based attitude control has
been proven highly effective for driving rotational systems that can be modeled
as rigid bodies, such as satellites and drones. However, methods rooted in this
approach do not enforce the existence of a unique closed-loop (CL) equilibrium
attitude-error quaternion (AEQ); and, for rotational errors about the
attitude-error Euler axis larger than {\pi}rad, their proportional-control
effect diminishes as the system state moves away from the stable equilibrium of
the CL rotational dynamics. In this paper, we introduce a new type of attitude
control law that more effectively leverages the attitude-error Euler axis-angle
information to guarantee a unique CL equilibrium AEQ and to provide greater
flexibility in the use of proportional-control efforts. Furthermore, using two
different control laws as examples-through the construction of a strict
Lyapunov function for the CL dynamics-we demonstrate that the resulting unique
equilibrium of the CL rotational system can be enforced to be uniformly
asymptotically stable. To assess and demonstrate the functionality and
performance of the proposed approach, we performed numerical simulations and
executed dozens of real-time tumble-recovery maneuvers using a small quadrotor.
These simulations and flight tests compellingly demonstrate that the proposed
axis-angle-based method achieves superior flight performance-compared with that
obtained using a high-performance quaternion-based controller-in terms of
stabilization time.

*Bai Li,Achilleas Kourtellis,Rong Cao,Joseph Post,Brian Porter,Yu Zhang*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: DARTS is a drone-based, AI-powered system for real-time traffic incident detection, offering high accuracy, adaptability, and scalability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional traffic incident detection systems have limitations such as reduced flexibility, reliance on dense infrastructure, and lack of adaptability to changing hotspots, necessitating innovative solutions.

Method: Developed DARTS with drone-based adaptive surveillance, thermal imaging for low visibility, and a lightweight AI framework for real-time vehicle trajectory extraction and incident detection.

Result: DARTS achieved 99% detection accuracy, detected and verified incidents faster than local centers, and monitored congestion propagation, showcasing operational advantages.

Conclusion: DARTS demonstrates potential scalability, cost-effectiveness, and improved responsiveness, indicating its transformative impact on traffic management systems.

Abstract: Rapid and reliable incident detection is critical for reducing crash-related
fatalities, injuries, and congestion. However, conventional methods, such as
closed-circuit television, dashcam footage, and sensor-based detection,
separate detection from verification, suffer from limited flexibility, and
require dense infrastructure or high penetration rates, restricting
adaptability and scalability to shifting incident hotspots. To overcome these
challenges, we developed DARTS, a drone-based, AI-powered real-time traffic
incident detection system. DARTS integrates drones' high mobility and aerial
perspective for adaptive surveillance, thermal imaging for better
low-visibility performance and privacy protection, and a lightweight deep
learning framework for real-time vehicle trajectory extraction and incident
detection. The system achieved 99% detection accuracy on a self-collected
dataset and supports simultaneous online visual verification, severity
assessment, and incident-induced congestion propagation monitoring via a
web-based interface. In a field test on Interstate 75 in Florida, DARTS
detected and verified a rear-end collision 12 minutes earlier than the local
transportation management center and monitored incident-induced congestion
propagation, suggesting potential to support faster emergency response and
enable proactive traffic control to reduce congestion and secondary crash risk.
Crucially, DARTS's flexible deployment architecture reduces dependence on
frequent physical patrols, indicating potential scalability and
cost-effectiveness for use in remote areas and resource-constrained settings.
This study presents a promising step toward a more flexible and integrated
real-time traffic incident detection system, with significant implications for
the operational efficiency and responsiveness of modern transportation
management.

*Petr Stibinger,Tomas Baca,Daniela Doubravova,Jan Rusnak,Jaroslav Solc,Jan Jakubek,Petr Stepan,Martin Saska*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel method for detecting and localizing radioactive sources using cooperating Micro Aerial Vehicles equipped with lightweight Compton cameras.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve radiation detection capabilities by leveraging advancements in lightweight detector technology and MAV swarming techniques.

Method: The study uses 40g Compton cameras mounted on MAVs. These cameras provide sparse measurements that are fused in real-time onboard the MAVs. Swarming dynamics optimize information gathering and vehicle motion to track radiation sources.

Result: Real-time radiation source localization, even with sparse measurements, is made possible. The MAV swarm effectively stabilizes and cooperates to maximize camera data and track moving radiation sources.

Conclusion: The innovative combination of lightweight Compton cameras and coordinated MAV swarming enables effective detection and tracking of radioactive materials in dynamic environments.

Abstract: We present a novel approach to localizing radioactive material by cooperating
Micro Aerial Vehicles (MAVs). Our approach utilizes a state-of-the-art
single-detector Compton camera as a highly sensitive, yet miniature detector of
ionizing radiation. The detector's exceptionally low weight (40 g) opens up new
possibilities of radiation detection by a team of cooperating agile MAVs. We
propose a new fundamental concept of fusing the Compton camera measurements to
estimate the position of the radiation source in real time even from extremely
sparse measurements. The data readout and processing are performed directly
onboard and the results are used in a dynamic feedback to drive the motion of
the vehicles. The MAVs are stabilized in a tightly cooperating swarm to
maximize the information gained by the Compton cameras, rapidly locate the
radiation source, and even track a moving radiation source.

*Emily Steiner,Daniel van der Spuy,Futian Zhou,Afereti Pama,Minas Liarokapis,Henry Williams*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper discusses a novel autonomous racing and overtaking agent applied in the F1Tenth Competition, achieving significant advancements in safe navigation and overtaking during wheel-to-wheel racing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the limitations of current algorithms in reliably completing overtaking maneuvers during autonomous wheel-to-wheel racing, which is crucial for improving performance and safety.

Method: The researchers developed an AI agent trained to navigate tracks and execute overtaking strategies in both simulation and real-world scenarios, using the F1Tenth platform to validate its performance.

Result: The developed agent achieved an overtaking success rate of 87% compared to 56% for agents trained solely for racing, demonstrating its superior ability to overtake reliably.

Conclusion: The study concludes that training an autonomous agent specifically for overtaking improves its performance in competitive wheel-to-wheel racing scenarios, which can be beneficial for advancing autonomous racing algorithms.

Abstract: While autonomous racing performance in Time-Trial scenarios has seen
significant progress and development, autonomous wheel-to-wheel racing and
overtaking are still severely limited. These limitations are particularly
apparent in real-life driving scenarios where state-of-the-art algorithms
struggle to safely or reliably complete overtaking manoeuvres. This is
important, as reliable navigation around other vehicles is vital for safe
autonomous wheel-to-wheel racing. The F1Tenth Competition provides a useful
opportunity for developing wheel-to-wheel racing algorithms on a standardised
physical platform. The competition format makes it possible to evaluate
overtaking and wheel-to-wheel racing algorithms against the state-of-the-art.
This research presents a novel racing and overtaking agent capable of learning
to reliably navigate a track and overtake opponents in both simulation and
reality. The agent was deployed on an F1Tenth vehicle and competed against
opponents running varying competitive algorithms in the real world. The results
demonstrate that the agent's training against opponents enables deliberate
overtaking behaviours with an overtaking rate of 87% compared 56% for an agent
trained just to race.

*Chi Zhang,Mingrui Li,Wenzhe Tong,Xiaonan Huang*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper proposes a novel reinforcement learning method using a graph neural network (GNN) that improves learning stability and efficiency for tensegrity robots, validated by experiments demonstrating real-world and simulation success.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Tensegrity robots excel in resilience and deployability but face difficulties in control due to underactuated and highly coupled dynamics. A better control solution is needed.

Method: The framework integrates a graph neural network (GNN) into the Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) algorithm, representing the robot as a graph to manage physical topology and coupling dynamics efficiently.

Result: Validated on a physical 3-bar tensegrity robot, the method achieved superior sample efficiency, noise tolerance, stiffness variation robustness, and trajectory accuracy. The learned policies transferred effectively from simulation to hardware.

Conclusion: Incorporating structural priors via GNNs into reinforcement learning significantly enhances tensegrity robot control, enabling stable and accurate locomotion both in simulation and real-world applications.

Abstract: Tensegrity robots combine rigid rods and elastic cables, offering high
resilience and deployability but posing major challenges for locomotion control
due to their underactuated and highly coupled dynamics. This paper introduces a
morphology-aware reinforcement learning framework that integrates a graph
neural network (GNN) into the Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) algorithm. By
representing the robot's physical topology as a graph, the proposed GNN-based
policy captures coupling among components, enabling faster and more stable
learning than conventional multilayer perceptron (MLP) policies. The method is
validated on a physical 3-bar tensegrity robot across three locomotion
primitives, including straight-line tracking and bidirectional turning. It
shows superior sample efficiency, robustness to noise and stiffness variations,
and improved trajectory accuracy. Notably, the learned policies transfer
directly from simulation to hardware without fine-tuning, achieving stable
real-world locomotion. These results demonstrate the advantages of
incorporating structural priors into reinforcement learning for tensegrity
robot control.

*Fan Yang,Renkai Ma,Yaxin Hu,Michael Rodgers,Lingyao Li*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper analyzes the emotional impact of discontinuing social robots like Moxie for children, proposing a shared responsibility framework for mitigating harm.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the emotional distress caused to children when emotional bonds with social robots are abruptly severed due to service discontinuation, and to explore accountability for mitigating such harms.

Method: A qualitative survey was conducted with 72 U.S. participants, examining their perspectives on responsibility, accountability, and ways to address the issue.

Result: Findings indicate shared responsibility across robot companies, parents, developers, and governments, with varying views influenced by political ideology and parental status. Participants offered polarized opinions on whether robot services should be continued and how.

Conclusion: The research proposes a shared responsibility framework to distribute accountability, offering design and policy recommendations to safeguard children's emotional wellbeing when robot companionship ends.

Abstract: Social robots like Moxie are designed to form strong emotional bonds with
children, but their abrupt discontinuation can cause significant struggles and
distress to children. When these services end, the resulting harm raises
complex questions of who bears responsibility when children's emotional bonds
are broken. Using the Moxie shutdown as a case study through a qualitative
survey of 72 U.S. participants, our findings show that the responsibility is
viewed as a shared duty across the robot company, parents, developers, and
government. However, these attributions varied by political ideology and
parental status of whether they have children. Participants' perceptions of
whether the robot service should continue are highly polarized; supporters
propose technical, financial, and governmental pathways for continuity, while
opponents cite business realities and risks of unhealthy emotional dependency.
Ultimately, this research contributes an empirically grounded shared
responsibility framework for safeguarding child-robot companionship by
detailing how accountability is distributed and contested, informing concrete
design and policy implications to mitigate the emotional harm of robot
discontinuation.

*Fan Yang,Lingyao Li,Yaxin Hu,Michael Rodgers,Renkai Ma*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This study examines the effects of robot anthropomorphism on human protective responses to robot abuse, finding non-linear patterns and moral shifts depending on anthropomorphic features.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore how levels of anthropomorphism in robots influence human protective behaviors and moral judgments, contributing to the understanding of moral engagement with robots.

Method: The study involved 201 participants who watched videos of robots with varying anthropomorphism levels (low, moderate, high) being abused. Data was collected using self-report surveys, automated facial expression analysis, and qualitative reflections.

Result: Protective responses and anger were strongest for a moderately anthropomorphic robot. As anthropomorphism increased, moral reasoning shifted from technical damage assessment to character condemnation of the abuser, with legal and societal responsibility implications broadening.

Conclusion: The uncanny valley effect heightens protective impulses instead of damping moral concern. The findings have implications for robot design, ethical considerations, and legal frameworks around robotics.

Abstract: Robots with anthropomorphic features are increasingly shaping how humans
perceive and morally engage with them. Our research investigates how different
levels of anthropomorphism influence protective responses to robot abuse,
extending the Computers as Social Actors (CASA) and uncanny valley theories
into a moral domain. In an experiment, we invite 201 participants to view
videos depicting abuse toward a robot with low (Spider), moderate (Two-Foot),
or high (Humanoid) anthropomorphism. To provide a comprehensive analysis, we
triangulate three modalities: self-report surveys measuring emotions and
uncanniness, physiological data from automated facial expression analysis, and
qualitative reflections. Findings indicate that protective responses are not
linear. The moderately anthropomorphic Two-Foot robot, rated highest in
eeriness and "spine-tingling" sensations consistent with the uncanny valley,
elicited the strongest physiological anger expressions. Self-reported anger and
guilt are significantly higher for both the Two-Foot and Humanoid robots
compared to the Spider. Qualitative findings further reveal that as
anthropomorphism increases, moral reasoning shifts from technical assessments
of property damage to condemnation of the abuser's character, while governance
proposals expand from property law to calls for quasi-animal rights and broader
societal responsibility. These results suggest that the uncanny valley does not
dampen moral concern but paradoxically heightens protective impulses, offering
critical implications for robot design, policy, and future legal frameworks.

TL;DR: This paper examines embodied intelligence (EI) in microrobot design, emphasizing co-design methodology. Several microrobotic platforms are showcased to demonstrate EI principles.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore embodied intelligence (EI) as a design principle for enhancing locomotion and navigation in advanced microrobotics.

Method: The paper utilizes co-design to simultaneously integrate physical structure and behavioral function, contrasting EI-inspired designs with traditional decoupled architectures.

Result: Robots developed by the AMSL team exhibit intelligent behavior through structural dynamics and environmental interaction. The paper showcases platforms like Bee++, RoBeetle, and others to demonstrate practical applications of EI.

Conclusion: Co-design enables embodied intelligence in microrobotics, providing a scalable and effective alternative to traditional control methods for small-scale robotic systems.

Abstract: The term embodied intelligence (EI) conveys the notion that body morphology,
material properties, interaction with the environment, and control strategies
can be purposefully integrated into the process of robotic design to generate
intelligent behavior; in particular, locomotion and navigation. In this paper,
we discuss EI as a design principle for advanced microrobotics, with a
particular focus on co-design -- the simultaneous and interdependent
development of physical structure and behavioral function. To illustrate the
contrast between EI-inspired systems and traditional architectures that
decouple sensing, computation, and actuation, we present and discuss a
collection of robots developed by the author and his team at the Autonomous
Microrobotic Systems Laboratory (AMSL). These robots exhibit intelligent
behavior that emerges from their structural dynamics and the physical
interaction between their components and with the environment. Platforms such
as the Bee++, RoBeetle, SMALLBug, SMARTI, WaterStrider, VLEIBot+, and FRISSHBot
exemplify how feedback loops, decision logics, sensing mechanisms, and smart
actuation strategies can be embedded into the physical properties of the
robotic system itself. Along these lines, we contend that co-design is not only
a method for empirical optimization under constraints, but also an enabler of
EI, offering a scalable and robust alternative to classical control for
robotics at the mm-to-cm-scale.

*Minseo Kwon,Young J. Kim*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper introduces a new kinodynamic Task and Motion Planning (TAMP) framework that integrates symbolic and numerical planning with visual rendering guidance, achieving high success rates and reduced planning time in comparison to traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing TAMP methods struggle with long-horizon issues due to excessive motion sampling, and LLMs lack spatial reasoning or feasibility verification. This paper seeks to address these limitations.

Method: The framework employs a hybrid state tree for joint task and motion decision-making, integrates kinodynamic constraints verified by motion planners and physics engines, and utilizes guidance from a vision-language model (VLM) based on visual renderings.

Result: The proposed framework delivers 32.14% to 1166.67% higher success rates compared to traditional and LLM-based TAMP planners while also reducing planning time in complex problems.

Conclusion: The integration of hybrid state representation, kinodynamic constraints, and VLM guidance significantly improves efficiency and effectiveness in solving complex TAMP problems.

Abstract: Task and Motion Planning (TAMP) integrates high-level task planning with
low-level motion feasibility, but existing methods are costly in long-horizon
problems due to excessive motion sampling. While LLMs provide commonsense
priors, they lack 3D spatial reasoning and cannot ensure geometric or dynamic
feasibility. We propose a kinodynamic TAMP framework based on a hybrid state
tree that uniformly represents symbolic and numeric states during planning,
enabling task and motion decisions to be jointly decided. Kinodynamic
constraints embedded in the TAMP problem are verified by an off-the-shelf
motion planner and physics simulator, and a VLM guides exploring a TAMP
solution and backtracks the search based on visual rendering of the states.
Experiments on the simulated domains and in the real world show 32.14% -
1166.67% increased average success rates compared to traditional and LLM-based
TAMP planners and reduced planning time on complex problems, with ablations
further highlighting the benefits of VLM guidance.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces an adaptive trajectory refinement algorithm for mobile robots in cluttered environments, improving safety and efficiency during planning and execution.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome challenges in trajectory planning for mobile robots in narrow and cluttered environments, where existing methods often fail or result in suboptimal solutions.

Method: The approach uses a two-stage algorithm: (1) segment-wise conservative collision testing to eliminate risks by recursive trajectory subdivision, and (2) pose-level safety refinement using penetration direction and line search to ensure collision-free and obstacle-distant paths.

Result: The algorithm demonstrated up to 1.69x higher success rates and up to 3.79x faster planning times compared to state-of-the-art techniques in simulations. Real-world tests confirmed safe navigation through narrow passages with efficient planning.

Conclusion: The proposed refinement algorithm successfully enhances trajectory planning, allowing mobile robots to navigate cluttered environments safely and efficiently in real-world and simulated scenarios.

Abstract: Trajectory planning for mobile robots in cluttered environments remains a
major challenge due to narrow passages, where conventional methods often fail
or generate suboptimal paths. To address this issue, we propose the adaptive
trajectory refinement algorithm, which consists of two main stages. First, to
ensure safety at the path-segment level, a segment-wise conservative collision
test is applied, where risk-prone trajectory path segments are recursively
subdivided until collision risks are eliminated. Second, to guarantee
pose-level safety, pose correction based on penetration direction and line
search is applied, ensuring that each pose in the trajectory is collision-free
and maximally clear from obstacles. Simulation results demonstrate that the
proposed method achieves up to 1.69x higher success rates and up to 3.79x
faster planning times than state-of-the-art approaches. Furthermore, real-world
experiments confirm that the robot can safely pass through narrow passages
while maintaining rapid planning performance.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a method combining CNN and Vision Transformer for improved self-localization using a monocular camera, achieving higher accuracy even in dynamic environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable accurate self-localization on a 3D map for autonomous driving using an inexpensive monocular camera, overcoming the limitations of existing convolutional neural network-based methods when dynamic obstacles are present.

Method: The proposed method integrates CNN with Vision Transformer to leverage the extraction of both local and global features. CNNs handle local feature extraction while Vision Transformers focus on global relationships between image patches.

Result: Experimental results indicate a 1.5x accuracy improvement in dynamic scenarios compared to SOTA methods. The mean localization error is reduced by 20.1%, and the robot achieves an average localization error of 7.51 cm.

Conclusion: The combination of CNN and Vision Transformer enhances self-localization accuracy and robustness, making autonomous driving more reliable even in environments with dynamic obstacles.

Abstract: Self-localization on a 3D map by using an inexpensive monocular camera is
required to realize autonomous driving. Self-localization based on a camera
often uses a convolutional neural network (CNN) that can extract local features
that are calculated by nearby pixels. However, when dynamic obstacles, such as
people, are present, CNN does not work well. This study proposes a new method
combining CNN with Vision Transformer, which excels at extracting global
features that show the relationship of patches on whole image. Experimental
results showed that, compared to the state-of-the-art method (SOTA), the
accuracy improvement rate in a CG dataset with dynamic obstacles is 1.5 times
higher than that without dynamic obstacles. Moreover, the self-localization
error of our method is 20.1% smaller than that of SOTA on public datasets.
Additionally, our robot using our method can localize itself with 7.51cm error
on average, which is more accurate than SOTA.

TL;DR: PHUMA leverages human video data at scale for humanoid locomotion, while addressing physical artifacts to improve motion imitation reliability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing approaches rely on high-quality but scarce motion capture datasets, limiting scalability and diversity. Recent methods using large-scale video data often introduce physical artifacts, which compromise stable imitation.

Method: PHUMA uses human video data at scale with physics-constrained retargeting and curated data processing to ensure physical plausibility, such as eliminating foot skating, ensuring joint limits, and maintaining ground contact.

Result: PHUMA-trained policies outperformed industry benchmarks like Humanoid-X and AMASS in both unseen motion imitation and path following tasks with pelvis-only guidance.

Conclusion: PHUMA improves scalability and physical reliability in humanoid locomotion datasets, making it more effective for training humanlike motion behaviors.

Abstract: Motion imitation is a promising approach for humanoid locomotion, enabling
agents to acquire humanlike behaviors. Existing methods typically rely on
high-quality motion capture datasets such as AMASS, but these are scarce and
expensive, limiting scalability and diversity. Recent studies attempt to scale
data collection by converting large-scale internet videos, exemplified by
Humanoid-X. However, they often introduce physical artifacts such as floating,
penetration, and foot skating, which hinder stable imitation. In response, we
introduce PHUMA, a Physically-grounded HUMAnoid locomotion dataset that
leverages human video at scale, while addressing physical artifacts through
careful data curation and physics-constrained retargeting. PHUMA enforces joint
limits, ensures ground contact, and eliminates foot skating, producing motions
that are both large-scale and physically reliable. We evaluated PHUMA in two
sets of conditions: (i) imitation of unseen motion from self-recorded test
videos and (ii) path following with pelvis-only guidance. In both cases,
PHUMA-trained policies outperform Humanoid-X and AMASS, achieving significant
gains in imitating diverse motions. The code is available at

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper presents Thor, a humanoid framework designed for human-level whole-body reactions in environments requiring force-rich interactions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable humanoid robots to perform human-like adaptive responses in force-rich and contact-intensive scenarios for applications in service, industry, and rescue.

Method: The authors proposed a framework, Thor, which utilizes a reinforcement learning architecture decoupling upper body, waist, and lower body control. They designed a force-adaptive torso-tilt (FAT2) reward function to drive human-like responses during force interactions.

Result: The framework was implemented on the Unitree G1 robot, with enhancements in force-interaction tasks, achieving peak pulling forces (167.7 N backward, 145.5 N forward) surpassing baselines by 68.9% and 74.7%. Thor successfully performed tasks like pulling a loaded rack and opening a fire door.

Conclusion: Thor demonstrates a significant improvement in humanoid force interaction capabilities, enabling effective task performance in contact-intensive environments, thus advancing humanoid applications in challenging scenarios.

Abstract: Humanoids hold great potential for service, industrial, and rescue
applications, in which robots must sustain whole-body stability while
performing intense, contact-rich interactions with the environment. However,
enabling humanoids to generate human-like, adaptive responses under such
conditions remains a major challenge. To address this, we propose Thor, a
humanoid framework for human-level whole-body reactions in contact-rich
environments. Based on the robot's force analysis, we design a force-adaptive
torso-tilt (FAT2) reward function to encourage humanoids to exhibit human-like
responses during force-interaction tasks. To mitigate the high-dimensional
challenges of humanoid control, Thor introduces a reinforcement learning
architecture that decouples the upper body, waist, and lower body. Each
component shares global observations of the whole body and jointly updates its
parameters. Finally, we deploy Thor on the Unitree G1, and it substantially
outperforms baselines in force-interaction tasks. Specifically, the robot
achieves a peak pulling force of 167.7 N (approximately 48% of the G1's body
weight) when moving backward and 145.5 N when moving forward, representing
improvements of 68.9% and 74.7%, respectively, compared with the
best-performing baseline. Moreover, Thor is capable of pulling a loaded rack
(130 N) and opening a fire door with one hand (60 N). These results highlight
Thor's effectiveness in enhancing humanoid force-interaction capabilities.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable autonomous robots to perform effective, real-time 3D scene understanding in dynamic and structurally repetitive orchards.

Method: AgriGS-SLAM combines direct LiDAR odometry, loop closures, and multi-camera 3D Gaussian Splatting rendering. It utilizes batch rasterization for recovering occluded structures and a unified gradient-driven map lifecycle for memory optimization and fine detail preservation, with pose refinement driven by probabilistic depth consistency.

Result: The system was deployed on orchard platforms and evaluated across seasons using apple and pear orchards, showcasing improved reconstruction sharpness, trajectory stability, and real-time performance compared to recent 3DGS-SLAM baselines.

Conclusion: AgriGS-SLAM delivers enhanced multimodal perception and real-time performance for orchard monitoring but can also be utilized for other outdoor scenarios needing robust sensing.

Abstract: Autonomous robots in orchards require real-time 3D scene understanding
despite repetitive row geometry, seasonal appearance changes, and wind-driven
foliage motion. We present AgriGS-SLAM, a Visual--LiDAR SLAM framework that
couples direct LiDAR odometry and loop closures with multi-camera 3D Gaussian
Splatting (3DGS) rendering. Batch rasterization across complementary viewpoints
recovers orchard structure under occlusions, while a unified gradient-driven
map lifecycle executed between keyframes preserves fine details and bounds
memory. Pose refinement is guided by a probabilistic LiDAR-based depth
consistency term, back-propagated through the camera projection to tighten
geometry-appearance coupling. We deploy the system on a field platform in apple
and pear orchards across dormancy, flowering, and harvesting, using a
standardized trajectory protocol that evaluates both training-view and
novel-view synthesis to reduce 3DGS overfitting in evaluation. Across seasons
and sites, AgriGS-SLAM delivers sharper, more stable reconstructions and
steadier trajectories than recent state-of-the-art 3DGS-SLAM baselines while
maintaining real-time performance on-tractor. While demonstrated in orchard
monitoring, the approach can be applied to other outdoor domains requiring
robust multimodal perception.

### [304] [Cooperative Task Spaces for Multi-Arm Manipulation Control based on Similarity Transformations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26362)
*Tobias Löw,Cem Bilaloglu,Sylvain Calinon*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces a theoretical framework for multi-arm robotic systems using conformal geometric algebra. It facilitates simplified modeling and control for complex robotic systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address difficulties in coordinating movements in multi-arm robotic systems, often due to their high degrees of freedom, to enable collaborative tasks.

Method: The authors utilize conformal geometric algebra to create cooperative task spaces and derive analytic and geometric Jacobian matrices to simplify the control of multi-arm systems.

Result: The framework supports effective integration into operational space control, demonstrated using bimanual manipulators, humanoids, and multi-fingered hands in experiments such as optimal control for geometric primitives and teleoperation.

Conclusion: The research lays the theoretical groundwork for cooperative manipulation control in robots, simplifying control modeling and enabling potential applications in collaborative robotics.

Abstract: Many tasks in human environments require collaborative behavior between
multiple kinematic chains, either to provide additional support for carrying
big and bulky objects or to enable the dexterity that is required for in-hand
manipulation. Since these complex systems often have a very high number of
degrees of freedom coordinating their movements is notoriously difficult to
model. In this article, we present the derivation of the theoretical
foundations for cooperative task spaces of multi-arm robotic systems based on
geometric primitives defined using conformal geometric algebra. Based on the
similarity transformations of these cooperative geometric primitives, we derive
an abstraction of complex robotic systems that enables representing these
systems in a way that directly corresponds to single-arm systems. By deriving
the associated analytic and geometric Jacobian matrices, we then show the
straightforward integration of our approach into classical control techniques
rooted in operational space control. We demonstrate this using bimanual
manipulators, humanoids and multi-fingered hands in optimal control experiments
for reaching desired geometric primitives and in teleoperation experiments
using differential kinematics control. We then discuss how the geometric
primitives naturally embed nullspace structures into the controllers that can
be exploited for introducing secondary control objectives. This work,
represents the theoretical foundations of this cooperative manipulation control
framework, and thus the experiments are presented in an abstract way, while
giving pointers towards potential future applications.

*Ilya Kurinov,Miroslav Ivanov,Grzegorz Orzechowski,Aki Mikkola*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper addresses the automation of forestry forwarders by training reinforcement learning agents to handle the full log loading process, achieving a 94% success rate.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study seeks to reduce the physical and mental stress on operators of forestry forwarders, who work in challenging and remote conditions for extended periods.

Method: The researchers developed a simulation model using NVIDIA's Isaac Gym and virtual environments. Reinforcement learning and curriculum learning approaches were employed to train an agent capable of automating log handling operations.

Result: The trained reinforcement learning agent achieved a 94% success rate in grasping and transporting logs from random positions to the forestry forwarder bed.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates the potential for reinforcement learning agents to advance automation in forestry forwarder operations, marking progress towards reducing human operator strain.

Abstract: Forestry forwarders play a central role in mechanized timber harvesting by
picking up and moving logs from the felling site to a processing area or a
secondary transport vehicle. Forwarder operation is challenging and physically
and mentally exhausting for the operator who must control the machine in remote
areas for prolonged periods of time. Therefore, even partial automation of the
process may reduce stress on the operator. This study focuses on continuing
previous research efforts in application of reinforcement learning agents in
automating log handling process, extending the task from grasping which was
studied in previous research to full log loading operation. The resulting agent
will be capable to automate a full loading procedure from locating and
grappling to transporting and delivering the log to a forestry forwarder bed.
To train the agent, a trailer type forestry forwarder simulation model in
NVIDIA's Isaac Gym and a virtual environment for a typical log loading scenario
were developed. With reinforcement learning agents and a curriculum learning
approach, the trained agent may be a stepping stone towards application of
reinforcement learning agents in automation of the forestry forwarder. The
agent learnt grasping a log in a random position from grapple's random position
and transport it to the bed with 94% success rate of the best performing agent.

*Guanxing Lu,Rui Zhao,Haitao Lin,He Zhang,Yansong Tang*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The study introduces Hi-ORS, a post-training method for vision-language-action models in robotic manipulation, combining the stability of imitation learning with the robustness of reinforcement learning by using rejection sampling and a novel reward-weighted training approach.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the instability of reinforcement learning in fine-tuning vision-language-action models and the offline nature of imitation learning, leading to inefficiencies in robotic manipulation task training.

Method: The proposed Hi-ORS uses rejection sampling to filter out negatively rewarded samples during fine-tuning, employs a reward-weighted supervised objective for better training, and incorporates online human-in-the-loop corrections for systematic error recovery learning.

Result: In real-world experimentation across three tasks and two embodiments, Hi-ORS fine-tuned policies within 1.5 hours, demonstrating superior performance and efficiency compared to RL and IL baselines, including robust error-recovery abilities.

Conclusion: Hi-ORS is an effective post-training method that stabilizes training, ensures robustness, and enables fast fine-tuning and superior performance in complex robotic manipulation tasks.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) is widely used to produce robust robotic
manipulation policies, but fine-tuning vision-language-action (VLA) models with
RL can be unstable due to inaccurate value estimates and sparse supervision at
intermediate steps. In contrast, imitation learning (IL) is easy to train but
often underperforms due to its offline nature. In this paper, we propose
Hi-ORS, a simple yet effective post-training method that utilizes rejection
sampling to achieve both training stability and high robustness. Hi-ORS
stabilizes value estimation by filtering out negatively rewarded samples during
online fine-tuning, and adopts a reward-weighted supervised training objective
to provide dense intermediate-step supervision. For systematic study, we
develop an asynchronous inference-training framework that supports flexible
online human-in-the-loop corrections, which serve as explicit guidance for
learning error-recovery behaviors. Across three real-world tasks and two
embodiments, Hi-ORS fine-tunes a pi-base policy to master contact-rich
manipulation in just 1.5 hours of real-world training, outperforming RL and IL
baselines by a substantial margin in both effectiveness and efficiency.
Notably, the fine-tuned policy exhibits strong test-time scalability by
reliably executing complex error-recovery behaviors to achieve better
performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The proliferation of collaborative robots highlights challenges in achieving lifelong adaptability, scalable coordination, and robust scheduling, which existing methods fail to address due to limitations in memory representation.

Method: The researchers propose RoboOS-NeXT, a memory-based framework featuring STEM that unifies spatial geometry, temporal history, and embodiment data, integrated into a brain-cerebellum model to facilitate effective multi-robot collaboration.

Result: Experiments conducted in various domains, like restaurants and households, demonstrate the superior performance of RoboOS-NeXT in heterogeneous robot embodiments.

Conclusion: RoboOS-NeXT provides a scalable and robust solution for lifelong multi-robot collaboration, overcoming key challenges in memory representation and coordination tasks.

Abstract: The proliferation of collaborative robots across diverse tasks and
embodiments presents a central challenge: achieving lifelong adaptability,
scalable coordination, and robust scheduling in multi-agent systems. Existing
approaches, from vision-language-action (VLA) models to hierarchical
frameworks, fall short due to their reliance on limited or dividual-agent
memory. This fundamentally constrains their ability to learn over long
horizons, scale to heterogeneous teams, or recover from failures, highlighting
the need for a unified memory representation. To address these limitations, we
introduce RoboOS-NeXT, a unified memory-based framework for lifelong, scalable,
and robust multi-robot collaboration. At the core of RoboOS-NeXT is the novel
Spatio-Temporal-Embodiment Memory (STEM), which integrates spatial scene
geometry, temporal event history, and embodiment profiles into a shared
representation. This memory-centric design is integrated into a
brain-cerebellum framework, where a high-level brain model performs global
planning by retrieving and updating STEM, while low-level controllers execute
actions locally. This closed loop between cognition, memory, and execution
enables dynamic task allocation, fault-tolerant collaboration, and consistent
state synchronization. We conduct extensive experiments spanning complex
coordination tasks in restaurants, supermarkets, and households. Our results
demonstrate that RoboOS-NeXT achieves superior performance across heterogeneous
embodiments, validating its effectiveness in enabling lifelong, scalable, and
robust multi-robot collaboration. Project website:

### [308] [Adaptive Inverse Kinematics Framework for Learning Variable-Length Tool Manipulation in Robotics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26551)
*Prathamesh Kothavale,Sravani Boddepalli*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper proposes a framework improving robots' tool usage, including skill transfer from simulation to real-world scenarios, achieving high accuracy in inverse kinematics and tool manipulation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome limitations in conventional robots' understanding of kinematics and tool usage, enabling efficient tool-based task execution.

Method: Developed an advanced inverse kinematics solver and simulation-learned action trajectory for robots to acquire and transfer tool manipulation skills.

Result: Robot's extended inverse kinematics solver achieved less than 1 cm error rate, and the trained policy in simulation had a mean error of 8 cm. Performance remained consistent with tools of varying lengths.

Conclusion: The research presents a pioneering framework for robotic tool usage, indicating its potential to address fundamental aspects of tool manipulation and enable diverse task execution.

Abstract: Conventional robots possess a limited understanding of their kinematics and
are confined to preprogrammed tasks, hindering their ability to leverage tools
efficiently. Driven by the essential components of tool usage - grasping the
desired outcome, selecting the most suitable tool, determining optimal tool
orientation, and executing precise manipulations - we introduce a pioneering
framework. Our novel approach expands the capabilities of the robot's inverse
kinematics solver, empowering it to acquire a sequential repertoire of actions
using tools of varying lengths. By integrating a simulation-learned action
trajectory with the tool, we showcase the practicality of transferring acquired
skills from simulation to real-world scenarios through comprehensive
experimentation. Remarkably, our extended inverse kinematics solver
demonstrates an impressive error rate of less than 1 cm. Furthermore, our
trained policy achieves a mean error of 8 cm in simulation. Noteworthy, our
model achieves virtually indistinguishable performance when employing two
distinct tools of different lengths. This research provides an indication of
potential advances in the exploration of all four fundamental aspects of tool
usage, enabling robots to master the intricate art of tool manipulation across
diverse tasks.

### [309] [FLYINGTRUST: A Benchmark for Quadrotor Navigation Across Scenarios and Vehicles](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26588)
*Gang Li,Chunlei Zhai,Teng Wang,Shaun Li,Shangsong Jiang,Xiangwei Zhu*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: FLYINGTRUST is a benchmarking framework that evaluates how quadrotor kinodynamics and scene structure impact navigation performance across platforms and scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges and risks associated with deploying visual navigation algorithms across different quadrotor platforms and scene geometries.

Method: FLYINGTRUST uses compact indicators for vehicle capability, combines scenarios and platforms for a standardized evaluation protocol, and provides a composite scoring system for analyzing navigation performance.

Result: Repeated trials showed predictable dependencies of navigation success on platform capability and scene geometry, highlighting distinct algorithm preferences and failure modes.

Conclusion: Both platform capability and scenario structure must be considered in algorithm design and evaluation to enhance robustness over various conditions.

Abstract: Visual navigation algorithms for quadrotors often exhibit a large variation
in performance when transferred across different vehicle platforms and scene
geometries, which increases the cost and risk of field deployment. To support
systematic early-stage evaluation, we introduce FLYINGTRUST, a high-fidelity,
configurable benchmarking framework that measures how platform kinodynamics and
scenario structure jointly affect navigation robustness. FLYINGTRUST models
vehicle capability with two compact, physically interpretable indicators:
maximum thrust-to-weight ratio and axis-wise maximum angular acceleration. The
benchmark pairs a diverse scenario library with a heterogeneous set of real and
virtual platforms and prescribes a standardized evaluation protocol together
with a composite scoring method that balances scenario importance, platform
importance and performance stability. We use FLYINGTRUST to compare
representative optimization-based and learning-based navigation approaches
under identical conditions, performing repeated trials per platform-scenario
combination and reporting uncertainty-aware metrics. The results reveal
systematic patterns: navigation success depends predictably on platform
capability and scene geometry, and different algorithms exhibit distinct
preferences and failure modes across the evaluated conditions. These
observations highlight the practical necessity of incorporating both platform
capability and scenario structure into algorithm design, evaluation, and
selection, and they motivate future work on methods that remain robust across
diverse platforms and scenarios.

### [310] [A Sliding-Window Filter for Online Continuous-Time Continuum Robot State Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26623)
*Spencer Teetaert,Sven Lilge,Jessica Burgner-Kahrs,Timothy D. Barfoot*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces a sliding-window filter (SWF) for continuous-time state estimation of continuum robots (CRs), achieving faster-than-real-time speeds with improved accuracy, while enabling online stochastic operation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous methods for state estimation in continuum robots struggled with either accuracy or computational efficiency. Continuous-time estimation faced runtime constraints and was limited to offline operation.

Method: The authors developed a novel sliding-window filter (SWF) designed for continuous-time state estimation, addressing stochastic needs and enabling online operation of CRs at faster-than-real-time speeds.

Result: The SWF provides accurate state estimation, operating online and faster than real time, marking progress compared to previous filtering methods for continuum robots.

Conclusion: This work introduces the first stochastic SLF for continuum robots that effectively combines accuracy, computational efficiency, online operation, and fast processing, opening up new research avenues for advanced robot estimation methods.

Abstract: Stochastic state estimation methods for continuum robots (CRs) often struggle
to balance accuracy and computational efficiency. While several recent works
have explored sliding-window formulations for CRs, these methods are limited to
simplified, discrete-time approximations and do not provide stochastic
representations. In contrast, current stochastic filter methods must run at the
speed of measurements, limiting their full potential. Recent works in
continuous-time estimation techniques for CRs show a principled approach to
addressing this runtime constraint, but are currently restricted to offline
operation. In this work, we present a sliding-window filter (SWF) for
continuous-time state estimation of CRs that improves upon the accuracy of a
filter approach while enabling continuous-time methods to operate online, all
while running at faster-than-real-time speeds. This represents the first
stochastic SWF specifically designed for CRs, providing a promising direction
for future research in this area.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a hierarchical framework that combines deep reinforcement learning methods, Deep Q-Network (DQN), and Twin Delayed Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (TD3) for efficient path-planning and control.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve efficiency and safety in path-planning and control tasks by utilizing a combination of deep reinforcement learning techniques.

Method: The framework uses a high-level DQN module for sub-goal selection and a low-level TD3-based controller for smooth motion execution. It involves reward shaping and a LiDAR-based safety gate to prevent unsafe motions.

Result: Experimental evaluation shows that the method achieves superior success rates, path efficiency, and reduced collisions compared to single-algorithm baselines and rule-based planners. It generalizes well to dynamic and unseen scenarios with fewer abrupt control changes.

Conclusion: The hierarchical framework enhances path-planning performance by combining DQN and TD3, providing a significant improvement over traditional and single-algorithm approaches. Its adaptability in dynamic environments is notable.

Abstract: This paper presents a hierarchical path-planning and control framework that
combines a high-level Deep Q-Network (DQN) for discrete sub-goal selection with
a low-level Twin Delayed Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (TD3) controller
for continuous actuation. The high-level module selects behaviors and
sub-goals; the low-level module executes smooth velocity commands. We design a
practical reward shaping scheme (direction, distance, obstacle avoidance,
action smoothness, collision penalty, time penalty, and progress), together
with a LiDAR-based safety gate that prevents unsafe motions. The system is
implemented in ROS + Gazebo (TurtleBot3) and evaluated with PathBench metrics,
including success rate, collision rate, path efficiency, and re-planning
efficiency, in dynamic and partially observable environments. Experiments show
improved success rate and sample efficiency over single-algorithm baselines
(DQN or TD3 alone) and rule-based planners, with better generalization to
unseen obstacle configurations and reduced abrupt control changes. Code and
evaluation scripts are available at the project repository.

### [313] [Heuristic Adaptation of Potentially Misspecified Domain Support for Likelihood-Free Inference in Stochastic Dynamical Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26656)
*Georgios Kamaras,Craig Innes,Subramanian Ramamoorthy*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper addresses the issue of suboptimal posterior inference due to support misspecification in likelihood-free inference (LFI) by proposing three heuristic variants that adapt the support during inference for robust parameter estimation and policy learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Likelihood-free inference (LFI) often faces challenges due to misspecified support in sampling, leading to suboptimal and falsely certain results in robotic applications.

Method: The paper introduces and evaluates three heuristic LFI approaches—EDGE, MODE, and CENTRE—that dynamically adapt the inference support by interpreting the posterior mode shift occurring during iterative inference.

Result: Tests on stochastic dynamical benchmarks and a dynamic deformable linear object (DLO) manipulation task show that these methods improve parameter classification and enhance sim-based policy learning performance for robust robotic manipulation.

Conclusion: Adapting the support alongside posterior inference refines parameter estimation and boosts agent robustness, solving key issues of support misspecification inherent in standard LFI.

Abstract: In robotics, likelihood-free inference (LFI) can provide the domain
distribution that adapts a learnt agent in a parametric set of deployment
conditions. LFI assumes an arbitrary support for sampling, which remains
constant as the initial generic prior is iteratively refined to more
descriptive posteriors. However, a potentially misspecified support can lead to
suboptimal, yet falsely certain, posteriors. To address this issue, we propose
three heuristic LFI variants: EDGE, MODE, and CENTRE. Each interprets the
posterior mode shift over inference steps in its own way and, when integrated
into an LFI step, adapts the support alongside posterior inference. We first
expose the support misspecification issue and evaluate our heuristics using
stochastic dynamical benchmarks. We then evaluate the impact of heuristic
support adaptation on parameter inference and policy learning for a dynamic
deformable linear object (DLO) manipulation task. Inference results in a finer
length and stiffness classification for a parametric set of DLOs. When the
resulting posteriors are used as domain distributions for sim-based policy
learning, they lead to more robust object-centric agent performance.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Hybrid Consistency Policy (HCP) to enhance visuomotor policy learning by balancing fast sampling with strong multi-modality through a hybrid generation approach.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the challenges posed by existing diffusion-based imitation learning methods in achieving both fast sampling and strong multi-modality.

Method: HCP utilizes a short stochastic prefix followed by an adaptive switch to a one-step consistency jump. It combines a trajectory-consistency objective with a denoising-matching objective through time-varying consistency distillation.

Result: In both simulations and real robot tests, HCP with fewer steps approaches the accuracy and mode coverage of the more extensive DDPM teacher, offering reduced latency for practical applications.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates that it is possible to achieve a trade-off between accuracy and efficiency in diffusion-based policy learning, enabling faster and effective robot decisions without compromising multi-modality.

Abstract: In visuomotor policy learning, diffusion-based imitation learning has become
widely adopted for its ability to capture diverse behaviors. However,
approaches built on ordinary and stochastic denoising processes struggle to
jointly achieve fast sampling and strong multi-modality. To address these
challenges, we propose the Hybrid Consistency Policy (HCP). HCP runs a short
stochastic prefix up to an adaptive switch time, and then applies a one-step
consistency jump to produce the final action. To align this one-jump
generation, HCP performs time-varying consistency distillation that combines a
trajectory-consistency objective to keep neighboring predictions coherent and a
denoising-matching objective to improve local fidelity. In both simulation and
on a real robot, HCP with 25 SDE steps plus one jump approaches the 80-step
DDPM teacher in accuracy and mode coverage while significantly reducing
latency. These results show that multi-modality does not require slow
inference, and a switch time decouples mode retention from speed. It yields a
practical accuracy efficiency trade-off for robot policies.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the perceived limitations of large VLA models for real-time, dynamic tasks by improving inference speed.

Method: Employing a set of strategies to reduce inference overheads and creating a full streaming inference framework for real-time robot control.

Result: Achieved a 100% success rate in dynamic grasping tasks and demonstrated the capability to run at high frame and trajectory rates.

Conclusion: The proposed methods unlock real-time capabilities for VLA models, previously considered unattainable, and provide practical applications for robotics.

Abstract: In this paper, we show how to run pi0-level multi-view VLA at 30Hz frame rate
and at most 480Hz trajectory frequency using a single consumer GPU. This
enables dynamic and real-time tasks that were previously believed to be
unattainable by large VLA models. To achieve it, we introduce a bag of
strategies to eliminate the overheads in model inference. The real-world
experiment shows that the pi0 policy with our strategy achieves a 100% success
rate in grasping a falling pen task. Based on the results, we further propose a
full streaming inference framework for real-time robot control of VLA. Code is

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper proposes a holistic risk governance framework for enterprises engaging with open-source projects, moving from tactical risk management to proactive governance based on systematic analysis principles.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional risk management does not adequately address systemic threats faced by enterprises integrating open-source software, necessitating a shift to holistic risk governance.

Method: A grounded theory study with 15 practitioners to develop a risk governance framework, validated through expert analysis and case studies.

Result: The proposed framework integrates a Strategic Objectives Matrix, taxonomies for External Threats and Internal Vulnerabilities, and an actionable mitigation strategy.

Conclusion: The paper introduces a diagnostic tool and method for enterprises to proactively manage open-source risks, enabling better governance and building an organizational "immune system".

Abstract: Enterprise engagement with open source has evolved from tactical adoption to
strategic deep integration, exposing them to a complex risk landscape far
beyond mere code. However, traditional risk management, narrowly focused on
technical tools, is structurally inadequate for systemic threats like upstream
"silent fixes", community conflicts, or sudden license changes, creating a
dangerous governance blind spot. To address this governance vacuum and enable
the necessary shift from tactical risk management to holistic risk governance,
we conducted a grounded theory study with 15 practitioners to develop a
holistic risk governance framework. Our study formalizes an analytical
framework built on a foundational risk principle: an uncontrollable External
Threat (e.g., a sudden license change in a key dependency) only becomes a
critical risk when it exploits a controllable Internal Vulnerability (e.g., an
undefined risk appetite for single-vendor projects), which then amplifies the
impact.The framework operationalizes this principle through a clear logical
chain: "Objectives -> Threats -> Vulnerabilities -> Mitigation" (OTVM). This
provides a holistic decision model that transcends mere technical checklists.
Based on this logic, our contributions are: (1) a "Strategic Objectives Matrix"
to clarify goals; (2) a systematic dual taxonomy of External Threats (Ex-Tech,
Ex-Comm, Ex-Eco) and Internal Vulnerabilities (In-Strat, In-Ops, In-Tech); and
(3) an actionable mitigation framework mapping capability-building to these
vulnerabilities. The framework's analytical utility was validated by three
industry experts through retrospective case studies on real-world incidents.
This work provides a novel diagnostic lens and a systematic path for
enterprises to shift from reactive "firefighting" to proactively building an
organizational "immune system".

TL;DR: PRISM integrates advanced modeling and constraints-guided practices to generate compliant, high-assurance artifacts for critical domains like automotive and legal systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of generating regulator-ready and machine-checkable artifacts in compliance-critical fields, reducing manual effort and increasing reliability.

Method: PRISM combines three components: Unified Meta-Model for semantic reconciliation, Integrated Constraint Model for enforcing structural and logical constraints, and Constraint-Guided Verifiable Generation for prefix-safe decoding and validation.

Result: Demonstrated utility in producing immediately usable, compliant artifacts in automotive software engineering and legal jurisdiction scenarios, minimizing remediation effort.

Conclusion: PRISM shows promise in automating compliance-critical artifact generation with embedded assurance, enhancing efficiency while maintaining accuracy and auditability.

Abstract: PRISM unifies Large Language Models with Model-Driven Engineering to generate
regulator-ready artifacts and machine-checkable evidence for safety- and
compliance-critical domains. PRISM integrates three pillars: a Unified
Meta-Model (UMM) reconciles heterogeneous schemas and regulatory text into a
single semantic space; an Integrated Constraint Model (ICM) compiles structural
and semantic requirements into enforcement artifacts including generation-time
automata (GBNF, DFA) and post-generation validators (e.g., SHACL, SMT); and
Constraint-Guided Verifiable Generation (CVG) applies these through two-layer
enforcement - structural constraints drive prefix-safe decoding while
semantic/logical validation produces machine-checkable certificates. When
violations occur, PRISM performs audit-guided repair and records generation
traces for compliance review. We evaluate PRISM in automotive software
engineering (AUTOSAR) and cross-border legal jurisdiction (Brussels I bis).
PRISM produces structurally valid, auditable artifacts that integrate with
existing tooling and substantially reduce manual remediation effort, providing
a practical path toward automated artifact generation with built-in assurance.

### [319] [Environmental Impact of CI/CD Pipelines](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26413)
*Nuno Saavedra,Alexandra Mendes,João F. Ferreira*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper studies the environmental impact (carbon and water footprint) of GitHub Actions in CI/CD pipelines, revealing substantial ecological implications and suggesting strategies for mitigation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the unknown environmental impact of CI/CD services like GitHub Actions and evaluate their carbon and water footprints amidst growing concerns around cloud computing's environmental impact.

Method: Builds upon a Cloud Carbon Footprint framework to analyze 2.2 million workflow runs from over 18,000 repositories, focusing on open-source GitHub Actions usage.

Result: The GitHub Actions ecosystem incurs notable carbon (456.9 MTCO2e) and water (5,738.2 kiloliters) footprints in the most likely scenario for 2024. It compares these impacts to tree carbon capture and familial water usage to emphasize scale.

Conclusion: The research highlights the environmental challenges of GitHub Actions usage and proposes actionable strategies, such as regionally optimized runner deployment, stricter policies for scheduled runs, and repository size reduction, to minimize the impact.

Abstract: CI/CD pipelines are widely used in software development, yet their
environmental impact, particularly carbon and water footprints (CWF), remains
largely unknown to developers, as CI service providers typically do not
disclose such information. With the growing environmental impact of cloud
computing, understanding the CWF of CI/CD services has become increasingly
important.
  This work investigates the CWF of using GitHub Actions, focusing on
open-source repositories where usage is free and unlimited for standard
runners. We build upon a methodology from the Cloud Carbon Footprint framework
and we use the largest dataset of workflow runs reported in the literature to
date, comprising over 2.2 million workflow runs from more than 18,000
repositories.
  Our analysis reveals that the GitHub Actions ecosystem results in a
substantial CWF. Our estimates for the carbon footprint in 2024 range from
150.5 MTCO2e in the most optimistic scenario to 994.9 MTCO2e in the most
pessimistic scenario, while the water footprint ranges from 1,989.6 to 37,664.5
kiloliters. The most likely scenario estimates are 456.9 MTCO2e for carbon
footprint and 5,738.2 kiloliters for water footprint. To provide perspective,
the carbon footprint in the most likely scenario is equivalent to the carbon
captured by 7,615 urban trees in a year, and the water footprint is comparable
to the water consumed by an average American family over 5,053 years.
  We explore strategies to mitigate this impact, primarily by reducing wasted
computational resources. Key recommendations include deploying runners in
regions whose energy production has a low environmental impact such as France
and the United Kingdom, implementing stricter deactivation policies for
scheduled runs and aligning their execution with periods when the regional
energy mix is more environmentally favorable, and reducing the size of
repositories.

*Musfiqur Rahman,SayedHassan Khatoonabadi,Emad Shihab*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper analyzes the limitations of large language models (LLMs) in generating real-world class-level code, showing significant performance gaps compared to synthetic benchmarks and proposing improvement strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate and benchmark the capacity of LLMs in generating class-level code for practical, real-world software projects, contrasting it with synthetic benchmark performance.

Method: A novel benchmark was designed using open-source classes, categorized into seen and unseen partitions. Various configurations of LLMs were tested under different input specifications, levels of documentation completeness, and retrieval-augmented setups.

Result: LLMs performed poorly with 25%-34% accuracy on real-world tasks compared to 84%-89% on synthetic benchmarks. Retrieval-enhanced configurations improved correctness by 4%-7%, while error analysis highlighted TypeError and AttributeError prevalence.

Conclusion: The study reveals limitations in LLMs for class-level engineering tasks, suggesting enhancements in context modeling, integration of retrieval augmentation, and documentation strategies to improve production code assistance tools.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have advanced code generation at the function
level, yet their ability to produce correct class-level implementations in
authentic software projects remains poorly understood. This work introduces a
novel benchmark derived from open-source repositories, comprising real-world
classes divided into seen and unseen partitions to evaluate generalization
under practical conditions. The evaluation examines multiple LLMs under varied
input specifications, retrieval-augmented configurations, and documentation
completeness levels.
  Results reveal a stark performance disparity: LLMs achieve 84% to 89%
correctness on established synthetic benchmarks but only 25% to 34% on
real-world class tasks, with negligible differences between familiar and novel
codebases. Comprehensive docstrings yield modest gains of 1% to 3% in
functional accuracy, though statistical significance is rare.
Retrieval-augmented generation proves most effective with partial
documentation, improving correctness by 4% to 7% by supplying concrete
implementation patterns absent from specifications. Error profiling identifies
AttributeError, TypeError, and AssertionError as dominant failure modes (84% of
cases), with synthetic tests overemphasizing assertion issues and real-world
scenarios highlighting type and attribute mismatches. Retrieval augmentation
reduces logical flaws but can introduce dependency conflicts.
  The benchmark and analysis expose critical limitations in current LLM
capabilities for class-level engineering, offering actionable insights for
enhancing context modelling, documentation strategies, and retrieval
integration in production code assistance tools.

### [321] [Reduction of Test Re-runs by Prioritizing Potential Order Dependent Flaky Tests](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26171)
*Hasnain Iqbal,Zerina Begum,Kazi Sakib*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper focuses on improving the efficiency of detecting order-dependent (OD) flaky tests by prioritizing potentially OD tests based on shared static field analysis, achieving significant reduction in test executions and unnecessary re-runs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Flaky tests, particularly order-dependent (OD) tests, degrade the reliability of automated software testing by causing CI pipeline failures while not always indicating actual faults. Current methods for detecting OD tests require excessive re-runs, creating inefficiencies.

Method: The proposed method analyzes shared static fields in test classes to identify and prioritize tests that are likely to be order-dependent, thereby reducing the need for excessive re-runs.

Result: In the experiment across 27 project modules, the method prioritized all OD tests in 23 cases, resulting in a 65.92% reduction in test executions and a 72.19% reduction in unnecessary re-runs.

Conclusion: The method meaningfully enhances the efficiency of OD flaky test detection by significantly reducing execution costs and unnecessary re-runs, demonstrating its value for improving CI pipeline reliability.

Abstract: Flaky tests can make automated software testing unreliable due to their
unpredictable behavior. These tests can pass or fail on the same code base on
multiple runs. However, flaky tests often do not refer to any fault, even
though they can cause the continuous integration (CI) pipeline to fail. A
common type of flaky test is the order-dependent (OD) test. The outcome of an
OD test depends on the order in which it is run with respect to other test
cases. Several studies have explored the detection and repair of OD tests.
However, their methods require re-runs of tests multiple times, that are not
related to the order dependence. Hence, prioritizing potential OD tests is
necessary to reduce the re-runs. In this paper, we propose a method to
prioritize potential order-dependent tests. By analyzing shared static fields
in test classes, we identify tests that are more likely to be order-dependent.
In our experiment on 27 project modules, our method successfully prioritized
all OD tests in 23 cases, reducing test executions by an average of 65.92% and
unnecessary re-runs by 72.19%. These results demonstrate that our approach
significantly improves the efficiency of OD test detection by lowering
execution costs.

TL;DR: CHCVERIF is a CHC solver using software verification tools for better performance in low-level semantics and bitvector benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve constrained Horn clause (CHC) solving, particularly on benchmarks involving bitvectors and low-level semantics.

Method: CHCVERIF employs a portfolio-based approach, integrating mature software verification tools to solve CHCs effectively.

Result: Evaluation shows moderate success in linear integer arithmetic, modest success in bitvector benchmarks, and confirms the viability of software verification tools for CHC solving.

Conclusion: Using software verification tools as backends in CHC solving, supported by a tailored portfolio, is a promising strategy to tackle specific benchmarks.

Abstract: Constrained Horn Clauses (CHCs) are widely adopted as intermediate
representations for a variety of verification tasks, including safety checking,
invariant synthesis, and interprocedural analysis. This paper introduces
CHCVERIF, a portfolio-based CHC solver that adopts a software verification
approach for solving CHCs. This approach enables us to reuse mature software
verification tools to tackle CHC benchmarks, particularly those involving
bitvectors and low-level semantics. Our evaluation shows that while the method
enjoys only moderate success with linear integer arithmetic, it achieves modest
success on bitvector benchmarks. Moreover, our results demonstrate the
viability and potential of using software verification tools as backends for
CHC solving, particularly when supported by a carefully constructed portfolio.

*Liming Dong,Sung Une Lee,Zhenchang Xing,Muhammad Ejaz Ahmed,Stefan Avgoustakis*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper identifies gaps in current software supply chain security frameworks tailored for critical infrastructure and proposes a multi-layered checklist to address these issues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the fragmented and insufficient security practices that fail to align with the specific needs of critical infrastructure sectors, which are increasingly being targeted by sophisticated software supply chain attacks.

Method: The authors conducted a multivocal literature review from international frameworks, Australian sources, and academic studies, applying a '4W+1H' analytical approach to synthesize security practices across software supply chains.

Result: The study identified a lack of context-specific frameworks for critical infrastructure sectors and developed ten core categories of software supply chain security practices, mapped across life-cycle phases, stakeholder roles, and implementation levels.

Conclusion: The paper highlights misalignments between existing framework guidance and sector-specific needs, emphasizing the necessity for integrated, tailored measures to protect critical infrastructure from evolving threats.

Abstract: The increasing frequency and sophistication of software supply chain attacks
pose severe risks to critical infrastructure sectors, threatening national
security, economic stability, and public safety. Despite growing awareness,
existing security practices remain fragmented and insufficient, with most
frameworks narrowly focused on isolated life cycle stages or lacking alignment
with the specific needs of critical infrastructure (CI) sectors. In this paper,
we conducted a multivocal literature review across international frameworks,
Australian regulatory sources, and academic studies to identify and analyze
security practices across the software supply chain, especially specific CI
sector. Our analysis found that few existing frameworks are explicitly tailored
to CI domains. We systematically leveraged identified software supply chain
security frameworks, using a "4W+1H" analytical approach, we synthesized ten
core categories (what) of software supply chain security practices, mapped them
across life-cycle phases (when), stakeholder roles (who), and implementation
levels (how), and examined their coverage across existing frameworks (where).
Building on these insights, the paper culminates in structured, multi-layered
checklist of 80 questions designed to relevant stakeholders evaluate and
enhance their software supply chain security. Our findings reveal gaps between
framework guidance and sector-specific needs, highlight the need for
integrated, context-aware approaches to safeguard critical infrastructure from
evolving software supply chain risks.

TL;DR: The paper creates a roadmap for adopting Generative AI in software engineering using a rigorous multi-cycle process and predicts 10 trends in SE by 2030.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore how Generative AI is transforming software engineering practices and to provide insights for future research and development in this field.

Method: A design science research approach was employed, involving three iterative cycles with inputs from workshops, literature reviews, and peer feedback. McLuhan’s tetrads were used to analyze the transformational effects of GenAI on SE.

Result: The study identifies four forms of GenAI augmentation in SE, their associated research challenges, and opportunities. It proposes a roadmap for future research validated by independent teams and peers.

Conclusion: The insights and roadmap offer a transparent foundation for understanding how GenAI is shaping SE processes, tools, and methods, along with 10 predictions for SE in 2030.

Abstract: Generative AI (GenAI) is rapidly transforming software engineering (SE)
practices, influencing how SE processes are executed, as well as how software
systems are developed, operated, and evolved. This paper applies design science
research to build a roadmap for GenAI-augmented SE. The process consists of
three cycles that incrementally integrate multiple sources of evidence,
including collaborative discussions from the FSE 2025 "Software Engineering
2030" workshop, rapid literature reviews, and external feedback sessions
involving peers. McLuhan's tetrads were used as a conceptual instrument to
systematically capture the transforming effects of GenAI on SE processes and
software products.The resulting roadmap identifies four fundamental forms of
GenAI augmentation in SE and systematically characterizes their related
research challenges and opportunities. These insights are then consolidated
into a set of future research directions. By grounding the roadmap in a
rigorous multi-cycle process and cross-validating it among independent author
teams and peers, the study provides a transparent and reproducible foundation
for analyzing how GenAI affects SE processes, methods and tools, and for
framing future research within this rapidly evolving area. Based on these
findings, the article finally makes ten predictions for SE in the year 2030.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper introduces RepoSearch-R1, a novel reinforcement learning framework that uses Monte-Carlo Tree Search for efficient repository-level reasoning, eliminating the need for model distillation or external supervision.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for repository-level tasks are inefficient due to limitations in guiding tool utilization and environmental decision-making without costly training or model distillation. Enterprise environments also face concerns around data compliance.

Method: RepoSearch-R1 adopts an agentic reinforcement learning framework utilizing Monte-Carlo Tree Search, enabling self-training to generate effective reasoning trajectories without external supervision or distillation.

Result: Experiments show RepoSearch-R1 significantly improves answer completeness for repository-level tasks by up to 33% while increasing training efficiency, and addressing data compliance challenges.

Conclusion: The proposed approach provides a promising solution for repository-level reasoning tasks, offering better efficiency and answer quality without compromising enterprise data compliance.

Abstract: Repository-level software engineering tasks require large language models
(LLMs) to efficiently navigate and extract information from complex codebases
through multi-turn tool interactions. Existing approaches face significant
limitations: training-free, in-context learning methods struggle to guide
agents effectively in tool utilization and decision-making based on
environmental feedback, while training-based approaches typically rely on
costly distillation from larger LLMs, introducing data compliance concerns in
enterprise environments. To address these challenges, we introduce
RepoSearch-R1, a novel agentic reinforcement learning framework driven by
Monte-carlo Tree Search (MCTS). This approach allows agents to generate
diverse, high-quality reasoning trajectories via self-training without
requiring model distillation or external supervision. Based on RepoSearch-R1,
we construct a RepoQA-Agent specifically designed for repository
question-answering tasks. Comprehensive evaluation on repository
question-answering tasks demonstrates that RepoSearch-R1 achieves substantial
improvements of answer completeness: 16.0% enhancement over no-retrieval
methods, 19.5% improvement over iterative retrieval methods, and 33% increase
in training efficiency compared to general agentic reinforcement learning
approaches. Our cold-start training methodology eliminates data compliance
concerns while maintaining robust exploration diversity and answer completeness
across repository-level reasoning tasks.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper introduces Nexus, a multi-agent framework for generating effective test oracles in non-regression testing, leading to improved accuracy and effectiveness in bug detection and program repair.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenge of generating accurate test oracles in non-regression software testing to determine if a function behaves as intended.

Method: Nexus uses a multi-agent deliberation, validation, and iterative self-refinement process, involving specialist agents and secure sandbox execution to refine and validate test oracles.

Result: Nexus demonstrates substantial improvements over baselines, increasing oracle accuracy, bug detection rates, and program repair success on various benchmarks.

Conclusion: Nexus significantly enhances the quality of test oracles, contributing to better bug detection and program repair accuracy, showcasing potential for advancing non-regression testing effectiveness.

Abstract: Test oracle generation in non-regression testing is a longstanding challenge
in software engineering, where the goal is to produce oracles that can
accurately determine whether a function under test (FUT) behaves as intended
for a given input. In this paper, we introduce Nexus, a novel multi-agent
framework to address this challenge. Nexus generates test oracles by leveraging
a diverse set of specialized agents that synthesize test oracles through a
structured process of deliberation, validation, and iterative self-refinement.
During the deliberation phase, a panel of four specialist agents, each
embodying a distinct testing philosophy, collaboratively critiques and refines
an initial set of test oracles. Then, in the validation phase, Nexus generates
a plausible candidate implementation of the FUT and executes the proposed
oracles against it in a secure sandbox. For any oracle that fails this
execution-based check, Nexus activates an automated selfrefinement loop, using
the specific runtime error to debug and correct the oracle before
re-validation. Our extensive evaluation on seven diverse benchmarks
demonstrates that Nexus consistently and substantially outperforms
state-of-theart baselines. For instance, Nexus improves the test-level oracle
accuracy on the LiveCodeBench from 46.30% to 57.73% for GPT-4.1-Mini. The
improved accuracy also significantly enhances downstream tasks: the bug
detection rate of GPT4.1-Mini generated test oracles on HumanEval increases
from 90.91% to 95.45% for Nexus compared to baselines, and the success rate of
automated program repair improves from 35.23% to 69.32%.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: SecureReviewer utilizes fine-tuned LLMs and the RAG technique to specialize in detecting and resolving security issues in code review, coupled with a secure-specific dataset and new evaluation metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Security issues during development can have long-term negative impacts and require early detection. General code review lacks sufficient focus on security-specific issues.

Method: SecureReviewer includes creating a tailored dataset for secure code review, fine-tuning LLMs using a secure-aware strategy, integrating RAG for grounded knowledge, and introducing SecureBLEU as a security-specific evaluation metric.

Result: Experiments demonstrate that SecureReviewer outperforms current methods in security issue detection accuracy, review comment quality, and practical utility.

Conclusion: SecureReviewer advances automated code review by equipping LLMs with enhanced capabilities to address security exclusively, overcoming challenges of data scarcity and evaluation effectiveness.

Abstract: Identifying and addressing security issues during the early phase of the
development lifecycle is critical for mitigating the long-term negative impacts
on software systems. Code review serves as an effective practice that enables
developers to check their teammates' code before integration into the codebase.
To streamline the generation of review comments, various automated code review
approaches have been proposed, where LLM-based methods have significantly
advanced the capabilities of automated review generation. However, existing
models primarily focus on general-purpose code review, their effectiveness in
identifying and addressing security-related issues remains underexplored.
Moreover, adapting existing code review approaches to target security issues
faces substantial challenges, including data scarcity and inadequate evaluation
metrics. To address these limitations, we propose SecureReviewer, a new
approach designed for enhancing LLMs' ability to identify and resolve
security-related issues during code review. Specifically, we first construct a
dataset tailored for training and evaluating secure code review capabilities.
Leveraging this dataset, we fine-tune LLMs to generate code review comments
that can effectively identify security issues and provide fix suggestions with
our proposed secure-aware fine-tuning strategy. To mitigate hallucination in
LLMs and enhance the reliability of their outputs, we integrate the RAG
technique, which grounds the generated comments in domain-specific security
knowledge. Additionally, we introduce SecureBLEU, a new evaluation metric
designed to assess the effectiveness of review comments in addressing security
issues. Experimental results demonstrate that SecureReviewer outperforms
state-of-the-art baselines in both security issue detection accuracy and the
overall quality and practical utility of generated review comments.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: State-of-the-art open-source large language models were evaluated for automating the Extract Method refactoring task in Python code. Recursive criticism and improvement (RCI) prompting outperformed one-shot methods in functional correctness and refactoring quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improving code readability and maintainability through automated methods is challenging, particularly the Extract Method refactoring task, and large language models offer potential solutions.

Method: Five open-source large language models (3B-8B parameters) were evaluated using automated metrics for functional correctness and code quality. One-shot prompting was compared with Recursive criticism and improvement (RCI) prompting strategies.

Result: Two models, Deepseek-Coder-RCI and Qwen2.5-Coder-RCI, performed best, achieving high test pass rates and improved code metrics, such as reduced lines of code and cyclomatic complexity. A developer survey indicates over 70% acceptance of RCI-generated refactorings.

Conclusion: Automated refactoring guided by quality prompts significantly enhances code readability and maintainability. Metrics like cyclomatic complexity and lines of code are useful but need human-in-the-loop evaluation for comprehensive assessment.

Abstract: Automating the Extract Method refactoring (EMR) remains challenging and
largely manual despite its importance in improving code readability and
maintainability. Recent advances in open-source, resource-efficient Large
Language Models (LLMs) offer promising new approaches for automating such
high-level tasks. In this work, we critically evaluate five state-of-the-art
open-source LLMs, spanning 3B to 8B parameter sizes, on the EMR task for Python
code. We systematically assess functional correctness and code quality using
automated metrics and investigate the impact of prompting strategies by
comparing one-shot prompting to a Recursive criticism and improvement (RCI)
approach. RCI-based prompting consistently outperforms one-shot prompting in
test pass rates and refactoring quality. The best-performing models,
Deepseek-Coder-RCI and Qwen2.5-Coder-RCI, achieve test pass percentage (TPP)
scores of 0.829 and 0.808, while reducing lines of code (LOC) per method from
12.103 to 6.192 and 5.577, and cyclomatic complexity (CC) from 4.602 to 3.453
and 3.294, respectively. A developer survey on RCI-generated refactorings shows
over 70% acceptance, with Qwen2.5-Coder rated highest across all evaluation
criteria. In contrast, the original code scored below neutral, particularly in
readability and maintainability, underscoring the benefits of automated
refactoring guided by quality prompts. While traditional metrics like CC and
LOC provide useful signals, they often diverge from human judgments,
emphasizing the need for human-in-the-loop evaluation. Our open-source
benchmark offers a foundation for future research on automated refactoring with
LLMs.

Motivation: Improving iterative web code modifications to reduce the manual, time-consuming process and address the challenge of enabling LLMs to accurately edit code based on new design requirements.

Method: Developed an automated data generation pipeline using LLMs to create a fine-tuning dataset called Instruct4Edit, involving diverse instruction generation, code modification, and visual verification.

Result: Fine-tuning with Instruct4Edit led to consistent improvement in models' ability to perform precise and visually accurate code changes, competing with proprietary systems.

Conclusion: The study establishes a scalable approach for natural language-based web editing, showing smaller open-source models can achieve high performance and releasing resources for reproducibility.

Abstract: The evolution of web applications relies on iterative code modifications, a
process that is traditionally manual and time-consuming. While Large Language
Models (LLMs) can generate UI code, their ability to edit existing code from
new design requirements (e.g., "center the logo") remains a challenge. This is
largely due to the absence of large-scale, high-quality tuning data to align
model performance with human expectations. In this paper, we introduce a novel,
automated data generation pipeline that uses LLMs to synthesize a high-quality
fine-tuning dataset for web editing, named Instruct4Edit. Our approach
generates diverse instructions, applies the corresponding code modifications,
and performs visual verification to ensure correctness. By fine-tuning models
on Instruct4Edit, we demonstrate consistent improvement in translating human
intent into precise, structurally coherent, and visually accurate code changes.
This work provides a scalable and transparent foundation for natural language
based web editing, demonstrating that fine-tuning smaller open-source models
can achieve competitive performance with proprietary systems. We release all
data, code implementations, and model checkpoints for reproduction.

TL;DR: The paper introduces ZKMLOps, a novel framework integrating Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs) into MLOps for verifiable accountability without exposing sensitive information, addressing regulatory compliance challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the conflict between legal transparency requirements and protecting sensitive assets such as proprietary data, a new approach to AI system verification that avoids costly and manual methods is needed.

Method: The authors propose ZKMLOps, a framework integrating Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs) into the MLOps lifecycle, leveraging cryptographic protocols to confirm compliance without disclosing sensitive information.

Result: The framework was evaluated using regulatory compliance in financial risk auditing, demonstrating feasibility through empirical testing of top ZKP protocols on Machine Learning models with varying complexities.

Conclusion: ZKMLOps provides a practical solution for achieving verifiable compliance while maintaining data privacy and model confidentiality, showing promise for application in AI systems requiring reliable auditability.

Abstract: The increasing exploitation of Artificial Intelligence (AI) enabled systems
in critical domains has made trustworthiness concerns a paramount showstopper,
requiring verifiable accountability, often by regulation (e.g., the EU AI Act).
Classical software verification and validation techniques, such as procedural
audits, formal methods, or model documentation, are the mechanisms used to
achieve this. However, these methods are either expensive or heavily manual and
ill-suited for the opaque, "black box" nature of most AI models. An intractable
conflict emerges: high auditability and verifiability are required by law, but
such transparency conflicts with the need to protect assets being audited-e.g.,
confidential data and proprietary models-leading to weakened accountability. To
address this challenge, this paper introduces ZKMLOps, a novel MLOps
verification framework that operationalizes Zero-Knowledge Proofs
(ZKPs)-cryptographic protocols allowing a prover to convince a verifier that a
statement is true without revealing additional information-within
Machine-Learning Operations lifecycles. By integrating ZKPs with established
software engineering patterns, ZKMLOps provides a modular and repeatable
process for generating verifiable cryptographic proof of compliance. We
evaluate the framework's practicality through a study of regulatory compliance
in financial risk auditing and assess feasibility through an empirical
evaluation of top ZKP protocols, analyzing performance trade-offs for ML models
of increasing complexity.

### [332] [Online and Interactive Bayesian Inference Debugging](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26579)
*Nathanael Nussbaumer,Markus Böck,Jürgen Cito*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper introduces a novel approach to debugging Bayesian inference in probabilistic programming, significantly reducing time and required expertise.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Probabilistic programming makes Bayesian models accessible but is challenging due to the complex nature of debugging inference issues.

Method: The authors developed a tool and framework for online and interactive debugging of Bayesian inference directly within the development environment.

Result: The study with 18 experienced participants demonstrates that the proposed debugging tool reduces the time and difficulty in inference debugging tasks.

Conclusion: The proposed method improves the efficiency and accessibility of debugging Bayesian inference, making probabilistic programming more user-friendly.

Abstract: Probabilistic programming is a rapidly developing programming paradigm which
enables the formulation of Bayesian models as programs and the automation of
posterior inference. It facilitates the development of models and conducting
Bayesian inference, which makes these techniques available to practitioners
from multiple fields. Nevertheless, probabilistic programming is notoriously
difficult as identifying and repairing issues with inference requires a lot of
time and deep knowledge. Through this work, we introduce a novel approach to
debugging Bayesian inference that reduces time and required knowledge
significantly. We discuss several requirements a Bayesian inference debugging
framework has to fulfill, and propose a new tool that meets these key
requirements directly within the development environment. We evaluate our
results in a study with 18 experienced participants and show that our approach
to online and interactive debugging of Bayesian inference significantly reduces
time and difficulty on inference debugging tasks.

### [333] [Stitch: Step-by-step LLM Guided Tutoring for Scratch](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26634)
*Yuan Si,Kyle Qi,Daming Li,Hanyuan Shi,Jialu Zhang*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper introduces Stitch, a tutoring system for debugging in Scratch that scaffolds learners step-by-step rather than showing direct answers, improving problem-solving and learning outcomes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current debugging approaches in block-based programming environments often directly show correct solutions to learners, which impairs problem-solving skill development.

Method: Stitch employs a Diff-Analyze module to identify discrepancies between the learner's code and reference implementation, uses a language model for explanations, and renders an iterative block-highlighting process for partial fixes.

Result: An empirical study reveals that Stitch's step-by-step guided system enhances learning outcomes compared to direct answer methods and state-of-the-art automated feedback tools.

Conclusion: Step-by-step scaffolding feedback methods, as demonstrated by Stitch, are more effective in fostering learning and problem-solving skills in block-based programming environments.

Abstract: Block-based environments such as Scratch are increasingly popular in
programming education. While block syntax reduces surface errors, semantic bugs
remain common and challenging for novices to resolve. Existing debugging
workflows typically show the correct program directly to learners, a strategy
that may fix errors but undermines the development of problem-solving skills.
  We present Stitch, an interactive tutoring system that replaces "showing the
answer" with step-by-step scaffolding. The system's Diff-Analyze module
contrasts a student's project with a reference implementation, identifies the
most critical differences, and uses a large language model to explain why these
changes matter. Learners inspect highlighted blocks through a custom rendering
engine, understand the explanations, and selectively apply partial fixes. This
iterative process continues until the intended functionality is achieved.
  We evaluate Stitch in an empirical study, comparing it against a
state-of-the-art automated feedback generation tool for Scratch. Our key
insight is that simply presenting the correct program is pedagogically
ineffective. In contrast, our interactive, step-by-step guided system promotes
a more effective learning experience. More broadly, what constitutes effective
feedback in block-based programming remains an open question. Our evaluation
provides new evidence that step-by-step tutoring significantly enhances
learning outcomes, outperforming both direct-answer approaches and current
automated feedback generation tools.

### [334] [Process-based Indicators of Vulnerability Re-Introducing Code Changes: An Exploratory Case Study](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26676)
*Samiha Shimmi,Nicholas M. Synovic,Mona Rahimi,George K. Thiruvathukal*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The study examines vulnerability reintroduction in software development, focusing on process metrics and cumulative changes instead of isolated fixes. A case study on ImageMagick highlights metrics like issue density and spoilage correlated with vulnerability recurrence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of traditional strategies, which focus only on code metrics, and investigate whether process metrics can uncover risky development activities that lead to vulnerability reintroduction over time.

Method: The researchers conducted a case study on the ImageMagick project, analyzing longitudinal process metrics (bus factor, issue density, issue spoilage) in relation to 76 instances of reintroduced vulnerabilities.

Result: Reintroduced vulnerabilities often coincided with increased issue spoilage and fluctuating issue density, revealing inefficiencies in issue management and team responsiveness during development.

Conclusion: Combining process metrics with code metrics is pivotal to predict risky fixes and enhance overall software security by addressing cumulative socio-technical and development issues.

Abstract: Software vulnerabilities often persist or re-emerge even after being fixed,
revealing the complex interplay between code evolution and socio-technical
factors. While source code metrics provide useful indicators of
vulnerabilities, software engineering process metrics can uncover patterns that
lead to their introduction. Yet few studies have explored whether process
metrics can reveal risky development activities over time -- insights that are
essential for anticipating and mitigating software vulnerabilities. This work
highlights the critical role of process metrics along with code changes in
understanding and mitigating vulnerability reintroduction. We move beyond
file-level prediction and instead analyze security fixes at the commit level,
focusing not only on whether a single fix introduces a vulnerability but also
on the longer sequences of changes through which vulnerabilities evolve and
re-emerge. Our approach emphasizes that reintroduction is rarely the result of
one isolated action, but emerges from cumulative development activities and
socio-technical conditions. To support this analysis, we conducted a case study
on the ImageMagick project by correlating longitudinal process metrics such as
bus factor, issue density, and issue spoilage with vulnerability reintroduction
activities, encompassing 76 instances of reintroduced vulnerabilities. Our
findings show that reintroductions often align with increased issue spoilage
and fluctuating issue density, reflecting short-term inefficiencies in issue
management and team responsiveness. These observations provide a foundation for
broader studies that combine process and code metrics to predict risky fixes
and strengthen software security.

### [335] [Using Copilot Agent Mode to Automate Library Migration: A Quantitative Assessment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26699)
*Aylton Almeida,Laerte Xavier,Marco Tulio Valente*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper evaluates the effectiveness of using an autonomous AI system, Github's Copilot Agent, for updating the Python library SQLAlchemy across different client applications. It introduces a migration coverage metric and finds that the system can achieve a high migration coverage (100%) but struggles with maintaining functionality (39.75% test-pass rate).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the challenges in updating libraries and frameworks, which is a critical task to avoid technical debt, security vulnerabilities, and legacy system rigidity. The paper explores how LLMs and autonomous coding systems offer solutions to automate and improve this process.

Method: The authors evaluate the SQLAlchemy updates across ten client applications using Github's Copilot Agent Mode, which utilizes multi-step autonomous migration workflows. They introduce a new metric called Migration Coverage to measure the accuracy of API migrations.

Result: The study shows that the AI system successfully migrated APIs with a 100% migration coverage but failed to ensure application functionality, resulting in a median test-pass rate of 39.75%.

Conclusion: While LLM-based autonomous systems demonstrate promise in automating code migration, they face significant challenges in ensuring functional correctness of updated applications. Further improvements are needed to enhance reliability for practical use cases.

Abstract: Keeping software systems up to date is essential to avoid technical debt,
security vulnerabilities, and the rigidity typical of legacy systems. However,
updating libraries and frameworks remains a time consuming and error-prone
process. Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) and agentic coding
systems offer new opportunities for automating such maintenance tasks. In this
paper, we evaluate the update of a well-known Python library, SQLAlchemy,
across a dataset of ten client applications. For this task, we use the Github's
Copilot Agent Mode, an autonomous AI systema capable of planning and executing
multi-step migration workflows. To assess the effectiveness of the automated
migration, we also introduce Migration Coverage, a metric that quantifies the
proportion of API usage points correctly migrated. The results of our study
show that the LLM agent was capable of migrating functionalities and API usages
between SQLAlchemy versions (migration coverage: 100%, median), but failed to
maintain the application functionality, leading to a low test-pass rate
(39.75%, median).

### [336] [Optimized Log Parsing with Syntactic Modifications](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26793)
*Nafid Enan,Gias Uddin*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper presents a study comparing various log parsers and introduces SynLog+, a two-phase log parsing enhancement, significantly improving accuracy without increasing runtime costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate the performance and characteristics of differing log parsers and develop a solution that overcomes their limitations, addressing the need for efficient and accurate log parsing in software systems.

Method: The paper conducts an empirical study comparing syntax-based, semantic-based log parsers, and parsing architectures (single-phase vs two-phase). It leverages these evaluations to design SynLog+, a second-phase module to enhance parsing accuracy.

Result: Semantic-based log parsers excel at identifying templates, while syntax-based parsers are far more efficient but lack template identification accuracy. Two-phase architecture boosts accuracy. SynLog+ improves accuracy for syntax-based and semantic-based log parsers by 236% and 20% respectively, with minimal runtime impact.

Conclusion: SynLog+ offers a significant advance in log parsing efficiency and accuracy, making it an effective enhancement for both syntax-based and semantic-based log parsers.

Abstract: Logs provide valuable insights into system runtime and assist in software
development and maintenance. Log parsing, which converts semi-structured log
data into structured log data, is often the first step in automated log
analysis. Given the wide range of log parsers utilizing diverse techniques, it
is essential to evaluate them to understand their characteristics and
performance. In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive empirical study
comparing syntax- and semantic-based log parsers, as well as single-phase and
two-phase parsing architectures. Our experiments reveal that semantic-based
methods perform better at identifying the correct templates and syntax-based
log parsers are 10 to 1,000 times more efficient and provide better grouping
accuracy although they fall short in accurate template identification.
Moreover, two-phase architecture consistently improves accuracy compared to
single-phase architecture. Based on the findings of this study, we propose
SynLog+, a template identification module that acts as the second phase in a
two-phase log parsing architecture. SynLog+ improves the parsing accuracy of
syntax-based and semantic-based log parsers by 236\% and 20\% on average,
respectively, with virtually no additional runtime cost.

### [337] [InputDSA: Demixing then Comparing Recurrent and Externally Driven Dynamics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25943)
*Ann Huang,Mitchell Ostrow,Satpreet H. Singh,Leo Kozachkov,Ila Fiete,Kanaka Rajan*

Main category: q-bio.NC

TL;DR: The paper introduces InputDSA (iDSA), a novel method for comparing both intrinsic and input-driven dynamics of systems using Dynamic Mode Decomposition with control (DMDc).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods like DSA fail to account for how inputs affect system dynamics, which is essential given real-world systems are often driven by external inputs.

Method: iDSA extends the DSA framework by incorporating input-driven dynamics via subspace identification with DMDc, allowing comparisons of both intrinsic and external input effects on systems.

Result: iDSA effectively compares input-driven systems even with noisy or surrogate input data. It reveals dynamic similarity in high-performing RNNs and identifies behavioral transitions in neural data from cognitive tasks.

Conclusion: InputDSA offers a robust, efficient method for dynamic comparisons of input-influenced systems, significantly improving upon limitations in previous approaches like DSA.

Abstract: In control problems and basic scientific modeling, it is important to compare
observations with dynamical simulations. For example, comparing two neural
systems can shed light on the nature of emergent computations in the brain and
deep neural networks. Recently, Ostrow et al. (2023) introduced Dynamical
Similarity Analysis (DSA), a method to measure the similarity of two systems
based on their recurrent dynamics rather than geometry or topology. However,
DSA does not consider how inputs affect the dynamics, meaning that two similar
systems, if driven differently, may be classified as different. Because
real-world dynamical systems are rarely autonomous, it is important to account
for the effects of input drive. To this end, we introduce a novel metric for
comparing both intrinsic (recurrent) and input-driven dynamics, called InputDSA
(iDSA). InputDSA extends the DSA framework by estimating and comparing both
input and intrinsic dynamic operators using a variant of Dynamic Mode
Decomposition with control (DMDc) based on subspace identification. We
demonstrate that InputDSA can successfully compare partially observed,
input-driven systems from noisy data. We show that when the true inputs are
unknown, surrogate inputs can be substituted without a major deterioration in
similarity estimates. We apply InputDSA on Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)
trained with Deep Reinforcement Learning, identifying that high-performing
networks are dynamically similar to one another, while low-performing networks
are more diverse. Lastly, we apply InputDSA to neural data recorded from rats
performing a cognitive task, demonstrating that it identifies a transition from
input-driven evidence accumulation to intrinsically-driven decision-making. Our
work demonstrates that InputDSA is a robust and efficient method for comparing
intrinsic dynamics and the effect of external input on dynamical systems.

### [338] [Integrated Information Theory: A Consciousness-First Approach to What Exists](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25998)
*Giulio Tononi,Melanie Boly*

Main category: q-bio.NC

TL;DR: This paper offers an overview of Integrated Information Theory (IIT), focusing on its "consciousness-first" approach to existence and its implications for phenomena such as perception, meaning, and free will.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the foundational question of what it means for something to exist, beginning with consciousness as a primary certainty and providing a framework to operationalize its essential properties.

Method: The authors use IIT's axioms of phenomenal existence to derive postulates of physical existence and propose that intrinsic existence requires cause-effect power within a unified structure.

Result: The study explains how IIT accounts for experiential properties like spatial and temporal awareness, binding of objects and concepts, and the qualities of sensory phenomena (qualia).

Conclusion: IIT provides a novel framework for understanding existence and consciousness, with practical implications for evaluating consciousness in living and non-living systems and redefining humanity's place in nature.

Abstract: This overview of integrated information theory (IIT) emphasizes IIT's
"consciousness-first" approach to what exists. Consciousness demonstrates to
each of us that something exists--experience--and reveals its essential
properties--the axioms of phenomenal existence. IIT formulates these properties
operationally, yielding the postulates of physical existence. To exist
intrinsically or absolutely, an entity must have cause-effect power upon
itself, in a specific, unitary, definite and structured manner. IIT's
explanatory identity claims that an entity's cause-effect structure accounts
for all properties of an experience--essential and accidental--with no
additional ingredients. These include the feeling of spatial extendedness,
temporal flow, of objects binding general concepts with particular
configurations of features, and of qualia such as colors and sounds. IIT's
intrinsic ontology has implications for understanding meaning, perception, and
free will, for assessing consciousness in patients, infants, other species, and
artifacts, and for reassessing our place in nature.

*Feichen Gan,Youcun Lu,Yingying Zhang,Yukun Liu*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: This paper introduces a unified conformal prediction framework for policy evaluation in reinforcement learning, offering robust uncertainty quantification for both on-policy and off-policy settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in reliable certainty quantification for reinforcement learning, particularly in high-stakes scenarios, where temporal dependencies, distributional shifts, and unobserved returns complicate analysis.

Method: The proposed method combines distributional reinforcement learning with conformal calibration, utilizing modular pseudo-return construction and a time-aware calibration strategy to address current RL challenges.

Result: The proposed framework improved uncertainty quantification and coverage reliability, outperforming existing distributional RL techniques in synthetic and benchmark environments like Mountain Car.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates that integrating conformal prediction into RL effectively provides accurate uncertainty quantification, making it suitable for high-stakes applications.

Abstract: Reliable uncertainty quantification is crucial for reinforcement learning
(RL) in high-stakes settings. We propose a unified conformal prediction
framework for infinite-horizon policy evaluation that constructs
distribution-free prediction intervals {for returns} in both on-policy and
off-policy settings. Our method integrates distributional RL with conformal
calibration, addressing challenges such as unobserved returns, temporal
dependencies, and distributional shifts. We propose a modular pseudo-return
construction based on truncated rollouts and a time-aware calibration strategy
using experience replay and weighted subsampling. These innovations mitigate
model bias and restore approximate exchangeability, enabling uncertainty
quantification even under policy shifts. Our theoretical analysis provides
coverage guarantees that account for model misspecification and importance
weight estimation. Empirical results, including experiments in synthetic and
benchmark environments like Mountain Car, show that our method significantly
improves coverage and reliability over standard distributional RL baselines.

TL;DR: This paper introduces a novel $L_1$-norm regularized indefinite kernel logistic regression (RIKLR) model to enhance interpretability and generalization in classification tasks, alongside a new optimization algorithm.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve kernel logistic regression by incorporating sparsity using indefinite kernels which better capture domain-specific structural information and enhance interpretability and generalization.

Method: The introduction of $L_1$-norm regularization into indefinite kernel logistic regression, paired with the development of a proximal linearized algorithm to handle nonsmoothness and nonconvexity.

Result: Experimental results confirm the proposed RIKLR model’s superior performance in terms of accuracy and sparsity across multiple benchmark datasets.

Conclusion: The RIKLR model effectively balances interpretability, generalization, and computational efficiency, offering advancements in classification methods with indefinite kernel approaches.

Abstract: Kernel logistic regression (KLR) is a powerful classification method widely
applied across diverse domains. In many real-world scenarios, indefinite
kernels capture more domain-specific structural information than positive
definite kernels. This paper proposes a novel $L_1$-norm regularized indefinite
kernel logistic regression (RIKLR) model, which extends the existing IKLR
framework by introducing sparsity via an $L_1$-norm penalty. The introduction
of this regularization enhances interpretability and generalization while
introducing nonsmoothness and nonconvexity into the optimization landscape. To
address these challenges, a theoretically grounded and computationally
efficient proximal linearized algorithm is developed. Experimental results on
multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate the superior performance of the
proposed method in terms of both accuracy and sparsity.

TL;DR: The paper addresses issues with synthetic data in handling imbalanced datasets, proposing a bias correction method to improve prediction accuracy while mitigating overfitting across classification, multi-task learning, and causal inference scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to tackle challenges in handling imbalanced data, where synthetic data generation for the minority group introduces bias and reduces prediction accuracy when treated as true data.

Method: The authors propose a bias correction procedure using information from the majority group, aiming to address the bias effects of synthetic data and enhance prediction accuracy. This framework is extended to multi-task learning and causal inference.

Result: Theoretical analysis provides bounds on bias estimation errors and indicates improved prediction accuracy. Simulation and handwriting digit dataset experiments validate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

Conclusion: The bias correction procedure improves prediction accuracy, reduces synthetic data bias, and extends its application to broader imbalanced data scenarios, showcasing both theoretical and empirical robustness.

Abstract: Imbalanced data, where the positive samples represent only a small proportion
compared to the negative samples, makes it challenging for classification
problems to balance the false positive and false negative rates. A common
approach to addressing the challenge involves generating synthetic data for the
minority group and then training classification models with both observed and
synthetic data. However, since the synthetic data depends on the observed data
and fails to replicate the original data distribution accurately, prediction
accuracy is reduced when the synthetic data is naively treated as the true
data. In this paper, we address the bias introduced by synthetic data and
provide consistent estimators for this bias by borrowing information from the
majority group. We propose a bias correction procedure to mitigate the adverse
effects of synthetic data, enhancing prediction accuracy while avoiding
overfitting. This procedure is extended to broader scenarios with imbalanced
data, such as imbalanced multi-task learning and causal inference. Theoretical
properties, including bounds on bias estimation errors and improvements in
prediction accuracy, are provided. Simulation results and data analysis on
handwritten digit datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.

TL;DR: The study presents a framework using graph neural networks to create instance-specific projections for solving high-dimensional quadratic programming problems efficiently.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the challenge of efficiently solving high-dimensional quadratic programming (QP) problems by reducing computation through variable reduction and tailored projections.

Method: The method uses a graph neural network model to generate instance-specific projections. Training involves bilevel optimization: inner optimization solves projected QPs, while outer optimization updates model parameters without backpropagation.

Result: Experimental results show that the proposed framework produces high-quality, feasible solutions for QPs with reduced computation time, surpassing existing approaches.

Conclusion: The study confirms the effectiveness of combining graph neural networks with tailored projections for solving heterogeneous quadratic programming problems efficiently and accurately.

Abstract: We propose a data-driven framework for efficiently solving quadratic
programming (QP) problems by reducing the number of variables in
high-dimensional QPs using instance-specific projection. A graph neural
network-based model is designed to generate projections tailored to each QP
instance, enabling us to produce high-quality solutions even for previously
unseen problems. The model is trained on heterogeneous QPs to minimize the
expected objective value evaluated on the projected solutions. This is
formulated as a bilevel optimization problem; the inner optimization solves the
QP under a given projection using a QP solver, while the outer optimization
updates the model parameters. We develop an efficient algorithm to solve this
bilevel optimization problem, which computes parameter gradients without
backpropagating through the solver. We provide a theoretical analysis of the
generalization ability of solving QPs with projection matrices generated by
neural networks. Experimental results demonstrate that our method produces
high-quality feasible solutions with reduced computation time, outperforming
existing methods.

### [344] [Uncertainty-Aware Diagnostics for Physics-Informed Machine Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26121)
*Mara Daniels,Liam Hodgkinson,Michael Mahoney*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: This paper introduces the Physics-Informed Log Evidence (PILE) score as a single uncertainty-aware metric to address ambiguities in assessing physics-informed machine learning models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current physics-informed machine learning methods struggle with the ambiguity introduced by their multi-objective nature and poor understanding of epistemic uncertainty. This can lead to unreliable measurements of model quality and unexpected failures.

Method: The paper works within a Gaussian process regression framework and proposes the PILE score, which bypasses test loss ambiguities and performs model evaluation using a single uncertainty-aware metric. It demonstrates how PILE minimization informs choices of hyperparameters such as kernel bandwidth and regularization weights.

Result: The PILE score successfully identifies optimal hyperparameters and kernel choices, even prior to data acquisition in a data-free case. It demonstrates robustness across various configurations, enabling better model selection in PIML.

Conclusion: The PILE score offers a more reliable and efficient alternative for evaluating physics-informed machine learning models and hyperparameters. Its potential application beyond kernel settings is highlighted, broadening its scope in PIML approaches.

Abstract: Physics-informed machine learning (PIML) integrates prior physical
information, often in the form of differential equation constraints, into the
process of fitting machine learning models to physical data. Popular PIML
approaches, including neural operators, physics-informed neural networks,
neural ordinary differential equations, and neural discrete equilibria, are
typically fit to objectives that simultaneously include both data and physical
constraints. However, the multi-objective nature of this approach creates
ambiguity in the measurement of model quality. This is related to a poor
understanding of epistemic uncertainty, and it can lead to surprising failure
modes, even when existing statistical metrics suggest strong fits. Working
within a Gaussian process regression framework, we introduce the
Physics-Informed Log Evidence (PILE) score. Bypassing the ambiguities of test
losses, the PILE score is a single, uncertainty-aware metric that provides a
selection principle for hyperparameters of a PIML model. We show that PILE
minimization yields excellent choices for a wide variety of model parameters,
including kernel bandwidth, least squares regularization weights, and even
kernel function selection. We also show that, even prior to data acquisition, a
special 'data-free' case of the PILE score identifies a priori kernel choices
that are 'well-adapted' to a given PDE. Beyond the kernel setting, we
anticipate that the PILE score can be extended to PIML at large, and we outline
approaches to do so.

TL;DR: The paper extends the robust and conjugate Gaussian process (RCGP) framework to multi-output Gaussian processes (MOGPs), making them robust and able to model correlations among outputs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the sensitivity of MOGPs to model misspecification and outliers that can distort predictions and propagate errors across correlated outputs.

Method: The methodology generalizes the RCGP framework, resulting in the Multi-Output RCGP (MO-RCGP) model, which is robust, conjugate, and can jointly model correlations.

Result: The effectiveness of MO-RCGP was validated through applications in finance and cancer research, demonstrating its practical utility.

Conclusion: The proposed MO-RCGP successfully handles outlier issues and accurately captures correlations across multiple outputs, improving predictive performance.

Abstract: Multi-output Gaussian process (MOGP) regression allows modelling dependencies
among multiple correlated response variables. Similarly to standard Gaussian
processes, MOGPs are sensitive to model misspecification and outliers, which
can distort predictions within individual outputs. This situation can be
further exacerbated by multiple anomalous response variables whose errors
propagate due to correlations between outputs. To handle this situation, we
extend and generalise the robust and conjugate Gaussian process (RCGP)
framework introduced by Altamirano et al. (2024). This results in the
multi-output RCGP (MO-RCGP): a provably robust MOGP that is conjugate, and
jointly captures correlations across outputs. We thoroughly evaluate our
approach through applications in finance and cancer research.

TL;DR: The paper establishes a connection between stochastic processes and reinforcement learning through action-driven processes, applying the concept to spiking neural networks and connecting it to maximum entropy reinforcement learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To unify the understanding of reinforcement learning actions and stochastic processes, and demonstrate how action-driven processes can model and optimize complex systems.

Method: The authors use control-as-inference and minimize the KL divergence between policy-driven and reward-driven distributions for action-driven processes.

Result: Minimizing the KL divergence is shown to be equivalent to maximum entropy reinforcement learning.

Conclusion: Action-driven processes bridge reinforcement learning and stochastic modeling, providing insights into optimizing and defining systems like spiking neural networks.

Abstract: At the heart of reinforcement learning are actions -- decisions made in
response to observations of the environment. Actions are equally fundamental in
the modeling of stochastic processes, as they trigger discontinuous state
transitions and enable the flow of information through large, complex systems.
In this paper, we unify the perspectives of stochastic processes and
reinforcement learning through action-driven processes, and illustrate their
application to spiking neural networks. Leveraging ideas from
control-as-inference, we show that minimizing the Kullback-Leibler divergence
between a policy-driven true distribution and a reward-driven model
distribution for a suitably defined action-driven process is equivalent to
maximum entropy reinforcement learning.

*Gerard T. Portela,Jason B. Gibbons,Sebastian Schneeweiss,Rishi J. Desai*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: This study evaluates violations of conditional exchangeability in causal ML models for individualized treatment effects and explores negative control outcomes (NCOs) as a diagnostic tool.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of empirical evaluations for conditional exchangeability in causal machine learning models and explore methods like NCOs for identifying unmeasured confounding biases.

Method: A simulation study was conducted to analyze causal forest and X-learner models under varying confounding conditions, sample sizes, and NCO structures. The study included comparisons of subgroup-level treatment effects under different scenarios.

Result: When conditional exchangeability was violated, causal ML models failed to estimate true treatment effect heterogeneity and sometimes falsely inferred heterogeneity. NCOs were effective in identifying unmeasured confounding and detecting potential biases, even if ideal NCO assumptions weren't fully met.

Conclusion: Conditional exchangeability violations undermine the validity of ITE estimates in observational studies. NCOs are recommended as a diagnostic tool for detecting unmeasured confounding in causal ML setups, enhancing credibility and reliability.

Abstract: Observational studies developing causal machine learning (ML) models for the
prediction of individualized treatment effects (ITEs) seldom conduct empirical
evaluations to assess the conditional exchangeability assumption. We aimed to
evaluate the performance of these models under conditional exchangeability
violations and the utility of negative control outcomes (NCOs) as a diagnostic.
We conducted a simulation study to examine confounding bias in ITE estimates
generated by causal forest and X-learner models under varying conditions,
including the presence or absence of true heterogeneity. We simulated data to
reflect real-world scenarios with differing levels of confounding, sample size,
and NCO confounding structures. We then estimated and compared subgroup-level
treatment effects on the primary outcome and NCOs across settings with and
without unmeasured confounding. When conditional exchangeability was violated,
causal forest and X-learner models failed to recover true treatment effect
heterogeneity and, in some cases, falsely indicated heterogeneity when there
was none. NCOs successfully identified subgroups affected by unmeasured
confounding. Even when NCOs did not perfectly satisfy its ideal assumptions, it
remained informative, flagging potential bias in subgroup level estimates,
though not always pinpointing the subgroup with the largest confounding.
Violations of conditional exchangeability substantially limit the validity of
ITE estimates from causal ML models in routinely collected observational data.
NCOs serve a useful empirical diagnostic tool for detecting subgroup-specific
unmeasured confounding and should be incorporated into causal ML workflows to
support the credibility of individualized inference.

### [348] [Bridging the Gap between Empirical Welfare Maximization and Conditional Average Treatment Effect Estimation in Policy Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26723)
*Masahiro Kato*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper examines two major approaches in policy learning, empirical welfare maximization (EWM) and plug-in methods, and establishes equivalence between them. A new regularization method to improve efficiency is proposed.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Policy learning aims to optimize treatment recommendations using covariates to maximize population welfare, with efforts to unify and streamline methods for efficiency and theoretical assurances.

Method: The study establishes theoretical equivalence between EWM and plug-in approaches through reparameterization, explores their interchangeability, and introduces a novel regularization method to simplify complex computations.

Result: It demonstrates that EWM and plug-in approaches share the same optimization framework and theoretical assurances. Moreover, a computationally efficient, convex training procedure is developed as a result of the equivalence.

Conclusion: The research bridges a methodological gap, providing insights into theoretical alignment and practical efficiencies in policy learning. The findings simplify the training process while maintaining robustness.

Abstract: The goal of policy learning is to train a policy function that recommends a
treatment given covariates to maximize population welfare. There are two major
approaches in policy learning: the empirical welfare maximization (EWM)
approach and the plug-in approach. The EWM approach is analogous to a
classification problem, where one first builds an estimator of the population
welfare, which is a functional of policy functions, and then trains a policy by
maximizing the estimated welfare. In contrast, the plug-in approach is based on
regression, where one first estimates the conditional average treatment effect
(CATE) and then recommends the treatment with the highest estimated outcome.
This study bridges the gap between the two approaches by showing that both are
based on essentially the same optimization problem. In particular, we prove an
exact equivalence between EWM and least squares over a reparameterization of
the policy class. As a consequence, the two approaches are interchangeable in
several respects and share the same theoretical guarantees under common
conditions. Leveraging this equivalence, we propose a novel regularization
method for policy learning. Our findings yield a convex and computationally
efficient training procedure that avoids the NP-hard combinatorial step
typically required in EWM.

*Masahiro Kato*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper proposes a unified theory for causal inference by combining various methods like Riesz regression, covariate balancing, density-ratio estimation (DRE), targeted maximum likelihood estimation (TMLE), and matching estimators in Average Treatment Effect (ATE) estimation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To establish a cohesive and comprehensive framework for causal inference by integrating different estimation methods and their relationships for ATE estimation.

Method: The paper identifies connections between techniques like Riesz regression, DRE, covariate balancing, TMLE, and matching estimators, emphasizing their equivalences and dual relationships in ATE settings.

Result: The analysis shows how these methods interrelate, where strategies like Riesz regression are equivalent to DRE in ATE contexts, the matching estimator is a special case of DRE, and TMLE focuses on bias-correction.

Conclusion: A comprehensive understanding of these interrelated methods is presented, enabling a unified approach to causal inference, which simplifies and strengthens ATE estimation methodologies.

Abstract: This note introduces a unified theory for causal inference that integrates
Riesz regression, covariate balancing, density-ratio estimation (DRE), targeted
maximum likelihood estimation (TMLE), and the matching estimator in average
treatment effect (ATE) estimation. In ATE estimation, the balancing weights and
the regression functions of the outcome play important roles, where the
balancing weights are referred to as the Riesz representer, bias-correction
term, and clever covariates, depending on the context. Riesz regression,
covariate balancing, DRE, and the matching estimator are methods for estimating
the balancing weights, where Riesz regression is essentially equivalent to DRE
in the ATE context, the matching estimator is a special case of DRE, and DRE is
in a dual relationship with covariate balancing. TMLE is a method for
constructing regression function estimators such that the leading bias term
becomes zero. Nearest Neighbor Matching is equivalent to Least Squares Density
Ratio Estimation and Riesz Regression.

TL;DR: The paper presents a hybrid method which combines a particle-mesh solver for gravitational forces and a neural network for hydrodynamic modeling, improving inference on cosmological simulations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for efficient and accurate cosmological inference models that simulate dynamics of gas and dark matter under hydrodynamics and gravity.

Method: A hybrid approach integrating a differentiable particle-mesh solver for gravity and a neural network that maps local quantities to a pressure field, requiring minimal data.

Result: Method outperforms existing approaches at both field-level and summary-statistic inference, demonstrating high data efficiency with just one simulation to constrain the neural model.

Conclusion: This hybrid model paves the way for direct application to observational data, avoiding dependency on simulation-based training datasets.

Abstract: Cosmological field-level inference requires differentiable forward models
that solve the challenging dynamics of gas and dark matter under hydrodynamics
and gravity. We propose a hybrid approach where gravitational forces are
computed using a differentiable particle-mesh solver, while the hydrodynamics
are parametrized by a neural network that maps local quantities to an effective
pressure field. We demonstrate that our method improves upon alternative
approaches, such as an Enthalpy Gradient Descent baseline, both at the field
and summary-statistic level. The approach is furthermore highly data efficient,
with a single reference simulation of cosmological structure formation being
sufficient to constrain the neural pressure model. This opens the door for
future applications where the model is fit directly to observational data,
rather than a training set of simulations.

TL;DR: The paper explores how to reduce aerodynamic drag and energy consumption on vans and trucks using pulsed jets controlled by optimization algorithms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To reduce aerodynamic drag and fuel consumption for flat-backed vehicles by improving control of the low-pressure wake.

Method: Experimental study using four pulsed jets controlled by a hybrid genetic algorithm to determine optimal actuation parameters.

Result: Achieved a drag reduction of approximately 10% through tailored actuation strategies identified via optimization.

Conclusion: Model-free optimization successfully identifies efficient control strategies for significant drag reduction and demonstrates practical advancements in energy-efficient flow control solutions.

Abstract: Aerodynamic drag on flat-backed vehicles like vans and trucks is dominated by
a low-pressure wake, whose control is critical for reducing fuel consumption.
This paper presents an experimental study at $Re_W\approx 78,300$ on active
flow control using four pulsed jets at the rear edges of a bluff body model. A
hybrid genetic algorithm, combining a global search with a local gradient-based
optimizer, was used to determine the optimal jet actuation parameters in an
experiment-in-the-loop setup. The cost function was designed to achieve a net
energy saving by simultaneously minimizing aerodynamic drag and penalizing the
actuation's energy consumption. The optimization campaign successfully
identified a control strategy that yields a drag reduction of approximately
10%. The optimal control law features a strong, low-frequency actuation from
the bottom jet, which targets the main vortex shedding, while the top and
lateral jets address higher-frequency, less energetic phenomena. Particle Image
Velocimetry analysis reveals a significant upward shift and stabilization of
the wake, leading to substantial pressure recovery on the model's lower base.
Ultimately, this work demonstrates that a model-free optimization approach can
successfully identify non-intuitive, multi-faceted actuation strategies that
yield significant and energetically efficient drag reduction.

Result: Robot movements and workflows were validated with over 80% accuracy, showing high confidence for real-time verification.

Conclusion: Acoustic signals serve as a reliable, low-cost method for passive monitoring in robotics without hardware changes.

Abstract: In this paper, we present a framework that uses acoustic side-channel
analysis (ASCA) to monitor and verify whether a robot correctly executes its
intended commands. We develop and evaluate a machine-learning-based workflow
verification system that uses acoustic emissions generated by robotic
movements. The system can determine whether real-time behavior is consistent
with expected commands. The evaluation takes into account movement speed,
direction, and microphone distance. The results show that individual robot
movements can be validated with over 80% accuracy under baseline conditions
using four different classifiers: Support Vector Machine (SVM), Deep Neural
Network (DNN), Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), and Convolutional Neural Network
(CNN). Additionally, workflows such as pick-and-place and packing could be
identified with similarly high confidence. Our findings demonstrate that
acoustic signals can support real-time, low-cost, passive verification in

Motivation: The authors aim to address the rapid spread of misinformation on social platforms, which undermines public discourse.

Method: FakeZero uses a client-side implementation including Local Transformer models and a three-stage training curriculum: fine-tuning, domain-adaptive training, and post-training improvements like quantisation and adversarial augmentation.

Result: FakeZero achieves 97.4% accuracy with the DistilBERT-Quant model while maintaining low latency. The TinyBERT-Quant variant further optimizes memory usage and latency, retaining performance with only minor reductions.

Conclusion: FakeZero provides an effective, scalable tool for detecting fake news, benefits policymakers, and can be employed for large-scale dataset collection with user consent to advance research in misinformation detection.

Abstract: Social platforms distribute information at unprecedented speed, which in turn
accelerates the spread of misinformation and threatens public discourse. We
present FakeZero, a fully client-side, cross-platform browser extension that
flags unreliable posts on Facebook and X (formerly Twitter) while the user
scrolls. All computation, DOM scraping, tokenisation, Transformer inference,
and UI rendering run locally through the Chromium messaging API, so no personal
data leaves the device.FakeZero employs a three-stage training curriculum:
baseline fine-tuning and domain-adaptive training enhanced with focal loss,
adversarial augmentation, and post-training quantisation. Evaluated on a
dataset of 239,000 posts, the DistilBERT-Quant model (67.6 MB) reaches 97.1%
macro-F1, 97.4% accuracy, and an AUROC of 0.996, with a median latency of
approximately 103 ms on a commodity laptop. A memory-efficient TinyBERT-Quant
variant retains 95.7% macro-F1 and 96.1% accuracy while shrinking the model to
14.7 MB and lowering latency to approximately 40 ms, showing that high-quality
fake-news detection is feasible under tight resource budgets with only modest
performance loss.By providing inline credibility cues, the extension can serve
as a valuable tool for policymakers seeking to curb the spread of
misinformation across social networks. With user consent, FakeZero also opens
the door for researchers to collect large-scale datasets of fake news in the
wild, enabling deeper analysis and the development of more robust detection
techniques.

TL;DR: The paper introduces SIRAJ, a red-teaming framework for testing and ensuring the safety of black-box LLM agents by detecting vulnerabilities using diverse test cases and adversarial attacks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the growing safety risks posed by large language model (LLM) agents as they plan and invoke tools, necessitating the development of robust systems to discover vulnerabilities and ensure their safe deployment.

Method: The proposed framework, SIRAJ, employs a two-step dynamic process: first, creating diverse seed test cases to explore various risk outcomes and tool-use trajectories, and second, iteratively generating and improving model-based adversarial attacks to test vulnerabilities. A model distillation approach is used to optimize costs while maintaining red-teaming effectiveness.

Result: The framework achieves a 2-2.5x increase in risk coverage outcomes using the seed generation process and doubles the attack success rate using an 8B distilled red-teamer model, outperforming the significantly larger 671B Deepseek-R1 model.

Conclusion: The iterative framework and model distillation strategies are effective, demonstrating improved generalization and structured reasoning for identifying safety vulnerabilities in LLM agents.

Abstract: The ability of LLM agents to plan and invoke tools exposes them to new safety
risks, making a comprehensive red-teaming system crucial for discovering
vulnerabilities and ensuring their safe deployment. We present SIRAJ: a generic
red-teaming framework for arbitrary black-box LLM agents. We employ a dynamic
two-step process that starts with an agent definition and generates diverse
seed test cases that cover various risk outcomes, tool-use trajectories, and
risk sources. Then, it iteratively constructs and refines model-based
adversarial attacks based on the execution trajectories of former attempts. To
optimize the red-teaming cost, we present a model distillation approach that
leverages structured forms of a teacher model's reasoning to train smaller
models that are equally effective. Across diverse evaluation agent settings,
our seed test case generation approach yields 2 -- 2.5x boost to the coverage
of risk outcomes and tool-calling trajectories. Our distilled 8B red-teamer
model improves attack success rate by 100%, surpassing the 671B Deepseek-R1
model. Our ablations and analyses validate the effectiveness of the iterative
framework, structured reasoning, and the generalization of our red-teamer
models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing watermarking schemes for large language models (LLMs) fail to ensure public verifiability of watermark detection without compromising security and trust.

Method: PVMark leverages zero-knowledge proof (ZKP) to allow public verification of watermark detection without disclosing the secret key, incorporating various ZKP constraints.

Result: Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of PVMark under different algorithms, hash functions, and protocols, ensuring transparency and maintaining watermark performance.

Conclusion: PVMark enables efficient, publicly verifiable watermark detection for LLMs while safeguarding against removal attacks or transparency issues, and proves adaptable for practical deployment.

Abstract: Watermarking schemes for large language models (LLMs) have been proposed to
identify the source of the generated text, mitigating the potential threats
emerged from model theft. However, current watermarking solutions hardly
resolve the trust issue: the non-public watermark detection cannot prove itself
faithfully conducting the detection. We observe that it is attributed to the
secret key mostly used in the watermark detection -- it cannot be public, or
the adversary may launch removal attacks provided the key; nor can it be
private, or the watermarking detection is opaque to the public. To resolve the
dilemma, we propose PVMark, a plugin based on zero-knowledge proof (ZKP),
enabling the watermark detection process to be publicly verifiable by third
parties without disclosing any secret key. PVMark hinges upon the proof of
`correct execution' of watermark detection on which a set of ZKP constraints
are built, including mapping, random number generation, comparison, and
summation. We implement multiple variants of PVMark in Python, Rust and Circom,
covering combinations of three watermarking schemes, three hash functions, and
four ZKP protocols, to show our approach effectively works under a variety of
circumstances. By experimental results, PVMark efficiently enables public
verifiability on the state-of-the-art LLM watermarking schemes yet without
compromising the watermarking performance, promising to be deployed in
practice.

Motivation: The paper aims to address the challenge of improving real-time intrusion detection systems by leveraging spatial and temporal network dependencies and improving model interpretability.

Method: The authors integrate GNNs for spatial relationships, RNNs for temporal sequence analysis, and multi-head attention mechanisms for feature selection and model interpretability, using the UNSW-NB15 dataset.

Result: The hybrid model surpasses traditional approaches in accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, excelling in detecting APTs, DDoS, and zero-day attacks.

Conclusion: This hybrid approach is effective and promising for next-generation intrusion detection in complex network environments with improved performance and interpretability.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel hybrid deep learning architecture that
synergistically combines Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), Recurrent Neural
Networks (RNNs), and multi-head attention mechanisms to significantly enhance
cybersecurity intrusion detection capabilities. By leveraging the comprehensive
UNSW-NB15 dataset containing diverse network traffic patterns, our approach
effectively captures both spatial dependencies through graph structural
relationships and temporal dynamics through sequential analysis of network
events. The integrated attention mechanism provides dual benefits of improved
model interpretability and enhanced feature selection, enabling cybersecurity
analysts to focus computational resources on high-impact security events -- a
critical requirement in modern real-time intrusion detection systems. Our
extensive experimental evaluation demonstrates that the proposed hybrid model
achieves superior performance compared to traditional machine learning
approaches and standalone deep learning models across multiple evaluation
metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. The model
achieves particularly strong performance in detecting sophisticated attack
patterns such as Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs), Distributed Denial of
Service (DDoS) attacks, and zero-day exploits, making it a promising solution
for next-generation cybersecurity applications in complex network environments.

*Yingjia Wang,Ting Qiao,Xing Liu,Chongzuo Li,Sixing Wu,Jianbin Li*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This paper introduces SSCL-BW, a sample-specific backdoor watermarking method to protect dataset ownership, overcoming vulnerabilities of existing approaches by using unique watermarks for each sample.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing dataset ownership verification methods struggle with detectability and robustness due to static or poison-label watermark patterns. This paper aims to provide a solution that ensures dataset protection and is resistant to watermark removal attacks.

Method: The authors propose a sample-specific clean-label backdoor watermarking (SSCL-BW), utilizing a U-Net-based watermarked sample generator. A composite loss function is designed with three components: target sample loss for effectiveness, non-target sample loss for reliability, and perceptual similarity loss for imperceptibility.

Result: Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets show the proposed method to be effective in verifying ownership and robust against watermark removal attacks.

Conclusion: SSCL-BW presents a novel and reliable approach for dataset ownership verification, addressing the limitations of prior methods with enhanced security and practical applicability.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of deep neural networks (DNNs) heavily relies on
large-scale, high-quality datasets. However, unauthorized commercial use of
these datasets severely violates the intellectual property rights of dataset
owners. Existing backdoor-based dataset ownership verification methods suffer
from inherent limitations: poison-label watermarks are easily detectable due to
label inconsistencies, while clean-label watermarks face high technical
complexity and failure on high-resolution images. Moreover, both approaches
employ static watermark patterns that are vulnerable to detection and removal.
To address these issues, this paper proposes a sample-specific clean-label
backdoor watermarking (i.e., SSCL-BW). By training a U-Net-based watermarked
sample generator, this method generates unique watermarks for each sample,
fundamentally overcoming the vulnerability of static watermark patterns. The
core innovation lies in designing a composite loss function with three
components: target sample loss ensures watermark effectiveness, non-target
sample loss guarantees trigger reliability, and perceptual similarity loss
maintains visual imperceptibility. During ownership verification, black-box
testing is employed to check whether suspicious models exhibit predefined
backdoor behaviors. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate the
effectiveness of the proposed method and its robustness against potential
watermark removal attacks.

Motivation: To improve anomaly detection in cybersecurity by leveraging HGNNs to better model complex cyber data.

Method: The paper reviews and classifies existing HGNN-based methods, analyzes models, benchmarks datasets, and discusses evaluation techniques.

Result: Provides a taxonomy for HGNN-based anomaly detection methods, highlights applications, and identifies challenges and research directions.

Conclusion: Establishes a structured foundation for advancing scalable and interpretable HGNN-based anomaly detection solutions in cybersecurity.

Abstract: Anomaly detection is a critical task in cybersecurity, where identifying
insider threats, access violations, and coordinated attacks is essential for
ensuring system resilience. Graph-based approaches have become increasingly
important for modeling entity interactions, yet most rely on homogeneous and
static structures, which limits their ability to capture the heterogeneity and
temporal evolution of real-world environments. Heterogeneous Graph Neural
Networks (HGNNs) have emerged as a promising paradigm for anomaly detection by
incorporating type-aware transformations and relation-sensitive aggregation,
enabling more expressive modeling of complex cyber data. However, current
research on HGNN-based anomaly detection remains fragmented, with diverse
modeling strategies, limited comparative evaluation, and an absence of
standardized benchmarks. To address this gap, we provide a comprehensive survey
of HGNN-based anomaly detection methods in cybersecurity. We introduce a
taxonomy that classifies approaches by anomaly type and graph dynamics, analyze
representative models, and map them to key cybersecurity applications. We also
review commonly used benchmark datasets and evaluation metrics, highlighting
their strengths and limitations. Finally, we identify key open challenges
related to modeling, data, and deployment, and outline promising directions for
future research. This survey aims to establish a structured foundation for
advancing HGNN-based anomaly detection toward scalable, interpretable, and
practically deployable solutions.

### [364] [Robust Super-Capacity SRS Channel Inpainting via Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26097)
*Usman Akram,Fan Zhang,Yang Li,Haris Vikalo*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: The paper introduces a diffusion-based channel inpainting framework to improve channel state information (CSI) in 5G NR systems under challenging conditions, outperforming prior methods like MAE with notable robustness to distortions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate CSI is crucial for reliable multiuser MIMO in 5G NR. Sparse SRS allocation faces resource and coverage constraints, necessitating robust methods for CSI predictions under various distortions.

Method: The approach uses a diffusion-based framework that incorporates system-model knowledge via likelihood-gradient terms during inference to adapt to mismatched conditions. The score-based diffusion variant is employed for channel inpainting and compared to UNet score-model and MAE.

Result: The proposed method achieves superior performance under distribution shift, with up to 14 dB NMSE improvement in challenging conditions like Laplace noise and interference. It also maintains competitive performance in standard settings.

Conclusion: Diffusion-guided channel inpainting is presented as a generalizable and robust method for enhancing SRS design and CSI reliability in 5G NR systems, overcoming limitations of prior approaches.

Abstract: Accurate channel state information (CSI) is essential for reliable multiuser
MIMO operation. In 5G NR, reciprocity-based beamforming via uplink Sounding
Reference Signals (SRS) face resource and coverage constraints, motivating
sparse non-uniform SRS allocation. Prior masked-autoencoder (MAE) approaches
improve coverage but overfit to training masks and degrade under unseen
distortions (e.g., additional masking, interference, clipping, non-Gaussian
noise). We propose a diffusion-based channel inpainting framework that
integrates system-model knowledge at inference via a likelihood-gradient term,
enabling a single trained model to adapt across mismatched conditions. On
standardized CDL channels, the score-based diffusion variant consistently
outperforms a UNet score-model baseline and the one-step MAE under distribution
shift, with improvements up to 14 dB NMSE in challenging settings (e.g.,
Laplace noise, user interference), while retaining competitive accuracy under
matched conditions. These results demonstrate that diffusion-guided inpainting
is a robust and generalizable approach for super-capacity SRS design in 5G NR
systems.

### [365] [SABER: Symbolic Regression-based Angle of Arrival and Beam Pattern Estimator](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26340)
*Shih-Kai Chou,Mengran Zhao,Cheng-Nan Hu,Kuang-Chung Chou,Carolina Fortuna,Jernej Hribar*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: This paper introduces SABER, a symbolic-regression framework for interpretable Angle-of-Arrival (AoA) estimation in wireless systems, achieving high accuracy and bridging the gap between black-box ML methods and physics-based models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Classical AoA estimation methods require complex setups, and generic Machine Learning approaches often lack physical interpretability for wireless communication systems.

Method: The authors propose SABER, a symbolic-regression-based framework that extracts interpretable models for AoA estimation from path loss measurements, validated in both controlled and real-world scenarios.

Result: SABER achieves sub-0.5 degree Mean Absolute Error (MAE) in controlled environments and near-zero error in real-world settings, outperforming state-of-the-art methods and matching theoretical CRLB limits.

Conclusion: SABER offers an interpretable and highly accurate alternative to black-box and physics-driven techniques for AoA estimation, validated in both simulation and practical application scenarios.

Abstract: Accurate Angle-of-arrival (AoA) estimation is essential for next-generation
wireless communication systems to enable reliable beamforming, high-precision
localization, and integrated sensing. Unfortunately, classical high-resolution
techniques require multi-element arrays and extensive snapshot collection,
while generic Machine Learning (ML) approaches often yield black-box models
that lack physical interpretability. To address these limitations, we propose a
Symbolic Regression (SR)-based ML framework. Namely, Symbolic Regression-based
Angle of Arrival and Beam Pattern Estimator (SABER), a constrained
symbolic-regression framework that automatically discovers closed-form beam
pattern and AoA models from path loss measurements with interpretability. SABER
achieves high accuracy while bridging the gap between opaque ML methods and
interpretable physics-driven estimators. First, we validate our approach in a
controlled free-space anechoic chamber, showing that both direct inversion of
the known $\cos^n$ beam and a low-order polynomial surrogate achieve sub-0.5
degree Mean Absolute Error (MAE). A purely unconstrained SR method can further
reduce the error of the predicted angles, but produces complex formulas that
lack physical insight. Then, we implement the same SR-learned inversions in a
real-world, Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface (RIS)-aided indoor testbed.
SABER and unconstrained SR models accurately recover the true AoA with
near-zero error. Finally, we benchmark SABER against the Cram\'er-Rao Lower
Bounds (CRLBs). Our results demonstrate that SABER is an interpretable and
accurate alternative to state-of-the-art and black-box ML-based methods for AoA
estimation.

*Xin Hu,Pengfei Xu,Jin Zhou,Hongbo Fu,Hui Huang*

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: The paper introduces StructLayoutFormer, a novel Transformer-based model for generating structured layouts in 2D visual content, ensuring better control of layout structures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a method for conditional structured layout generation in 2D visual content that overcomes the limitations of existing data-driven models, which fail to produce realistic layout structures.

Method: A Transformer-based approach named StructLayoutFormer is introduced, employing a structure serialization scheme to represent structured layouts as sequences while disentangling structural information from element placements.

Result: The approach outperforms existing data-driven layout generation models in producing realistic and conditional structured layouts and effectively extracts and transfers layout structures.

Conclusion: StructLayoutFormer marks a significant advancement in structured layout generation, enabling realistic and editable layouts and providing a superior alternative to conventional data-driven methods.

Abstract: Structured layouts are preferable in many 2D visual contents (\eg, GUIs,
webpages) since the structural information allows convenient layout editing.
Computational frameworks can help create structured layouts but require heavy
labor input. Existing data-driven approaches are effective in automatically
generating fixed layouts but fail to produce layout structures. We present
StructLayoutFormer, a novel Transformer-based approach for conditional
structured layout generation. We use a structure serialization scheme to
represent structured layouts as sequences. To better control the structures of
generated layouts, we disentangle the structural information from the element
placements. Our approach is the first data-driven approach that achieves
conditional structured layout generation and produces realistic layout
structures explicitly. We compare our approach with existing data-driven layout
generation approaches by including post-processing for structure extraction.
Extensive experiments have shown that our approach exceeds these baselines in
conditional structured layout generation. We also demonstrate that our approach
is effective in extracting and transferring layout structures. The code is

TL;DR: RNAGenScape is a framework for optimizing mRNA sequences using machine learning, ensuring effective and biologically plausible exploration in scarce data scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address challenges in mRNA design and optimization for synthetic biology and therapeutic development, including scarce/imbalanced data and complex sequence-function relationships.

Method: RNAGenScape employs a property-guided manifold Langevin dynamics framework, integrating an organized autoencoder and a manifold projector for optimized mRNA design.

Result: RNAGenScape achieves improved target properties and high success rates across three real mRNA datasets, outperforming other generative/optimization methods.

Conclusion: RNAGenScape provides a scalable paradigm for mRNA design, enabling controllable optimization and exploration while maintaining robustness and biological plausibility in limited-data contexts.

Abstract: mRNA design and optimization are important in synthetic biology and
therapeutic development, but remain understudied in machine learning.
Systematic optimization of mRNAs is hindered by the scarce and imbalanced data
as well as complex sequence-function relationships. We present RNAGenScape, a
property-guided manifold Langevin dynamics framework that iteratively updates
mRNA sequences within a learned latent manifold. RNAGenScape combines an
organized autoencoder, which structures the latent space by target properties
for efficient and biologically plausible exploration, with a manifold projector
that contracts each step of update back to the manifold. RNAGenScape supports
property-guided optimization and smooth interpolation between sequences, while
remaining robust under scarce and undersampled data, and ensuring that
intermediate products are close to the viable mRNA manifold. Across three real
mRNA datasets, RNAGenScape improves the target properties with high success
rates and efficiency, outperforming various generative or optimization methods
developed for proteins or non-biological data. By providing continuous,
data-aligned trajectories that reveal how edits influence function, RNAGenScape
establishes a scalable paradigm for controllable mRNA design and latent space
exploration in mRNA sequence modeling.

### [368] [Optimizing Mirror-Image Peptide Sequence Design for Data Storage via Peptide Bond Cleavage Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25814)
*Yilong Lu,Si Chen,Songyan Gao,Han Liu,Xin Dong,Wenfeng Shen,Guangtai Ding*

Main category: q-bio.QM

TL;DR: The paper proposes the use of mirror-image peptides as biological storage media and introduces DBond, a deep neural network model for predicting peptide bond cleavage to improve sequencing accuracy indirectly.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to overcome the limitations of traditional storage media like hard drives in terms of density and lifespan, and also address challenges in sequencing mirror-image peptides due to scarce datasets and algorithm inefficiencies.

Method: The researchers developed DBond, a deep neural network that incorporates features such as sequence attributes, precursor ion properties, and environmental factors in mass spectrometry. They also created the MiPD513 dataset, peptide bond cleavage labeling algorithm, and a dual prediction strategy.

Result: DBond significantly improved sequencing accuracy by predicting peptide bond cleavage. The new single-label classification strategy outperformed existing methods in both single and multiple peptide bond cleavage tasks.

Conclusion: This study demonstrates the potential of optimizing mirror-image peptide sequences to enhance their usability as biological storage media, supported by advanced prediction methods and new datasets.

Abstract: Traditional non-biological storage media, such as hard drives, face
limitations in both storage density and lifespan due to the rapid growth of
data in the big data era. Mirror-image peptides composed of D-amino acids have
emerged as a promising biological storage medium due to their high storage
density, structural stability, and long lifespan. The sequencing of
mirror-image peptides relies on \textit{de-novo} technology. However, its
accuracy is limited by the scarcity of tandem mass spectrometry datasets and
the challenges that current algorithms encounter when processing these peptides
directly. This study is the first to propose improving sequencing accuracy
indirectly by optimizing the design of mirror-image peptide sequences. In this
work, we introduce DBond, a deep neural network based model that integrates
sequence features, precursor ion properties, and mass spectrometry
environmental factors for the prediction of mirror-image peptide bond cleavage.
In this process, sequences with a high peptide bond cleavage ratio, which are
easy to sequence, are selected. The main contributions of this study are as
follows. First, we constructed MiPD513, a tandem mass spectrometry dataset
containing 513 mirror-image peptides. Second, we developed the peptide bond
cleavage labeling algorithm (PBCLA), which generated approximately 12.5 million
labeled data based on MiPD513. Third, we proposed a dual prediction strategy
that combines multi-label and single-label classification. On an independent
test set, the single-label classification strategy outperformed other methods
in both single and multiple peptide bond cleavage prediction tasks, offering a
strong foundation for sequence optimization.

*Maarten P. Scholl,Mahmoud Mahfouz,Anisoara Calinescu,J. Doyne Farmer*

Main category: q-fin.PM

TL;DR: This paper proposes a generative framework, based on GANs, to model mutual fund strategies without needing explicit utility functions, and it successfully captures known investment styles and implicit manager objectives.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fund managers optimize for complex, multi-goal strategies beyond simple risk-return trade-offs, challenging traditional modeling approaches that rely on utility function specification and parameterization.

Method: The authors use a GAN-based generative framework to model the conditional probability of fund portfolio weights, using stock characteristics, historical returns, past weights, and a latent variable representing strategy, without requiring explicit reward or objective labeling.

Result: The model successfully captures investment styles like 'growth' and 'value,' reveals implicit objectives of fund managers, and aligns with some principles of Markowitz-like optimization but in diverse forms. It also provides an interpretable and testable methodology.

Conclusion: This framework offers a data-driven way to characterize investment strategies, aiding in market simulation, strategy attribution, and regulatory oversight, while improving interpretability of fund strategies.

Abstract: While investment funds publicly disclose their objectives in broad terms,
their managers optimize for complex combinations of competing goals that go
beyond simple risk-return trade-offs. Traditional approaches attempt to model
this through multi-objective utility functions, but face fundamental challenges
in specification and parameterization. We propose a generative framework that
learns latent representations of fund manager strategies without requiring
explicit utility specification.
  Our approach directly models the conditional probability of a fund's
portfolio weights, given stock characteristics, historical returns, previous
weights, and a latent variable representing the fund's strategy. Unlike methods
based on reinforcement learning or imitation learning, which require specified
rewards or labeled expert objectives, our GAN-based architecture learns
directly from the joint distribution of observed holdings and market data.
  We validate our framework on a dataset of 1436 U.S. equity mutual funds. The
learned representations successfully capture known investment styles, such as
"growth" and "value," while also revealing implicit manager objectives. For
instance, we find that while many funds exhibit characteristics of
Markowitz-like optimization, they do so with heterogeneous realizations for
turnover, concentration, and latent factors.
  To analyze and interpret the end-to-end model, we develop a series of tests
that explain the model, and we show that the benchmark's expert labeling are
contained in our model's encoding in a linear interpretable way.
  Our framework provides a data-driven approach for characterizing investment
strategies for applications in market simulation, strategy attribution, and
regulatory oversight.

### [370] [Enabling Fast and Accurate Neutral Atom Readout through Image Denoising](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25982)
*Chaithanya Naik Mude,Linipun Phuttitarn,Satvik Maurya,Kunal Sinha,Mark Saffman,Swamit Tannu*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: Neutral atom quantum computers face slow qubit readout which is a bottleneck for quantum error correction. The study introduces GANDALF, an image denoising framework enabling faster and reliable readouts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Neutral atom systems have great potential for scaling up quantum computers but are hindered by slow and error-prone qubit readout processes, limiting their efficiency in quantum error correction.

Method: The proposed framework, GANDALF, incorporates image denoising via image translation techniques to extract clean signals from low-photon measurements. This is complemented with lightweight classifiers and a pipelined readout design.

Result: GANDALF achieves reliable classification at up to 1.6x shorter readout times, reduces logical error rate by up to 35x, and speeds up quantum error correction cycle time up to 1.77x compared to current methods.

Conclusion: The successful implementation of GANDALF demonstrates a breakthrough in addressing the readout speed and accuracy tradeoff in neutral atom quantum computers, enhancing their capability to deploy faster and more reliable quantum error correction.

Abstract: Neutral atom quantum computers hold promise for scaling up to hundreds of
thousands of qubits, but their progress is constrained by slow qubit readout.
Measuring qubits currently takes milliseconds-much longer than the underlying
quantum gate operations-making readout the primary bottleneck in deploying
quantum error correction. Because each round of QEC depends on measurement,
long readout times increase cycle duration and slow down program execution.
Reducing the readout duration speeds up cycles and reduces decoherence errors
that accumulate while qubits idle, but it also lowers the number of collected
photons, making measurements noisier and more error-prone. This tradeoff leaves
neutral atom systems stuck between slow but accurate readout and fast but
unreliable readout.
  We show that image denoising can resolve this tension. Our framework,
GANDALF, uses explicit denoising using image translation to reconstruct clear
signals from short, low-photon measurements, enabling reliable classification
at up to 1.6x shorter readout times. Combined with lightweight classifiers and
a pipelined readout design, our approach both reduces logical error rate by up
to 35x and overall QEC cycle time up to 1.77x compared to state-of-the-art
CNN-based readout for Cesium (Cs) Neutral Atom arrays.

TL;DR: This paper introduces FlowQ-Net, a generative framework for synthesizing compact and efficient quantum circuits using Generative Flow Networks, improving circuit design for quantum computing applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Optimizing quantum circuit designs is critical for noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices to address resource constraints and enhance resilience to errors.

Method: FlowQ-Net employs Generative Flow Networks to learn stochastic policies for sequential circuit construction, guided by user-defined reward functions that consider multiple design objectives.

Result: FlowQ-Net improved circuit efficiency significantly, creating circuits that are 10×-30× more compact in terms of parameters, gates, and depth compared to traditional designs, maintaining performance even on real-world quantum devices.

Conclusion: Generative models like FlowQ-Net represent a promising path to more efficient quantum circuit designs, advancing quantum algorithm development and scientific discovery on NISQ devices.

Abstract: Designing efficient quantum circuits is a central bottleneck to exploring the
potential of quantum computing, particularly for noisy intermediate-scale
quantum (NISQ) devices, where circuit efficiency and resilience to errors are
paramount. The search space of gate sequences grows combinatorially, and
handcrafted templates often waste scarce qubit and depth budgets. We introduce
\textsc{FlowQ-Net} (Flow-based Quantum design Network), a generative framework
for automated quantum circuit synthesis based on Generative Flow Networks
(GFlowNets). This framework learns a stochastic policy to construct circuits
sequentially, sampling them in proportion to a flexible, user-defined reward
function that can encode multiple design objectives such as performance, depth,
and gate count. This approach uniquely enables the generation of a diverse
ensemble of high-quality circuits, moving beyond single-solution optimization.
We demonstrate the efficacy of \textsc{FlowQ-Net} through an extensive set of
simulations. We apply our method to Variational Quantum Algorithm (VQA) ansatz
design for molecular ground state estimation, Max-Cut, and image
classification, key challenges in near-term quantum computing. Circuits
designed by \textsc{FlowQ-Net} achieve significant improvements, yielding
circuits that are 10$\times$-30$\times$ more compact in terms of parameters,
gates, and depth compared to commonly used unitary baselines, without
compromising accuracy. This trend holds even when subjected to error profiles
from real-world quantum devices. Our results underline the potential of
generative models as a general-purpose methodology for automated quantum
circuit design, offering a promising path towards more efficient quantum
algorithms and accelerating scientific discovery in the quantum domain.

TL;DR: This paper introduces Flex-GAD, an unsupervised framework for node-level anomaly detection in attributed networks, improving detection accuracy and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address challenges in detecting anomalous nodes in attributed networks, crucial for fraud prevention and mitigating misinformation in varied domains.

Method: Flex-GAD combines a community-based GCN encoder with a standard attribute encoder, using a self-attention fusion module to integrate information adaptively.

Result: In tests on seven real-world graphs, Flex-GAD improved AUC by 7.98% compared to the best previous method and was significantly faster, running up to 102x faster per epoch.

Conclusion: Flex-GAD provides an effective and efficient solution for graph anomaly detection, suitable for diverse graph structures and datasets.

Abstract: Detecting anomalous nodes in attributed networks, where each node is
associated with both structural connections and descriptive attributes, is
essential for identifying fraud, misinformation, and suspicious behavior in
domains such as social networks, academic citation graphs, and e-commerce
platforms. We propose Flex-GAD, a novel unsupervised framework for graph
anomaly detection at the node level. Flex-GAD integrates two encoders to
capture complementary aspects of graph data. The framework incorporates a novel
community-based GCN encoder to model intra-community and inter-community
information into node embeddings, thereby ensuring structural consistency,
along with a standard attribute encoder. These diverse representations are
fused using a self-attention-based representation fusion module, which enables
adaptive weighting and effective integration of the encoded information. This
fusion mechanism allows automatic emphasis of the most relevant node
representation across different encoders. We evaluate Flex-GAD on seven
real-world attributed graphs with varying sizes, node degrees, and attribute
homogeneity. Flex-GAD achieves an average AUC improvement of 7.98% over the
previously best-performing method, GAD-NR, demonstrating its effectiveness and
flexibility across diverse graph structures. Moreover, it significantly reduces
training time, running 102x faster per epoch than Anomaly DAE and 3x faster per
epoch than GAD-NR on average across seven benchmark datasets.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how political mobilization messages operate at scale in online social networks using advanced simulation methods.

Method: An agent-based simulation is developed combining demographic data, Twitter network topology, and LLM agents, assigning them attributes like political stance and demographic profiles to model interactions and voting behaviors dynamically.

Result: The simulation replicates results similar to real-life experiments, showcasing stronger mobilization effects with social treatments and peer-to-peer spillovers.

Conclusion: The framework provides a reproducible and controlled setting for testing political mobilization tactics and conducting sensitivity analyses, bridging real-world experiments and computational modeling.

Abstract: Online social networks have transformed the ways in which political
mobilization messages are disseminated, raising new questions about how peer
influence operates at scale. Building on the landmark 61-million-person
Facebook experiment \citep{bond201261}, we develop an agent-based simulation
framework that integrates real U.S. Census demographic distributions, authentic
Twitter network topology, and heterogeneous large language model (LLM) agents
to examine the effect of mobilization messages on voter turnout. Each simulated
agent is assigned demographic attributes, a personal political stance, and an
LLM variant (\texttt{GPT-4.1}, \texttt{GPT-4.1-Mini}, or \texttt{GPT-4.1-Nano})
reflecting its political sophistication. Agents interact over realistic social
network structures, receiving personalized feeds and dynamically updating their
engagement behaviors and voting intentions. Experimental conditions replicate
the informational and social mobilization treatments of the original Facebook
study. Across scenarios, the simulator reproduces qualitative patterns observed
in field experiments, including stronger mobilization effects under social
message treatments and measurable peer spillovers. Our framework provides a
controlled, reproducible environment for testing counterfactual designs and
sensitivity analyses in political mobilization research, offering a bridge
between high-validity field experiments and flexible computational
modeling.\footnote{Code and data available at

Motivation: To offer a mathematically principled approach for solving distributionally robust optimization problems using a gradient flow perspective.

Method: The authors leverage recent advancements in gradient flow theory, specifically using Wasserstein Fisher-Rao and Stein variational gradient flows, to design new algorithms for distributionally robust optimization.

Result: The framework recovers popular DRO methods, introduces novel algorithms, and provides deeper insights into their theoretical behavior and convergence dynamics. Numerical experiments validate these findings.

Conclusion: The paper establishes a robust and theoretically sound framework for DRO, offering practical algorithms and providing new theoretical insights that unify and extend prior approaches.

Abstract: We propose a mathematically principled PDE gradient flow framework for
distributionally robust optimization (DRO). Exploiting the recent advances in
the intersection of Markov Chain Monte Carlo sampling and gradient flow theory,
we show that our theoretical framework can be implemented as practical
algorithms for sampling from worst-case distributions and, consequently, DRO.
While numerous previous works have proposed various reformulation techniques
and iterative algorithms, we contribute a sound gradient flow view of the
distributional optimization that can be used to construct new algorithms. As an
example of applications, we solve a class of Wasserstein and Sinkhorn DRO
problems using the recently-discovered Wasserstein Fisher-Rao and Stein
variational gradient flows. Notably, we also show some simple reductions of our
framework recover exactly previously proposed popular DRO methods, and provide
new insights into their theoretical limit and optimization dynamics. Numerical
studies based on stochastic gradient descent provide empirical backing for our
theoretical findings.

TL;DR: This paper introduces a hybrid system to improve finance-native collateral optimization under ISDA CSAs, combining machine learning and quantum-inspired methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the complexity of collateral optimization under ISDA CSAs, which involves challenging financial constraints like integer lots, caps, and haircuts.

Method: The methodology includes a hybrid pipeline involving (i) LLM for extracting CSA terms, (ii) quantum-inspired algorithms interleaving simulated annealing and higher order QAOA for optimization, (iii) a risk-aware objective function, and (iv) using CP-SAT to certify feasibility.

Result: The hybrid system improves optimization outcomes by up to 10.7% over a classical baseline on government bond datasets, achieving better cost, movement, and risk tradeoffs.

Conclusion: The proposed hybrid system demonstrates superior performance in collateral optimization and offers governance auditability through released artifacts.

Abstract: We address finance-native collateral optimization under ISDA Credit Support
Annexes (CSAs), where integer lots, Schedule A haircuts, RA/MTA gating, and
issuer/currency/class caps create rugged, legally bounded search spaces. We
introduce a certifiable hybrid pipeline purpose-built for this domain: (i) an
evidence-gated LLM that extracts CSA terms to a normalized JSON
(abstain-by-default, span-cited); (ii) a quantum-inspired explorer that
interleaves simulated annealing with micro higher order QAOA (HO-QAOA) on
binding sub-QUBOs (subset size n <= 16, order k <= 4) to coordinate multi-asset
moves across caps and RA-induced discreteness; (iii) a weighted risk-aware
objective (Movement, CVaR, funding-priced overshoot) with an explicit coverage
window U <= Reff+B; and (iv) CP-SAT as single arbiter to certify feasibility
and gaps, including a U-cap pre-check that reports the minimal feasible buffer
B*. Encoding caps/rounding as higher-order terms lets HO-QAOA target the domain
couplings that defeat local swaps. On government bond datasets and multi-CSA
inputs, the hybrid improves a strong classical baseline (BL-3) by 9.1%, 9.6%,
and 10.7% across representative harnesses, delivering better cost-movement-tail
frontiers under governance settings. We release governance grade artifacts-span
citations, valuation matrix audit, weight provenance, QUBO manifests, and
CP-SAT traces-to make results auditable and reproducible.

predictive path-following control. Static as well as moving obstacles are
considered. Central to the approach is a computationally efficient and
continuously differentiable condition for detecting collisions with ellipsoidal
obstacles. A novel two-stage optimization approach mitigates numerical issues
arising from the structure of the resulting optimal control problem. The
effectiveness of the approach is demonstrated through simulations and
real-world experiments with the Crazyflie quadrotor. This represents the first
hardware demonstration of an MPC controller of this kind for UAVs in a
three-dimensional task.

### [377] [FGGM: Formal Grey-box Gradient Method for Attacking DRL-based MU-MIMO Scheduler](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26075)
*Thanh Le,Hai Duong,Yusheng Ji,ThanhVu Nguyen,John C. S. Lui*

Main category: cs.NI

TL;DR: This paper addresses the security risks in DRL-based MU-MIMO systems in 5G networks, focusing on adversarial attacks exploiting CSI data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand and mitigate security vulnerabilities arising from adversarial attacks in DRL-based user selection in MU-MIMO 5G systems.

Method: Develop an attacking scheme called FGGM using polytope abstract domains to estimate bounds for manipulated CSIs, targeting throughput degradation attacks.

Result: Experimental results show that FGGM can reduce victim network throughput by up to 70% without accessing exact CSI values.

Conclusion: The paper highlights security risks in DRL-based systems and proposes an effective attacking scheme, emphasizing the need for robust defenses in resource allocation problems.

Abstract: In 5G mobile communication systems, MU-MIMO has been applied to enhance
spectral efficiency and support high data rates. To maximize spectral
efficiency while providing fairness among users, the base station (BS) needs to
selects a subset of users for data transmission. Given that this problem is
NP-hard, DRL-based methods have been proposed to infer the near-optimal
solutions in real-time, yet this approach has an intrinsic security problem.
This paper investigates how a group of adversarial users can exploit
unsanitized raw CSIs to launch a throughput degradation attack. Most existing
studies only focused on systems in which adversarial users can obtain the exact
values of victims' CSIs, but this is impractical in the case of uplink
transmission in LTE/5G mobile systems. We note that the DRL policy contains an
observation normalizer which has the mean and variance of the observation to
improve training convergence. Adversarial users can then estimate the upper and
lower bounds of the local observations including the CSIs of victims based
solely on that observation normalizer. We develop an attacking scheme FGGM by
leveraging polytope abstract domains, a technique used to bound the outputs of
a neural network given the input ranges. Our goal is to find one set of
intentionally manipulated CSIs which can achieve the attacking goals for the
whole range of local observations of victims. Experimental results demonstrate
that FGGM can determine a set of adversarial CSI vector controlled by
adversarial users, then reuse those CSIs throughout the simulation to reduce
the network throughput of a victim up to 70\% without knowing the exact value
of victims' local observations. This study serves as a case study and can be
applied to many other DRL-based problems, such as a knapsack-oriented resource
allocation problems.

### [378] [Statistical Inference for Matching Decisions via Matrix Completion under Dependent Missingness](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26478)
*Congyuan Duan,Wanteng Ma,Dong Xia,Kan Xu*

Main category: stat.ME

TL;DR: This paper addresses decision-making in matching markets using matrix completion, proposing a non-convex algorithm and approaches for statistical inference under matching-induced dependent sampling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to tackle the challenges in estimating and making inferences within matching markets where observed data is constrained by matching-induced dependence, departing from classical matrix completion assumptions.

Method: The authors propose a non-convex algorithm using Grassmannian gradient descent for matrix completion and develop a debiasing and projection framework to quantify uncertainty and perform hypothesis testing under matching-induced dependent sampling.

Result: The approach achieves near-optimal entrywise convergence rates for matching mechanisms, demonstrates asymptotic normality with finite-sample guarantees, and performs well in empirical experiments with accurate estimation and valid confidence intervals.

Conclusion: The proposed algorithm and inference framework offer effective tools for decision-making in matching markets while addressing the challenges posed by dependent sampling constraints.

Abstract: This paper studies decision-making and statistical inference for two-sided
matching markets via matrix completion. In contrast to the independent sampling
assumed in classical matrix completion literature, the observed entries, which
arise from past matching data, are constrained by matching capacity. This
matching-induced dependence poses new challenges for both estimation and
inference in the matrix completion framework. We propose a non-convex algorithm
based on Grassmannian gradient descent and establish near-optimal entrywise
convergence rates for three canonical mechanisms, i.e., one-to-one matching,
one-to-many matching with one-sided random arrival, and two-sided random
arrival. To facilitate valid uncertainty quantification and hypothesis testing
on matching decisions, we further develop a general debiasing and projection
framework for arbitrary linear forms of the reward matrix, deriving asymptotic
normality with finite-sample guarantees under matching-induced dependent
sampling. Our empirical experiments demonstrate that the proposed approach
provides accurate estimation, valid confidence intervals, and efficient
evaluation of matching policies.

Main category: cs.DB

TL;DR: The paper introduces DySQL-Bench, a benchmark for evaluating Text-to-SQL systems in dynamic, multi-turn scenarios, revealing new challenges for adapting to evolving user intents.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current Text-to-SQL systems perform well in static tasks but struggle with dynamic scenarios where user intents change over multiple interactions. This paper aims to address this gap to better reflect real-world needs.

Method: DySQL-Bench uses an automated two-stage pipeline for task synthesis and validation, involving structured tree representations for generation, interaction-based filtering, and expert evaluation. Additionally, a multi-turn evaluation framework simulates realistic interactions.

Result: DySQL-Bench comprises 1,072 tasks spanning 13 domains and tests models on evolving user intents. Even GPT-4 achieves only 58.34% accuracy and 23.81% Pass@5 score, demonstrating the benchmark's complexity.

Conclusion: DySQL-Bench reveals existing systems' limitations in handling multi-turn Text-to-SQL tasks, providing a robust tool and dataset for advancing research in this area.

Abstract: Recent advances in Text-to-SQL have achieved strong results in static,
single-turn tasks, where models generate SQL queries from natural language
questions. However, these systems fall short in real-world interactive
scenarios, where user intents evolve and queries must be refined over multiple
turns. In applications such as finance and business analytics, users
iteratively adjust query constraints or dimensions based on intermediate
results. To evaluate such dynamic capabilities, we introduce DySQL-Bench, a
benchmark assessing model performance under evolving user interactions. Unlike
previous manually curated datasets, DySQL-Bench is built through an automated
two-stage pipeline of task synthesis and verification. Structured tree
representations derived from raw database tables guide LLM-based task
generation, followed by interaction-oriented filtering and expert validation.
Human evaluation confirms 100% correctness of the synthesized data. We further
propose a multi-turn evaluation framework simulating realistic interactions
among an LLM-simulated user, the model under test, and an executable database.
The model must adapt its reasoning and SQL generation as user intents change.
DySQL-Bench covers 13 domains across BIRD and Spider 2 databases, totaling
1,072 tasks. Even GPT-4o attains only 58.34% overall accuracy and 23.81% on the
Pass@5 metric, underscoring the benchmark's difficulty. All code and data are
released at https://github.com/Aurora-slz/Real-World-SQL-Bench .

*Xinqi Li,Yi Zhang,Li-Ting Huang,Hsiao-Huang Chang,Thoralf Niendorf,Min-Chi Ku,Qian Tao,Hsin-Jung Yang*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: This paper develops a physics-informed deep learning model for multi-contrast MRI image registration, aiming to improve alignment across different image types.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The misalignment in multiparametric MRI maps creates challenges for pixel-wise myocardial tissue analysis. The study aims to overcome this limitation by creating a robust image registration framework that accommodates diverse contrast complexities.

Method: A generalizable physics-informed deep learning model with test-time adaptation is proposed. Synthetic images from specific physics models are used as references for transductive learning to enable accurate registration across T1 and T2 mapping images.

Result: The model has been validated in healthy volunteers using various MRI sequences, demonstrating improvements in multi-contrast image registration with significantly reduced variability.

Conclusion: The approach provides a reliable method for addressing image misalignment in multiparametric mapping MRI, enabling better tissue characterization and possibly enhancing clinical diagnostic capabilities.

Abstract: Multiparametric mapping MRI has become a viable tool for myocardial tissue
characterization. However, misalignment between multiparametric maps makes
pixel-wise analysis challenging. To address this challenge, we developed a
generalizable physics-informed deep-learning model using test-time adaptation
to enable group image registration across contrast weighted images acquired
from multiple physical models (e.g., a T1 mapping model and T2 mapping model).
The physics-informed adaptation utilized the synthetic images from specific
physics model as registration reference, allows for transductive learning for
various tissue contrast. We validated the model in healthy volunteers with
various MRI sequences, demonstrating its improvement for multi-modal
registration with a wide range of image contrast variability.

*Xizhi Tian,Changjun Zhou,Yulin. Yang*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: This paper introduces SPG-CDENet, a novel segmentation approach addressing challenges in multi-organ segmentation with spatial priors and cross dual encoder network innovations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address challenges in multi-organ segmentation due to variations in organ size and shape.

Method: Proposing SPG-CDENet with a spatial prior network for coarse localization guidance and a cross dual encoder network for refined segmentation using global encoding, symmetric cross-attention, and flow-based decoding.

Result: Experiments on public datasets show SPG-CDENet outperforming existing segmentation methods in both qualitative and quantitative assessments.

Conclusion: The SPG-CDENet significantly improves multi-organ segmentation accuracy and validates the proposed modules' effectiveness through ablation studies.

Abstract: Multi-organ segmentation is a critical task in computer-aided diagnosis.
While recent deep learning methods have achieved remarkable success in image
segmentation, huge variations in organ size and shape challenge their
effectiveness in multi-organ segmentation. To address these challenges, we
propose a Spatial Prior-Guided Cross Dual Encoder Network (SPG-CDENet), a novel
two-stage segmentation paradigm designed to improve multi-organ segmentation
accuracy. Our SPG-CDENet consists of two key components: a spatial prior
network and a cross dual encoder network. The prior network generates coarse
localization maps that delineate the approximate ROI, serving as spatial
guidance for the dual encoder network. The cross dual encoder network comprises
four essential components: a global encoder, a local encoder, a symmetric
cross-attention module, and a flow-based decoder. The global encoder captures
global semantic features from the entire image, while the local encoder focuses
on features from the prior network. To enhance the interaction between the
global and local encoders, a symmetric cross-attention module is proposed
across all layers of the encoders to fuse and refine features. Furthermore, the
flow-based decoder directly propagates high-level semantic features from the
final encoder layer to all decoder layers, maximizing feature preservation and
utilization. Extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments on two public
datasets demonstrate the superior performance of SPG-CDENet compared to
existing segmentation methods. Furthermore, ablation studies further validate
the effectiveness of the proposed modules in improving segmentation accuracy.

*Wondimagegn Abebe Demissie,Stefano Roccella,Rudy Rossetto,Antonio Minnocci,Andrea Vannini,Luca Sebastiani*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: This paper compares three deep learning models for olive tree crown segmentation in UAV imagery, assessing their accuracy and speed for biovolume estimation in precision agriculture.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To support yield prediction and resource management in Mediterranean regions facing climate stresses by enabling accurate biovolume estimation of olive trees.

Method: Three deep learning models (U-Net, YOLOv11m-seg, and Mask R-CNN) were applied for segmenting olive tree crowns and shadows using annotated UAV imagery. Biovolumes were estimated by combining crown area and shadow-derived height through solar geometry.

Result: Mask R-CNN achieved the highest accuracy (F1 = 0.86; mIoU = 0.72), YOLOv11m-seg delivered the fastest throughput (0.12 second/image), biovolumes ranged from 4 to 24 cubic meters, highlighting tree structural differences.

Conclusion: Mask R-CNN was identified for scenarios requiring high accuracy, while YOLOv11m-seg is ideal for large-scale, time-sensitive applications. U-Net offers a lightweight, high-sensitivity alternative. The framework is scalable and could benefit from further integration with DEM/DSM data and field calibration.

Abstract: Olive tree biovolume estimation is a key task in precision agriculture,
supporting yield prediction and resource management, especially in
Mediterranean regions severely impacted by climate-induced stress. This study
presents a comparative analysis of three deep learning models U-Net,
YOLOv11m-seg, and Mask RCNN for segmenting olive tree crowns and their shadows
in ultra-high resolution UAV imagery. The UAV dataset, acquired over
Vicopisano, Italy, includes manually annotated crown and shadow masks. Building
on these annotations, the methodology emphasizes spatial feature extraction and
robust segmentation; per-tree biovolume is then estimated by combining crown
projected area with shadow-derived height using solar geometry. In testing,
Mask R-CNN achieved the best overall accuracy (F1 = 0.86; mIoU = 0.72), while
YOLOv11m-seg provided the fastest throughput (0.12 second per image). The
estimated biovolumes spanned from approximately 4 to 24 cubic meters,
reflecting clear structural differences among trees. These results indicate
Mask R-CNN is preferable when biovolume accuracy is paramount, whereas
YOLOv11m-seg suits large-area deployments where speed is critical; U-Net
remains a lightweight, high-sensitivity option. The framework enables accurate,
scalable orchard monitoring and can be further strengthened with DEM or DSM
integration and field calibration for operational decision support.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: SAMRI adapts SAM's image segmentation capabilities to MRI by fine-tuning its mask decoder, achieving high accuracy and efficiency in segmenting diverse anatomical regions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MRI segmentation is important for clinical decision-making but is challenging due to labor-intensive manual processes and MRI-specific variations. Existing solutions fail to address these challenges effectively.

Method: SAMRI specializes the existing Segment Anything Model (SAM) for MRI by implementing a two-stage fine-tuning approach specifically on the mask decoder.

Result: SAMRI reduces training time by 94% and trainable parameters by 96%, while attaining state-of-the-art results with a mean Dice score of 0.87 across diverse MRI segmentation tasks.

Conclusion: SAMRI provides an efficient and accurate solution for MRI segmentation, showing strong generalization across anatomical regions and particularly excelling in small, clinically important structures.

Abstract: Accurate magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) segmentation is crucial for
clinical decision-making, but remains labor-intensive when performed manually.
Convolutional neural network (CNN)-based methods can be accurate and efficient,
but often generalize poorly to MRI's variable contrast, intensity
inhomogeneity, and protocols. Although the transformer-based Segment Anything
Model (SAM) has demonstrated remarkable generalizability in natural images,
existing adaptations often treat MRI as another imaging modality, overlooking
these modality-specific challenges. We present SAMRI, an MRI-specialized SAM
trained and validated on 1.1 million labeled MR slices spanning whole-body
organs and pathologies. We demonstrate that SAM can be effectively adapted to
MRI by simply fine-tuning its mask decoder using a two-stage strategy, reducing
training time by 94% and trainable parameters by 96% versus full-model
retraining. Across diverse MRI segmentation tasks, SAMRI achieves a mean Dice
of 0.87, delivering state-of-the-art accuracy across anatomical regions and
robust generalization on unseen structures, particularly small and clinically
important structures.

*Alya Almsouti,Ainur Khamitova,Darya Taratynova,Mohammad Yaqub*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: This paper introduces BRIQA, an automated solution for assessing artifacts in pediatric brain MRI, addressing class imbalance with improved performance on several metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual quality assessment of pediatric brain MRI is prone to subjectivity and is time-intensive, especially for low-field systems with reduced signal-to-noise ratios. There is a need for robust automated methods to ensure diagnostic accuracy and efficiency.

Method: The proposed method, BRIQA, utilizes gradient-based loss reweighting for dynamic adjustments to class contributions and a rotating batching mechanism for consistent learning across underrepresented classes.

Result: The study demonstrates that BRIQA improves the average macro F1 score from 0.659 to 0.706 in artifact severity classification, with specific improvements in identifying Noise, Zipper, Positioning, Contrast, Motion, and Banding artifacts.

Conclusion: BRIQA presents a significant advancement in automated MRI quality assessment by addressing class imbalances effectively, offering an efficient alternative to manual evaluation for enhanced diagnostic outcomes.

Abstract: Assessing the severity of artifacts in pediatric brain Magnetic Resonance
Imaging (MRI) is critical for diagnostic accuracy, especially in low-field
systems where the signal-to-noise ratio is reduced. Manual quality assessment
is time-consuming and subjective, motivating the need for robust automated
solutions. In this work, we propose BRIQA (Balanced Reweighting in Image
Quality Assessment), which addresses class imbalance in artifact severity
levels. BRIQA uses gradient-based loss reweighting to dynamically adjust
per-class contributions and employs a rotating batching scheme to ensure
consistent exposure to underrepresented classes. Through experiments, no single
architecture performs best across all artifact types, emphasizing the
importance of architectural diversity. The rotating batching configuration
improves performance across metrics by promoting balanced learning when
combined with cross-entropy loss. BRIQA improves average macro F1 score from
0.659 to 0.706, with notable gains in Noise (0.430), Zipper (0.098),
Positioning (0.097), Contrast (0.217), Motion (0.022), and Banding (0.012)
artifact severity classification. The code is available at

Motivation: To explore the potential of medical foundation models for detecting prostate cancer using micro-ultrasound data and validate their effectiveness in clinical settings.

Method: The paper presents ProstNFound+, integrating a medical foundation model, adapter tuning, and a prompt encoder for clinical biomarkers. The model was trained on retrospective data and validated prospectively on new data.

Result: ProstNFound+ demonstrated robust generalization to prospective data without performance loss, aligning with clinical scoring protocols and generating interpretable heatmaps consistent with biopsy findings.

Conclusion: ProstNFound+ shows potential for clinical deployment as a scalable and interpretable alternative to current expert-driven protocols for prostate cancer detection.

Abstract: Purpose: Medical foundation models (FMs) offer a path to build
high-performance diagnostic systems. However, their application to prostate
cancer (PCa) detection from micro-ultrasound ({\mu}US) remains untested in
clinical settings. We present ProstNFound+, an adaptation of FMs for PCa
detection from {\mu}US, along with its first prospective validation. Methods:
ProstNFound+ incorporates a medical FM, adapter tuning, and a custom prompt
encoder that embeds PCa-specific clinical biomarkers. The model generates a
cancer heatmap and a risk score for clinically significant PCa. Following
training on multi-center retrospective data, the model is prospectively
evaluated on data acquired five years later from a new clinical site. Model
predictions are benchmarked against standard clinical scoring protocols
(PRI-MUS and PI-RADS). Results: ProstNFound+ shows strong generalization to the
prospective data, with no performance degradation compared to retrospective
evaluation. It aligns closely with clinical scores and produces interpretable
heatmaps consistent with biopsy-confirmed lesions. Conclusion: The results
highlight its potential for clinical deployment, offering a scalable and
interpretable alternative to expert-driven protocols.

Conclusion: The MORE dataset significantly boosts model generalization capabilities. Freely accessible, it provides a valuable resource for improving medical image reconstruction performance.

Abstract: CT reconstruction provides radiologists with images for diagnosis and
treatment, yet current deep learning methods are typically limited to specific
anatomies and datasets, hindering generalization ability to unseen anatomies
and lesions. To address this, we introduce the Multi-Organ medical image
REconstruction (MORE) dataset, comprising CT scans across 9 diverse anatomies

facilitating rigorous evaluation of model generalization for CT reconstruction.
We further establish a strong baseline solution that outperforms prior
approaches under these challenging conditions. Our results demonstrate that:
(1) a comprehensive dataset helps improve the generalization capability of

*Peter Behroozi*

Main category: astro-ph.IM

TL;DR: This paper introduces a novel Markov Chain Monte Carlo sampler inspired by ray tracing in refractive index mediums, achieving robust sampling performance even in complex scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve sampling resilience and overcome challenges posed by likelihood barriers and heating in stochastic gradients, particularly for large neural network models.

Method: The authors propose a ray tracing based MCMC sampler that propagates rays at constant speed through parameter space, showing compatibility with various sampling methods under the generalized framework.

Result: The method exhibited orders-of-magnitude improvement in resilience and allowed sampling across different neural network architectures, including the 1.5 billion-parameter GPT-2, using a consumer-level GPU.

Conclusion: Ray tracing offers a significant advancement in sampling methods with extensive applicability and compatibility, supported by public implementation in multiple coding frameworks.

Abstract: We derive a Markov Chain Monte Carlo sampler based on following ray paths in
a medium where the refractive index $n(x)$ is a function of the desired
likelihood $\mathcal{L}(x)$. The sampling method propagates rays at constant
speed through parameter space, leading to orders of magnitude higher resilience
to heating for stochastic gradients as compared to Hamiltonian Monte Carlo
(HMC), as well as the ability to cross any likelihood barrier, including holes
in parameter space. Using the ray tracing method, we sample the posterior
distributions of neural network outputs for a variety of different
architectures, up to the 1.5 billion-parameter GPT-2 (Generative Pre-trained
Transformer 2) architecture, all on a single consumer-level GPU. We also show
that prior samplers including traditional HMC, microcanonical HMC, Metropolis,
Gibbs, and even Monte Carlo integration are special cases within a generalized
ray tracing framework, which can sample according to an arbitrary weighting
function. Public code and documentation for C, JAX, and PyTorch are available

*Manideep Pendyala*

Main category: astro-ph.IM

TL;DR: This paper addresses the overwhelming number of pulsar candidates generated during surveys by developing a deep learning pipeline combining array-derived features and image diagnostics. The model achieves a final accuracy of 94% using GAN-based augmentation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Pulsar surveys produce vast quantities of data that are impractical for manual analysis, highlighting the need for automated candidate selection methods.

Method: The proposed pipeline converts raw GMRT data to processed pulsar candidates, analyzes them using fused array and image diagnostics, and employs refined CNN architectures with GAN-based augmentation for minority class recall.

Result: The final model integrated GANs and CNNs, achieving 94% accuracy for pulsar classification with balanced precision and recall while maintaining efficiency for near-real-time operations.

Conclusion: Combining array-derived features with image-based diagnostics enhances classification accuracy over image-only methods, and targeted augmentation improves recall for minority classes like pulsars. The pipeline is adaptable to future high-throughput pulsar surveys.

Abstract: Pulsar surveys generate millions of candidates per run, overwhelming manual
inspection. This thesis builds a deep learning pipeline for radio pulsar
candidate selection that fuses array-derived features with image diagnostics.
From approximately 500 GB of Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope (GMRT) data, raw
voltages are converted to filterbanks (SIGPROC), then de-dispersed and folded
across trial dispersion measures (PRESTO) to produce approximately 32,000
candidates. Each candidate yields four diagnostics--summed profile, time vs.
phase, subbands vs. phase, and DM curve--represented as arrays and images. A
baseline stacked model (ANNs for arrays + CNNs for images with
logistic-regression fusion) reaches 68% accuracy. We then refine the CNN
architecture and training (regularization, learning-rate scheduling, max-norm
constraints) and mitigate class imbalance via targeted augmentation, including
a GAN-based generator for the minority class. The enhanced CNN attains 87%
accuracy; the final GAN+CNN system achieves 94% accuracy with balanced
precision and recall on a held-out test set, while remaining lightweight enough
for near--real-time triage. The results show that combining array and image
channels improves separability over image-only approaches, and that modest
generative augmentation substantially boosts minority (pulsar) recall. The
methods are survey-agnostic and extensible to forthcoming high-throughput
facilities.

*Hitomi Jin Ling Tee,Chaoren Wang,Zijie Zhang,Zhizheng Wu*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: Current TTS evaluations are limited by metrics like WER. The paper proposes SP-MCQA, a new subjective method for measuring intelligibility and key information accuracy in synthesized speech, supported by a benchmark dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional intelligibility metrics for TTS, such as Word Error Rate (WER), fail to sufficiently capture the complexity of real-world speech comprehension and human needs.

Method: The authors propose Spoken-Passage Multiple-Choice Question Answering (SP-MCQA), a novel subjective evaluation technique, and introduce an 8.76-hour news-style benchmark dataset called SP-MCQA-Eval.

Result: Experiments indicate that even with low WER, TTS systems can struggle with key-information accuracy. SOTA models show limitations in text normalization and phonetic accuracy.

Conclusion: A high-level intelligibility evaluation metric like SP-MCQA is needed, as traditional metrics do not adequately assess the practical understanding of synthesized speech.

Abstract: The evaluation of intelligibility for TTS has reached a bottleneck, as
existing assessments heavily rely on word-by-word accuracy metrics such as WER,
which fail to capture the complexity of real-world speech or reflect human
comprehension needs. To address this, we propose Spoken-Passage Multiple-Choice
Question Answering, a novel subjective approach evaluating the accuracy of key
information in synthesized speech, and release SP-MCQA-Eval, an 8.76-hour
news-style benchmark dataset for SP-MCQA evaluation. Our experiments reveal
that low WER does not necessarily guarantee high key-information accuracy,
exposing a gap between traditional metrics and practical intelligibility.
SP-MCQA shows that even state-of-the-art (SOTA) models still lack robust text
normalization and phonetic accuracy. This work underscores the urgent need for
high-level, more life-like evaluation criteria now that many systems already
excel at WER yet may fall short on real-world intelligibility.

### [390] [ALMGuard: Safety Shortcuts and Where to Find Them as Guardrails for Audio-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26096)
*Weifei Jin,Yuxin Cao,Junjie Su,Minhui Xue,Jie Hao,Ke Xu,Jin Song Dong,Derui Wang*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: The paper introduces a defense framework called ALMGuard for Audio-Language Models (ALMs) against jailbreak attacks, leveraging Shortcut Activation Perturbations tailored to activate safety protocols.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Audio-Language Models (ALMs) are advancing multimodal understanding but are vulnerable to ALM-specific jailbreak attacks. Existing defense mechanisms are ineffective against these threats.

Method: The authors propose ALMGuard, including Shortcut Activation Perturbations (SAPs) to trigger safety shortcuts, and the Mel-Gradient Sparse Mask (M-GSM), which applies targeted perturbations to sensitive Mel-frequency bins for secure inference.

Result: ALMGuard reduces the success rate of ALM-specific jailbreak attacks to 4.6% while maintaining utility on benign tasks, outperforming prior defenses.

Conclusion: ALMGuard proves effective as the first defense framework designed for ALMs against multimodal jailbreak attacks, setting a new benchmark in robustness and maintaining task performance.

Abstract: Recent advances in Audio-Language Models (ALMs) have significantly improved
multimodal understanding capabilities. However, the introduction of the audio
modality also brings new and unique vulnerability vectors. Previous studies
have proposed jailbreak attacks that specifically target ALMs, revealing that
defenses directly transferred from traditional audio adversarial attacks or
text-based Large Language Model (LLM) jailbreaks are largely ineffective
against these ALM-specific threats. To address this issue, we propose ALMGuard,
the first defense framework tailored to ALMs. Based on the assumption that
safety-aligned shortcuts naturally exist in ALMs, we design a method to
identify universal Shortcut Activation Perturbations (SAPs) that serve as
triggers that activate the safety shortcuts to safeguard ALMs at inference
time. To better sift out effective triggers while preserving the model's
utility on benign tasks, we further propose Mel-Gradient Sparse Mask (M-GSM),
which restricts perturbations to Mel-frequency bins that are sensitive to
jailbreaks but insensitive to speech understanding. Both theoretical analyses
and empirical results demonstrate the robustness of our method against both
seen and unseen attacks. Overall, \MethodName reduces the average success rate
of advanced ALM-specific jailbreak attacks to 4.6% across four models, while
maintaining comparable utility on benign benchmarks, establishing it as the new
state of the art. Our code and data are available at

*Saleh Albeaik,Faisal Alsallum,Mohamad Alrished*

Main category: physics.soc-ph

TL;DR: The study explores interactions between individuals and groups, revealing distinct proximity zones and behaviors in crowd dynamics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how people interact with groups and the role of social norms in pedestrian behaviors within crowds.

Method: Analysis of naturalistic data focusing on group zones, zone occupancy counts, and proximity behaviors.

Result: Three distinct zones in addition to the public zone were identified, showing that people mostly stay in the public zone and approach groups cautiously and briefly.

Conclusion: These findings enhance the understanding of group proxemics in crowd behavior, highlighting how proximity and interaction with groups are regulated by social norms.

Abstract: People tend to walk in groups, and interactions with those groups have a
significant impact on crowd behavior and pedestrian traffic dynamics. Social
norms can be seen as unwritten rules regulating people interactions in social
settings. This article studies people interactions with groups and the
emergence of group proxemics. Group zones, zone occupancy counts and people
clearance from the group are studied using naturalistic data. Analysis indicate
potential presence of three different zones in addition to the public zone.
People tend to remain in the public zone and only progressively get closer to
groups, and those closer approaches happen in a low frequency and for brief
periods of time.

*Charlotte Claye,Pierre Marschall,Wassila Ouerdane,Céline Hudelot,Julien Duquesne*

Main category: q-bio.GN

TL;DR: The paper presents a concept-based interpretability framework for single-cell RNA-seq models to improve their utility in biological discovery.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current single-cell RNA-seq models are effective in downstream tasks but their black-box nature limits interpretability, hindering biological discovery.

Method: It introduces an interpretability framework using attribution methods with counterfactual perturbations and offers two approaches: expert-driven analysis and ontology-driven pathway enrichment.

Result: The framework improves concept interpretability of single-cell RNA-seq models, showcasing concepts as being more informative than individual neurons while maintaining the latent representations' richness.

Conclusion: This work establishes a robust framework for decoding biological knowledge encoded in RNA-seq models, enabling hypothesis generation and discovery.

Abstract: Single-cell RNA-seq foundation models achieve strong performance on
downstream tasks but remain black boxes, limiting their utility for biological
discovery. Recent work has shown that sparse dictionary learning can extract
concepts from deep learning models, with promising applications in biomedical
imaging and protein models. However, interpreting biological concepts remains
challenging, as biological sequences are not inherently human-interpretable. We
introduce a novel concept-based interpretability framework for single-cell
RNA-seq models with a focus on concept interpretation and evaluation. We
propose an attribution method with counterfactual perturbations that identifies
genes that influence concept activation, moving beyond correlational approaches
like differential expression analysis. We then provide two complementary
interpretation approaches: an expert-driven analysis facilitated by an
interactive interface and an ontology-driven method with attribution-based
biological pathway enrichment. Applying our framework to two well-known
single-cell RNA-seq models from the literature, we interpret concepts extracted
by Top-K Sparse Auto-Encoders trained on two immune cell datasets. With a
domain expert in immunology, we show that concepts improve interpretability
compared to individual neurons while preserving the richness and
informativeness of the latent representations. This work provides a principled
framework for interpreting what biological knowledge foundation models have
encoded, paving the way for their use for hypothesis generation and discovery.

TL;DR: The study investigates the perspectives of industry stakeholders on the ABET accreditation process, focusing on the employability of graduates and critical insights in non-industrialized contexts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ABET accreditation is pivotal for engineering programs globally, requiring alignment with stakeholders' needs to enrich employability prospects for graduates.

Method: Qualitative research through interviews with industry advisory board members in an Ecuadorian engineering program that achieved ABET accreditation.

Result: The research provides insights on how industry views the relevance, usefulness, and employability outcomes tied to ABET accreditation.

Conclusion: ABET accreditation processes in less industrialized regions can benefit from industry stakeholders' input, bolstering its applicability and effectiveness.

Abstract: ABET accreditation is an increasingly prominent system of global
accreditation of engineering programs, and the assessment requires programs to
demonstrate that they meet the needs of the program's stakeholders, typically
industrial potential employers of graduates. To obtain these inputs, programs
are required to assemble an advisory committee board. The views of the advisory
board on the relevance of the degree outcomes are an essential part of this
process. The purpose of this qualitative research study is to explore the
viewpoints that industry stakeholders have on this type of process. The context
for the study was an Ecuadorian engineering program which had successfully
achieved the ABET accreditation. The study drew on interviews undertaken with
industry members who were part of the advisory board. This study focuses on how
they perceive the process and the accreditation awarded, analyzing their views
of its usefulness, especially in relation to the employability of graduates.
Based on the findings, we offer critical insights into this accreditation
process when it takes place in contexts beyond highly industrialized countries.

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: This paper introduces ORBIT, a benchmark for evaluating recommendation models consistently and realistically, with new datasets and methodologies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing datasets and evaluation methods for recommender systems do not capture realistic user behaviors and often lead to inconsistent or ambiguous results.

Method: The authors developed ORBIT, a unified benchmarking framework offering standardized evaluation settings and reproducible splits. They introduce ClueWeb-Reco, a synthetic dataset based on real user web browsing data, reserved as a hidden test to evaluate model generalization.

Result: Evaluation of 12 recommendation models indicates general performance improvements on public datasets but reveals limitations on hidden tests like ClueWeb-Reco. The study also highlights potential benefits of integrating LLMs.

Conclusion: ORBIT provides a valuable resource for reproducible and realistic evaluation of recommendation models, enhancing research consistency and uncovering areas for improvement in large-scale recommendation challenges.

Abstract: Recommender systems are among the most impactful AI applications, interacting
with billions of users every day, guiding them to relevant products, services,
or information tailored to their preferences. However, the research and
development of recommender systems are hindered by existing datasets that fail
to capture realistic user behaviors and inconsistent evaluation settings that
lead to ambiguous conclusions. This paper introduces the Open Recommendation
Benchmark for Reproducible Research with HIdden Tests (ORBIT), a unified
benchmark for consistent and realistic evaluation of recommendation models.
ORBIT offers a standardized evaluation framework of public datasets with
reproducible splits and transparent settings for its public leaderboard.
Additionally, ORBIT introduces a new webpage recommendation task, ClueWeb-Reco,
featuring web browsing sequences from 87 million public, high-quality webpages.
ClueWeb-Reco is a synthetic dataset derived from real, user-consented, and
privacy-guaranteed browsing data. It aligns with modern recommendation
scenarios and is reserved as the hidden test part of our leaderboard to
challenge recommendation models' generalization ability. ORBIT measures 12
representative recommendation models on its public benchmark and introduces a
prompted LLM baseline on the ClueWeb-Reco hidden test. Our benchmark results
reflect general improvements of recommender systems on the public datasets,
with variable individual performances. The results on the hidden test reveal
the limitations of existing approaches in large-scale webpage recommendation
and highlight the potential for improvements with LLM integrations. ORBIT

TL;DR: The paper introduces a hybrid Graph Attention Network (GAT)-based Collaborative Filtering framework, enriched with Large Language Model-based embeddings, to address data sparsity and cold-start challenges in recommender systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to tackle the limitations of recommender systems in accurately suggesting items for new or less active users, especially under data sparsity and cold-start scenarios.

Method: The method involves integrating textual user profiles and item metadata as embeddings into a bipartite user-item graph using a GAT-based framework. It employs a hybrid loss function, combining Bayesian Personalized Ranking (BPR) with cosine similarity and robust negative sampling for better ranking performance.

Result: The approach shows consistent improvements over state-of-the-art baselines in Precision, NDCG, and MAP, and is robust for users with limited interaction history, as validated on the MovieLens 100k and 1M datasets.

Conclusion: The use of LLM-augmented embeddings and hybrid loss functions enhances recommender systems, successfully mitigating sparsity and cold-start issues. Future work will focus on balancing coverage, diversity, fairness, and interpretability features.

Abstract: Recommender systems often struggle with data sparsity and cold-start
scenarios, limiting their ability to provide accurate suggestions for new or
infrequent users. This paper presents a Graph Attention Network (GAT) based
Collaborative Filtering (CF) framework enhanced with Large Language Model (LLM)
driven context aware embeddings. Specifically, we generate concise textual user
profiles and unify item metadata (titles, genres, overviews) into rich textual
embeddings, injecting these as initial node features in a bipartite user item
graph. To further optimize ranking performance, we introduce a hybrid loss
function that combines Bayesian Personalized Ranking (BPR) with a cosine
similarity term and robust negative sampling, ensuring explicit negative
feedback is distinguished from unobserved data. Experiments on the MovieLens
100k and 1M datasets show consistent improvements over state-of-the-art
baselines in Precision, NDCG, and MAP while demonstrating robustness for users
with limited interaction history. Ablation studies confirm the critical role of
LLM-augmented embeddings and the cosine similarity term in capturing nuanced
semantic relationships. Our approach effectively mitigates sparsity and
cold-start limitations by integrating LLM-derived contextual understanding into
graph-based architectures. Future directions include balancing recommendation
accuracy with coverage and diversity, and introducing fairness-aware
constraints and interpretability features to enhance system performance
further.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve defect identification in AM processes through models sensitive to physical parameter variations.

Method: Adopts a mixture model learning approach, integrating physics-based principles and analyzing empirical data from AM processes and public datasets.

Result: The study demonstrated the capability of the physics-guided mixture models to identify and understand physical defects in AM systems effectively.

Conclusion: Physics-guided mixture models show promise in examining physical behavior and improving defect detection in laser AM processes.

Abstract: In this study, we leverage a mixture model learning approach to identify
defects in laser-based Additive Manufacturing (AM) processes. By incorporating
physics based principles, we also ensure that the model is sensitive to
meaningful physical parameter variations. The empirical evaluation was
conducted by analyzing real-world data from two AM processes: Directed Energy
Deposition and Laser Powder Bed Fusion. In addition, we also studied the
performance of the developed framework over public datasets with different

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: This paper introduces Social Insight Agents (SIA), a system using large language models (LLMs) to analyze and visualize heterogeneous social media data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address the challenges of exploring and analyzing complex heterogeneous social media data, which includes user behavior, textual content, temporal dynamics, and network structures.

Method: The authors propose SIA, an LLM-based agent system that integrates multi-modal data through coordinated workflows and a unified data coordinator. It uses a taxonomy to connect insight types with mining and visualization techniques, offering an interactive interface for human-agent collaboration.

Result: The case studies and evaluations show that SIA successfully uncovers diverse and meaningful insights from social media, while enhancing collaboration between users and agents.

Conclusion: SIA demonstrates its ability to analyze heterogeneous social media data effectively, providing trustworthy and adaptable tools for researchers and practitioners.

Abstract: Social media platforms generate massive volumes of heterogeneous data,
capturing user behaviors, textual content, temporal dynamics, and network
structures. Analyzing such data is crucial for understanding phenomena such as
opinion dynamics, community formation, and information diffusion. However,
discovering insights from this complex landscape is exploratory, conceptually
challenging, and requires expertise in social media mining and visualization.
Existing automated approaches, though increasingly leveraging large language
models (LLMs), remain largely confined to structured tabular data and cannot
adequately address the heterogeneity of social media analysis. We present SIA
(Social Insight Agents), an LLM agent system that links heterogeneous
multi-modal data -- including raw inputs (e.g., text, network, and behavioral
data), intermediate outputs, mined analytical results, and visualization
artifacts -- through coordinated agent flows. Guided by a bottom-up taxonomy
that connects insight types with suitable mining and visualization techniques,
SIA enables agents to plan and execute coherent analysis strategies. To ensure
multi-modal integration, it incorporates a data coordinator that unifies
tabular, textual, and network data into a consistent flow. Its interactive
interface provides a transparent workflow where users can trace, validate, and
refine the agent's reasoning, supporting both adaptability and trustworthiness.
Through expert-centered case studies and quantitative evaluation, we show that
SIA effectively discovers diverse and meaningful insights from social media
while supporting human-agent collaboration in complex analytical tasks.

### [398] [Risks and Opportunities in Human-Machine Teaming in Operationalizing Machine Learning Target Variables](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25974)
*Mengtian Guo,David Gotz,Yue Wang*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: This paper explores human-machine teaming strategies to support the process of selecting proxy target variables for predictive modeling, comparing relevance-first and performance-first approaches through a controlled user study.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Predictive models often fail due to poorly chosen proxy target variables used to operationalize abstract constructs. The paper seeks to address this challenge by exploring how human-machine interactions can improve proxy selection.

Method: The researchers conducted a controlled user study involving two human-machine teaming strategies: relevance-first (human-led proxy selection based on relevance) and performance-first (machine-recommended proxies based on predictive performance).

Result: The performance-first strategy enabled quicker iterations and decision-making but biased users towards proxies with high predictive performance that may not align with application goals.

Conclusion: Human-machine teaming can accelerate proxy selection processes but also introduces risks of misalignment. Future research should focus on balancing efficiency and alignment with application objectives.

Abstract: Predictive modeling has the potential to enhance human decision-making.
However, many predictive models fail in practice due to problematic problem
formulation in cases where the prediction target is an abstract concept or
construct and practitioners need to define an appropriate target variable as a
proxy to operationalize the construct of interest. The choice of an appropriate
proxy target variable is rarely self-evident in practice, requiring both domain
knowledge and iterative data modeling. This process is inherently
collaborative, involving both domain experts and data scientists. In this work,
we explore how human-machine teaming can support this process by accelerating
iterations while preserving human judgment. We study the impact of two
human-machine teaming strategies on proxy construction: 1) relevance-first:
humans leading the process by selecting relevant proxies, and 2)
performance-first: machines leading the process by recommending proxies based
on predictive performance. Based on a controlled user study of a proxy
construction task (N = 20), we show that the performance-first strategy
facilitated faster iterations and decision-making, but also biased users
towards well-performing proxies that are misaligned with the application goal.
Our study highlights the opportunities and risks of human-machine teaming in
operationalizing machine learning target variables, yielding insights for
future research to explore the opportunities and mitigate the risks.

TL;DR: The paper investigates how large language model (LLM) agents behave in realistic market conditions, using a simulated environment to study dynamics such as utility, biases, manipulation, and the impact of search mechanisms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is increasing involvement of LLM agents in economic decisions, leading to questions about their accountability and value to users in complex, real-world market conditions.

Method: The authors developed Magentic-Marketplace, a simulated environment where Assistant agents represent consumers and Service agents represent businesses, enabling studies of complex market interactions.

Result: Experiments demonstrate that frontier models can achieve near-optimal welfare under ideal conditions but face significant degradation with scalability and exhibit strong biases like favoring the first proposal.

Conclusion: The paper highlights behavioral patterns in realistic market conditions and underscores the need to design fair and efficient agentic marketplaces.

Abstract: As LLM agents advance, they are increasingly mediating economic decisions,
ranging from product discovery to transactions, on behalf of users. Such
applications promise benefits but also raise many questions about agent
accountability and value for users. Addressing these questions requires
understanding how agents behave in realistic market conditions. However,
previous research has largely evaluated agents in constrained settings, such as
single-task marketplaces (e.g., negotiation) or structured two-agent
interactions. Real-world markets are fundamentally different: they require
agents to handle diverse economic activities and coordinate within large,
dynamic ecosystems where multiple agents with opaque behaviors may engage in
open-ended dialogues. To bridge this gap, we investigate two-sided agentic
marketplaces where Assistant agents represent consumers and Service agents
represent competing businesses. To study these interactions safely, we develop
Magentic-Marketplace -- a simulated environment where Assistants and Services
can operate. This environment enables us to study key market dynamics: the
utility agents achieve, behavioral biases, vulnerability to manipulation, and
how search mechanisms shape market outcomes. Our experiments show that frontier
models can approach optimal welfare -- but only under ideal search conditions.
Performance degrades sharply with scale, and all models exhibit severe
first-proposal bias, creating 10-30x advantages for response speed over
quality. These findings reveal how behaviors emerge across market conditions,
informing the design of fair and efficient agentic marketplaces.

TL;DR: The paper explores algorithmic collusion in market making using a hierarchical reinforcement learning framework with various agent types, analyzing their interactions and impact on market outcomes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding emergent behaviors, such as collusion or dominance by advanced AI bots, and their impact on markets is crucial for designing fair and efficient trading systems.

Method: The study uses a hierarchical multi-agent reinforcement learning framework comprising a self-interested market maker and three distinct competitor agents with varying objectives. Interaction-level metrics are introduced to assess agent dynamics.

Result: Agent B2 thrives in zero-sum settings by tightening average spreads, enhancing execution efficiency. Hybrid Agent B* adapts strategies, garnering dominant market share while mitigating adverse effects compared to Agent B2.

Conclusion: Adaptive incentive control fosters strategic coexistence in heterogeneous agent environments, providing insights into behavioral design for algorithmic trading systems.

Abstract: Algorithmic collusion has emerged as a central question in AI: Will the
interaction between different AI agents deployed in markets lead to collusion?
More generally, understanding how emergent behavior, be it a cartel or market
dominance from more advanced bots, affects the market overall is an important
research question.
  We propose a hierarchical multi-agent reinforcement learning framework to
study algorithmic collusion in market making. The framework includes a
self-interested market maker (Agent~A), which is trained in an uncertain
environment shaped by an adversary, and three bottom-layer competitors: the
self-interested Agent~B1 (whose objective is to maximize its own PnL), the
competitive Agent~B2 (whose objective is to minimize the PnL of its opponent),
and the hybrid Agent~B$^\star$, which can modulate between the behavior of the
other two. To analyze how these agents shape the behavior of each other and
affect market outcomes, we propose interaction-level metrics that quantify
behavioral asymmetry and system-level dynamics, while providing signals
potentially indicative of emergent interaction patterns.
  Experimental results show that Agent~B2 secures dominant performance in a
zero-sum setting against B1, aggressively capturing order flow while tightening
average spreads, thus improving market execution efficiency. In contrast,
Agent~B$^\star$ exhibits a self-interested inclination when co-existing with
other profit-seeking agents, securing dominant market share through adaptive
quoting, yet exerting a milder adverse impact on the rewards of Agents~A and B1
compared to B2. These findings suggest that adaptive incentive control supports
more sustainable strategic co-existence in heterogeneous agent environments and
offers a structured lens for evaluating behavioral design in algorithmic
trading systems.

TL;DR: SupervisorAgent is introduced as a runtime-supervision framework designed to improve efficiency and robustness in Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) by intervening during critical tasks without altering base agent architecture.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current MAS methodologies suffer from inefficiencies and misinformation impacts, with limited real-time intervention capabilities. Motivation centers around addressing these challenges proactively.

Method: SupervisorAgent uses an LLM-free adaptive filter to identify essential intervention points during operations, correcting errors and enhancing efficiency while keeping the base agent's architecture intact.

Result: On the GAIA benchmark, SupervisorAgent decreases token usage by 29.45%, maintaining task success rates. It is validated across five additional benchmarks for its adaptability and robustness.

Conclusion: SupervisorAgent demonstrates effectiveness in reducing inefficiencies within MAS, offering a lightweight and modular solution validated across multiple benchmarks and use cases.

Abstract: While Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) excel at complex tasks, their growing
autonomy with operational complexity often leads to critical inefficiencies,
such as excessive token consumption and failures arising from misinformation.
Existing methods primarily focus on post-hoc failure attribution, lacking
proactive, real-time interventions to enhance robustness and efficiency. To
this end, we introduce SupervisorAgent, a lightweight and modular framework for
runtime, adaptive supervision that operates without altering the base agent's
architecture. Triggered by an LLM-free adaptive filter, SupervisorAgent
intervenes at critical junctures to proactively correct errors, guide
inefficient behaviors, and purify observations. On the challenging GAIA
benchmark, SupervisorAgent reduces the token consumption of the Smolagent
framework by an average of 29.45% without compromising its success rate.
Extensive experiments across five additional benchmarks (math reasoning, code
generation, and question answering) and various SoTA foundation models validate
the broad applicability and robustness of our approach. The code is available

TL;DR: Introduces GIFF, a fairness-oriented resource allocation framework that modifies Q-values to balance efficiency and fairness, showcasing significant performance improvements across various domains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the issue of inequitable outcomes in multi-agent resource allocation while optimizing for efficiency.

Method: GIFF adjusts the Q-function with a fairness gain and counterfactual advantage correction term, formalized within centralized control for allocation problems.

Result: Empirical evaluations in tasks like ridesharing and homelessness prevention indicate superior fairness and efficiency of GIFF compared to baselines.

Conclusion: GIFF is a principled and effective framework for fair resource allocation, leveraging reinforcement learning techniques to discover equitable policies.

Abstract: We introduce the General Incentives-based Framework for Fairness (GIFF), a
novel approach for fair multi-agent resource allocation that infers fair
decision-making from standard value functions. In resource-constrained
settings, agents optimizing for efficiency often create inequitable outcomes.
Our approach leverages the action-value (Q-)function to balance efficiency and
fairness without requiring additional training. Specifically, our method
computes a local fairness gain for each action and introduces a counterfactual
advantage correction term to discourage over-allocation to already well-off
agents. This approach is formalized within a centralized control setting, where
an arbitrator uses the GIFF-modified Q-values to solve an allocation problem.
  Empirical evaluations across diverse domains, including dynamic ridesharing,
homelessness prevention, and a complex job allocation task-demonstrate that our
framework consistently outperforms strong baselines and can discover
far-sighted, equitable policies. The framework's effectiveness is supported by
a theoretical foundation; we prove its fairness surrogate is a principled lower
bound on the true fairness improvement and that its trade-off parameter offers
monotonic tuning. Our findings establish GIFF as a robust and principled
framework for leveraging standard reinforcement learning components to achieve
more equitable outcomes in complex multi-agent systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide an alternative method for proving satisfiability of CHCs over ADTs by building regular Herbrand models using tree automata.

Method: Building the tree automaton utilizing an encoding of CHCs with ADTs into a SAT problem using Clingo, an Answer Set Programming tool.

Result: Implemented a translation that allows semi-complete satisfiability checking, enabling identification of regular models or counter-examples.

Conclusion: The approach effectively supplies a method for generating tree automata and handling satisfiability problems of CHCs over ADTs using ASP techniques.

Abstract: We are interested in proving satisfiability of Constrained Horn Clauses
(CHCs) over Algebraic Data Types (ADTs). We propose to prove satisfiability by
building a tree automaton recognizing the Herbrand model of the CHCs. If such
an automaton exists then the model is said to be regular, i.e., the Herbrand
model is a regular set of atoms. Kostyukov et al. have shown how to derive an
automaton when CVC4 finds a finite model of the CHCs. We propose an alternative
way to build the automaton using an encoding into a SAT problem using Clingo,
an Answer Set Programming (ASP) tool. We implemented a translation of CHCs with
ADTs into an ASP problem. Combined with Clingo, we obtain a semi-complete
satisfiability checker: it finds a tree automaton if a regular Herbrand model
exists or finds a counter-example if the problem is unsatisfiable.

Motivation: To establish a formal framework for expressing and analyzing semantic properties of sets, relations, and computations in programming languages and systems.

Method: The paper utilizes Elementary Inference Systems, associated with a first-order theory, and introduces semantic property proofs through satisfiability in canonical and arbitrary models.

Result: It enables the validation or disproval of semantic properties in programming languages and rewriting systems using satisfiability analysis of models of Elementary Inference Systems.

Conclusion: Elementary Inference Systems provide a robust means of analyzing semantic properties in first-order systems, facilitating the study of programming language properties and computational systems.

Abstract: We consider sets/relations/computations defined by *Elementary Inference
Systems* I, which are obtained from Smullyan's *elementary formal systems*
using Gentzen's notation for inference rules, and proof trees for atoms
P(t_1,...,t_n), where predicate P represents the considered
set/relation/computation. A first-order theory Th(I), actually a set of
definite Horn clauses, is given to I. Properties of objects defined by I are
expressed as first-order sentences F, which are proved true or false by
*satisfaction* M |= F of F in a *canonical* model M of Th(I). For this reason,
we call F a *semantic property* of I. Since canonical models are, in general,
incomputable, we show how to (dis)prove semantic properties by satisfiability
in an *arbitrary* model A of Th(I). We apply these ideas to the analysis of
properties of programming languages and systems whose computations can be
described by means of an elementary inference system. In particular,
rewriting-based systems.

Motivation: To analyze and document the inner workings, strengths, and limitations of Theta, a CHC verification tool, and to provide an accurate performance assessment corrected for prior configuration issues.

Method: The paper investigates Theta's algorithms for verifying constrained Horn clauses (CHCs), identifies its unique features, and addresses a performance issue from the CHC-COMP 2025 by rerunning benchmarks with corrected settings.

Result: Theta's actual capabilities, corrected for a configuration error, are reevaluated on the CHC-COMP benchmarks, revealing its true performance.

Conclusion: This study details Theta's verification framework and its distinguishing features while providing an updated performance analysis to showcase its potential and limitations in CHC verification.

Abstract: Theta is a verification framework that has participated in the CHC-COMP
competition since 2023. While its core approach -- based on transforming
constrained Horn clauses (CHCs) into control-flow automata (CFAs) for analysis
-- has remained mostly unchanged, Theta's verification techniques, design
trade-offs, and limitations have remained mostly unexplored in the context of
CHCs. This paper fills that gap: we provide a detailed description of the
algorithms employed by Theta, highlighting the unique features that distinguish
it from other CHC solvers. We also analyze the strengths and weaknesses of the
tool in the context of CHC-COMP benchmarks. Notably, in the 2025 edition of the
competition, Theta's performance was impacted by a configuration issue, leading
to suboptimal results. To provide a clearer picture of Theta's actual
capabilities, we re-execute the tool on the competition benchmarks under
corrected settings and report on the resulting performance.
