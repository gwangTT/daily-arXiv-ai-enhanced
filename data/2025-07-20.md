### [1] [AI-Powered Math Tutoring: Platform for Personalized and Adaptive Education](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12484)
*Jarosław A. Chudziak,Adam Kostka*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper presents a novel AI-driven tutoring system for mathematics that goes beyond reactive assistance by offering adaptive feedback, course generation, and textbook retrieval for personalized learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AI tutoring systems are mostly reactive and underdeveloped, particularly for teaching mathematics, leading to limited deep reflection and structured learning.

Method: The research proposes a multi-agent AI tutoring platform combining adaptive feedback, course generation, and textbook knowledge retrieval to enable individualized, modular learning.

Result: The platform facilitates structured learning experiences where students can learn new topics, identify and work on weaknesses, and practice personalized exercises.

Conclusion: The work enhances AI-based educational methods by introducing a modular tutoring system that leverages pedagogical agents for teaching mathematics more effectively.

Abstract: The growing ubiquity of artificial intelligence (AI), in particular large
language models (LLMs), has profoundly altered the way in which learners gain
knowledge and interact with learning material, with many claiming that AI
positively influences their learning achievements. Despite this advancement,
current AI tutoring systems face limitations associated with their reactive
nature, often providing direct answers without encouraging deep reflection or
incorporating structured pedagogical tools and strategies. This limitation is
most apparent in the field of mathematics, in which AI tutoring systems remain
underdeveloped. This research addresses the question: How can AI tutoring
systems move beyond providing reactive assistance to enable structured,
individualized, and tool-assisted learning experiences? We introduce a novel
multi-agent AI tutoring platform that combines adaptive and personalized
feedback, structured course generation, and textbook knowledge retrieval to
enable modular, tool-assisted learning processes. This system allows students
to learn new topics while identifying and targeting their weaknesses, revise
for exams effectively, and practice on an unlimited number of personalized
exercises. This article contributes to the field of artificial intelligence in
education by introducing a novel platform that brings together pedagogical
agents and AI-driven components, augmenting the field with modular and
effective systems for teaching mathematics.

### [2] [MR-LDM -- The Merge-Reactive Longitudinal Decision Model: Game Theoretic Human Decision Modeling for Interactive Sim Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12494)
*Dustin Holley,Jovin D'sa,Hossein Nourkhiz Mahjoub,Gibran Ali*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper enhances highway merge scenario simulations using a unified game-theoretic decision and dynamics model.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improve simulation environments to replicate realistic human-like driving behavior in highway merging scenarios.

Method: Developed a game-theoretic model integrating improved payoff functions and lag actions, validated with real-world datasets, and deployed in high fidelity simulation.

Result: The model achieved realistic reproduction of merging interactions and was computationally efficient for large-scale simulations.

Conclusion: The unified model supports realistic and efficient simulations for autonomous vehicle development.

Abstract: Enhancing simulation environments to replicate real-world driver behavior,
i.e., more humanlike sim agents, is essential for developing autonomous vehicle
technology. In the context of highway merging, previous works have studied the
operational-level yielding dynamics of lag vehicles in response to a merging
car at highway on-ramps. Other works focusing on tactical decision modeling
generally consider limited action sets or utilize payoff functions with large
parameter sets and limited payoff bounds. In this work, we aim to improve the
simulation of the highway merge scenario by targeting a game theoretic model
for tactical decision-making with improved payoff functions and lag actions. We
couple this with an underlying dynamics model to have a unified decision and
dynamics model that can capture merging interactions and simulate more
realistic interactions in an explainable and interpretable fashion. The
proposed model demonstrated good reproducibility of complex interactions when
validated on a real-world dataset. The model was finally integrated into a high
fidelity simulation environment and confirmed to have adequate computation time
efficiency for use in large-scale simulations to support autonomous vehicle
development.

### [3] [A Survey of Explainable Reinforcement Learning: Targets, Methods and Needs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12599)
*Léo Saulières*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper reviews explainable reinforcement learning (XRL), proposes a taxonomy based on "What" and "How" questions, and analyzes over 250 papers to identify needs in the field.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the opacity of AI models, particularly deep learning-based ones, by enhancing understanding of their internal mechanisms and providing actionable insights through explainable reinforcement learning.

Method: Developed a taxonomy for explanations in XRL using "What" (target of explanation) and "How" (method of explanation), conducted a state-of-the-art review of over 250 papers, and identified relevant fields and gaps in XRL research.

Result: A new taxonomy for XRL explanations was proposed, and a state-of-the-art review identified adjacent domains and research gaps that require attention.

Conclusion: The paper advances the field of XRL by presenting a systematic taxonomy, a comprehensive review of existing literature, and highlighting key research needs and areas for future exploration.

Abstract: The success of recent Artificial Intelligence (AI) models has been
accompanied by the opacity of their internal mechanisms, due notably to the use
of deep neural networks. In order to understand these internal mechanisms and
explain the output of these AI models, a set of methods have been proposed,
grouped under the domain of eXplainable AI (XAI). This paper focuses on a
sub-domain of XAI, called eXplainable Reinforcement Learning (XRL), which aims
to explain the actions of an agent that has learned by reinforcement learning.
We propose an intuitive taxonomy based on two questions "What" and "How". The
first question focuses on the target that the method explains, while the second
relates to the way the explanation is provided. We use this taxonomy to provide
a state-of-the-art review of over 250 papers. In addition, we present a set of
domains close to XRL, which we believe should get attention from the community.
Finally, we identify some needs for the field of XRL.

### [4] [Fly, Fail, Fix: Iterative Game Repair with Reinforcement Learning and Large Multimodal Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12666)
*Alex Zook,Josef Spjut,Jonathan Tremblay*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces a framework combining reinforcement learning (RL) and large multimodal models (LMMs) to iteratively refine game design by analyzing player behaviors and adjusting game mechanics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional game design tools struggle to bridge the gap between static game structures and dynamic player behavior, limiting effective feedback and iteration.

Method: The framework pairs an RL agent, which plays the game and generates behavioral data, with an LMM that analyzes this data and revises game configurations to achieve gameplay objectives.

Result: Results show that LMMs can interpret behavioral traces from RL agents to make targeted improvements to game mechanics, highlighting their utility in automated design processes.

Conclusion: The proposed framework presents a scalable method for integrating AI in game design, facilitating iterative improvements by linking gameplay analysis and design refinement.

Abstract: Game design hinges on understanding how static rules and content translate
into dynamic player behavior - something modern generative systems that inspect
only a game's code or assets struggle to capture. We present an automated
design iteration framework that closes this gap by pairing a reinforcement
learning (RL) agent, which playtests the game, with a large multimodal model
(LMM), which revises the game based on what the agent does. In each loop the RL
player completes several episodes, producing (i) numerical play metrics and/or
(ii) a compact image strip summarising recent video frames. The LMM designer
receives a gameplay goal and the current game configuration, analyses the play
traces, and edits the configuration to steer future behaviour toward the goal.
We demonstrate results that LMMs can reason over behavioral traces supplied by
RL agents to iteratively refine game mechanics, pointing toward practical,
scalable tools for AI-assisted game design.

### [5] [Benchmarking Deception Probes via Black-to-White Performance Boosts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12691)
*Avi Parrack,Carlo Leonardo Attubato,Stefan Heimersheim*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper evaluates the effectiveness of deception probes on AI models, showing weak but promising advancements in detecting deceptive versus honest activations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the ability of deception probes to detect deceptive behavior in AI models and evaluate their resistance to evasion strategies.

Method: Compared white-box monitoring (with access to probe activations) and black-box monitoring (without access), measuring their effectiveness through black-to-white performance boosts.

Result: Observed a weak yet encouraging improvement in detection from white-box insights compared to black-box setups.

Conclusion: Deception probes show some promise, but they currently exhibit limited efficacy, highlighting the need for further improvement.

Abstract: AI assistants will occasionally respond deceptively to user queries.
Recently, linear classifiers (called "deception probes") have been trained to
distinguish the internal activations of a language model during deceptive
versus honest responses. However, it's unclear how effective these probes are
at detecting deception in practice, nor whether such probes are resistant to
simple counter strategies from a deceptive assistant who wishes to evade
detection. In this paper, we compare white-box monitoring (where the monitor
has access to token-level probe activations) to black-box monitoring (without
such access). We benchmark deception probes by the extent to which the white
box monitor outperforms the black-box monitor, i.e. the black-to-white
performance boost. We find weak but encouraging black-to-white performance
boosts from existing deception probes.

### [6] [Imitating Mistakes in a Learning Companion AI Agent for Online Peer Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12801)
*Sosui Moribe,Taketoshi Ushiama*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This study focuses on creating an AI learning companion for peer learning, especially in English composition, targeting learners with similar proficiency levels.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the limitations of human peer learning by developing an AI that can act as an effective peer even when human companions are unavailable.

Method: The study assumes that learners at the same proficiency level make similar mistakes and uses this assumption to design and validate the AI learning companion's effectiveness in English composition.

Result: The proposed AI learning agent effectively facilitates peer learning by emulating the traits of a peer with similar proficiency.

Conclusion: An AI learning agent can overcome the challenges of human peer learning by providing a consistent and accessible peer learning experience, particularly in English composition.

Abstract: In recent years, peer learning has gained attention as a method that promotes
spontaneous thinking among learners, and its effectiveness has been confirmed
by numerous studies. This study aims to develop an AI Agent as a learning
companion that enables peer learning anytime and anywhere. However, peer
learning between humans has various limitations, and it is not always
effective. Effective peer learning requires companions at the same proficiency
levels. In this study, we assume that a learner's peers with the same
proficiency level as the learner make the same mistakes as the learner does and
focus on English composition as a specific example to validate this approach.

Method: The authors propose MCPEval, a Model Context Protocol-based framework that automates task generation and evaluation, providing standardized metrics and integration with native agent tools.

Result: Tests of MCPEval across five real-world domains demonstrated its effectiveness in uncovering detailed, domain-specific performance of LLM agents.

Conclusion: MCPEval enhances the scalability and standardization of LLM agent evaluations, and the framework is publicly accessible to foster reproducible research and standardized assessment practices.

Abstract: The rapid rise of Large Language Models (LLMs)-based intelligent agents
underscores the need for robust, scalable evaluation frameworks. Existing
methods rely on static benchmarks and labor-intensive data collection, limiting
practical assessment. We introduce \oursystemname, an open-source Model Context
Protocol (MCP)-based framework that automates end-to-end task generation and
deep evaluation of LLM agents across diverse domains. MCPEval standardizes
metrics, seamlessly integrates with native agent tools, and eliminates manual
effort in building evaluation pipelines. Empirical results across five
real-world domains show its effectiveness in revealing nuanced, domain-specific
performance. We publicly release MCPEval
https://github.com/SalesforceAIResearch/MCPEval to promote reproducible and
standardized LLM agent evaluation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To determine the mathematical structure of optimal, independent, and zero unanimous fuzzy classification aggregation functions.

Method: The authors use mathematical proof techniques to establish results for various cases: $m \ge 3$ objects and $2 \le p \le m$ types, and separately when $m=p=2$.

Result: The authors show that for $m \ge 3$ and $2 \le p \le m$, the aggregation function must be a weighted arithmetic mean. They also characterize the function for the special case $m=p=2$.

Abstract: We prove that any optimal, independent, and zero unanimous fuzzy
classification aggregation function of a continuum of individual
classifications of $m\ge 3$ objects into $2\le p\le m$ types must be a weighted
arithmetic mean. We also provide a characterization for the case when $m=p=2$.

### [10] [Assessing adaptive world models in machines with novel games](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12821)

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper suggests evaluating AI's ability to create and adapt world models, inspired by human adaptability, using novel game benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of effective evaluation frameworks for assessing how well AI systems can adapt through interaction and exploration, as current approaches emphasize static learning.

Method: Proposes a benchmarking approach based on games with deep novelty to challenge AI's ability to rapidly generate and refine world models.

Result: Details a framework with key construction principles and metrics for evaluating adaptive world models in AI.

Conclusion: Encourages adoption of this framework to drive improvements in AI systems' abilities for human-like rapid adaptation and robust generalization.

Abstract: Human intelligence exhibits a remarkable capacity for rapid adaptation and
effective problem-solving in novel and unfamiliar contexts. We argue that this
profound adaptability is fundamentally linked to the efficient construction and
refinement of internal representations of the environment, commonly referred to
as world models, and we refer to this adaptation mechanism as world model
induction. However, current understanding and evaluation of world models in
artificial intelligence (AI) remains narrow, often focusing on static
representations learned from training on a massive corpora of data, instead of
the efficiency and efficacy of models in learning these representations through
interaction and exploration within a novel environment. In this Perspective, we
provide a view of world model induction drawing on decades of research in
cognitive science on how humans learn and adapt so efficiently; we then call
for a new evaluation framework for assessing adaptive world models in AI.
Concretely, we propose a new benchmarking paradigm based on suites of carefully
designed games with genuine, deep and continually refreshing novelty in the
underlying game structures -- we refer to this kind of games as novel games. We
detail key desiderata for constructing these games and propose appropriate
metrics to explicitly challenge and evaluate the agent's ability for rapid
world model induction. We hope that this new evaluation framework will inspire
future evaluation efforts on world models in AI and provide a crucial step
towards developing AI systems capable of the human-like rapid adaptation and
robust generalization -- a critical component of artificial general
intelligence.

### [11] [Information-Theoretic Aggregation of Ethical Attributes in Simulated-Command](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12862)
*Hussein Abbass,Taylan Akay,Harrison Tolley*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper addresses the challenge of integrating human ethical judgment into simulations by proposing a method where humans design the ethical metric space, leaving the simulation to explore scenarios and suggest optimal decisions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Exploring a vast number of scenarios with ethical implications is hindered by the impracticality and inefficiency of involving human judgment during every decision cycle in simulations.

Method: The paper proposes a framework where human commanders design an ethical metric space beforehand, allowing simulations to dynamically weight ethical attributes based on literature from multi-criteria decision making, particularly using concepts like entropy.

Result: The proposed approach enables simulations to run autonomously while incorporating ethical considerations dynamically, and subsequently provides a narrowed set of actionable options to human commanders.

Conclusion: The approach facilitates scaling up simulation-based explorations with ethical implications by offloading ethical weighting decisions to the simulation while preserving human oversight for final decision-making.

Abstract: In the age of AI, human commanders need to use the computational powers
available in today's environment to simulate a very large number of scenarios.
Within each scenario, situations occur where different decision design options
could have ethical consequences. Making these decisions reliant on human
judgement is both counter-productive to the aim of exploring very large number
of scenarios in a timely manner and infeasible when considering the workload
needed to involve humans in each of these choices. In this paper, we move human
judgement outside the simulation decision cycle. Basically, the human will
design the ethical metric space, leaving it to the simulated environment to
explore the space. When the simulation completes its testing cycles, the
testing environment will come back to the human commander with a few options to
select from. The human commander will then exercise human-judgement to select
the most appropriate course of action, which will then get executed
accordingly. We assume that the problem of designing metrics that are
sufficiently granular to assess the ethical implications of decisions is
solved. Subsequently, the fundamental problem we look at in this paper is how
to weight ethical decisions during the running of these simulations; that is,
how to dynamically weight the ethical attributes when agents are faced with
decision options with ethical implications during generative simulations. The
multi-criteria decision making literature has started to look at nearby
problems, where the concept of entropy has been used to determine the weights
during aggregation. We draw from that literature different approaches to
automatically calculate the weights for ethical attributes during
simulation-based testing and evaluation.

### [12] [Manipulation Attacks by Misaligned AI: Risk Analysis and Safety Case Framework](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12872)
*Rishane Dassanayake,Mario Demetroudi,James Walpole,Lindley Lentati,Jason R. Brown,Edward James Young*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper addresses the threat of manipulation attacks by AI systems and provides a systematic framework to assess and mitigate these risks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To tackle the growing but underexplored threat of AI systems manipulating and deceiving humans, potentially undermining cybersecurity and leading to catastrophic outcomes.

Method: The authors propose a safety case framework focused on inability, control, and trustworthiness, specifying evidence needs, evaluation approaches, and implementation guidelines.

Result: The work introduces a systematic methodology that enables AI companies to incorporate manipulation risks into safety governance practices.

Conclusion: The paper provides a concrete foundation for AI companies to proactively address manipulation threats, improving AI safety governance before deployment.

Abstract: Frontier AI systems are rapidly advancing in their capabilities to persuade,
deceive, and influence human behaviour, with current models already
demonstrating human-level persuasion and strategic deception in specific
contexts. Humans are often the weakest link in cybersecurity systems, and a
misaligned AI system deployed internally within a frontier company may seek to
undermine human oversight by manipulating employees. Despite this growing
threat, manipulation attacks have received little attention, and no systematic
framework exists for assessing and mitigating these risks. To address this, we
provide a detailed explanation of why manipulation attacks are a significant
threat and could lead to catastrophic outcomes. Additionally, we present a
safety case framework for manipulation risk, structured around three core lines
of argument: inability, control, and trustworthiness. For each argument, we
specify evidence requirements, evaluation methodologies, and implementation
considerations for direct application by AI companies. This paper provides the
first systematic methodology for integrating manipulation risk into AI safety
governance, offering AI companies a concrete foundation to assess and mitigate
these threats before deployment.

### [13] [VAR-MATH: Probing True Mathematical Reasoning in Large Language Models via Symbolic Multi-Instance Benchmarks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12885)
*Jian Yao,Ran Cheng,Kay Chen Tan*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper identifies flaws in existing evaluation protocols for reinforcement learning in mathematical reasoning and introduces the VAR-MATH framework for robust, contamination-resistant evaluations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Advances in reinforcement learning have improved the mathematical reasoning of LLMs, but questionable improvements from flawed signals necessitate a deeper evaluation method.

Method: The VAR-MATH framework converts fixed numerical problems into symbolic templates and evaluates reasoning consistency across multiple variations.

Result: RL-trained models showed significant performance drops (e.g., 48% on AMC23 and 58.3% on AIME24) under the new evaluation framework.

Conclusion: Many RL-based improvements exploit superficial heuristics and fail to generalize, highlighting VAR-MATH's utility for robustly assessing reasoning abilities.

Abstract: Recent advances in reinforcement learning (RL) have led to substantial
improvements in the mathematical reasoning abilities of large language models
(LLMs), as measured by standard benchmarks. However, these gains often persist
even when models are trained with flawed signals, such as random or inverted
rewards, raising a fundamental question: do such improvements reflect true
reasoning, or are they merely artifacts of overfitting to benchmark-specific
patterns? To address this question, we take an evaluation-centric perspective
and identify two critical shortcomings in existing protocols. First,
\emph{benchmark contamination} arises from the public availability of test
problems, increasing the risk of data leakage. Second, \emph{evaluation
fragility} stems from the reliance on single-instance assessments, which are
highly sensitive to stochastic outputs and fail to capture reasoning
consistency. To overcome these limitations, we introduce {VAR-MATH}, a symbolic
evaluation framework designed to probe genuine reasoning ability. By converting
fixed numerical problems into symbolic templates and requiring models to solve
multiple instantiations of each, VAR-MATH enforces consistent reasoning across
structurally equivalent variants, thereby mitigating contamination and
improving evaluation robustness. We apply VAR-MATH to transform two popular
benchmarks, AMC23 and AIME24, into their symbolic counterparts, VAR-AMC23 and
VAR-AIME24. Experimental results reveal substantial performance drops for
RL-trained models on the variabilized versions, especially for smaller models,
with average declines of 48.0\% on AMC23 and 58.3\% on AIME24. These findings
suggest that many existing RL methods rely on superficial heuristics and fail
to generalize beyond specific numerical forms. Overall, VAR-MATH offers a
principled, contamination-resistant evaluation paradigm for mathematical
reasoning.

### [14] [A Translation of Probabilistic Event Calculus into Markov Decision Processes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12989)
*Lyris Xu,Fabio Aurelio D'Asaro,Luke Dickens*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper integrates Probabilistic Event Calculus (PEC) with Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) to enable goal-directed reasoning, while maintaining PEC's interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of goal-directed reasoning mechanisms in the Probabilistic Event Calculus framework.

Method: Develop a formal translation of PEC domains into MDPs by introducing the concept of 'action-taking situations' and leveraging MDP algorithms and tools.

Result: The integration supports both temporal reasoning and goal-directed planning, with learned policies mapped back into PEC representations to ensure interpretability.

Conclusion: This work extends the capabilities of PEC for practical applications in uncertain environments while retaining its expressiveness and interpretability.

Abstract: Probabilistic Event Calculus (PEC) is a logical framework for reasoning about
actions and their effects in uncertain environments, which enables the
representation of probabilistic narratives and computation of temporal
projections. The PEC formalism offers significant advantages in
interpretability and expressiveness for narrative reasoning. However, it lacks
mechanisms for goal-directed reasoning. This paper bridges this gap by
developing a formal translation of PEC domains into Markov Decision Processes
(MDPs), introducing the concept of "action-taking situations" to preserve PEC's
flexible action semantics. The resulting PEC-MDP formalism enables the
extensive collection of algorithms and theoretical tools developed for MDPs to
be applied to PEC's interpretable narrative domains. We demonstrate how the
translation supports both temporal reasoning tasks and objective-driven
planning, with methods for mapping learned policies back into human-readable
PEC representations, maintaining interpretability while extending PEC's
capabilities.

### [15] [Exploiting Constraint Reasoning to Build Graphical Explanations for Mixed-Integer Linear Programming](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13007)
*Roger Xavier Lera-Leri,Filippo Bistaffa,Athina Georgara,Juan Antonio Rodriguez-Aguilar*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces X-MILP, a methodology for generating contrastive explanations for mixed integer linear programming (MILP) problems using constraint reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper seeks to address the growing need for trustworthy AI systems by improving understanding and transparency in MILP decision-making processes through the development of contrastive explanations.

Method: The approach encodes user queries as constraints, computes the Irreducible Infeasible Subsystem (IIS) of these constraints, and constructs an explanation represented as a "graph of reasons" to make the structure of the answer interpretable.

Result: X-MILP was empirically tested on established optimization problem instances, demonstrating its feasibility and ability to produce meaningful explanations.

Conclusion: X-MILP provides an effective framework for generating contrastive explanations for MILP problems, improving user understanding and interpretability in optimization decision-making.

Abstract: Following the recent push for trustworthy AI, there has been an increasing
interest in developing contrastive explanation techniques for optimisation,
especially concerning the solution of specific decision-making processes
formalised as MILPs. Along these lines, we propose X-MILP, a domain-agnostic
approach for building contrastive explanations for MILPs based on constraint
reasoning techniques. First, we show how to encode the queries a user makes
about the solution of an MILP problem as additional constraints. Then, we
determine the reasons that constitute the answer to the user's query by
computing the Irreducible Infeasible Subsystem (IIS) of the newly obtained set
of constraints. Finally, we represent our explanation as a "graph of reasons"
constructed from the IIS, which helps the user understand the structure among
the reasons that answer their query. We test our method on instances of
well-known optimisation problems to evaluate the empirical hardness of
computing explanations.

Abstract: The study "Prediction of Highway Traffic Flow Based on Artificial
Intelligence Algorithms Using California Traffic Data" presents a machine
learning-based traffic flow prediction model to address global traffic
congestion issues. The research utilized 30-second interval traffic data from
California Highway 78 over a five-month period from July to November 2022,
analyzing a 7.24 km westbound section connecting "Melrose Dr" and "El-Camino
Real" in the San Diego area. The study employed Multiple Linear Regression
(MLR) and Random Forest (RF) algorithms, analyzing data collection intervals
ranging from 30 seconds to 15 minutes. Using R^2, MAE, and RMSE as performance
metrics, the analysis revealed that both MLR and RF models performed optimally
with 10-minute data collection intervals. These findings are expected to
contribute to future traffic congestion solutions and efficient traffic
management.

### [17] [From Roots to Rewards: Dynamic Tree Reasoning with RL](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13142)
*Ahmed Bahloul,Simon Malberg*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes a dynamic reinforcement learning framework that improves tree-structured reasoning systems by adaptively constructing reasoning trees in real-time, addressing limitations of static methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing tree-structured reasoning frameworks like ProbTree are limited by their static nature and computational inefficiency, which hinder dynamic adaptation and real-time question answering capabilities.

Method: The authors introduce a reinforcement learning framework that incrementally builds reasoning trees based on real-time confidence estimates and optimizes action selection policies for decomposition, retrieval, or aggregation.

Result: The proposed approach enhances solution quality and computational efficiency by enabling selective expansion and focused resource allocation, maintaining probabilistic rigor.

Conclusion: This work pioneers a new dynamic paradigm for tree-structured reasoning that combines flexibility and probabilistic robustness, advancing real-world question answering systems.

Abstract: Modern language models address complex questions through chain-of-thought
(CoT) reasoning (Wei et al., 2023) and retrieval augmentation (Lewis et al.,
2021), yet struggle with error propagation and knowledge integration.
Tree-structured reasoning methods, particularly the Probabilistic
Tree-of-Thought (ProbTree)(Cao et al., 2023) framework, mitigate these issues
by decomposing questions into hierarchical structures and selecting answers
through confidence-weighted aggregation of parametric and retrieved knowledge
(Yao et al., 2023). However, ProbTree's static implementation introduces two
key limitations: (1) the reasoning tree is fixed during the initial
construction phase, preventing dynamic adaptation to intermediate results, and
(2) each node requires exhaustive evaluation of all possible solution
strategies, creating computational inefficiency. We present a dynamic
reinforcement learning (Sutton and Barto, 2018) framework that transforms
tree-based reasoning into an adaptive process. Our approach incrementally
constructs the reasoning tree based on real-time confidence estimates, while
learning optimal policies for action selection (decomposition, retrieval, or
aggregation). This maintains ProbTree's probabilistic rigor while improving
both solution quality and computational efficiency through selective expansion
and focused resource allocation. The work establishes a new paradigm for
treestructured reasoning that balances the reliability of probabilistic
frameworks with the flexibility required for real-world question answering
systems.

### [18] [Black Box Deployed -- Functional Criteria for Artificial Moral Agents in the LLM Era](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13175)
*Matthew E. Brophy*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper highlights the need to revise philosophical criteria for evaluating artificial moral agents (AMAs) due to the opaque nature of large language models (LLMs). It proposes ten updated criteria for assessing these agents, with practical applications shown through hypothetical scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional ethical frameworks for AMAs assume transparency, but this assumption clashes with the opaque architecture and stochastic behaviors of modern LLMs. The paper seeks to address this mismatch by redefining these evaluation criteria.

Method: The authors draw from philosophical discussions and propose ten functional criteria specific to LLM-based AMAs. They utilize hypothetical scenarios, like an autonomous public bus, to demonstrate the applicability of these criteria.

Result: The paper offers a novel framework with ten criteria—moral concordance, context sensitivity, normative integrity, metaethical awareness, system resilience, trustworthiness, corrigibility, partial transparency, functional autonomy, and moral imagination—for aligning LLM-based systems with societal values.

Conclusion: The proposed framework updates evaluation techniques to match the unique characteristics of LLMs, aiming to better align artificial moral agents with ethical expectations and societal needs.

Abstract: The advancement of powerful yet opaque large language models (LLMs)
necessitates a fundamental revision of the philosophical criteria used to
evaluate artificial moral agents (AMAs). Pre-LLM frameworks often relied on the
assumption of transparent architectures, which LLMs defy due to their
stochastic outputs and opaque internal states. This paper argues that
traditional ethical criteria are pragmatically obsolete for LLMs due to this
mismatch. Engaging with core themes in the philosophy of technology, this paper
proffers a revised set of ten functional criteria to evaluate LLM-based
artificial moral agents: moral concordance, context sensitivity, normative
integrity, metaethical awareness, system resilience, trustworthiness,
corrigibility, partial transparency, functional autonomy, and moral
imagination. These guideposts, applied to what we term "SMA-LLS" (Simulating
Moral Agency through Large Language Systems), aim to steer AMAs toward greater
alignment and beneficial societal integration in the coming years. We
illustrate these criteria using hypothetical scenarios involving an autonomous
public bus (APB) to demonstrate their practical applicability in morally
salient contexts.

*Besik Dundua,Temur Kutsia*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper integrates higher-order patterns with fuzzy logic through a unification algorithm based on similarity relations using minimum T-norm.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Decision-making tasks require reasoning with abstract functions and predicates, where precise matches aren't always necessary.

Method: Development of a unification algorithm for higher-order patterns, incorporating similarity relations expressed via minimum T-norm.

Result: The algorithm is proven to terminate, be sound, complete, and compute a most general unifier for unifiable terms.

Conclusion: The paper establishes a computationally efficient technique combining higher-order logic and fuzzy reasoning.

Abstract: The combination of higher-order theories and fuzzy logic can be useful in
decision-making tasks that involve reasoning across abstract functions and
predicates, where exact matches are often rare or unnecessary. Developing
efficient reasoning and computational techniques for such a combined formalism
presents a significant challenge. In this paper, we adopt a more
straightforward approach aiming at integrating two well-established and
computationally well-behaved components: higher-order patterns on one side and
fuzzy equivalences expressed through similarity relations based on minimum
T-norm on the other. We propose a unification algorithm for higher-order
patterns modulo these similarity relations and prove its termination,
soundness, and completeness. This unification problem, like its crisp
counterpart, is unitary. The algorithm computes a most general unifier with the
highest degree of approximation when the given terms are unifiable.

### [20] [The Generative Energy Arena (GEA): Incorporating Energy Awareness in Large Language Model (LLM) Human Evaluations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13302)
*Carlos Arriaga,Gonzalo Martínez,Eneko Sendin,Javier Conde,Pedro Reviriego*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes GEA, an evaluation platform for large language models that factors in energy consumption, showing users tend to favor smaller, energy-efficient models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding how energy awareness influences human preferences in model selection, given the challenges of scalable and human-aligned evaluation methods for LLMs.

Method: The paper introduces GEA (Generative Energy Arena), an evaluation tool where users compare models with energy consumption data included in the assessment process.

Result: Users in GEA often prefer smaller, energy-efficient models over larger ones with greater energy demand, as they don't perceive an equal quality enhancement.

Conclusion: Energy consumption awareness can shift user preferences towards efficient models, emphasizing the need to balance performance with sustainability in LLM development.

Abstract: The evaluation of large language models is a complex task, in which several
approaches have been proposed. The most common is the use of automated
benchmarks in which LLMs have to answer multiple-choice questions of different
topics. However, this method has certain limitations, being the most
concerning, the poor correlation with the humans. An alternative approach, is
to have humans evaluate the LLMs. This poses scalability issues as there is a
large and growing number of models to evaluate making it impractical (and
costly) to run traditional studies based on recruiting a number of evaluators
and having them rank the responses of the models. An alternative approach is
the use of public arenas, such as the popular LM arena, on which any user can
freely evaluate models on any question and rank the responses of two models.
The results are then elaborated into a model ranking. An increasingly important
aspect of LLMs is their energy consumption and, therefore, evaluating how
energy awareness influences the decisions of humans in selecting a model is of
interest. In this paper, we present GEA, the Generative Energy Arena, an arena
that incorporates information on the energy consumption of the model in the
evaluation process. Preliminary results obtained with GEA are also presented,
showing that for most questions, when users are aware of the energy
consumption, they favor smaller and more energy efficient models. This suggests
that for most user interactions, the extra cost and energy incurred by the more
complex and top-performing models do not provide an increase in the perceived
quality of the responses that justifies their use.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces FormulaOne, a benchmark to assess the limits of advanced AI models in solving real-world problems in graph theory, logic, and algorithms, showing current models' limitations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To better understand how close advanced AI models are to true human or superhuman expertise by evaluating their ability to handle challenging real-life research problems.

Method: Developed FormulaOne, a benchmark inspired by graph theory, MSO logic, and theoretical computer science, coupled with a testing setup for AI models.

Result: State-of-the-art models like OpenAI's o3 performed poorly, solving less than 1% of FormulaOne problems despite multiple attempts and demonstrations.

Conclusion: Current AI models are far from achieving expert-level understanding, especially in domains requiring deep theoretical reasoning and significant progress could have profound theoretical implications.

Abstract: Frontier AI models demonstrate formidable breadth of knowledge. But how close
are they to true human -- or superhuman -- expertise? Genuine experts can
tackle the hardest problems and push the boundaries of scientific
understanding. To illuminate the limits of frontier model capabilities, we turn
away from contrived competitive programming puzzles, and instead focus on
real-life research problems.
  We construct FormulaOne, a benchmark that lies at the intersection of graph
theory, logic, and algorithms, all well within the training distribution of
frontier models. Our problems are incredibly demanding, requiring an array of
reasoning steps. The dataset has three key properties. First, it is of
commercial interest and relates to practical large-scale optimisation problems,
such as those arising in routing, scheduling, and network design. Second, it is
generated from the highly expressive framework of Monadic Second-Order (MSO)
logic on graphs, paving the way toward automatic problem generation at scale;
ideal for building RL environments. Third, many of our problems are intimately
related to the frontier of theoretical computer science, and to central
conjectures therein, such as the Strong Exponential Time Hypothesis (SETH). As
such, any significant algorithmic progress on our dataset, beyond known
results, could carry profound theoretical implications.
  Remarkably, state-of-the-art models like OpenAI's o3 fail entirely on
FormulaOne, solving less than 1% of the questions, even when given 10 attempts
and explanatory fewshot examples -- highlighting how far they remain from
expert-level understanding in some domains. To support further research, we
additionally curate FormulaOne-Warmup, offering a set of simpler tasks, from
the same distribution. We release the full corpus along with a comprehensive
evaluation framework.

### [22] [Modular SAIL: dream or reality?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12471)
*Petr Kourzanov,Anmol*

Main category: cs.AR

TL;DR: This paper explores compositionality in the RISC-V ISA development flow and proposes a modular approach within the SAIL-RISCV golden model to enable emulation, simulation, and verification of plugins, delivering comparable performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to exploit the modularity of RISC-V ISA by addressing compositionality in the development flow beyond the specification level, enhancing emulator, simulation, and verification capabilities.

Method: The authors propose and implement Modular SAIL, an adaptation to inject compositionality into the SAIL-RISCV model, enabling emulator-level support for modules with static and dynamic binding.

Result: The modular emulator demonstrates comparable functionality to the original RISC-V ISS while maintaining acceptable performance levels for both static and dynamic binding approaches.

Conclusion: The findings suggest that introducing modular compositionality into the SAIL framework is both feasible and beneficial for modular emulation, indicating possibilities for broader application in RISC-V development flows.

Abstract: In order to truly benefit from RISC-V ISA modularity, the community has to
address the issue of compositionality, going beyond modules at the
specification level covering larger subsets of the RISC-V development flow
including emulation, simulation and verification. In this paper we introduce
modular SAIL, an experiment to inject compositionality into the SAIL-RISCV
golden model. We show that it is, in principle, not difficult to adapt the
SAIL-RISCV flow (and ideally the SAIL compiler itself) to support modules at
the emulator level. We back our findings by a comparative study of the
resulting pluggable emulator's performance using both static and dynamic
binding, which both exhibit same functional behavior as the original monolithic
emulator (aka RISC-V ISS).

TL;DR: The paper presents a novel CGRA architecture designed to accelerate transformer operations on low-power edge devices.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current computational demands of transformers hinder their deployment on energy-constrained edge devices.

Method: The proposed architecture uses a 4x4 PE array for parallel computation, 4x2 MOBs for efficient memory operations, and a switchless mesh torus interconnect network for reduced power and latency.

Result: The architecture provides scalable deployment of transformer models with improved energy efficiency and computing performance.

Conclusion: This CGRA design meets the computational needs of transformers, enabling machine learning applications on resource-constrained edge devices.

Abstract: Transformers have revolutionized deep learning with applications in natural
language processing, computer vision, and beyond. However, their computational
demands make it challenging to deploy them on low-power edge devices. This
paper introduces an ultra-low-power, Coarse-Grained Reconfigurable Array (CGRA)
architecture specifically designed to accelerate General Matrix Multiplication
(GEMM) operations in transformer models tailored for the energy and resource
constraints of edge applications. The proposed architecture integrates a 4 x 4
array of Processing Elements (PEs) for efficient parallel computation and
dedicated 4 x 2 Memory Operation Blocks (MOBs) for optimized LOAD/STORE
operations, reducing memory bandwidth demands and enhancing data reuse. A
switchless mesh torus interconnect network further minimizes power and latency
by enabling direct communication between PEs and MOBs, eliminating the need for
centralized switching. Through its heterogeneous array design and efficient
dataflow, this CGRA architecture addresses the unique computational needs of
transformers, offering a scalable pathway to deploy sophisticated machine
learning models on edge devices.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Counterfeit integrated circuits are becoming prevalent and pose risks in electronics labs. The paper seeks to transform this challenge into an educational opportunity.

Method: Instead of discarding fake TL074 operational amplifiers, students in an electronics course used them to conduct diagnostics, measure currents, analyze waveforms, and troubleshoot issues.

Result: Students gained practical experience and deeper understanding of analog circuits, supply chain concerns, and hands-on engineering skills.

Conclusion: Using counterfeit components as educational tools can enhance learning outcomes and raise awareness about supply chain security issues.

Abstract: This work-in-progress paper presents a case study in which counterfeit TL074
operational amplifiers, discovered in a junior level electronics course, became
the basis for a hands on learning experience. Counterfeit integrated circuits
(IC) are increasingly common, posing a significant threat to the integrity of
undergraduate electronics laboratories. Instead of simply replacing the
counterfeit components, we turned the issue into a teaching moment. Students
engaged in hands-on diagnostics measuring current, analyzing waveforms, and

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes a "Model Synthesis Architecture" (MSA) combining distributed and symbolic representations to mimic human reasoning in novel situations, outperforming language model-only baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to understand how humans integrate broad knowledge and reason coherently in novel situations, which existing AI models struggle to replicate.

Method: The paper introduces the MSA, which uses language models for relevance-based retrieval and probabilistic programs for constructing coherent world models. It was tested on a new dataset focusing on reasoning in a sports domain.

Result: The MSA demonstrated superior performance compared to language model-only baselines in modeling human judgments, particularly in handling novel causal structures and integrating background knowledge.

Conclusion: MSAs offer a promising architecture for replicating human-like reasoning in open-ended scenarios by combining global relevance retrieval and coherent modeling.

Abstract: When faced with novel situations, people are able to marshal relevant
considerations from a wide range of background knowledge and put these to use
in inferences and predictions. What permits us to draw in globally relevant
information and reason over it coherently? Here, we explore the hypothesis that
people use a combination of distributed and symbolic representations to
construct bespoke mental models tailored to novel situations. We propose a
computational implementation of this idea -- a ``Model Synthesis Architecture''
(MSA) -- using language models to implement global relevance-based retrieval
and model synthesis and probabilistic programs to implement bespoke, coherent
world models. We evaluate our MSA as a model of human judgments on a novel
reasoning dataset. The dataset -- built around a `Model Olympics` domain of
sports vignettes -- tests models' capacity for human-like, open-ended reasoning
by requiring (i) judgments about novel causal structures described in language;
(ii) drawing on large bodies of background knowledge; and (iii) doing both in
light of observations that introduce arbitrary novel variables. Our MSA
approach captures human judgments better than language model-only baselines,
under both direct and chain-of-thought generations from the LM that supports
model synthesis. These results suggest that MSAs can be implemented in a way
that mirrors people's ability to deliver locally coherent reasoning over
globally relevant variables, offering a path to understanding and replicating
human reasoning in open-ended domains.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores how language models (LMs) understand and categorize sentence modalities using linear representations called modal difference vectors, showing improvements in reliability and insights into human modal categorization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address concerns about the ability of language models to discern different sentence modalities, such as possible, impossible, or nonsensical.

Method: The authors introduced modal difference vectors to identify and analyze the linear representations in LMs responsible for modality judgments. They also studied how these vectors align with both LM competence and human categorization behavior.

Result: Finding that modal difference vectors enable LMs to make more accurate and reliable modality judgments than previously thought, and these vectors align with human categorization ratings in a meaningful way.

Conclusion: The study provides evidence that LMs have robust capabilities for modality categorization, offering insights into both machine and human cognition regarding modalities.

Abstract: Language models (LMs) are used for a diverse range of tasks, from question
answering to writing fantastical stories. In order to reliably accomplish these
tasks, LMs must be able to discern the modal category of a sentence (i.e.,
whether it describes something that is possible, impossible, completely
nonsensical, etc.). However, recent studies have called into question the
ability of LMs to categorize sentences according to modality (Michaelov et al.,
2025; Kauf et al., 2023). In this work, we identify linear representations that
discriminate between modal categories within a variety of LMs, or modal
difference vectors. Analysis of modal difference vectors reveals that LMs have
access to more reliable modal categorization judgments than previously
reported. Furthermore, we find that modal difference vectors emerge in a
consistent order as models become more competent (i.e., through training steps,
layers, and parameter count). Notably, we find that modal difference vectors
identified within LM activations can be used to model fine-grained human
categorization behavior. This potentially provides a novel view into how human
participants distinguish between modal categories, which we explore by
correlating projections along modal difference vectors with human participants'
ratings of interpretable features. In summary, we derive new insights into LM
modal categorization using techniques from mechanistic interpretability, with
the potential to inform our understanding of modal categorization in humans.

TL;DR: The study evaluates NLP models for classifying drug-related deaths via free-text coroner reports, showing BioClinicalBERT's near-perfect performance and potential for real-time surveillance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rising drug-related death rates in the U.S., primarily due to fentanyl, require enhanced surveillance systems, as current manual ICD-10 coding causes delays and data loss.

Method: The study tested multiple NLP methods, including fine-tuned encoder-only (BioClinicalBERT, BERT) and decoder-only (Qwen 3, Llama 3) language models on datasets from 2020 and 2023-2024, assessing their F1 score performance.

Result: BioClinicalBERT achieved near-perfect scores (>=0.998 internal, 0.966 external) and outperformed other NLP methods, proving its accuracy across diverse datasets.

Conclusion: Fine-tuned clinical NLP models like BioClinicalBERT substantially improve overdose surveillance, reducing delays and enabling near real-time detection of drug trends.

Abstract: The rising rate of drug-related deaths in the United States, largely driven
by fentanyl, requires timely and accurate surveillance. However, critical
overdose data are often buried in free-text coroner reports, leading to delays
and information loss when coded into ICD (International Classification of
Disease)-10 classifications. Natural language processing (NLP) models may
automate and enhance overdose surveillance, but prior applications have been
limited. A dataset of 35,433 death records from multiple U.S. jurisdictions in
2020 was used for model training and internal testing. External validation was
conducted using a novel separate dataset of 3,335 records from 2023-2024.
Multiple NLP approaches were evaluated for classifying specific drug
involvement from unstructured death certificate text. These included
traditional single- and multi-label classifiers, as well as fine-tuned
encoder-only language models such as Bidirectional Encoder Representations from
Transformers (BERT) and BioClinicalBERT, and contemporary decoder-only large
language models such as Qwen 3 and Llama 3. Model performance was assessed
using macro-averaged F1 scores, and 95% confidence intervals were calculated to
quantify uncertainty. Fine-tuned BioClinicalBERT models achieved near-perfect
performance, with macro F1 scores >=0.998 on the internal test set. External
validation confirmed robustness (macro F1=0.966), outperforming conventional
machine learning, general-domain BERT models, and various decoder-only large
language models. NLP models, particularly fine-tuned clinical variants like
BioClinicalBERT, offer a highly accurate and scalable solution for overdose
death classification from free-text reports. These methods can significantly
accelerate surveillance workflows, overcoming the limitations of manual ICD-10
coding and supporting near real-time detection of emerging substance use
trends.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces AdaptiSent, a framework improving Multimodal Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis by using adaptive cross-modal attentions. It outperforms existing models in sentiment classification and aspect term extraction with higher precision, recall, and F1 scores.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need to better analyze and model interactions between textual and visual modalities for sentiment classification and aspect term extraction.

Method: AdaptiSent utilizes adaptive cross-modal attention, dynamic modality weighting, and context-adaptive mechanisms to enhance analysis. Experiments were conducted using standard Twitter datasets to compare it against text-only and other multimodal models.

Result: AdaptiSent achieved higher precision, recall, and F1 scores than existing models. It excels at identifying inter-modal relationships and adapting focus dynamically based on contextual relevance.

Conclusion: The framework significantly improves multimodal sentiment analysis, setting a new performance standard in the field and showcasing its effectiveness in handling complex multimodal information.

Abstract: We introduce AdaptiSent, a new framework for Multimodal Aspect-Based
Sentiment Analysis (MABSA) that uses adaptive cross-modal attention mechanisms
to improve sentiment classification and aspect term extraction from both text
and images. Our model integrates dynamic modality weighting and
context-adaptive attention, enhancing the extraction of sentiment and
aspect-related information by focusing on how textual cues and visual context
interact. We tested our approach against several baselines, including
traditional text-based models and other multimodal methods. Results from
standard Twitter datasets show that AdaptiSent surpasses existing models in
precision, recall, and F1 score, and is particularly effective in identifying
nuanced inter-modal relationships that are crucial for accurate sentiment and
aspect term extraction. This effectiveness comes from the model's ability to
adjust its focus dynamically based on the context's relevance, improving the
depth and accuracy of sentiment analysis across various multimodal data sets.
AdaptiSent sets a new standard for MABSA, significantly outperforming current
methods, especially in understanding complex multimodal information.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional speech evaluation methods struggle with designing specialized systems and aligning automatic evaluation with human judgments.

Method: AudioJudge systematically assesses pronunciation, speaking rate, speaker identity, and speech quality using prompt engineering with audio concatenation and in-context learning.

Result: AudioJudge achieves up to 0.91 Spearman correlation with human preferences and shows robustness under noise but faces verbosity and positional bias challenges.

Conclusion: AudioJudge is a promising unified framework for evaluating multi-aspect audio characteristics, though careful treatment of biases is needed for optimization.

Abstract: Current speech evaluation suffers from two critical limitations: the need and
difficulty of designing specialized systems targeting individual audio
characteristics, and poor correlation between automatic evaluation methods and
human preferences. This work presents a systematic study of Large Audio Model
(LAM) as a Judge, AudioJudge, investigating whether it can provide a unified
evaluation framework that addresses both challenges. We systematically explore
AudioJudge across audio characteristic detection tasks, including
pronunciation, speaking rate, speaker identification and speech quality, and
system-level human preference simulation for automated benchmarking. We
investigate different prompt engineering strategies, finding that audio
concatenation combined with in-context learning significantly improves
performance across both audio characteristic detection and human preference
simulation tasks. We further introduce a multi-aspect ensemble AudioJudge to
enable general-purpose multi-aspect audio evaluation. This method decomposes
speech assessment into specialized judges for lexical content, speech quality,
and paralinguistic features, achieving up to 0.91 Spearman correlation with
human preferences on our system ranking benchmark. Robustness analysis reveals
that while LAMs maintain strong performance under acoustic noise, they exhibit
significant verbosity and positional biases that require careful mitigation.

Motivation: The rigidity of subword tokenizers in language models causes inefficiencies in tokenization, especially for out-of-distribution data, unseen languages, or scripts. Addressing this issue is crucial for better model adaptation.

Method: The authors develop FLEXITOKENS, a byte-level tokenization approach featuring a boundary predictor for variable-length segments. It uses a simplified training objective for greater adaptation flexibility without enforcing a fixed compression rate.

Result: FLEXITOKENS reduces token over-fragmentation and achieves up to 10% improvement in downstream task performance compared to traditional subword tokenizers and gradient-based methods.

Conclusion: FLEXITOKENS offers a highly flexible and efficient solution for language model tokenization, successfully enhancing performance across diverse benchmarks, domains, and tasks.

Abstract: Language models (LMs) are challenging to adapt to new data distributions by
simple finetuning. This is due to the rigidity of their subword tokenizers,
which typically remain unchanged during adaptation. This inflexibility often
leads to inefficient tokenization, causing overfragmentation of
out-of-distribution domains, unseen languages, or scripts. In this work, we
develop byte-level LMs with learnable tokenizers to make tokenization adaptive.
Our models include a submodule that learns to predict boundaries between the
input byte sequence, encoding it into variable-length segments. Existing
tokenizer-free methods train this boundary predictor using an auxiliary loss
that enforces a fixed compression rate across the training corpus, introducing
a new kind of rigidity. We propose FLEXITOKENS, a simplified training objective
that enables significantly greater flexibility during adaptation. Evaluating
across multiple multilingual benchmarks, morphologically diverse tasks, and
domains, we demonstrate that FLEXITOKENS consistently reduces token
over-fragmentation and achieves up to 10\% improvements on downstream task
performance compared to subword and other gradient-based tokenizers. Code and
data for our experiments will be released at

### [32] [TransEvalnia: Reasoning-based Evaluation and Ranking of Translations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12724)
*Richard Sproat,Tianyu Zhao,Llion Jones*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: TransEvalnia is a reasoning-based system for translation evaluation and ranking, surpassing traditional systems like MT-Ranker while correlating well with human raters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to improve the evaluation accuracy and ranking of machine translations by enabling fine-grained assessments and reducing biases found in existing systems.

Method: The system employs prompting-based reasoning via powerful LLMs like Claude-3.5-Sonnet and Qwen-2.5-72B-Instruct for multidimensional translation quality evaluation and ranking.

Result: TransEvalnia demonstrates competitive or improved performance over MT-Ranker across multiple datasets and languages, correlating well with human assessments despite some position bias.

Conclusion: TransEvalnia offers high-quality translation evaluations and rankings, with sensitivities addressed through proposed bias mitigation methods, and is shared openly for further research.

Abstract: We present TransEvalnia, a prompting-based translation evaluation and ranking
system that uses reasoning in performing its evaluations and ranking. This
system presents fine-grained evaluations based on a subset of the
Multidimensional Quality Metrics (https://themqm.org/), returns an assessment
of which translation it deems the best, and provides numerical scores for the
various dimensions and for the overall translation. We show that TransEvalnia
performs as well as or better than the state-of-the-art MT-Ranker (Moosa et al.
2024) on our own English-Japanese data as well as several language pairs from
various WMT shared tasks. Using Anthropic's Claude-3.5-Sonnet and
Qwen-2.5-72B-Instruct as the evaluation LLMs, we show that the evaluations
returned are deemed highly acceptable to human raters, and that the scores
assigned to the translations by Sonnet, as well as other LLMs, correlate well
with scores assigned by the human raters. We also note the sensitivity of our
system -- as well as MT-Ranker -- to the order in which the translations are
presented, and we propose methods to address this position bias. All data,
including the system's evaluation and reasoning, human assessments, as well as
code is released.

### [33] [Strategy Adaptation in Large Language Model Werewolf Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12732)
*Fuya Nakamori,Yin Jou Huang,Fei Cheng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This study introduces a strategy-switching mechanism for Werewolf agents to adapt better to dynamic game contexts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous methods lack adaptability to changing situations in the Werewolf game as strategies were implicitly defined.

Method: The paper proposes explicit strategy selection based on game context and player role estimation.

Result: Comparative evaluation shows that strategy adaptation improves performance compared to baseline methods.

Conclusion: Explicitly adapting strategies enhances the effectiveness of Werewolf agents in varying game contexts.

Abstract: This study proposes a method to improve the performance of Werewolf agents by
switching between predefined strategies based on the attitudes of other players
and the context of conversations. While prior works of Werewolf agents using
prompt engineering have employed methods where effective strategies are
implicitly defined, they cannot adapt to changing situations. In this research,
we propose a method that explicitly selects an appropriate strategy based on
the game context and the estimated roles of other players. We compare the
strategy adaptation Werewolf agents with baseline agents using implicit or
fixed strategies and verify the effectiveness of our proposed method.

### [34] [Logit Arithmetic Elicits Long Reasoning Capabilities Without Training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12759)
*Yunxiang Zhang,Muhammad Khalifa,Lechen Zhang,Xin Liu,Ayoung Lee,Xinliang Frederick Zhang,Farima Fatahi Bayat,Lu Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces ThinkLogit, a decoding-time method to enhance long reasoning abilities in large reasoning models (LRMs) using smaller guiding models, achieving significant performance improvements without or with minimal training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation lies in investigating whether the long reasoning abilities of large models can be elicited without additional training, reducing computational costs while enhancing cognitive strategies like backtracking and self-correction.

Method: The method involves using logits arithmetic to guide a large LM with a smaller model during decoding time. Additional improvements are achieved using ThinkLogit-DPO, which employs preference optimization with reasoning pairs.

Result: ThinkLogit and ThinkLogit-DPO demonstrated 26% and 29% relative improvement in pass@1 performance on mathematical reasoning tasks, using a setup where a smaller model (21x smaller) guided a large model. Furthermore, long reasoning skills transferred through reinforcement learning showed a 13% relative improvement.

Conclusion: This work presents a computationally efficient approach to unlock the reasoning abilities in large models with minimal or no training, highlighting its potential for enhancing complex reasoning tasks.

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) can do complex reasoning via long
chain-of-thought (CoT) involving cognitive strategies such as backtracking and
self-correction. Recent studies suggest that some models inherently possess
these long reasoning abilities, which may be unlocked via extra training. Our
work first investigates whether we can elicit such behavior without any
training. To this end, we propose a decoding-time approach, ThinkLogit, which
utilizes logits arithmetic (Liu et al., 2024) to tune a target large LM for
long reasoning using a substantially smaller model as guider. We then show that
we can further boost performance by training the guider model with preference
optimization over correct/incorrect reasoning pairs sampled from both the
target and guider model -- a setup we refer to as ThinkLogit-DPO. Our
experiments demonstrate that ThinkLogit and ThinkLogit-DPO achieve a relative
improvement in pass@1 by 26% and 29%, respectively, over four mathematical
datasets using the Qwen2.5-32B when guided by R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B -- a model
21x smaller. Lastly, we show that ThinkLogit can transfer long reasoning skills
acquired through reinforcement learning, improving pass@1 by 13% relative
compared to the Qwen2.5-32B base model. Our work presents a
computationally-efficient method to elicit long reasoning in large models with
minimal or no additional training.

### [35] [Synergy: End-to-end Concept Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12769)
*Keli Zheng,Zerong Xie*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces 'Synergy,' a byte-level language model that learns intermediate tokenization and achieves comparable or better performance without traditional tokenizers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a language model that eliminates reliance on conventional tokenizers, fostering a more robust and flexible language processing framework.

Method: The model is trained as a byte-level language model with a learned routing mechanism to bridge different abstraction levels, compared to existing methods like BBPE and Llama3.

Result: Synergy learns to tokenize bytes effectively, generates fewer tokens, and competes or outperforms models like Llama3 under comparable conditions.

Conclusion: Tokenizer-free architectures can be viable and effective, highlighting potential for developing more flexible and robust language model pipelines.

Abstract: In this paper, we present Synergy, a language model that bridges different
levels of abstraction in an end-to-end fashion through a learned routing
mechanism. Focusing on low-level linguistic abstraction, we trained our model
as a byte-level language model. Our model spontaneously learns to tokenize
bytes, producing fewer concept tokens than Byte-level Byte Pair Encoder (BBPE)
tokenizers while keeping comparable performance. By comparing with Llama3, we
observed an advantage of Synergy under the same model scale and training
dataset size. Further studies show that the middle part (the higher abstraction
part) of our model performs better when positional encodings are removed,
suggesting the emergence of position-independent concepts. These findings
demonstrate the feasibility of tokenizer-free architectures, paving the way for
more robust and flexible pipelines.

### [36] [Learning Robust Negation Text Representations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12782)
*Thinh Hung Truong,Karin Verspoor,Trevor Cohn,Timothy Baldwin*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper addresses the challenge of negation robustness in text encoders, proposing a distillation approach using large language models and contrastive learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the deficiency of text encoders in capturing negation semantics, which negatively affects downstream applications.

Method: Utilizing diverse negation patterns from large language models, fine-tuning a BERT-based model using a standard contrastive learning approach.

Result: Significant enhancements in negation understanding capabilities, while maintaining strong performance on general benchmarks.

Conclusion: The proposed method improves negation robustness in text encoders and can be extended to enhance negation understanding in large language models as well.

Abstract: Despite rapid adoption of autoregressive large language models, smaller text
encoders still play an important role in text understanding tasks that require
rich contextualized representations. Negation is an important semantic function
that is still not properly captured by such methods, affecting many downstream
applications relying on text embeddings. We propose a strategy to improve
negation robustness of text encoders, by distilling data from large language
models using diverse patterns of negation and hedging. We adopt a standard
contrastive learning strategy to finetune a strong BERT-based model, and
observe large improvement in negation understanding capabilities while
maintaining competitive performance on general benchmarks. In addition, we also
show that our method can be adapted to LLMs, leading to improved performance on
negation benchmarks.

### [37] [Large Language Models' Internal Perception of Symbolic Music](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12808)
*Andrew Shin,Kunitake Kaneko*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper evaluates how large language models (LLMs) represent musical concepts by generating symbolic music from text prompts and testing its utility for classification and generation tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the largely unexamined capability of LLMs to model symbolic music, beyond their demonstrated potential in text, coding, and mathematics.

Method: The methodology involves generating MIDI files using LLMs without specific musical training, using these files to create a dataset, and then training neural networks on this dataset to evaluate performance in genre/style classification and melody completion.

Result: Results show that LLMs can identify basic musical patterns and temporal structures but also have limitations due to the absence of explicit musical context.

Conclusion: LLMs have potential in encoding and generating symbolic music, though their performance is constrained by lack of domain-specific training or context.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at modeling relationships between strings
in natural language and have shown promise in extending to other symbolic
domains like coding or mathematics. However, the extent to which they
implicitly model symbolic music remains underexplored. This paper investigates
how LLMs represent musical concepts by generating symbolic music data from
textual prompts describing combinations of genres and styles, and evaluating
their utility through recognition and generation tasks. We produce a dataset of
LLM-generated MIDI files without relying on explicit musical training. We then
train neural networks entirely on this LLM-generated MIDI dataset and perform
genre and style classification as well as melody completion, benchmarking their
performance against established models. Our results demonstrate that LLMs can
infer rudimentary musical structures and temporal relationships from text,
highlighting both their potential to implicitly encode musical patterns and
their limitations due to a lack of explicit musical context, shedding light on
their generative capabilities for symbolic music.

### [38] [Are Knowledge and Reference in Multilingual Language Models Cross-Lingually Consistent?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12838)
*Xi Ai,Mahardika Krisna Ihsani,Min-Yen Kan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper addresses cross-lingual consistency in multilingual models, exploring how code-mixed coreferential statements are processed and analyzing strategies to improve knowledge consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve cross-lingual transferability, factuality, and performance parity of multilingual language models by ensuring knowledge remains consistent across languages.

Method: The authors used interpretability approaches to analyze layer-wise model behavior in cross-lingual contexts, studied code-mixed coreferential statements, and evaluated improvement strategies like code-switching training and cross-lingual word alignment.

Result: Multilingual models exhibit varying levels of cross-lingual consistency influenced by language families and linguistic factors, with promising improvements from strategies like cross-lingual alignment and code-switching training.

Conclusion: Cross-lingual alignment supervision and code-switching training are effective for enhancing both multilingual language model performance and cross-lingual knowledge consistency.

Abstract: Cross-lingual consistency should be considered to assess cross-lingual
transferability, maintain the factuality of the model knowledge across
languages, and preserve the parity of language model performance. We are thus
interested in analyzing, evaluating, and interpreting cross-lingual consistency
for factual knowledge. We examine code-mixed coreferential statements conveyed
identical knowledge across languages to study cross-lingual knowledge
consistency. We use some interpretability approaches to analyze the behavior of
a model in cross-lingual contexts, discovering that multilingual models show
different levels of consistency, subject to language families, linguistic
factors, and a bottleneck in cross-lingual consistency on a particular layer.
In addition, we evaluate common strategies aimed at improving multilingual
performance to observe whether these strategies can improve knowledge
consistency at the same time. While knowledge is not cross-lingual consistency
in many cases, code-switching training and cross-lingual word alignment
objectives show the most promising results, emphasizing the noteworthiness of
cross-lingual alignment supervision and code-switching training for both
multilingual performance and cross-lingual consistency enhancement.

### [39] [Making Language Model a Hierarchical Classifier and Generator](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12930)
*Yihong Wang,Zhonglin Jiang,Ningyuan Xi,Yue Zhao,Qingqing Gu,Xiyuan Chen,Hao Wu,Sheng Xu,Hange Zhou,Yong Chen,Luo Ji*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes adapting language models like GPT to use hierarchical decoding, where multiple layers decode text simultaneously. This approach achieves strong results in tasks like text classification and generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Inspired by human hierarchical thinking, the authors aim to create a decoder architecture that leverages simultaneous decoding across different layers for enhanced text generation and classification performance.

Method: They adapted a pretrained language model by copying language heads from the last layer into selected intermediate layers and fine-tuned them on specific tasks, enabling hierarchical decoding.

Result: The experimental results showed that intermediate layers could generate meaningful content, achieving state-of-the-art performance on various tasks such as hierarchical text classification, guided generation, and hierarchical text generation.

Conclusion: This hierarchical decoder paradigm demonstrates strong potential for task-specific adaptation in language models and suggests feasibility for pretraining generalized hierarchical reasoners from scratch.

Abstract: Decoder-only language models, such as GPT and LLaMA, generally decode on the
last layer. Motivated by human's hierarchical thinking capability, we propose
that a hierarchical decoder architecture could be built with different layers
decoding texts simultaneously. Due to limited time and computationally
resources, we choose to adapt a pretrained language model into this form of
hierarchical decoder. Language heads of the last layer are copied to different
selected intermediate layers, and fine-tuned with different task inputs. By
thorough experiments, we validate that these selective intermediate layers
could be adapted to speak meaningful and reasonable contents, and this paradigm
of hierarchical decoder can obtain state-of-the-art performances on multiple
tasks such as hierarchical text classification, classification-guided
generation, and hierarchical text generation. This study suggests the
possibility of a generalized hierarchical reasoner, pretraining from scratch.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the IberLEF 2025 Task PRESTA, requiring robust question-answering capabilities about tables in Spanish, leveraging advancements in LLM technology.

Method: The method includes a multi-step process: analyzing table content, selecting columns, creating natural language instructions, translating them to Python code, executing the code, and managing errors, using open-source LLMs with optimized prompts.

Result: Achieved an 85% accuracy score in the IberLEF 2025 Task PRESTA.

Conclusion: The approach demonstrates the effectiveness of integrating code generation with LLMs to process and interpret tabular data in Spanish-speaking contexts.

Abstract: This paper presents our approach for the IberLEF 2025 Task PRESTA: Preguntas
y Respuestas sobre Tablas en Espa\~nol (Questions and Answers about Tables in
Spanish). Our solution obtains answers to the questions by implementing Python
code generation with LLMs that is used to filter and process the table. This
solution evolves from the MRT implementation for the Semeval 2025 related task.
The process consists of multiple steps: analyzing and understanding the content
of the table, selecting the useful columns, generating instructions in natural
language, translating these instructions to code, running it, and handling
potential errors or exceptions. These steps use open-source LLMs and
fine-grained optimized prompts for each step. With this approach, we achieved
an accuracy score of 85\% in the task.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a formal UML-based model to automate processes using attack scenarios in cybersecurity, aiding both analysis and training script generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the lack of formalized input data for automated cybersecurity processes, particularly those using attack scenarios.

Method: The authors developed a novel formal model, abstracted with UML class diagrams, to describe the context and scenarios of cyber attacks.

Result: The model was demonstrated in two use cases: 1) upstream attack analysis and 2) the automatic generation of attack scripts for cybersecurity training.

Conclusion: The research highlights the utility of the proposed model in facilitating cybersecurity automation and training, addressing a critical need for process formalization.

Abstract: Organizations face an ever-changing threat landscape. They must continuously
dedicate significant efforts to protect their assets, making their adoption of
increased cybersecurity automation inevitable. However, process automation
requires formalization of input data. Through this paper, we address this need
for processes that use attack scenarios as input. Among these processes, one
can mention both the generation of scripts for attack simulation and training
purposes, as well as the analysis of attacks. Therefore, the paper's main
research contribution is a novel formal model that encompasses the attack's
context description and its scenario. It is abstracted using UML class model.
Once the description of our model done, we will show how it could serve an
upstream attack analysis process. We will show also its use for an automatic
generation of attack scripts in the context of cybersecurity training. These
two uses cases constitute the second contribution of this present research
work.

TL;DR: SemCSE is an unsupervised method for generating semantic embeddings of scientific texts using LLM-generated summaries, outperforming traditional methods and achieving state-of-the-art results on benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing citation-based methods fail to capture true semantic similarity in scientific text embeddings, necessitating a new approach to understand and encode semantic content.

Method: SemCSE uses contrastive learning on LLM-generated summaries of scientific abstracts, ensuring related summaries are positioned closer in embedding space.

Result: SemCSE exhibits strong semantic separation in embeddings and achieves state-of-the-art performance on the SciRepEval benchmark.

Conclusion: SemCSE demonstrates the efficacy of semantically focused learning for scientific text embeddings, outperforming traditional methods and setting a new standard for model performance.

Abstract: We introduce SemCSE, an unsupervised method for learning semantic embeddings
of scientific texts. Building on recent advances in contrastive learning for
text embeddings, our approach leverages LLM-generated summaries of scientific
abstracts to train a model that positions semantically related summaries closer
together in the embedding space. This resulting objective ensures that the
model captures the true semantic content of a text, in contrast to traditional
citation-based approaches that do not necessarily reflect semantic similarity.
To validate this, we propose a novel benchmark designed to assess a model's
ability to understand and encode the semantic content of scientific texts,
demonstrating that our method enforces a stronger semantic separation within
the embedding space. Additionally, we evaluate SemCSE on the comprehensive
SciRepEval benchmark for scientific text embeddings, where it achieves
state-of-the-art performance among models of its size, thus highlighting the
benefits of a semantically focused training approach.

*Jaya Caporusso,Matthew Purver,Senja Pollak*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This proposal aims to create a computational system to identify Self-aspects in text by developing an ontology, dataset, and testing NLP models for interpretability, accuracy, and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The Self is a multifaceted concept that has been discussed in various disciplines but remains unexplored in natural language processing (NLP). Incorporating NLP-based analysis of the Self aligns with understanding psychological and mental health phenomena.

Method: The approach involves creating an ontology of Self-aspects, developing a gold-standard annotated dataset, and evaluating different NLP models (discriminative, generative, and embedding-based) on criteria such as interpretability and accuracy.

Result: Predicted outcomes include identifying the best-performing models for analyzing Self-aspects in text and utilizing these models in mental health and phenomenological studies.

Conclusion: This framework could provide meaningful insights into the linguistic reflection of the Self, with applications in mental health and empirical phenomenology.

Abstract: This Ph.D. proposal introduces a plan to develop a computational framework to
identify Self-aspects in text. The Self is a multifaceted construct and it is
reflected in language. While it is described across disciplines like cognitive
science and phenomenology, it remains underexplored in natural language
processing (NLP). Many of the aspects of the Self align with psychological and
other well-researched phenomena (e.g., those related to mental health),
highlighting the need for systematic NLP-based analysis. In line with this, we
plan to introduce an ontology of Self-aspects and a gold-standard annotated
dataset. Using this foundation, we will develop and evaluate conventional
discriminative models, generative large language models, and embedding-based
retrieval approaches against four main criteria: interpretability, ground-truth
adherence, accuracy, and computational efficiency. Top-performing models will
be applied in case studies in mental health and empirical phenomenology.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper examines the impact of annotator demographics on labeling variability in sexism detection tasks and assesses the potential of using Generative AI models as annotators.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to understand demographic biases and their influence on annotation variability in NLP systems, particularly for high-stakes tasks like sexism detection.

Method: A Generalized Linear Mixed Model was employed to quantify the influence of annotator demographics versus text content. The reliability of Generative AI models with demographic persona guidance was also evaluated.

Result: Demographic factors contributed only 8% to annotation variability, with text content being the major driver. Persona-guided GenAI often failed or degraded performance. Explainable AI showed model predictions mainly relied on sexism-critical tokens in the text.

Conclusion: Content-focused strategies and robust annotation protocols are more effective for fostering fairness in NLP systems than persona simulation approaches.

Abstract: Understanding the sources of variability in annotations is crucial for
developing fair NLP systems, especially for tasks like sexism detection where
demographic bias is a concern. This study investigates the extent to which
annotator demographic features influence labeling decisions compared to text
content. Using a Generalized Linear Mixed Model, we quantify this inf luence,
finding that while statistically present, demographic factors account for a
minor fraction ( 8%) of the observed variance, with tweet content being the
dominant factor. We then assess the reliability of Generative AI (GenAI) models
as annotators, specifically evaluating if guiding them with demographic
personas improves alignment with human judgments. Our results indicate that
simplistic persona prompting often fails to enhance, and sometimes degrades,
performance compared to baseline models. Furthermore, explainable AI (XAI)
techniques reveal that model predictions rely heavily on content-specific
tokens related to sexism, rather than correlates of demographic
characteristics. We argue that focusing on content-driven explanations and
robust annotation protocols offers a more reliable path towards fairness than
potentially persona simulation.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This study uses machine learning to analyze oral narratives of children needing intervention, identifying key linguistic predictors of literacy development.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore linguistic features of oral narratives that predict the literacy development of children in multilingual contexts and identify indicators of intervention needs.

Method: Using machine learning techniques, recorded oral narratives of four- and five-year-old children speaking Afrikaans and isiXhosa were analyzed to identify language-specific and shared linguistic features.

Result: Features such as lexical diversity and mean utterance length were found to predict typical development, while articulation rate was less informative. Specific verbs and auxiliaries used in goal-directed storytelling correlated with lower intervention requirements.

Conclusion: This analysis highlights both universal and language-specific predictors of narrative proficiency, aiding early assessment in multilingual educational settings.

Abstract: Oral narrative skills are strong predictors of later literacy development.
This study examines the features of oral narratives from children who were
identified by experts as requiring intervention. Using simple machine learning
methods, we analyse recorded stories from four- and five-year-old Afrikaans-
and isiXhosa-speaking children. Consistent with prior research, we identify
lexical diversity (unique words) and length-based features (mean utterance
length) as indicators of typical development, but features like articulation
rate prove less informative. Despite cross-linguistic variation in
part-of-speech patterns, the use of specific verbs and auxiliaries associated
with goal-directed storytelling is correlated with a reduced likelihood of
requiring intervention. Our analysis of two linguistically distinct languages
reveals both language-specific and shared predictors of narrative proficiency,
with implications for early assessment in multilingual contexts.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: GEMMAS is a new evaluation framework analyzing multi-agent collaboration by modeling it as a directed acyclic graph, introducing metrics for communication efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing evaluations of multi-agent systems emphasize output correctness, ignoring inefficiencies in communication and coordination that lead to redundant reasoning and higher costs.

Method: GEMMAS models agent interactions as a directed acyclic graph and introduces two metrics: Information Diversity Score (IDS) for semantic variation and Unnecessary Path Ratio (UPR) for redundant reasoning.

Result: GEMMAS was tested on five benchmarks, demonstrating significant variations in communication efficiency even when accuracy differences were small, such as on GSM8K where IDS differed by 12.8% and UPR by 80%.

Conclusion: Outcome-only metrics are insufficient for evaluating multi-agent systems; process-level diagnostics like GEMMAS are vital for building more interpretable and efficient AI systems.

Abstract: Multi-agent systems built on language models have shown strong performance on
collaborative reasoning tasks. However, existing evaluations focus only on the
correctness of the final output, overlooking how inefficient communication and
poor coordination contribute to redundant reasoning and higher computational
costs. We introduce GEMMAS, a graph-based evaluation framework that analyzes
the internal collaboration process by modeling agent interactions as a directed
acyclic graph. To capture collaboration quality, we propose two process-level
metrics: Information Diversity Score (IDS) to measure semantic variation in
inter-agent messages, and Unnecessary Path Ratio (UPR) to quantify redundant
reasoning paths. We evaluate GEMMAS across five benchmarks and highlight
results on GSM8K, where systems with only a 2.1% difference in accuracy differ
by 12.8% in IDS and 80% in UPR, revealing substantial variation in internal
collaboration. These findings demonstrate that outcome-only metrics are
insufficient for evaluating multi-agent performance and highlight the
importance of process-level diagnostics in designing more interpretable and
resource-efficient collaborative AI systems.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a system that uses speech recognition and machine learning to evaluate preschool children's oral narrative skills, aiding teachers in identifying students needing literacy interventions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large preschool classrooms often render it difficult for teachers to identify children requiring help with narrative and comprehension skills, critical for future literacy.

Method: The system transcribes oral narratives using automatic speech recognition and evaluates them using two scoring models—a linear model and a large language model (LLM).

Result: The LLM-based model outperformed the linear model, achieving performance comparable to human experts in identifying students needing interventions.

Conclusion: The system enables automatic oral assessments, aiding teachers in providing personalized learning support to preschool children.

Abstract: Developing narrative and comprehension skills in early childhood is critical
for later literacy. However, teachers in large preschool classrooms struggle to
accurately identify students who require intervention. We present a system for
automatically assessing oral narratives of preschool children in Afrikaans and
isiXhosa. The system uses automatic speech recognition followed by a machine
learning scoring model to predict narrative and comprehension scores. For
scoring predicted transcripts, we compare a linear model to a large language
model (LLM). The LLM-based system outperforms the linear model in most cases,
but the linear system is competitive despite its simplicity. The LLM-based
system is comparable to a human expert in flagging children who require
intervention. We lay the foundation for automatic oral assessments in
classrooms, giving teachers extra capacity to focus on personalised support for
children's learning.

TL;DR: The paper proposes CAST, a novel framework to improve large language models' (LLMs) ability in transferring knowledge across tasks without altering parameters or inputs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs often struggle with unseen tasks in low-data scenarios, and existing cross-task learning methods have limitations related to robustness, scalability, and efficiency.

Method: CAST leverages consistent activation patterns in latent spaces of LLMs, using samples from high-resource tasks to enhance contrastive representations for low-resource tasks without parameter updates.

Result: CAST outperforms competitive baselines in cross-domain and cross-lingual task transfers, demonstrating superior scalability and reduced computational costs.

Conclusion: The proposed CAST method proves to be an efficient and effective way to enhance task transfer in LLMs by steering internal activation states, overcoming current limitations in cross-task learning.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown impressive abilities in leveraging
pretrained knowledge through prompting, but they often struggle with unseen
tasks, particularly in data-scarce scenarios. While cross-task in-context
learning offers a direct solution for transferring knowledge across tasks, it
still faces critical challenges in terms of robustness, scalability, and
efficiency. In this paper, we investigate whether cross-task transfer can be
achieved via latent space steering without parameter updates or input
expansion. Through an analysis of activation patterns in the latent space of
LLMs, we observe that the enhanced activations induced by in-context examples
have consistent patterns across different tasks. Inspired by these findings, we
propose CAST, a novel Cross-task Activation Steering Transfer framework that
enables effective transfer by manipulating the model's internal activation
states. Our approach first selects influential and diverse samples from
high-resource tasks, then utilizes their contrastive representation-enhanced
activations to adapt LLMs to low-resource tasks. Extensive experiments across
both cross-domain and cross-lingual transfer settings show that our method
outperforms competitive baselines and demonstrates superior scalability and
lower computational costs.

### [49] [HATS: Hindi Analogy Test Set for Evaluating Reasoning in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13238)
*Ashray Gupta,Rohan Joseph,Sunny Rai*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a Hindi Analogy Test Set (HATS) to evaluate large language models' reasoning abilities in Hindi, finding that models perform better with English prompts even on Hindi tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation stems from a lack of research on large language models' reasoning and analogy capabilities in Indic languages, particularly Hindi.

Method: The authors created a test set (HATS) of 405 multiple-choice Hindi questions from Indian government exams and used different prompting strategies, including a grounded Chain of Thought method based on cognitive theories.

Result: State-of-the-art multilingual models performed best when prompted in English, highlighting challenges in reasoning capabilities in Hindi.

Conclusion: The Hindi Analogy Test Set fills a gap in resources for evaluating reasoning in Indic languages, providing important insights into multilingual model generalization.

Abstract: Analogies test a model's ability to infer implicit relationships between
concepts, making them a key benchmark for evaluating reasoning capabilities.
While large language models (LLMs) are widely evaluated for reasoning in
English, their abilities in Indic languages remain understudied, limiting our
understanding of whether these models generalize across languages. To address
this gap, we introduce a new Hindi Analogy Test Set (HATS), comprising 405
multiple-choice questions sourced from Indian government exams. We benchmark
state-of-the-art multilingual LLMs using various prompting strategies and
introduce a grounded Chain of Thought approach that leverages cognitive
theories of analogical reasoning. This approach improves model performance on
Hindi analogy questions. Our experiments show that models perform best with
English prompts, irrespective of the prompting strategy. Our test set addresses
the lack of a critical resource to evaluate LLM reasoning capabilities in
Hindi.

### [50] [Automating Steering for Safe Multimodal Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13255)
*Lyucheng Wu,Mengru Wang,Ziwen Xu,Tri Cao,Nay Oo,Bryan Hooi,Shumin Deng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces AutoSteer, a safety enhancement framework for Multimodal Large Language Models, which reduces vulnerabilities to adversarial multimodal inputs without fine-tuning the model.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address safety concerns in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), particularly their vulnerabilities to adversarial multimodal inputs.

Method: The authors propose AutoSteer, comprising three components: a Safety Awareness Score (SAS) for identifying crucial safety-relevant distinctions, an adaptive safety prober to detect potential toxic outputs, and a Refusal Head to intervene and modulate high-risk outputs during inference.

Result: AutoSteer demonstrates significant reductions in Attack Success Rates (ASR) across various safety-critical benchmarks while preserving the general capabilities of the models.

Conclusion: AutoSteer proves to be an efficient, interpretable, and modular solution for enhancing the safety of multimodal AI systems during deployment.

Abstract: Recent progress in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) has unlocked
powerful cross-modal reasoning abilities, but also raised new safety concerns,
particularly when faced with adversarial multimodal inputs. To improve the
safety of MLLMs during inference, we introduce a modular and adaptive
inference-time intervention technology, AutoSteer, without requiring any
fine-tuning of the underlying model. AutoSteer incorporates three core
components: (1) a novel Safety Awareness Score (SAS) that automatically
identifies the most safety-relevant distinctions among the model's internal
layers; (2) an adaptive safety prober trained to estimate the likelihood of
toxic outputs from intermediate representations; and (3) a lightweight Refusal
Head that selectively intervenes to modulate generation when safety risks are
detected. Experiments on LLaVA-OV and Chameleon across diverse safety-critical
benchmarks demonstrate that AutoSteer significantly reduces the Attack Success
Rate (ASR) for textual, visual, and cross-modal threats, while maintaining
general abilities. These findings position AutoSteer as a practical,
interpretable, and effective framework for safer deployment of multimodal AI
systems.

*Jiazheng Li,Hong Lu,Kaiyue Wen,Zaiwen Yang,Jiaxuan Gao,Hongzhou Lin,Yi Wu,Jingzhao Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces QuestA, a reinforcement learning strategy utilizing question augmentation for improved performance in math reasoning tasks, achieving state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of reinforcement learning in enhancing multi-step reasoning on challenging problems.

Method: Partial solutions, termed "Question Augmentation," are introduced during RL training to reduce problem complexity and improve learning signals, enhancing model reasoning capabilities.

Result: The QuestA method achieves state-of-the-art results on math reasoning benchmarks, including a pass@1 improvement and increased pass@k accuracy on challenging problems.

Conclusion: QuestA, by improving sample efficiency through reduced complexity, provides a practical technique for advancing multi-step reasoning capabilities in large language models.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has become a key component in training large
language reasoning models (LLMs). However, recent studies questions its
effectiveness in improving multi-step reasoning-particularly on hard problems.
To address this challenge, we propose a simple yet effective strategy via
Question Augmentation: introduce partial solutions during training to reduce
problem difficulty and provide more informative learning signals. Our method,
QuestA, when applied during RL training on math reasoning tasks, not only
improves pass@1 but also pass@k-particularly on problems where standard RL
struggles to make progress. This enables continual improvement over strong
open-source models such as DeepScaleR and OpenMath Nemotron, further enhancing
their reasoning capabilities. We achieve new state-of-the-art results on math
benchmarks using 1.5B-parameter models: 67.1% (+5.3%) on AIME24, 59.5% (+10.0%)
on AIME25, and 35.5% (+4.0%) on HMMT25. Further, we provide theoretical
explanations that QuestA improves sample efficiency, offering a practical and
generalizable pathway for expanding reasoning capability through RL.

*Luis Gasco,Hermenegildo Fabregat,Laura García-Sardiña,Paula Estrella,Daniel Deniz,Alvaro Rodrigo,Rabih Zbib*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: TalentCLEF 2025 is an initiative to evaluate multilingual models for job title matching and skill prediction using real-world labor market data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the lack of public data and benchmarks for developing and evaluating fair and reliable language models for human capital management.

Method: The study introduces TalentCLEF 2025 with two tasks: multilingual job title matching and job title-based skill prediction. It uses anonymized and manually annotated real-world job application data, incorporating monolingual and cross-lingual evaluations and gender bias testing.

Result: TalentCLEF attracted 76 teams and over 280 submissions. Most participants used multilingual encoder-based models fine-tuned with contrastive learning. Results showed that training strategies impacted performance more than model size.

Conclusion: TalentCLEF provides the first public benchmark in the domain, promoting the creation of fair, robust, and transferable language models tailored for the labor market.

Abstract: Advances in natural language processing and large language models are driving
a major transformation in Human Capital Management, with a growing interest in
building smart systems based on language technologies for talent acquisition,
upskilling strategies, and workforce planning. However, the adoption and
progress of these technologies critically depend on the development of reliable
and fair models, properly evaluated on public data and open benchmarks, which
have so far been unavailable in this domain.
  To address this gap, we present TalentCLEF 2025, the first evaluation
campaign focused on skill and job title intelligence. The lab consists of two
tasks: Task A - Multilingual Job Title Matching, covering English, Spanish,
German, and Chinese; and Task B - Job Title-Based Skill Prediction, in English.
Both corpora were built from real job applications, carefully anonymized, and
manually annotated to reflect the complexity and diversity of real-world labor
market data, including linguistic variability and gender-marked expressions.
  The evaluations included monolingual and cross-lingual scenarios and covered
the evaluation of gender bias.
  TalentCLEF attracted 76 registered teams with more than 280 submissions. Most
systems relied on information retrieval techniques built with multilingual
encoder-based models fine-tuned with contrastive learning, and several of them
incorporated large language models for data augmentation or re-ranking. The
results show that the training strategies have a larger effect than the size of
the model alone. TalentCLEF provides the first public benchmark in this field
and encourages the development of robust, fair, and transferable language
technologies for the labor market.

*Wang Xi,Quan Shi,Tian Yu,Yujie Peng,Jiayi Sun,Mengxing Ren,Zenghui Ding,Ningguang Yao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces RCPS, a novel framework for automatically generating professional-quality media presentations, and PREVAL, an evaluation method for assessing output quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for automated media presentation generation face logical inconsistencies and poor layouts that fail to meet professional standards.

Method: The RCPS framework incorporates Deep Structured Narrative Planning, Adaptive Layout Generation, and an Iterative Optimization Loop. PREVAL evaluates quality using rationale-enhanced models focused on content, coherence, and design.

Result: RCPS outperforms baseline methods in creating high-quality presentations that resemble human expert standards. PREVAL matches human judgments, proving its effectiveness.

Conclusion: RCPS achieves professional-level presentation quality and demonstrates the potential for reliable automated assessments through PREVAL.

Abstract: Automated generation of high-quality media presentations is challenging,
requiring robust content extraction, narrative planning, visual design, and
overall quality optimization. Existing methods often produce presentations with
logical inconsistencies and suboptimal layouts, thereby struggling to meet
professional standards. To address these challenges, we introduce RCPS
(Reflective Coherent Presentation Synthesis), a novel framework integrating
three key components: (1) Deep Structured Narrative Planning; (2) Adaptive
Layout Generation; (3) an Iterative Optimization Loop. Additionally, we propose
PREVAL, a preference-based evaluation framework employing rationale-enhanced
multi-dimensional models to assess presentation quality across Content,
Coherence, and Design. Experimental results demonstrate that RCPS significantly
outperforms baseline methods across all quality dimensions, producing
presentations that closely approximate human expert standards. PREVAL shows
strong correlation with human judgments, validating it as a reliable automated
tool for assessing presentation quality.

*Yilun Zhao,Weiyuan Chen,Zhijian Xu,Manasi Patwardhan,Yixin Liu,Chengye Wang,Lovekesh Vig,Arman Cohan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: AbGen is a benchmark to evaluate LLMs' ability in designing ablation studies, comparing their performance to humans and assessing automated evaluation methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To better understand and improve the capabilities of LLMs in generating detailed ablation studies for scientific contexts.

Method: AbGen benchmark incorporating 1,500 examples from NLP papers and the AbGen-Eval meta-evaluation benchmark for automated methods.

Result: LLMs significantly underperform compared to humans in study design quality, and automated metrics are unreliable for evaluation.

Conclusion: Current LLMs and evaluation systems need improvements to reliably tackle complex scientific tasks like ablation study designs.

Abstract: We introduce AbGen, the first benchmark designed to evaluate the capabilities
of LLMs in designing ablation studies for scientific research. AbGen consists
of 1,500 expert-annotated examples derived from 807 NLP papers. In this
benchmark, LLMs are tasked with generating detailed ablation study designs for
a specified module or process based on the given research context. Our
evaluation of leading LLMs, such as DeepSeek-R1-0528 and o4-mini, highlights a
significant performance gap between these models and human experts in terms of
the importance, faithfulness, and soundness of the ablation study designs.
Moreover, we demonstrate that current automated evaluation methods are not
reliable for our task, as they show a significant discrepancy when compared to
human assessment. To better investigate this, we develop AbGen-Eval, a
meta-evaluation benchmark designed to assess the reliability of commonly used
automated evaluation systems in measuring LLM performance on our task. We
investigate various LLM-as-Judge systems on AbGen-Eval, providing insights for
future research on developing more effective and reliable LLM-based evaluation
systems for complex scientific tasks.

### [55] [HapticCap: A Multimodal Dataset and Task for Understanding User Experience of Vibration Haptic Signals](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13318)
*Guimin Hu,Daniel Hershcovich,Hasti Seifi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces HapticCap, a dataset linking haptic vibrations to textual descriptions, for improving haptic-to-text interpretations. They test this using a contrastive learning framework and achieve best results with a combined T5 and AST model.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Creating meaningful haptic feedback is complex due to a lack of annotated vibration datasets and limitations in tasks/models for text-based descriptions of vibrations.

Method: The authors build HapticCap, a human-annotated dataset of 92,070 haptic-text pairs, and propose a haptic-caption retrieval task using a supervised contrastive learning framework.

Result: The best haptic-caption retrieval results are achieved by a combination of the T5 language model and AST audio model, particularly when trained per description category.

Conclusion: HapticCap and the proposed retrieval task advance research in haptic feedback by bridging the gap between vibrations and textual descriptions for better user understanding.

Abstract: Haptic signals, from smartphone vibrations to virtual reality touch feedback,
can effectively convey information and enhance realism, but designing signals
that resonate meaningfully with users is challenging. To facilitate this, we
introduce a multimodal dataset and task, of matching user descriptions to
vibration haptic signals, and highlight two primary challenges: (1) lack of
large haptic vibration datasets annotated with textual descriptions as
collecting haptic descriptions is time-consuming, and (2) limited capability of
existing tasks and models to describe vibration signals in text. To advance
this area, we create HapticCap, the first fully human-annotated
haptic-captioned dataset, containing 92,070 haptic-text pairs for user
descriptions of sensory, emotional, and associative attributes of vibrations.
Based on HapticCap, we propose the haptic-caption retrieval task and present
the results of this task from a supervised contrastive learning framework that
brings together text representations within specific categories and vibrations.
Overall, the combination of language model T5 and audio model AST yields the
best performance in the haptic-caption retrieval task, especially when
separately trained for each description category.

### [56] [Social and Political Framing in Search Engine Results](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13325)
*Amrit Poudel,Tim Weninger*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study examines how search engines and ideologically-motivated user queries amplify biases in search results, thereby contributing to information polarization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to explore the underexamined role of search engines and user behavior in contributing to biases in search results, particularly in politically and socially sensitive topics.

Method: The study uses a dataset of political and social topics to analyze outputs from major search engines, investigating prioritization of content and the impact of ideologically-driven search queries.

Result: The results show that search engines exhibit biases in content prioritization and that ideologically-driven queries amplify these biases. Significant differences in content sources were also found across different search engines.

Conclusion: The study concludes that search engines and user queries significantly shape public perception by reinforcing ideological divides, highlighting their role in increasing information polarization.

Abstract: Search engines play a crucial role in shaping public discourse by influencing
how information is accessed and framed. While prior research has extensively
examined various dimensions of search bias -- such as content prioritization,
indexical bias, political polarization, and sources of bias -- an important
question remains underexplored: how do search engines and
ideologically-motivated user queries contribute to bias in search results. This
study analyzes the outputs of major search engines using a dataset of political
and social topics. The findings reveal that search engines not only prioritize
content in ways that reflect underlying biases but also that
ideologically-driven user queries exacerbate these biases, resulting in the
amplification of specific narratives. Moreover, significant differences were
observed across search engines in terms of the sources they prioritize. These
results suggest that search engines may play a pivotal role in shaping public
perceptions by reinforcing ideological divides, thereby contributing to the
broader issue of information polarization.

*Yulu Qin,Dheeraj Varghese,Adam Dahlgren Lindström,Lucia Donatelli,Kanishka Misra,Najoung Kim*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study investigates whether VL training alters linguistic representations in language models, primarily focusing on lexical-conceptual knowledge and taxonomic organization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand if VL training impacts the taxonomic understanding and deployment of lexical-conceptual knowledge in language models.

Method: Behavioral and representational analyses comparing text-only language models and VL-trained counterparts on a question-answering task requiring taxonomic understanding.

Result: VL models generally perform better on text-only question tasks focused on taxonomic relations. However, the taxonomic knowledge itself is not significantly altered, but its utilization in task contexts improves.

Conclusion: VL training enhances the application of existing taxonomic knowledge in language models without altering the knowledge itself, showcasing improved task-specific deployment.

Abstract: Does vision-and-language (VL) training change the linguistic representations
of language models in meaningful ways? Most results in the literature have
shown inconsistent or marginal differences, both behaviorally and
representationally. In this work, we start from the hypothesis that the domain
in which VL training could have a significant effect is lexical-conceptual
knowledge, in particular its taxonomic organization. Through comparing minimal
pairs of text-only LMs and their VL-trained counterparts, we first show that
the VL models often outperform their text-only counterparts on a text-only
question-answering task that requires taxonomic understanding of concepts
mentioned in the questions. Using an array of targeted behavioral and
representational analyses, we show that the LMs and VLMs do not differ
significantly in terms of their taxonomic knowledge itself, but they differ in
how they represent questions that contain concepts in a taxonomic relation vs.
a non-taxonomic relation. This implies that the taxonomic knowledge itself does
not change substantially through additional VL training, but VL training does
improve the deployment of this knowledge in the context of a specific task,
even when the presentation of the task is purely linguistic.

*Zhouqi Hua,Wenwei Zhang,Chengqi Lyu,Yuzhe Gu,Songyang Gao,Kuikun Liu,Kai Chen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces TAIL, a method to improve length generalization in LLMs by imitating Turing Machine execution, validated on a synthetic dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLMs struggle with length generalization, and existing solutions for reasoning tasks tend to be task-specific and lack general applicability.

Method: The paper introduces TAIL, which utilizes chain-of-thought data to simulate Turing Machine execution, expands reasoning steps linearly, and integrates explicit memory mechanisms to address long-range data access challenges.

Result: TAIL improves length generalization and reasoning performance on synthetic tasks for Qwen2.5-7B, surpassing prior methods and demonstrating properties of Turing Machines in attention behaviors.

Conclusion: TAIL demonstrates that key Turing Machine concepts are essential for length generalization in LLMs, offering a promising pathway for improving reasoning capabilities using synthetic data.

Abstract: Length generalization, the ability to solve problems of longer sequences than
those observed during training, poses a core challenge of Transformer-based
large language models (LLM). Although existing studies have predominantly
focused on data-driven approaches for arithmetic operations and symbolic
manipulation tasks, these approaches tend to be task-specific with limited
overall performance. To pursue a more general solution, this paper focuses on a
broader case of reasoning problems that are computable, i.e., problems that
algorithms can solve, thus can be solved by the Turing Machine. From this
perspective, this paper proposes Turing MAchine Imitation Learning (TAIL) to
improve the length generalization ability of LLMs. TAIL synthesizes
chain-of-thoughts (CoT) data that imitate the execution process of a Turing
Machine by computer programs, which linearly expands the reasoning steps into
atomic states to alleviate shortcut learning and explicit memory fetch
mechanism to reduce the difficulties of dynamic and long-range data access in
elementary operations. To validate the reliability and universality of TAIL, we
construct a challenging synthetic dataset covering 8 classes of algorithms and
18 tasks. Without bells and whistles, TAIL significantly improves the length
generalization ability as well as the performance of Qwen2.5-7B on various
tasks using only synthetic data, surpassing previous methods and DeepSeek-R1.
The experimental results reveal that the key concepts in the Turing Machine,
instead of the thinking styles, are indispensable for TAIL for length
generalization, through which the model exhibits read-and-write behaviors
consistent with the properties of the Turing Machine in their attention layers.
This work provides a promising direction for future research in the learning of
LLM reasoning from synthetic data.

TL;DR: The paper introduces Context Engineering as a systematic discipline for optimizing information fed to Large Language Models (LLMs), analyzing over 1300 papers and proposing a taxonomy dividing foundational components and system implementations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to further the performance and contextual understanding of LLMs by optimizing the context they process, as better context utilization enhances their capabilities.

Method: The paper categorizes Context Engineering into foundational components (retrieval, generation, processing, and management) and explores their integration into systems like retrieval-augmented generation, memory systems, and multi-agent systems.

Result: It highlights both a comprehensive framework for the field and a critical gap: LLMs excel in comprehension but struggle in generating sophisticated, long-form outputs.

Conclusion: The paper offers a unified framework for advancing context-aware AI and identifies addressing the generation gap as a key research priority.

Abstract: The performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) is fundamentally determined
by the contextual information provided during inference. This survey introduces
Context Engineering, a formal discipline that transcends simple prompt design
to encompass the systematic optimization of information payloads for LLMs. We
present a comprehensive taxonomy decomposing Context Engineering into its
foundational components and the sophisticated implementations that integrate
them into intelligent systems. We first examine the foundational components:
context retrieval and generation, context processing and context management. We
then explore how these components are architecturally integrated to create
sophisticated system implementations: retrieval-augmented generation (RAG),
memory systems and tool-integrated reasoning, and multi-agent systems. Through
this systematic analysis of over 1300 research papers, our survey not only
establishes a technical roadmap for the field but also reveals a critical
research gap: a fundamental asymmetry exists between model capabilities. While
current models, augmented by advanced context engineering, demonstrate
remarkable proficiency in understanding complex contexts, they exhibit
pronounced limitations in generating equally sophisticated, long-form outputs.
Addressing this gap is a defining priority for future research. Ultimately,
this survey provides a unified framework for both researchers and engineers
advancing context-aware AI.

*Tyler Loakman,William Thorne,Chenghua Lin*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This study examines whether Large Language Models (LLMs) can effectively explain various types of humor, not just simple puns. Researchers created a dataset of 600 jokes across 4 humor types, evaluated models, and found limitations in their ability to explain complex topics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing research in computational humor is overly focused on simple, pun-based jokes, neglecting more complex humor forms.

Method: The authors curated a dataset of 600 jokes across four categories, manually wrote high-quality explanations, and tested the zero-shot abilities of various LLMs to explain these jokes.

Result: LLMs, including reasoning models, were unable to consistently and adequately explain all joke types in the dataset, especially more complex forms of humor.

Conclusion: Current LLMs have significant limitations in processing and explaining diverse humor types, highlighting the narrow scope of computational humor research.

Abstract: Humour, as a complex language form, is derived from myriad aspects of life,
whilst existing work on computational humour has focussed almost exclusively on
short pun-based jokes. In this work, we investigate whether the ability of
Large Language Models (LLMs) to explain humour depends on the particular humour
form. We compare models on simple puns and more complex topical humour that
requires knowledge of real-world entities and events. In doing so, we curate a
dataset of 600 jokes split across 4 joke types and manually write high-quality
explanations. These jokes include heterographic and homographic puns,
contemporary internet humour, and topical jokes, where understanding relies on
reasoning beyond "common sense", rooted instead in world knowledge regarding
news events and pop culture. Using this dataset, we compare the zero-shot
abilities of a range of LLMs to accurately and comprehensively explain jokes of
different types, identifying key research gaps in the task of humour
explanation. We find that none of the tested models (inc. reasoning models) are
capable of reliably generating adequate explanations of all joke types, further
highlighting the narrow focus of most works in computational humour on overly
simple joke forms.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance performance, transparency, and reproducibility in document visual question answering (DocVQA) without requiring additional model fine-tuning.

Method: EaGERS generates natural language rationales, grounds them spatially using multimodal embedding similarities, and processes responses using masked image regions.

Result: The pipeline boosts exact match accuracy and Average Normalized Levenshtein Similarity metrics on the DocVQA dataset.

Conclusion: EaGERS improves DocVQA metrics and offers a training-free, model-independent solution with enhanced transparency.

Abstract: We introduce EaGERS, a fully training-free and model-agnostic pipeline that
(1) generates natural language rationales via a vision language model, (2)
grounds these rationales to spatial sub-regions by computing multimodal
embedding similarities over a configurable grid with majority voting, and (3)
restricts the generation of responses only from the relevant regions selected
in the masked image. Experiments on the DocVQA dataset demonstrate that our
best configuration not only outperforms the base model on exact match accuracy
and Average Normalized Levenshtein Similarity metrics but also enhances
transparency and reproducibility in DocVQA without additional model
fine-tuning.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces MindJourney, a framework enabling vision-language models (VLMs) to perform 3D spatial reasoning using a controllable world model based on video diffusion.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VLMs struggle with 3D spatial reasoning and tasks requiring an understanding of 3D dynamics, essential for embodied tasks like navigation and manipulation.

Method: The proposed method pairs a VLM with a video diffusion-based world model, allowing interactive exploration and iterative sketching of camera trajectories with synthesized multi-view evidence.

Result: MindJourney achieves an 8% performance improvement on the SAT spatial reasoning benchmark without fine-tuning and outperforms VLMs trained with reinforcement learning.

Conclusion: Pairing VLMs with video diffusion-based world models at test-time is a simple yet effective approach to enhance 3D reasoning capabilities of VLMs.

Abstract: Spatial reasoning in 3D space is central to human cognition and indispensable
for embodied tasks such as navigation and manipulation. However,
state-of-the-art vision-language models (VLMs) struggle frequently with tasks
as simple as anticipating how a scene will look after an egocentric motion:
they perceive 2D images but lack an internal model of 3D dynamics. We therefore
propose MindJourney, a test-time scaling framework that grants a VLM with this
missing capability by coupling it to a controllable world model based on video
diffusion. The VLM iteratively sketches a concise camera trajectory, while the
world model synthesizes the corresponding view at each step. The VLM then
reasons over this multi-view evidence gathered during the interactive
exploration. Without any fine-tuning, our MindJourney achieves over an average
8% performance boost on the representative spatial reasoning benchmark SAT,
showing that pairing VLMs with world models for test-time scaling offers a
simple, plug-and-play route to robust 3D reasoning. Meanwhile, our method also
improves upon the test-time inference VLMs trained through reinforcement
learning, which demonstrates the potential of our method that utilizes world
models for test-time scaling.

Conclusion: Mono-InternVL models address critical weaknesses in monolithic MLLMs and set benchmarks for improved visual capability, lower training costs, and efficient inference, providing a foundational approach for scalable multimodal learning solutions.

Abstract: This paper focuses on monolithic Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs),
which integrate visual encoding and language decoding into a single model.
Existing structures and pre-training strategies for monolithic MLLMs often
suffer from unstable optimization and catastrophic forgetting. To address these
challenges, our key idea is to embed a new visual parameter space into a
pre-trained LLM, enabling stable learning of visual knowledge from noisy data
via delta tuning. Based on this principle, we first introduce Mono-InternVL, an
advanced monolithic MLLM that incorporates a set of visual experts through a
multimodal mixture-of-experts architecture. In addition, we design an
innovative Endogenous Visual Pre-training (EViP) for Mono-InternVL to maximize
its visual capabilities via progressive learning. Mono-InternVL achieves
competitive performance against existing MLLMs but also leads to relatively
expensive data cost. Therefore, we further present Mono-InternVL-1.5, a cheaper
and stronger monolithic MLLM equipped with an improved EViP (EViP++). EViP++
introduces additional visual attention experts to Mono-InternVL-1.5 and
re-organizes the pre-training process in an efficient manner. During inference,
it includes a fused CUDA kernel to speed up its MoE operations. With these
designs, Mono-InternVL-1.5 significantly reduces training and inference costs,
while still maintaining competitive performance with Mono-InternVL. To evaluate
our approach, we conduct extensive experiments across 15 benchmarks. Results
demonstrate that Mono-InternVL outperforms existing monolithic MLLMs on 12 out
of 15 benchmarks, e.g., +114-point improvement over Emu3 on OCRBench. Compared
to its modular counterpart, i.e., InternVL-1.5, Mono-InternVL-1.5 achieves
similar multimodal performance while reducing first-token latency by up to 69%.

*Judy Long,Tao Liu,Sean Alexander Woznicki,Miljana Marković,Oskar Marko,Molly Sears*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This study reviews workflows for large-scale crop mapping and evaluates their effectiveness using both conventional supervised learning and transfer learning approaches across diverse sites.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improve the efficiency and accuracy of crop mapping by evaluating methodologies for supervised learning and transfer learning approaches.

Method: Comparison of preprocessing techniques, models, and transfer learning methods using Landsat 8 data and labeled training samples from five sites.

Result: Transformer models paired with fine-scale preprocessing were most effective. Transfer learning methods like UDA work well for homogeneous domains, and fine-tuning is best for diverse scenarios.

Conclusion: Workflow effectiveness depends on labeled sample size availability. Supervised learning performs better with sufficient samples, while transfer learning is viable for low-sample domains.

Abstract: Crop mapping involves identifying and classifying crop types using spatial
data, primarily derived from remote sensing imagery. This study presents the
first comprehensive review of large-scale, pixel-wise crop mapping workflows,
encompassing both conventional supervised methods and emerging transfer
learning approaches. To identify the optimal supervised crop mapping workflows,
we conducted systematic experiments, comparing six widely adopted satellite
image-based preprocessing methods, alongside eleven supervised pixel-wise
classification models. Additionally, we assessed the synergistic impact of
varied training sample sizes and variable combinations. Moreover, we identified
optimal transfer learning techniques for different magnitudes of domain shift.
The evaluation of best methods was conducted across five diverse agricultural
sites. Landsat 8 served as the primary satellite data source. Labels come from
CDL trusted pixels and field surveys.
  Our findings reveal three key insights. First, fine-scale interval
preprocessing paired with Transformer models consistently delivered optimal
performance for both supervised and transferable workflows. RF offered rapid
training and competitive performance in conventional supervised learning and
direct transfer to similar domains. Second, transfer learning techniques
enhanced workflow adaptability, with UDA being effective for homogeneous crop
classes while fine-tuning remains robust across diverse scenarios. Finally,
workflow choice depends heavily on the availability of labeled samples. With a
sufficient sample size, supervised training typically delivers more accurate
and generalizable results. Below a certain threshold, transfer learning that
matches the level of domain shift is a viable alternative to achieve crop
mapping. Repository:

TL;DR: The study introduces CT-ScanGaze, the first publicly available eye-tracking dataset for CT scans, and CT-Searcher, a novel deep learning model for 3D scanpath prediction in CT volumes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the gap of understanding radiologists' gaze behavior in CT readings due to the unavailability of 3D gaze datasets and the challenge posed by the three-dimensional complexity of CT volumes.

Method: The researchers developed CT-ScanGaze dataset and CT-Searcher model, converting existing 2D gaze data into 3D for pretraining. They conducted both qualitative and quantitative evaluations for accuracy on CT-ScanGaze.

Result: CT-Searcher effectively predicts radiologist-like 3D fixation sequences and demonstrates improved scanpath predictions compatible with 3D CT volumes.

Conclusion: This work sets a foundation for further exploration in gaze prediction for medical imaging and bridges gaps for interpretable AI-aided CT diagnosis systems.

Abstract: Understanding radiologists' eye movement during Computed Tomography (CT)
reading is crucial for developing effective interpretable computer-aided
diagnosis systems. However, CT research in this area has been limited by the
lack of publicly available eye-tracking datasets and the three-dimensional
complexity of CT volumes. To address these challenges, we present the first
publicly available eye gaze dataset on CT, called CT-ScanGaze. Then, we
introduce CT-Searcher, a novel 3D scanpath predictor designed specifically to
process CT volumes and generate radiologist-like 3D fixation sequences,
overcoming the limitations of current scanpath predictors that only handle 2D
inputs. Since deep learning models benefit from a pretraining step, we develop
a pipeline that converts existing 2D gaze datasets into 3D gaze data to
pretrain CT-Searcher. Through both qualitative and quantitative evaluations on
CT-ScanGaze, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach and provide a
comprehensive assessment framework for 3D scanpath prediction in medical
imaging.

*Said Ohamouddou,Abdellatif El Afia,Hanaa El Afia,Raddouane Chiheb*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces MS-DGCNN++, a hierarchical multi-scale fusion dynamic graph convolutional network, designed for tree species classification and general 3D object recognition using LiDAR point clouds. It achieves improved accuracy compared to existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Classifying tree species from LiDAR point clouds is challenging due to complex multi-scale geometries and limitations in current methods' ability to capture semantic relationships across hierarchical tree structures.

Method: MS-DGCNN++ employs scale-specific feature engineering (local, branch, canopy scales) with cross-scale information propagation for structured semantic representation, replacing parallel uniform processing in previous methods.

Result: Achieved 94.96% accuracy on STPCTLS and outperformed prior methods like MS-DGCNN and PPT. It also improved accuracy by 6.1% on FOR-species20K and performed well on ModelNet40 (93.15%) and ModelNet10 (94.05%). Reduced complexity and parameters make it suitable for resource-constrained applications.

Conclusion: The method outperforms state-of-the-art models in both tree species classification and general 3D object recognition while being computationally efficient. It offers versatile applications for point cloud data processing.

Abstract: Tree species classification from terrestrial LiDAR point clouds is
challenging because of the complex multi-scale geometric structures in forest
environments. Existing approaches using multi-scale dynamic graph convolutional
neural networks (MS-DGCNN) employ parallel multi-scale processing, which fails
to capture the semantic relationships between the hierarchical levels of the
tree architecture. We present MS-DGCNN++, a hierarchical multiscale fusion
dynamic graph convolutional network that uses semantically meaningful feature
extraction at local, branch, and canopy scales with cross-scale information
propagation. Our method employs scale-specific feature engineering, including
standard geometric features for the local scale, normalized relative vectors
for the branch scale, and distance information for the canopy scale. This
hierarchical approach replaces uniform parallel processing with semantically
differentiated representations that are aligned with the natural tree
structure. Under the same proposed tree species data augmentation strategy for
all experiments, MS-DGCNN++ achieved an accuracy of 94.96 \% on STPCTLS,
outperforming DGCNN, MS-DGCNN, and the state-of-the-art model PPT. On
FOR-species20K, it achieves 67.25\% accuracy (6.1\% improvement compared to
MS-DGCNN). For standard 3D object recognition, our method outperformed DGCNN
and MS-DGCNN with overall accuracies of 93.15\% on ModelNet40 and 94.05\% on
ModelNet10. With lower parameters and reduced complexity compared to
state-of-the-art transformer approaches, our method is suitable for
resource-constrained applications while maintaining a competitive accuracy.
Beyond tree classification, the method generalizes to standard 3D object
recognition, establishing it as a versatile solution for diverse point cloud
processing applications. The implementation code is publicly available at

TL;DR: A novel dataset of annotated soccer penalty kicks is introduced, paired with a deep learning model to predict shot directions based on player movements. It achieved high accuracy, surpassing real goalkeepers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve action anticipation in sports contexts by addressing the lack of suitable datasets for predicting outcomes like soccer penalty kick directions.

Method: The authors manually annotated penalty kick data and used deep learning classifiers integrating action recognition features with contextual metadata. They evaluated 22 backbone models across seven architecture families.

Result: The best-performing model achieved 63.9% accuracy in predicting penalty shot directions, outperforming real-world goalkeeper performance.

Conclusion: The dataset is valuable for anticipatory action recognition, and the deep learning approach is promising for predictive tasks in sports.

Abstract: Action anticipation has become a prominent topic in Human Action Recognition
(HAR). However, its application to real-world sports scenarios remains limited
by the availability of suitable annotated datasets. This work presents a novel
dataset of manually annotated soccer penalty kicks to predict shot direction
based on pre-kick player movements. We propose a deep learning classifier to
benchmark this dataset that integrates HAR-based feature embeddings with
contextual metadata. We evaluate twenty-two backbone models across seven
architecture families (MViTv2, MViTv1, SlowFast, Slow, X3D, I3D, C2D),
achieving up to 63.9% accuracy in predicting shot direction (left or right),
outperforming the real goalkeepers' decisions. These results demonstrate the
dataset's value for anticipatory action recognition and validate our model's
potential as a generalizable approach for sports-based predictive tasks.

*Sandipan Sarma,Agney Talwarr,Arijit Sur*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper addresses a long-tail distribution problem in Human-Object Interaction Detection (HOID) and presents a novel top-down framework, Funnel-HOI, that emphasizes improving the encoder stage for scene understanding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the long-tail distribution problem in HOID, where labeled data is limited due to the exponential number of object-action combinations. Current methods focus on decoders, but the authors argue for improving scene interpretation at the encoder stage.

Method: A novel top-down framework called Funnel-HOI is proposed, inspired by a human's tendency to recognize well-defined concepts first, followed by abstract ones. The method incorporates an asymmetric co-attention mechanism for multimodal information and introduces a loss function to better regulate object-action misclassification penalties.

Result: The framework achieves state-of-the-art performance on the HICO-DET and V-COCO datasets. It shows significant improvements, with up to 12.4% gains for unseen categories and 8.4% for rare categories in zero-shot settings.

Conclusion: Funnel-HOI successfully enhances encoder-level interpretation of interactions, solving the long-tail distribution problem more effectively and outperforming existing methods in both supervised and zero-shot settings.

Abstract: Human-object interaction detection (HOID) refers to localizing interactive
human-object pairs in images and identifying the interactions. Since there
could be an exponential number of object-action combinations, labeled data is
limited - leading to a long-tail distribution problem. Recently, zero-shot
learning emerged as a solution, with end-to-end transformer-based object
detectors adapted for HOID becoming successful frameworks. However, their
primary focus is designing improved decoders for learning entangled or
disentangled interpretations of interactions. We advocate that HOI-specific
cues must be anticipated at the encoder stage itself to obtain a stronger scene
interpretation. Consequently, we build a top-down framework named Funnel-HOI
inspired by the human tendency to grasp well-defined concepts first and then
associate them with abstract concepts during scene understanding. We first
probe an image for the presence of objects (well-defined concepts) and then
probe for actions (abstract concepts) associated with them. A novel asymmetric
co-attention mechanism mines these cues utilizing multimodal information
(incorporating zero-shot capabilities) and yields stronger interaction
representations at the encoder level. Furthermore, a novel loss is devised that
considers objectaction relatedness and regulates misclassification penalty
better than existing loss functions for guiding the interaction classifier.
Extensive experiments on the HICO-DET and V-COCO datasets across
fully-supervised and six zero-shot settings reveal our state-of-the-art
performance, with up to 12.4% and 8.4% gains for unseen and rare HOI
categories, respectively.

*Kaihua Chen,Tarasha Khurana,Deva Ramanan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper explores dynamic scene novel-view synthesis using monocular videos, utilizing 3D reconstructions and feed-forward 2D video diffusion models for better efficiency and geometry preservation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the limitations of previous methods that rely on expensive test-time optimization or fail to preserve geometry in feed-forward training scenarios.

Method: Introduces a two-stage method: reconstruct dynamic 3D scenes for covisible pixels, and use a self-supervised video inpainting diffusion model (CogNVS) for hidden pixels, trained on diverse 2D video data.

Result: CogNVS demonstrates superior performance compared to most prior approaches in generating novel views for dynamic scenes from monocular videos.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively combines 3D reconstruction and video diffusion models for efficient and accurate novel-view synthesis, applicable in zero-shot scenarios.

Abstract: We explore novel-view synthesis for dynamic scenes from monocular videos.
Prior approaches rely on costly test-time optimization of 4D representations or
do not preserve scene geometry when trained in a feed-forward manner. Our
approach is based on three key insights: (1) covisible pixels (that are visible
in both the input and target views) can be rendered by first reconstructing the
dynamic 3D scene and rendering the reconstruction from the novel-views and (2)
hidden pixels in novel views can be "inpainted" with feed-forward 2D video
diffusion models. Notably, our video inpainting diffusion model (CogNVS) can be
self-supervised from 2D videos, allowing us to train it on a large corpus of
in-the-wild videos. This in turn allows for (3) CogNVS to be applied zero-shot
to novel test videos via test-time finetuning. We empirically verify that
CogNVS outperforms almost all prior art for novel-view synthesis of dynamic
scenes from monocular videos.

*Inamullah,Ernesto Elias Vidal Rosas,Imran Razzak,Shoaib Jameel*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The study combines retinal microvascular imaging with serum lipidomic profiling to identify early biomarkers for cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for CVD risk assessment often fail to detect early-stage changes. There’s a lack of research integrating retinal microvasculature with comprehensive lipidomic profiles.

Method: An imaging omics framework was employed, using deep learning-based retinal image analysis and UHPLC ESI HRMS for serum lipid profiling in a healthy population.

Result: Strong correlations were discovered between retinal vascular traits (e.g., average artery width, vessel density) and lipid species (e.g., TAGs, DAGs, Cers), independent of age and sex.

Conclusion: The integration of retinal and lipidomic data highlights early, non-invasive biomarkers for CVD risk and suggests pathways for improved detection and personalized healthcare.

Abstract: Cardiovascular disease (CVD) remains the leading global cause of mortality,
yet current risk stratification methods often fail to detect early, subclinical
changes. Previous studies have generally not integrated retinal
microvasculature characteristics with comprehensive serum lipidomic profiles as
potential indicators of CVD risk. In this study, an innovative imaging omics
framework was introduced, combining retinal microvascular traits derived
through deep learning based image processing with serum lipidomic data to
highlight asymptomatic biomarkers of cardiovascular risk beyond the
conventional lipid panel. This represents the first large scale, covariate
adjusted and stratified correlation analysis conducted in a healthy population,
which is essential for identifying early indicators of disease. Retinal
phenotypes were quantified using automated image analysis tools, while serum
lipid profiling was performed by Ultra High Performance Liquid Chromatography
Electrospray ionization High resolution mass spectrometry (UHPLC ESI HRMS).
Strong, age- and sex-independent correlations were established, particularly
between average artery width, vessel density, and lipid subclasses such as
triacylglycerols (TAGs), diacylglycerols (DAGs), and ceramides (Cers). These
associations suggest a converging mechanism of microvascular remodeling under
metabolic stress. By linking detailed
  vascular structural phenotypes to specific lipid species, this study fills a
critical gap in the understanding of early CVD pathogenesis. This integration
not only offers a novel perspective on microvascular metabolic associations but
also presents a significant opportunity for the identification of robust,
non-invasive biomarkers. Ultimately, these findings may support improved early
detection, targeted prevention, and personalized approaches in cardiovascular
healthcare.

Result: The proposed architecture drastically improves efficiency (91% less parameters and complexity, 3x faster inference) while outperforming state-of-the-art methods in segmentation metrics (F1-score of 0.771 and IoU of 0.677).

Conclusion: FORTRESS represents a robust and efficient solution for real-time structural defect segmentation, making it especially suitable for resource-constrained environments. Its dual optimization strategy is critical for its superior performance.

Abstract: Automated structural defect segmentation in civil infrastructure faces a
critical challenge: achieving high accuracy while maintaining computational
efficiency for real-time deployment. This paper presents FORTRESS
(Function-composition Optimized Real-Time Resilient Structural Segmentation), a
new architecture that balances accuracy and speed by using a special method
that combines depthwise separable convolutions with adaptive Kolmogorov-Arnold
Network integration. FORTRESS incorporates three key innovations: a systematic
depthwise separable convolution framework achieving a 3.6x parameter reduction
per layer, adaptive TiKAN integration that selectively applies function
composition transformations only when computationally beneficial, and
multi-scale attention fusion combining spatial, channel, and KAN-enhanced
features across decoder levels. The architecture achieves remarkable efficiency
gains with 91% parameter reduction (31M to 2.9M), 91% computational complexity
reduction (13.7 to 1.17 GFLOPs), and 3x inference speed improvement while
delivering superior segmentation performance. Evaluation on benchmark
infrastructure datasets demonstrates state-of-the-art results with an F1- score
of 0.771 and a mean IoU of 0.677, significantly outperforming existing methods
including U-Net, SA-UNet, and U- KAN. The dual optimization strategy proves
essential for optimal performance, establishing FORTRESS as a robust solution

Conclusion: NeuraLeaf demonstrates effective 3D leaf modeling and reconstruction. Its novel approach capitalizes on 2D image datasets and a skinning model, offering significant advancements in plant modeling.

Abstract: We develop a neural parametric model for 3D leaves for plant modeling and
reconstruction that are essential for agriculture and computer graphics. While
neural parametric models are actively studied for humans and animals, plant
leaves present unique challenges due to their diverse shapes and flexible
deformation. To this problem, we introduce a neural parametric model for
leaves, NeuraLeaf. Capitalizing on the fact that flattened leaf shapes can be
approximated as a 2D plane, NeuraLeaf disentangles the leaves' geometry into
their 2D base shapes and 3D deformations. This representation allows learning
from rich sources of 2D leaf image datasets for the base shapes, and also has
the advantage of simultaneously learning textures aligned with the geometry. To
model the 3D deformation, we propose a novel skeleton-free skinning model and
create a newly captured 3D leaf dataset called DeformLeaf. We show that
NeuraLeaf successfully generates a wide range of leaf shapes with deformation,
resulting in accurate model fitting to 3D observations like depth maps and
point clouds. Our implementation and dataset are available at

Abstract: This study investigates the application of deep residual networks for
predicting the dynamics of interacting three-dimensional rigid bodies. We
present a framework combining a 3D physics simulator implemented in C++ with a
deep learning model constructed using PyTorch. The simulator generates training
data encompassing linear and angular motion, elastic collisions, fluid
friction, gravitational effects, and damping. Our deep residual network,
consisting of an input layer, multiple residual blocks, and an output layer, is
designed to handle the complexities of 3D dynamics. We evaluate the network's
performance using a datasetof 10,000 simulated scenarios, each involving 3-5
interacting rigid bodies. The model achieves a mean squared error of 0.015 for
position predictions and 0.022 for orientation predictions, representing a 25%
improvement over baseline methods. Our results demonstrate the network's
ability to capture intricate physical interactions, with particular success in
predicting elastic collisions and rotational dynamics. This work significantly
contributes to physics-informed machine learning by showcasing the immense
potential of deep residual networks in modeling complex 3D physical systems. We
discuss our approach's limitations and propose future directions for improving
generalization to more diverse object shapes and materials.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The study introduces HairShifter, a video-based hairstyle transfer framework that ensures high-quality, consistent, and adaptable results across video frames.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address challenges in video-based hair transfer, specifically achieving temporal consistency, spatial fidelity, and adaptability, areas where single-image hair transfer methods fall short.

Method: HairShifter adopts an "Anchor Frame + Animation" framework, utilizing an Image Hair Transfer module for accurate image transformations and a Multi-Scale Gated SPADE Decoder for blending and coherence across video frames.

Result: HairShifter showed state-of-the-art performance in video hairstyle transfer, demonstrating superior visual quality, maintaining hairstyle fidelity, and preserving non-hair regions across frames.

Conclusion: This framework establishes a baseline in video-based hairstyle transfer and is expected to expand applications in domains like social media, gaming, and entertainment.

Abstract: Hair transfer is increasingly valuable across domains such as social media,
gaming, advertising, and entertainment. While significant progress has been
made in single-image hair transfer, video-based hair transfer remains
challenging due to the need for temporal consistency, spatial fidelity, and
dynamic adaptability. In this work, we propose HairShifter, a novel "Anchor
Frame + Animation" framework that unifies high-quality image hair transfer with
smooth and coherent video animation. At its core, HairShifter integrates a
Image Hair Transfer (IHT) module for precise per-frame transformation and a
Multi-Scale Gated SPADE Decoder to ensure seamless spatial blending and
temporal coherence. Our method maintains hairstyle fidelity across frames while
preserving non-hair regions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that HairShifter
achieves state-of-the-art performance in video hairstyle transfer, combining
superior visual quality, temporal consistency, and scalability. The code will
be publicly available. We believe this work will open new avenues for
video-based hairstyle transfer and establish a robust baseline in this field.

*Ruicheng Zhang,Haowei Guo,Kanghui Tian,Jun Zhou,Mingliang Yan,Zeyu Zhang,Shen Zhao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UMIS is crucial for anatomical assessment but struggles due to complexity, addressed by the novel "Mamba Snake" framework, which enhances deep snakes for better organ segmentation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional pixel-based approaches are insufficient for UMIS due to lack of anatomical insights and relational modeling between organs, limiting the ability to handle complex structures.

Method: Mamba Snake employs a hierarchical state space atlas to model inter-organ topology, a vision state space module (MEB) for contour refinement, and a dual-classification synergy mechanism for optimizing detection and segmentation.

Result: Evaluations on five clinical datasets showed Mamba Snake achieved an average Dice improvement of 3% compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: The novel framework effectively bridges gaps in UMIS by incorporating topological modeling, adaptive refinement, and dual-classification strategies, demonstrating significant improvements in segmentation performance.

Abstract: Unified Medical Image Segmentation (UMIS) is critical for comprehensive
anatomical assessment but faces challenges due to multi-scale structural
heterogeneity. Conventional pixel-based approaches, lacking object-level
anatomical insight and inter-organ relational modeling, struggle with
morphological complexity and feature conflicts, limiting their efficacy in
UMIS. We propose Mamba Snake, a novel deep snake framework enhanced by state
space modeling for UMIS. Mamba Snake frames multi-contour evolution as a
hierarchical state space atlas, effectively modeling macroscopic inter-organ
topological relationships and microscopic contour refinements. We introduce a
snake-specific vision state space module, the Mamba Evolution Block (MEB),
which leverages effective spatiotemporal information aggregation for adaptive
refinement of complex morphologies. Energy map shape priors further ensure
robust long-range contour evolution in heterogeneous data. Additionally, a
dual-classification synergy mechanism is incorporated to concurrently optimize
detection and segmentation, mitigating under-segmentation of microstructures in
UMIS. Extensive evaluations across five clinical datasets reveal Mamba Snake's
superior performance, with an average Dice improvement of 3\% over
state-of-the-art methods.

*Hanlei Shi,Leyuan Qu,Yu Liu,Di Gao,Yuhua Zheng,Taihao Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces a framework called Think-Before-Draw, which enhances text-based emotional talking-head video generation by improving the semantic interpretation and fine-grained expressiveness of emotions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the limitations of current text-driven emotional talking-head generation, which relies on predefined discrete emotion labels and fails to capture natural emotional expressiveness.

Method: The proposed Think-Before-Draw framework employs a Chain-of-Thought (CoT) strategy for semantic parsing and a progressive guidance denoising strategy inspired by portrait painting to optimize emotive expressiveness.

Result: The approach achieves state-of-the-art results on benchmarks like MEAD and HDTF and demonstrates zero-shot generation capabilities on a new portrait image dataset.

Conclusion: Think-Before-Draw effectively bridges the gap between textual emotional semantics and natural facial expressiveness, pushing the boundaries of emotional talking-head generation.

Abstract: Emotional talking-head generation has emerged as a pivotal research area at
the intersection of computer vision and multimodal artificial intelligence,
with its core value lying in enhancing human-computer interaction through
immersive and empathetic engagement.With the advancement of multimodal large
language models, the driving signals for emotional talking-head generation has
shifted from audio and video to more flexible text. However, current
text-driven methods rely on predefined discrete emotion label texts,
oversimplifying the dynamic complexity of real facial muscle movements and thus
failing to achieve natural emotional expressiveness.This study proposes the
Think-Before-Draw framework to address two key challenges: (1) In-depth
semantic parsing of emotions--by innovatively introducing Chain-of-Thought
(CoT), abstract emotion labels are transformed into physiologically grounded
facial muscle movement descriptions, enabling the mapping from high-level
semantics to actionable motion features; and (2) Fine-grained expressiveness
optimization--inspired by artists' portrait painting process, a progressive
guidance denoising strategy is proposed, employing a "global emotion
localization--local muscle control" mechanism to refine micro-expression
dynamics in generated videos.Our experiments demonstrate that our approach
achieves state-of-the-art performance on widely-used benchmarks, including MEAD
and HDTF. Additionally, we collected a set of portrait images to evaluate our
model's zero-shot generation capability.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes a framework to improve traffic accident anticipation using generative scene augmentation and adaptive temporal reasoning, coupled with a new benchmark dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The goal is to enhance autonomous driving systems for better traffic accident anticipation. Challenges include limited quality training data and missing object-level cues due to sensor/environmental issues.

Method: The authors deployed a world-model-guided video generation pipeline for enriching edge cases. They also built a dynamic prediction model using strengthened graph convolutions and dilated temporal operators.

Result: The framework showed improved accuracy and lead time of accident predictions, validated through experiments on both public and proprietary datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed framework addresses current deficiencies in safety-critical autonomous driving systems, offering significant advancements in accident anticipation.

Abstract: Reliable anticipation of traffic accidents is essential for advancing
autonomous driving systems. However, this objective is limited by two
fundamental challenges: the scarcity of diverse, high-quality training data and
the frequent absence of crucial object-level cues due to environmental
disruptions or sensor deficiencies. To tackle these issues, we propose a
comprehensive framework combining generative scene augmentation with adaptive
temporal reasoning. Specifically, we develop a video generation pipeline that
utilizes a world model guided by domain-informed prompts to create
high-resolution, statistically consistent driving scenarios, particularly
enriching the coverage of edge cases and complex interactions. In parallel, we
construct a dynamic prediction model that encodes spatio-temporal relationships
through strengthened graph convolutions and dilated temporal operators,
effectively addressing data incompleteness and transient visual noise.
Furthermore, we release a new benchmark dataset designed to better capture
diverse real-world driving risks. Extensive experiments on public and newly
released datasets confirm that our framework enhances both the accuracy and
lead time of accident anticipation, offering a robust solution to current data
and modeling limitations in safety-critical autonomous driving applications.

Conclusion: The results demonstrate the potential for scalable, autonomous UAV systems to conduct extended, real-time marine animal monitoring effectively.

Abstract: This paper introduces an autonomous UAV vision system for continuous,
real-time tracking of marine animals, specifically sharks, in dynamic marine
environments. The system integrates an onboard computer with a stabilised RGB-D
camera and a custom-trained OSTrack pipeline, enabling visual identification
under challenging lighting, occlusion, and sea-state conditions. A key
innovation is the inter-UAV handoff protocol, which enables seamless transfer
of tracking responsibilities between drones, extending operational coverage
beyond single-drone battery limitations. Performance is evaluated on a curated
shark dataset of 5,200 frames, achieving a tracking success rate of 81.9\%
during real-time flight control at 100 Hz, and robustness to occlusion,
illumination variation, and background clutter. We present a seamless UAV
handoff framework, where target transfer is attempted via high-confidence
feature matching, achieving 82.9\% target coverage. These results confirm the
viability of coordinated UAV operations for extended marine tracking and lay
the groundwork for scalable, autonomous monitoring.

*Hengkai Tan,Yao Feng,Xinyi Mao,Shuhe Huang,Guodong Liu,Zhongkai Hao,Hang Su,Jun Zhu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces ATARA and AnyPos to enable scalable data collection and effective learning for vision-language-action models in task-agnostic control.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The reliance of VLA models on task-specific human demonstrations limits scalability and increases data acquisition costs.

Method: The authors propose ATARA, a self-supervised framework for scalable random action collection, and AnyPos, an inverse dynamics model with novel modules like Arm-Decoupled Estimation and Direction-Aware Decoder.

Result: ATARA accelerates data collection by over 30x, and the AnyPos-ATARA pipeline improves test accuracy by 51% and downstream task success rates by 30-40%.

Conclusion: The approach effectively decouples task-specific conditioning from action execution, enabling scalable, efficient, and cost-effective task-agnostic control.

Abstract: Vision-language-action (VLA) models have shown promise on task-conditioned
control in complex settings such as bimanual manipulation. However, the heavy
reliance on task-specific human demonstrations limits their generalization and
incurs high data acquisition costs. In this work, we present a new notion of
task-agnostic action paradigm that decouples action execution from
task-specific conditioning, enhancing scalability, efficiency, and
cost-effectiveness. To address the data collection challenges posed by this
paradigm -- such as low coverage density, behavioral redundancy, and safety
risks -- we introduce ATARA (Automated Task-Agnostic Random Actions), a
scalable self-supervised framework that accelerates collection by over $
30\times $ compared to human teleoperation. To further enable effective
learning from task-agnostic data, which often suffers from distribution
mismatch and irrelevant trajectories, we propose AnyPos, an inverse dynamics
model equipped with Arm-Decoupled Estimation and a Direction-Aware Decoder
(DAD). We additionally integrate a video-conditioned action validation module
to verify the feasibility of learned policies across diverse manipulation
tasks. Extensive experiments show that the AnyPos-ATARA pipeline yields a 51%
improvement in test accuracy and achieves 30-40% higher success rates in
downstream tasks such as lifting, pick-and-place, and clicking, using
replay-based video validation. Project Page:

### [84] [Local Representative Token Guided Merging for Text-to-Image Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12771)
*Min-Jeong Lee,Hee-Dong Kim,Seong-Whan Lee*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces ReToM (local representative token guided merging), which speeds up image generation in Stable Diffusion by merging tokens intelligently using local representative tokens defined per attention window, achieving improved visual quality and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The generation process in Stable Diffusion is slow due to the quadratic complexity of attention operations. Existing token merging approaches have limitations in handling the specific characteristics of attention mechanisms in image generation models.

Method: ReToM defines local boundaries in attention inputs, adjusts window sizes, and selects representative tokens for each window based on their average similarity at a specific timestep. This maintains essential visual information while merging less relevant tokens.

Result: ReToM achieved a 6.2% increase in FID and better CLIP scores compared to the baseline, alongside maintaining an inference time comparable to existing methods.

Conclusion: ReToM effectively enhances the balance between visual quality and computational efficiency in attention-based image generation tasks, making it a practical improvement for Stable Diffusion models.

Abstract: Stable diffusion is an outstanding image generation model for text-to-image,
but its time-consuming generation process remains a challenge due to the
quadratic complexity of attention operations. Recent token merging methods
improve efficiency by reducing the number of tokens during attention
operations, but often overlook the characteristics of attention-based image
generation models, limiting their effectiveness. In this paper, we propose
local representative token guided merging (ReToM), a novel token merging
strategy applicable to any attention mechanism in image generation. To merge
tokens based on various contextual information, ReToM defines local boundaries
as windows within attention inputs and adjusts window sizes. Furthermore, we
introduce a representative token, which represents the most representative
token per window by computing similarity at a specific timestep and selecting
the token with the highest average similarity. This approach preserves the most
salient local features while minimizing computational overhead. Experimental
results show that ReToM achieves a 6.2% improvement in FID and higher CLIP
scores compared to the baseline, while maintaining comparable inference time.
We empirically demonstrate that ReToM is effective in balancing visual quality
and computational efficiency.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces KCR-Transformer, a compact transformer for vision tasks with lower computational costs and improved accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the computational inefficiency of modern vision transformers while maintaining or potentially improving their accuracy.

Method: The KCR-Transformer introduces differentiable channel selection in MLP layers for efficient channel pruning, guided by a strong theoretical generalization bound.

Result: KCR-Transformers reduce FLOPs and parameters in popular transformers like ViT and Swin, achieving superior performance across various computer vision tasks.

Conclusion: KCR-Transformer provides a practical solution for creating efficient vision transformers with rigorous theoretical backing, improving both computational efficiency and prediction accuracy.

Abstract: Self-attention and transformer architectures have become foundational
components in modern deep learning. Recent efforts have integrated transformer
blocks into compact neural architectures for computer vision, giving rise to
various efficient vision transformers. In this work, we introduce Transformer
with Kernel Complexity Reduction, or KCR-Transformer, a compact transformer
block equipped with differentiable channel selection, guided by a novel and
sharp theoretical generalization bound. KCR-Transformer performs input/output
channel selection in the MLP layers of transformer blocks to reduce the
computational cost. Furthermore, we provide a rigorous theoretical analysis
establishing a tight generalization bound for networks equipped with
KCR-Transformer blocks. Leveraging such strong theoretical results, the channel
pruning by KCR-Transformer is conducted in a generalization-aware manner,
ensuring that the resulting network retains a provably small generalization
error. Our KCR-Transformer is compatible with many popular and compact
transformer networks, such as ViT and Swin, and it reduces the FLOPs of the
vision transformers while maintaining or even improving the prediction
accuracy. In the experiments, we replace all the transformer blocks in the
vision transformers with KCR-Transformer blocks, leading to KCR-Transformer
networks with different backbones. The resulting TCR-Transformers achieve
superior performance on various computer vision tasks, achieving even better
performance than the original models with even less FLOPs and parameters.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces 'SVM-City,' a multidomain dataset for outdoor scene understanding, and proposes 'City-VLM,' a vision-language model for multimodal data fusion, showing superior performance in outdoor scene analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the limitations of existing LVLMs, which largely focus on indoor, single-modality scene understanding, making them unsuitable for large-scale, multidomain outdoor environments.

Method: The approach involves creating the SVM-City dataset and developing City-VLM for outdoor scene understanding. City-VLM employs incomplete multimodal learning and constructs a joint probabilistic distribution space for effective multimodal fusion.

Result: City-VLM outperforms existing LVLMs in outdoor scene understanding tasks, showing an 18.14% average improvement in question-answering tasks.

Conclusion: The proposed method and dataset demonstrate effectiveness and generalization for large-scale outdoor scene understanding, outperforming traditional models in practical scenarios.

Abstract: Scene understanding enables intelligent agents to interpret and comprehend
their environment. While existing large vision-language models (LVLMs) for
scene understanding have primarily focused on indoor household tasks, they face
two significant limitations when applied to outdoor large-scale scene
understanding. First, outdoor scenarios typically encompass larger-scale
environments observed through various sensors from multiple viewpoints (e.g.,
bird view and terrestrial view), while existing indoor LVLMs mainly analyze
single visual modalities within building-scale contexts from humanoid
viewpoints. Second, existing LVLMs suffer from missing multidomain perception
outdoor data and struggle to effectively integrate 2D and 3D visual
information. To address the aforementioned limitations, we build the first
multidomain perception outdoor scene understanding dataset, named
\textbf{\underline{SVM-City}}, deriving from multi\textbf{\underline{S}}cale
scenarios with multi\textbf{\underline{V}}iew and
multi\textbf{\underline{M}}odal instruction tuning data. It contains $420$k
images and $4, 811$M point clouds with $567$k question-answering pairs from
vehicles, low-altitude drones, high-altitude aerial planes, and satellite. To
effectively fuse the multimodal data in the absence of one modality, we
introduce incomplete multimodal learning to model outdoor scene understanding
and design the LVLM named \textbf{\underline{City-VLM}}. Multimodal fusion is
realized by constructing a joint probabilistic distribution space rather than
implementing directly explicit fusion operations (e.g., concatenation).
Experimental results on three typical outdoor scene understanding tasks show
City-VLM achieves $18.14 \%$ performance surpassing existing LVLMs in
question-answering tasks averagely. Our method demonstrates pragmatic and
generalization performance across multiple outdoor scenes.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods struggle to accurately assess document quality, limiting their practical application in fields like digitization and archival.

Method: DeQA-Doc adapts the MLLM-based image quality scorer, DeQA-Score, for documents using soft label strategies and resolution flexibility, while also incorporating ensemble techniques.

Result: DeQA-Doc provides accurate and generalizable quality scores for document images, outperforming existing baseline approaches across various degradation scenarios.

Conclusion: DeQA-Doc represents a significant advancement in document quality assessment, leveraging MLLMs and ensemble methods to achieve superior performance. The code and models are also made publicly available.

Abstract: Document quality assessment is critical for a wide range of applications
including document digitization, OCR, and archival. However, existing
approaches often struggle to provide accurate and robust quality scores,
limiting their applicability in practical scenarios. With the rapid progress in
Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs), recent MLLM-based methods have
achieved remarkable performance in image quality assessment. In this work, we
extend this success to the document domain by adapting DeQA-Score, a
state-of-the-art MLLM-based image quality scorer, for document quality
assessment. We propose DeQA-Doc, a framework that leverages the visual language
capabilities of MLLMs and a soft label strategy to regress continuous document
quality scores. To adapt DeQA-Score to DeQA-Doc, we adopt two complementary
solutions to construct soft labels without the variance information. Also, we
relax the resolution constrains to support the large resolution of document
images. Finally, we introduce ensemble methods to further enhance the
performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DeQA-Doc significantly
outperforms existing baselines, offering accurate and generalizable document
quality assessment across diverse degradation types. Codes and model weights

*Yufei Peng,Yonggang Zhang,Yiu-ming Cheung*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces 'Sage', a semantic-guided fine-tuning approach for long-tailed visual recognition leveraging foundation models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address degraded performance in less frequent classes in long-tailed learning using foundation models.

Method: Proposing Semantic-guided fine-tuning with SG-Adapter to strengthen visual-text alignment and introducing a distribution mismatch-aware compensation factor to rectify prediction bias in loss functions.

Result: Experiments on benchmark datasets validate the proposed system's effectiveness in improving performance for long-tailed learning.

Conclusion: Sage demonstrates improved visual recognition performance for classes with fewer samples, overcoming limitations of existing methods.

Abstract: The variance in class-wise sample sizes within long-tailed scenarios often
results in degraded performance in less frequent classes. Fortunately,
foundation models, pre-trained on vast open-world datasets, demonstrate strong
potential for this task due to their generalizable representation, which
promotes the development of adaptive strategies on pre-trained models in
long-tailed learning. Advanced fine-tuning methods typically adjust visual
encoders while neglecting the semantics derived from the frozen text encoder,
overlooking the visual and textual alignment. To strengthen this alignment, we
propose a novel approach, Semantic-guided fine-tuning of foundation model for
long-tailed visual recognition (Sage), which incorporates semantic guidance
derived from textual modality into the visual fine-tuning process.
Specifically, we introduce an SG-Adapter that integrates class descriptions as
semantic guidance to guide the fine-tuning of the visual encoder. The
introduced guidance is passesed through the attention mechanism and enables the
model to focus more on semantically relevant content, strengthening the
alignment between the visual and textual modalities. Due to the inconsistent
class-conditional distributions neglected by the existing loss function, the
resulting prediction bias causes performance improvements for the tail class
less than for the head class, even when the multi-modal alignment is enhanced.
To address this challenge, we propose a novel distribution mismatch-aware
compensation factor, which is specifically designed to rectify the prediction
bias caused by the ignored inconsistent distribution based on our theoretical
analysis, and is seamlessly integrated into the loss function. Extensive
experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed
Sage in enhancing performance in long-tailed learning.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces 'FIQ,' a novel method for Video Question Answering (VQA) that enhances reasoning and context understanding by generating fundamental question-answer pairs based on scene descriptions from videos.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While existing VQA methods rely heavily on question-answer pairs and focus narrowly on event-centric annotations, they fail to capture the broader scene context essential for higher-level reasoning.

Method: The authors propose FIQ, which generates question-answer pairs from video scene descriptions, enriching the dataset and improving contextual understanding. Additionally, they introduce a VQ-CAlign module to integrate task-specific question embeddings with visual features.

Result: Their FIQ approach achieves state-of-the-art results on the SUTD-TrafficQA dataset, outperforming existing baseline methods.

Conclusion: The proposed FIQ method significantly improves reasoning and generalization in VQA tasks by incorporating fundamental scene information and aligning question embeddings with relevant visual features, making it adaptable for downstream tasks.

Abstract: Video question answering (VQA) is a multimodal task that requires the
interpretation of a video to answer a given question. Existing VQA methods
primarily utilize question and answer (Q&A) pairs to learn the spatio-temporal
characteristics of video content. However, these annotations are typically
event-centric, which is not enough to capture the broader context of each
video. The absence of essential details such as object types, spatial layouts,
and descriptive attributes restricts the model to learning only a fragmented
scene representation. This issue limits the model's capacity for generalization
and higher-level reasoning. In this paper, we propose a fundamental question
generation with the integration of question embeddings for video question
answering (FIQ), a novel approach designed to strengthen the reasoning ability
of the model by enhancing the fundamental understanding of videos. FIQ
generates Q&A pairs based on descriptions extracted from videos, enriching the
training data with fundamental scene information. Generated Q&A pairs enable
the model to understand the primary context, leading to enhanced
generalizability and reasoning ability. Furthermore, we incorporate a VQ-CAlign
module that assists task-specific question embeddings with visual features,
ensuring that essential domain-specific details are preserved to increase the
adaptability of downstream tasks. Experiments on SUTD-TrafficQA demonstrate
that our FIQ achieves state-of-the-art performance compared to existing
baseline methods.

Method: MCoT-RE employs a two-phase approach: generating captions for textual and integrated visual-textual contexts, followed by re-ranking candidates using these captions and the reference image.

Result: MCoT-RE outperformed existing training-free methods, with Recall@10 improvements of up to 6.24% on FashionIQ and Recall@1 improvements of up to 8.58% on CIRR.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively addresses limitations of prior methods by balancing textual modifications and visual context, achieving enhanced retrieval precision.

Abstract: Composed Image Retrieval (CIR) is the task of retrieving a target image from
a gallery using a composed query consisting of a reference image and a
modification text. Among various CIR approaches, training-free zero-shot
methods based on pre-trained models are cost-effective but still face notable
limitations. For example, sequential VLM-LLM pipelines process each modality
independently, which often results in information loss and limits cross-modal
interaction. In contrast, methods based on multimodal large language models
(MLLMs) often focus exclusively on applying changes indicated by the text,
without fully utilizing the contextual visual information from the reference
image. To address these issues, we propose multi-faceted Chain-of-Thought with
re-ranking (MCoT-RE), a training-free zero-shot CIR framework. MCoT-RE utilizes
multi-faceted Chain-of-Thought to guide the MLLM to balance explicit
modifications and contextual visual cues, generating two distinct captions: one
focused on modification and the other integrating comprehensive visual-textual
context. The first caption is used to filter candidate images. Subsequently, we
combine these two captions and the reference image to perform multi-grained
re-ranking. This two-stage approach facilitates precise retrieval by aligning
with the textual modification instructions while preserving the visual context
of the reference image. Through extensive experiments, MCoT-RE achieves
state-of-the-art results among training-free methods, yielding improvements of
up to 6.24% in Recall@10 on FashionIQ and 8.58% in Recall@1 on CIRR.

*Jeong-Woo Park,Young-Eun Kim,Seong-Whan Lee*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces FAR-Net, a multi-stage fusion framework for composed image retrieval (CIR), aiming to improve semantic alignment and adaptiveness in vision-language tasks. It achieves higher performance compared to state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing CIR methods either focus excessively on textual details (early fusion) or fail to capture fine-grained semantic alignments between image regions and textual tokens (late fusion).

Method: The proposed FAR-Net combines two modules: enhanced semantic alignment module (ESAM) which utilizes late fusion with cross-attention for fine-grained relationships, and adaptive reconciliation module (ARM) which uses early fusion with uncertainty embeddings to improve robustness.

Result: FAR-Net enhances CIR performance on CIRR and FashionIQ datasets, showing up to 2.4% improvement in Recall@1 and 1.04% in Recall@50 compared to previous methods.

Conclusion: FAR-Net demonstrates its effectiveness as a robust and scalable solution for CIR tasks, addressing limitations of existing methods.

Abstract: Composed image retrieval (CIR) is a vision language task that retrieves a
target image using a reference image and modification text, enabling intuitive
specification of desired changes. While effectively fusing visual and textual
modalities is crucial, existing methods typically adopt either early or late
fusion. Early fusion tends to excessively focus on explicitly mentioned textual
details and neglect visual context, whereas late fusion struggles to capture
fine-grained semantic alignments between image regions and textual tokens. To
address these issues, we propose FAR-Net, a multi-stage fusion framework
designed with enhanced semantic alignment and adaptive reconciliation,
integrating two complementary modules. The enhanced semantic alignment module
(ESAM) employs late fusion with cross-attention to capture fine-grained
semantic relationships, while the adaptive reconciliation module (ARM) applies
early fusion with uncertainty embeddings to enhance robustness and
adaptability. Experiments on CIRR and FashionIQ show consistent performance
gains, improving Recall@1 by up to 2.4% and Recall@50 by 1.04% over existing
state-of-the-art methods, empirically demonstrating that FAR Net provides a
robust and scalable solution to CIR tasks.

conditions, designed to capture motion entanglement where both camera and
targets move freely in 3D; (2) SO-HOTA, a novel metric combining Dot Distance
with HOTA to mitigate the sensitivity of IoU-based metrics to small
displacements; and (3) a competitive MVA2025 challenge with 78 participants and
308 submissions, where the winning method achieved a 5.1x improvement over the
baseline. This work lays a foundation for advancing SMOT in UAV scenarios with
applications in bird strike avoidance, agriculture, fisheries, and ecological
monitoring.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing captioning models lack fine-grained control and reliable evaluation methods, which limits their effectiveness in aligning multimodal content and following instructions.

Method: The paper presents the AnyCapModel (ACM), a plug-and-play framework enhancing captioning without retraining base models, alongside a new dataset (ACD) and evaluation benchmark (AnyCapEval).

Result: ACM significantly improved content and style scores across various base models, with notable gains highlighted for GPT-4o as well as performance on common benchmarks like MIA-Bench and VidCapBench.

Conclusion: The proposed solutions (ACM, ACD, and AnyCapEval) successfully address gaps in controllable multimodal captioning by enhancing caption quality and introducing better tools for evaluation.

Abstract: Controllable captioning is essential for precise multimodal alignment and
instruction following, yet existing models often lack fine-grained control and
reliable evaluation protocols. To address this gap, we present the AnyCap
Project, an integrated solution spanning model, dataset, and evaluation. We
introduce AnyCapModel (ACM), a lightweight plug-and-play framework that
enhances the controllability of existing foundation models for omni-modal
captioning without retraining the base model. ACM reuses the original captions
from base models while incorporating user instructions and modality features to
generate improved captions. To remedy the data scarcity in controllable
multimodal captioning, we build AnyCapDataset (ACD), covering three modalities,
28 user-instruction types, and 300\,k high-quality data entries. We further
propose AnyCapEval, a new benchmark that provides more reliable evaluation
metrics for controllable captioning by decoupling content accuracy and
stylistic fidelity. ACM markedly improves caption quality across a diverse set
of base models on AnyCapEval. Notably, ACM-8B raises GPT-4o\'s content scores
by 45\% and style scores by 12\%, and it also achieves substantial gains on
widely used benchmarks such as MIA-Bench and VidCapBench.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces an attention-refocusing scheme (SRE) to improve domain generalization with CLIP by aligning its attention maps across simulated domain shifts, achieving better performance compared to state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CLIP struggles with focusing on domain-invariant regions across domains, leading to suboptimal performance on unseen target domains. The work addresses this limitation in domain generalization.

Method: The proposed approach, Simulate, Refocus, and Ensemble (SRE), simulates domain shifts via data augmentation, aligns attention maps in CLIP between source and simulated target domains, and employs ensemble learning to strengthen domain-invariant focus.

Result: The introduced method (SRE) demonstrates superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods in domain generalization across diverse datasets.

Conclusion: The attention-refocusing approach improves CLIP's ability to handle unseen domains by addressing domain shifts through attention map alignment, achieving promising results on domain generalization tasks.

Abstract: Domain generalization (DG) aims to learn a model from source domains and
apply it to unseen target domains with out-of-distribution data. Owing to
CLIP's strong ability to encode semantic concepts, it has attracted increasing
interest in domain generalization. However, CLIP often struggles to focus on
task-relevant regions across domains, i.e., domain-invariant regions, resulting
in suboptimal performance on unseen target domains. To address this challenge,
we propose an attention-refocusing scheme, called Simulate, Refocus and
Ensemble (SRE), which learns to reduce the domain shift by aligning the
attention maps in CLIP via attention refocusing. SRE first simulates domain
shifts by performing augmentation on the source data to generate simulated
target domains. SRE then learns to reduce the domain shifts by refocusing the
attention in CLIP between the source and simulated target domains. Finally, SRE
utilizes ensemble learning to enhance the ability to capture domain-invariant
attention maps between the source data and the simulated target data. Extensive
experimental results on several datasets demonstrate that SRE generally
achieves better results than state-of-the-art methods. The code is available

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome challenges in robustness, generalization, and efficiency in learning-based monocular visual odometry systems.

Method: DINO-VO utilizes DINOv2 for sparse feature matching, incorporates a salient keypoints detector, combines robust-semantic with fine-grained geometric features, uses a transformer-based matcher, and employs a differentiable pose estimation layer.

Result: The system achieves high accuracy and robustness in challenging environments, surpassing prior VO methods on TartanAir and KITTI datasets, and competing effectively on EuRoC dataset, with efficient performance under constrained hardware resources.

Conclusion: DINO-VO advances the state-of-the-art in visual odometry and demonstrates potential scalability in robotics applications, showcasing better robustness, accuracy, and generalization capabilities.

Abstract: Learning-based monocular visual odometry (VO) poses robustness,
generalization, and efficiency challenges in robotics. Recent advances in
visual foundation models, such as DINOv2, have improved robustness and
generalization in various vision tasks, yet their integration in VO remains
limited due to coarse feature granularity. In this paper, we present DINO-VO, a
feature-based VO system leveraging DINOv2 visual foundation model for its
sparse feature matching. To address the integration challenge, we propose a
salient keypoints detector tailored to DINOv2's coarse features. Furthermore,
we complement DINOv2's robust-semantic features with fine-grained geometric
features, resulting in more localizable representations. Finally, a
transformer-based matcher and differentiable pose estimation layer enable
precise camera motion estimation by learning good matches. Against prior
detector-descriptor networks like SuperPoint, DINO-VO demonstrates greater
robustness in challenging environments. Furthermore, we show superior accuracy
and generalization of the proposed feature descriptors against standalone
DINOv2 coarse features. DINO-VO outperforms prior frame-to-frame VO methods on
the TartanAir and KITTI datasets and is competitive on EuRoC dataset, while
running efficiently at 72 FPS with less than 1GB of memory usage on a single
GPU. Moreover, it performs competitively against Visual SLAM systems on outdoor
driving scenarios, showcasing its generalization capabilities.

TL;DR: The paper proposes SCORE, a new framework for open-vocabulary remote sensing instance segmentation, addressing challenges in handling novel categories and diverse datasets through multi-granularity scene context.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for remote sensing instance segmentation are limited to close-vocabulary predictions, which restrict their ability to generalize to novel categories or datasets in Earth observation scenarios.

Method: The proposed method, SCORE, leverages multi-granularity scene context, including Region-Aware Integration to refine class embeddings with regional context and Global Context Adaptation to enrich text embeddings with remote sensing global context.

Result: SCORE achieves state-of-the-art performance in open-vocabulary remote sensing instance segmentation across diverse datasets, providing a robust solution.

Conclusion: This framework demonstrates significant improvements in handling diverse challenges faced in geospatial analysis, establishing new benchmarks for open-vocabulary segmentation methods in remote sensing.

Abstract: Most existing remote sensing instance segmentation approaches are designed
for close-vocabulary prediction, limiting their ability to recognize novel
categories or generalize across datasets. This restricts their applicability in
diverse Earth observation scenarios. To address this, we introduce
open-vocabulary (OV) learning for remote sensing instance segmentation. While
current OV segmentation models perform well on natural image datasets, their
direct application to remote sensing faces challenges such as diverse
landscapes, seasonal variations, and the presence of small or ambiguous objects
in aerial imagery. To overcome these challenges, we propose $\textbf{SCORE}$
($\textbf{S}$cene $\textbf{C}$ontext matters in $\textbf{O}$pen-vocabulary
$\textbf{RE}$mote sensing instance segmentation), a framework that integrates
multi-granularity scene context, i.e., regional context and global context, to
enhance both visual and textual representations. Specifically, we introduce
Region-Aware Integration, which refines class embeddings with regional context
to improve object distinguishability. Additionally, we propose Global Context
Adaptation, which enriches naive text embeddings with remote sensing global
context, creating a more adaptable and expressive linguistic latent space for
the classifier. We establish new benchmarks for OV remote sensing instance
segmentation across diverse datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that,
our proposed method achieves SOTA performance, which provides a robust solution
for large-scale, real-world geospatial analysis. Our code is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces SE-VLN, a novel framework enabling self-evolving vision-language navigation (VLN) agents, achieving significant performance improvements over state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While large language models (LLMs) have advanced VLN with better generalization in instruction understanding, they lack the ability to incorporate experiential knowledge and evolve efficiently in new scenarios.

Method: The SE-VLN framework comprises three components: a hierarchical memory module (to turn cases into reusable knowledge), a retrieval-augmented reasoning module (enabling decision-making using past experiences), and a reflection module (for continual evolution during testing).

Result: The framework achieved navigation success rates of 57% (R2R dataset) and 35.2% (REVERSE dataset), with performance improvements of 23.9% and 15.0% over state-of-the-art methods, respectively. Additionally, performance improved with the expansion of the experience repository.

Conclusion: SE-VLN demonstrates great potential for making VLN agents more adaptive and achieving higher efficiency via self-evolution, bridging limitations of fixed-knowledge LLM approaches.

Abstract: Recent advances in vision-language navigation (VLN) were mainly attributed to
emerging large language models (LLMs). These methods exhibited excellent
generalization capabilities in instruction understanding and task reasoning.
However, they were constrained by the fixed knowledge bases and reasoning
abilities of LLMs, preventing fully incorporating experiential knowledge and
thus resulting in a lack of efficient evolutionary capacity. To address this,
we drew inspiration from the evolution capabilities of natural agents, and
proposed a self-evolving VLN framework (SE-VLN) to endow VLN agents with the
ability to continuously evolve during testing. To the best of our knowledge, it
was the first time that an multimodal LLM-powered self-evolving VLN framework
was proposed. Specifically, SE-VLN comprised three core modules, i.e., a
hierarchical memory module to transfer successful and failure cases into
reusable knowledge, a retrieval-augmented thought-based reasoning module to
retrieve experience and enable multi-step decision-making, and a reflection
module to realize continual evolution. Comprehensive tests illustrated that the
SE-VLN achieved navigation success rates of 57% and 35.2% in unseen
environments, representing absolute performance improvements of 23.9% and 15.0%
over current state-of-the-art methods on R2R and REVERSE datasets,
respectively. Moreover, the SE-VLN showed performance improvement with
increasing experience repository, elucidating its great potential as a
self-evolving agent framework for VLN.

TL;DR: The paper introduces $S^2M^2$, a new global matching architecture for stereo matching that balances accuracy and efficiency without dataset-specific tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To resolve the limitations of existing stereo matching methods that either struggle with generalization due to local mechanisms or have impractical computational costs in global approaches.

Method: $S^2M^2$ uses a multi-resolution transformer for long-range correspondence and a novel loss function to focus on feasible matches, achieving robust disparity, occlusion, and confidence estimation.

Result: $S^2M^2$ achieves a new state-of-the-art performance on Middlebury v3 and ETH3D benchmarks, with superior detail reconstruction and competitive efficiency.

Conclusion: This architecture bridges the gap between accuracy, efficiency, and generalization in stereo matching by overcoming previous trade-offs through innovative design.

Abstract: The pursuit of a generalizable stereo matching model, capable of performing
across varying resolutions and disparity ranges without dataset-specific
fine-tuning, has revealed a fundamental trade-off. Iterative local search
methods achieve high scores on constrained benchmarks, but their core mechanism
inherently limits the global consistency required for true generalization. On
the other hand, global matching architectures, while theoretically more robust,
have been historically rendered infeasible by prohibitive computational and
memory costs. We resolve this dilemma with $S^2M^2$: a global matching
architecture that achieves both state-of-the-art accuracy and high efficiency
without relying on cost volume filtering or deep refinement stacks. Our design
integrates a multi-resolution transformer for robust long-range correspondence,
trained with a novel loss function that concentrates probability on feasible
matches. This approach enables a more robust joint estimation of disparity,
occlusion, and confidence. $S^2M^2$ establishes a new state of the art on the
Middlebury v3 and ETH3D benchmarks, significantly outperforming prior methods
across most metrics while reconstructing high-quality details with competitive
efficiency.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces HRSeg, a model designed for reasoning segmentation tasks that overcomes limitations in perceptual resolution using High-Resolution Perception (HRP) and High-Resolution Enhancement (HRE) modules.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The work is motivated by the need to enhance perceptual resolution in visual encoders for reasoning segmentation tasks, as existing methods are limited by low perceptual resolution and have high computational costs.

Method: The proposed method includes two main components: HRP, which processes high-resolution images using cropping and feature integration, and HRE, which aligns high-resolution mask features with text features for precise segmentation.

Result: Through extensive experiments and ablation studies, HRSeg demonstrates superior performance and validates the efficacy of its modules across multiple benchmark datasets.

Conclusion: HRSeg addresses the perceptual resolution limitations of existing approaches, offering an efficient solution with improved segmentation accuracy through its innovative high-resolution modules.

Abstract: The reasoning segmentation task involves segmenting objects within an image
by interpreting implicit user instructions, which may encompass subtleties such
as contextual cues and open-world knowledge. Despite significant advancements
made by existing approaches, they remain constrained by low perceptual
resolution, as visual encoders are typically pre-trained at lower resolutions.
Furthermore, simply interpolating the positional embeddings of visual encoders
to enhance perceptual resolution yields only marginal performance improvements
while incurring substantial computational costs. To address this, we propose
HRSeg, an efficient model with high-resolution fine-grained perception. It
features two key innovations: High-Resolution Perception (HRP) and
High-Resolution Enhancement (HRE). The HRP module processes high-resolution
images through cropping, integrating local and global features for
multi-granularity quality. The HRE module enhances mask features by integrating
fine-grained information from high-resolution images, refining their alignment
with text features for precise segmentation. Extensive ablation studies
validate the effectiveness of our modules, while comprehensive experiments on
multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate HRSeg's superior performance.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VITA is a novel Vision-To-Action flow matching policy that simplifies visuomotor control by mapping visual inputs to actions directly without additional conditioning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to simplify and enhance visuomotor control models by eliminating separate conditioning mechanisms and reducing resources like time and complexity.

Method: VITA creates a structured latent space via an autoencoder, up-samples actions, and learns mapping end-to-end using flow latent decoding with simple MLP layers.

Result: VITA outperforms or matches state-of-the-art policies in bi-manual manipulation tasks, while significantly reducing inference latency by 50-130%.

Conclusion: VITA demonstrates the feasibility of an MLP-only flow matching policy for complex visuomotor tasks, achieving competitive performance efficiently.

Abstract: We present VITA, a Vision-To-Action flow matching policy that evolves latent
visual representations into latent actions for visuomotor control. Traditional
flow matching and diffusion policies sample from standard source distributions
(e.g., Gaussian noise) and require additional conditioning mechanisms like
cross-attention to condition action generation on visual information, creating
time and space overheads. VITA proposes a novel paradigm that treats latent
images as the flow source, learning an inherent mapping from vision to action
while eliminating separate conditioning modules and preserving generative
modeling capabilities. Learning flows between fundamentally different
modalities like vision and action is challenging due to sparse action data
lacking semantic structures and dimensional mismatches between high-dimensional
visual representations and raw actions. We address this by creating a
structured action latent space via an autoencoder as the flow matching target,
up-sampling raw actions to match visual representation shapes. Crucially, we
supervise flow matching with both encoder targets and final action outputs
through flow latent decoding, which backpropagates action reconstruction loss
through sequential flow matching ODE solving steps for effective end-to-end
learning. Implemented as simple MLP layers, VITA is evaluated on challenging
bi-manual manipulation tasks on the ALOHA platform, including 5 simulation and
2 real-world tasks. Despite its simplicity, MLP-only VITA outperforms or
matches state-of-the-art generative policies while reducing inference latency
by 50-130% compared to conventional flow matching policies requiring different
conditioning mechanisms or complex architectures. To our knowledge, VITA is the
first MLP-only flow matching policy capable of solving complex bi-manual
manipulation tasks like those in ALOHA benchmarks.

Method: It employs multi-channel bio-impedance sensing, soft electrodes, and a deep learning model integrating anatomical priors for robust head pose estimation.

Result: NeckSense achieves a mean per-vertex error of 25.9 mm across head movements, on par with SOTA vision-based methods, validated with a leave-one-person-out approach.

Conclusion: NeckSense demonstrates the feasibility of a wearable, line-of-sight-free alternative to vision-based head pose tracking systems with comparable accuracy.

Abstract: We present NeckSense, a novel wearable system for head pose tracking that
leverages multi-channel bio-impedance sensing with soft, dry electrodes
embedded in a lightweight, necklace-style form factor. NeckSense captures
dynamic changes in tissue impedance around the neck, which are modulated by
head rotations and subtle muscle activations. To robustly estimate head pose,
we propose a deep learning framework that integrates anatomical priors,
including joint constraints and natural head rotation ranges, into the loss
function design. We validate NeckSense on 7 participants using the current SOTA
pose estimation model as ground truth. Our system achieves a mean per-vertex
error of 25.9 mm across various head movements with a leave-one-person-out
cross-validation method, demonstrating that a compact, line-of-sight-free
bio-impedance wearable can deliver head-tracking performance comparable to SOTA
vision-based methods.

### [106] [Camera-based implicit mind reading by capturing higher-order semantic dynamics of human gaze within environmental context](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12889)
*Mengke Song,Yuge Xie,Qi Cui,Luming Li,Xinyu Liu,Guotao Wang,Chenglizhao Chen,Shanchen Pang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel, unobtrusive emotion recognition method using gaze fixation patterns combined with environmental context and temporal dynamics, leveraging standard HD cameras.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current emotion recognition methods relying on explicit signals or physiological sensors fail to capture deeper emotions due to their limitations in natural behavior and scalability.

Method: Using HD cameras, the proposed method extracts gaze trajectories and integrates visual attention with environmental semantics and temporal dynamics for emotion recognition.

Result: The approach achieves real-time, continuous emotion recognition without specialized hardware, enabling high generalizability at low deployment costs.

Conclusion: Emotions are shown to be complex outcomes of interactions between humans and their environments, achievable through a scalable, camera-based and user-unaware method.

Abstract: Emotion recognition,as a step toward mind reading,seeks to infer internal
states from external cues.Most existing methods rely on explicit signals-such
as facial expressions,speech,or gestures-that reflect only bodily responses and
overlook the influence of environmental context.These cues are often
voluntary,easy to mask,and insufficient for capturing deeper,implicit emotions.
Physiological signal-based approaches offer more direct access to internal
states but require complex sensors that compromise natural behavior and limit
scalability.Gaze-based methods typically rely on static fixation analysis and
fail to capture the rich,dynamic interactions between gaze and the
environment,and thus cannot uncover the deep connection between emotion and
implicit behavior.To address these limitations,we propose a novel
camera-based,user-unaware emotion recognition approach that integrates gaze
fixation patterns with environmental semantics and temporal dynamics.Leveraging
standard HD cameras,our method unobtrusively captures users'eye appearance and
head movements in natural settings-without the need for specialized hardware or
active user participation.From these visual cues,the system estimates gaze
trajectories over time and space, providing the basis for modeling the spatial,
semantic,and temporal dimensions of gaze behavior. This allows us to capture
the dynamic interplay between visual attention and the surrounding
environment,revealing that emotions are not merely physiological responses but
complex outcomes of human-environment interactions.The proposed approach
enables user-unaware,real-time,and continuous emotion recognition,offering high
generalizability and low deployment cost.

*Yin Wu,Daniel Slieter,Ahmed Abouelazm,Christian Hubschneider,J. Marius Zöllner*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces LanePerf, a system for estimating the robustness of lane detection models without ground-truth labels, outperforming baseline methods and addressing domain shifts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Collecting and annotating target domain data to ensure lane detection model robustness is resource-intensive. Performance estimation without ground-truth labels is a promising but underexplored solution.

Method: The authors adapt five performance estimation methods from image classification to lane detection and propose LanePerf, which integrates image and lane features using a pretrained image encoder and DeepSets-based architecture.

Result: LanePerf outperforms baseline methods, achieving a lower Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 0.117 and a higher Spearman correlation coefficient of 0.727 on the OpenLane dataset.

Conclusion: LanePerf provides a robust, label-free approach to performance estimation in lane detection, aiding in improved safety and efficiency for Automated Driving Systems and Advanced Driver-Assistance Systems.

Abstract: Lane detection is a critical component of Advanced Driver-Assistance Systems
(ADAS) and Automated Driving System (ADS), providing essential spatial
information for lateral control. However, domain shifts often undermine model
reliability when deployed in new environments. Ensuring the robustness and
safety of lane detection models typically requires collecting and annotating
target domain data, which is resource-intensive. Estimating model performance
without ground-truth labels offers a promising alternative for efficient
robustness assessment, yet remains underexplored in lane detection. While
previous work has addressed performance estimation in image classification,
these methods are not directly applicable to lane detection tasks. This paper
first adapts five well-performing performance estimation methods from image
classification to lane detection, building a baseline. Addressing the
limitations of prior approaches that solely rely on softmax scores or lane
features, we further propose a new Lane Performance Estimation Framework
(LanePerf), which integrates image and lane features using a pretrained image
encoder and a DeepSets-based architecture, effectively handling zero-lane
detection scenarios and large domain-shift cases. Extensive experiments on the
OpenLane dataset, covering diverse domain shifts (scenes, weather, hours),
demonstrate that our LanePerf outperforms all baselines, achieving a lower MAE
of 0.117 and a higher Spearman's rank correlation coefficient of 0.727. These
findings pave the way for robust, label-free performance estimation in ADAS,
supporting more efficient testing and improved safety in challenging driving
scenarios.

*Shreyansh Jain,Koteswar Rao Jerripothula*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces a novel image classification dataset for Federated Learning and proposes two new Federated Learning algorithms, Fed-Cyclic and Fed-Star, both of which outperform existing baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for privacy-preserving machine learning frameworks motivates this work. A lack of Federated Learning-specific datasets for image classification also drives the authors to contribute a new dataset and methods.

Method: The authors created a dataset of 23,326 images from eight sources, classified into 31 categories. They developed Fed-Cyclic and Fed-Star algorithms with cyclic and star-like weight-sharing topologies, respectively.

Result: The new Federated Learning algorithms, Fed-Cyclic and Fed-Star, demonstrated improved performance over existing baselines when evaluated on the proposed image dataset.

Conclusion: The paper advances Federated Learning by offering a dataset specifically designed for the paradigm and introducing two algorithms that boost performance in federated image classification.

Abstract: Federated Learning is a collaborative machine learning paradigm that enables
multiple clients to learn a global model without exposing their data to each
other. Consequently, it provides a secure learning platform with
privacy-preserving capabilities. This paper introduces a new dataset containing
23,326 images collected from eight different commercial sources and classified
into 31 categories, similar to the Office-31 dataset. To the best of our
knowledge, this is the first image classification dataset specifically designed
for Federated Learning. We also propose two new Federated Learning algorithms,
namely Fed-Cyclic and Fed-Star. In Fed-Cyclic, a client receives weights from
its previous client, updates them through local training, and passes them to
the next client, thus forming a cyclic topology. In Fed-Star, a client receives
weights from all other clients, updates its local weights through
pre-aggregation (to address statistical heterogeneity) and local training, and
sends its updated local weights to all other clients, thus forming a star-like
topology. Our experiments reveal that both algorithms perform better than
existing baselines on our newly introduced dataset.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces AthleticsPose, a dataset for improving 3D pose estimation in sports, achieving a 75% reduction in MPJPE when using real sports motion data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome challenges in using monocular 3D pose estimation for sports analysis, specifically the lack of realistic datasets and unclear accuracy for sports applications.

Method: The researchers created AthleticsPose, a dataset based on real sports motions, trained 3D pose estimation models, and conducted evaluations including performance comparisons, view, and scale sensitivity analysis.

Result: The model trained on AthleticsPose outperformed baseline models trained on artificial datasets, reducing MPJPE by 75%, while also showing sensitivity to camera angles and subject scales.

Conclusion: The use of realistic motion data significantly enhances model performance though practical limitations remain, especially for high-speed metrics in kinematic analysis.

Abstract: Monocular 3D pose estimation is a promising, flexible alternative to costly
motion capture systems for sports analysis. However, its practical application
is hindered by two factors: a lack of realistic sports datasets and unclear
reliability for sports tasks. To address these challenges, we introduce the
AthleticsPose dataset, a new public dataset featuring ``real'' motions captured
from 23 athletes performing various athletics events on an athletic field.
Using this dataset, we trained a representative 3D pose estimation model and
performed a comprehensive evaluation. Our results show that the model trained
on AthleticsPose significantly outperforms a baseline model trained on an
imitated sports motion dataset, reducing MPJPE by approximately 75 %. These
results show the importance of training on authentic sports motion data, as
models based on imitated motions do not effectively transfer to real-world
motions. Further analysis reveals that estimation accuracy is sensitive to
camera view and subject scale. In case studies of kinematic indicators, the
model demonstrated the potential to capture individual differences in knee
angles but struggled with higher-speed metrics, such as knee-drive velocity,
due to prediction biases. This work provides the research community with a
valuable dataset and clarifies the potential and practical limitations of using
monocular 3D pose estimation for sports motion analysis. Our dataset, code, and
checkpoints are available at https://github.com/SZucchini/AthleticsPose.

### [110] [Argus: Leveraging Multiview Images for Improved 3-D Scene Understanding With Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12916)
*Yifan Xu,Chao Zhang,Hanqi Jiang,Xiaoyan Wang,Ruifei Ma,Yiwei Li,Zihao Wu,Zeju Li,Xiangde Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper presents Argus, a 3D multimodal framework combining multi-view images and 3D point clouds to enhance 3D scene understanding using Large Language Models (LLMs).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Motivated by the limitations of 3D point clouds, such as missing textureless planes, repetitive patterns, and distorted complex objects, the authors aim to utilize 2D multi-view images to compensate for these deficiencies and improve 3D scene understanding for LLMs.

Method: The Argus framework fuses multi-view images with camera poses into view-as-scene features and integrates them with 3D point cloud features to create detailed 3D-aware scene embeddings, enabling LLMs to better understand 3D environments.

Result: Extensive experiments show that Argus outperforms existing 3D-LMMs in various downstream tasks, demonstrating its effectiveness in addressing limitations of point cloud reconstruction.

Conclusion: Argus provides a robust solution to compensate for the shortcomings of 3D point clouds and enhances the 3D task-solving capability of LLMs through multimodal integration of images and point clouds.

Abstract: Advancements in foundation models have made it possible to conduct
applications in various downstream tasks. Especially, the new era has witnessed
a remarkable capability to extend Large Language Models (LLMs) for tackling
tasks of 3D scene understanding. Current methods rely heavily on 3D point
clouds, but the 3D point cloud reconstruction of an indoor scene often results
in information loss. Some textureless planes or repetitive patterns are prone
to omission and manifest as voids within the reconstructed 3D point clouds.
Besides, objects with complex structures tend to introduce distortion of
details caused by misalignments between the captured images and the dense
reconstructed point clouds. 2D multi-view images present visual consistency
with 3D point clouds and provide more detailed representations of scene
components, which can naturally compensate for these deficiencies. Based on
these insights, we propose Argus, a novel 3D multimodal framework that
leverages multi-view images for enhanced 3D scene understanding with LLMs. In
general, Argus can be treated as a 3D Large Multimodal Foundation Model
(3D-LMM) since it takes various modalities as input(text instructions, 2D
multi-view images, and 3D point clouds) and expands the capability of LLMs to
tackle 3D tasks. Argus involves fusing and integrating multi-view images and
camera poses into view-as-scene features, which interact with the 3D features
to create comprehensive and detailed 3D-aware scene embeddings. Our approach
compensates for the information loss while reconstructing 3D point clouds and
helps LLMs better understand the 3D world. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that our method outperforms existing 3D-LMMs in various downstream tasks.

### [111] [DMQ: Dissecting Outliers of Diffusion Models for Post-Training Quantization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12933)
*Dongyeun Lee,Jiwan Hur,Hyounguk Shon,Jae Young Lee,Junmo Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces DMQ, a novel method combining LES and channel-wise PTS to improve quantization for diffusion models, which leads to significant computational efficiency while maintaining performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current diffusion models require high computational resources, and existing post-training quantization methods struggle at low bit-widths, degrading model performance.

Method: DMQ integrates Learned Equivalent Scaling for optimal channel-wise scaling factors, adaptive timestep weighting to prioritize earlier denoising steps, and channel-wise Power-of-Two Scaling for activations, supported by a voting algorithm.

Result: DMQ achieves significant performance improvements at low bit-widths (e.g., W4A6, W4A8), ensuring high-quality image generation and model stability.

Conclusion: The proposed DMQ method effectively addresses computational challenges for diffusion models in resource-constrained environments, providing a robust quantization approach with superior performance.

Abstract: Diffusion models have achieved remarkable success in image generation but
come with significant computational costs, posing challenges for deployment in
resource-constrained environments. Recent post-training quantization (PTQ)
methods have attempted to mitigate this issue by focusing on the iterative
nature of diffusion models. However, these approaches often overlook outliers,
leading to degraded performance at low bit-widths. In this paper, we propose a
DMQ which combines Learned Equivalent Scaling (LES) and channel-wise
Power-of-Two Scaling (PTS) to effectively address these challenges. Learned
Equivalent Scaling optimizes channel-wise scaling factors to redistribute
quantization difficulty between weights and activations, reducing overall
quantization error. Recognizing that early denoising steps, despite having
small quantization errors, crucially impact the final output due to error
accumulation, we incorporate an adaptive timestep weighting scheme to
prioritize these critical steps during learning. Furthermore, identifying that
layers such as skip connections exhibit high inter-channel variance, we
introduce channel-wise Power-of-Two Scaling for activations. To ensure robust
selection of PTS factors even with small calibration set, we introduce a voting
algorithm that enhances reliability. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our
method significantly outperforms existing works, especially at low bit-widths
such as W4A6 (4-bit weight, 6-bit activation) and W4A8, maintaining high image
generation quality and model stability. The code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To optimize landslide detection using deep learning while addressing challenges of overfitting and data imbalance in remote sensing imagery.

Method: A framework with online and offline data augmentation, EfficientNet_Large for feature extraction, and an SVM classifier for post-processing to enhance classification performance.

Abstract: The use of satellite imagery combined with deep learning to support automatic
landslide detection is becoming increasingly widespread. However, selecting an
appropriate deep learning architecture to optimize performance while avoiding
overfitting remains a critical challenge. To address these issues, we propose a
deep-learning based framework for landslide detection from remote sensing image
in this paper. The proposed framework presents an effective combination of the
online an offline data augmentation to tackle the imbalanced data, a backbone
EfficientNet\_Large deep learning model for extracting robust embedding
features, and a post-processing SVM classifier to balance and enhance the
classification performance. The proposed model achieved an F1-score of 0.8938
on the public test set of the Zindi challenge.

*Yafei Zhang,Lingqi Kong,Huafeng Li,Jie Wen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This study introduces a weakly supervised approach for visible-infrared person re-identification (ReID) using only single-modal identity labels, eliminating the need for cross-modal labeled data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the challenge of visible-infrared person ReID in scenarios where labeled cross-modal identity samples are unavailable, thus reducing the reliance on costly and often unavailable cross-modal annotations.

Method: The proposed method includes a heterogeneous expert collaborative consistency learning framework. It independently trains classification experts for each modality, which collaborate to establish cross-modal identity correspondences through a fusion mechanism and consistent learning.

Result: Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method effectively enhances cross-modal identity recognition and modality-invariant feature extraction on two challenging datasets.

Conclusion: The weakly supervised method successfully reduces reliance on labeled cross-modal samples while maintaining robust cross-modal ReID performance.

Abstract: To reduce the reliance of visible-infrared person re-identification (ReID)
models on labeled cross-modal samples, this paper explores a weakly supervised
cross-modal person ReID method that uses only single-modal sample identity
labels, addressing scenarios where cross-modal identity labels are unavailable.
To mitigate the impact of missing cross-modal labels on model performance, we
propose a heterogeneous expert collaborative consistency learning framework,
designed to establish robust cross-modal identity correspondences in a weakly
supervised manner. This framework leverages labeled data from each modality to
independently train dedicated classification experts. To associate cross-modal
samples, these classification experts act as heterogeneous predictors,
predicting the identities of samples from the other modality. To improve
prediction accuracy, we design a cross-modal relationship fusion mechanism that
effectively integrates predictions from different experts. Under the implicit
supervision provided by cross-modal identity correspondences, collaborative and
consistent learning among the experts is encouraged, significantly enhancing
the model's ability to extract modality-invariant features and improve
cross-modal identity recognition. Experimental results on two challenging
datasets validate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

*Yucheng Tang,Yunguan Fu,Weixi Yi,Yipei Wang,Daniel C. Alexander,Rhodri Davies,Yipeng Hu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces a novel multimodal uncertainty propagation model (MUPM) to analyze and optimize uncertainties in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) for clinical applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to better understand and leverage the relationships and uncertainties arising from multimodal data inputs (such as text and images) in large-scale MLLMs, particularly for clinical tasks involving cardiac imaging and records.

Method: The authors propose MUPM, which characterizes and propagates uncertainties from unimodal (image-only, text-only) and multimodal (joint) data. It uses cardiac MRI scans and digital health records to evaluate its effectiveness in modeling uncertainties.

Result: The MUPM demonstrates robust optimization with limited data, generalizability across different input distributions and downstream tasks, and transferability due to shared pretraining and fine-tuning of MLLMs. It also quantifies uncertainty relationships effectively.

Conclusion: MUPM enables practical clinical applications by robustly estimating and analyzing uncertainties, identifying redundant factors, and potentially aiding in novel cardiac disease prediction tasks. It provides an efficient way to handle multimodal data in MLLMs.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) can process and integrate
information from multimodality sources, such as text and images. However,
interrelationship among input modalities, uncertainties due to individual
uni-modal data and potential clinical applications following such an
uncertainty decomposition are yet fully understood in the context of
large-scale MLLMs. In this work, we propose a multimodal uncertainty
propagation model (MUPM) based on uncertainty propagation, to characterise the
relationship among the uncertainties arising from image-only, text-only, and
joint image-text variations in MLLM inputs. Using real clinical data consisting
of cardiac MR scans and digital health records, we describe that MUPMs can be
optimised robustly with a few samples. We then show that the fitted MUPMs are
generalisable across different input data distributions and, perhaps
surprisingly, across different downstream tasks. Such a transferability may be
explained by the shared pretraining, comparatively light MLLM fine-tuning,
along with the low-dimensional nature of the MUPMs. More importantly, this
learned transferability, quantifying the relationship between these
uncertainties, led to direct clinical applications in which uncertainties may
be estimated and thus analysed robustly for varying data or even a novel set of
cardiac disease prediction tasks. In addition, we show experimentally the
efficiency in multimodal data required for estimating the overall uncertainty
and its ability to identify redundant factors, both of which are considered
practical yet clinically useful applications with the proposed MUPMs. Codes are
available at https://github.com/yucheng722/MUPM.

TL;DR: LoViC is a diffusion transformer framework for generating long, coherent text-to-video outputs using a segment-wise process and a novel FlexFormer autoencoder for compression.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges in scaling text-to-video generation to long-duration content due to the quadratic complexity of self-attention.

Method: The framework uses LoViC, a DiT-based model trained on large-scale open-domain videos, and FlexFormer, an autoencoder that compresses video and text into unified latent representations with linearly adjustable compression rates.

Result: The approach enables high-quality generation of long, coherent videos along with support for tasks like prediction, interpolation, and multi-shot generation.

Conclusion: LoViC improves efficiency and temporal coherence in long video generation, validated through experiments on diverse tasks.

Abstract: Despite recent advances in diffusion transformers (DiTs) for text-to-video
generation, scaling to long-duration content remains challenging due to the
quadratic complexity of self-attention. While prior efforts -- such as sparse
attention and temporally autoregressive models -- offer partial relief, they
often compromise temporal coherence or scalability. We introduce LoViC, a
DiT-based framework trained on million-scale open-domain videos, designed to
produce long, coherent videos through a segment-wise generation process. At the
core of our approach is FlexFormer, an expressive autoencoder that jointly
compresses video and text into unified latent representations. It supports
variable-length inputs with linearly adjustable compression rates, enabled by a
single query token design based on the Q-Former architecture. Additionally, by
encoding temporal context through position-aware mechanisms, our model
seamlessly supports prediction, retradiction, interpolation, and multi-shot
generation within a unified paradigm. Extensive experiments across diverse
tasks validate the effectiveness and versatility of our approach.

TL;DR: Proposing cIDI, a learning-based DIR framework using Implicit Neural Representations conditioned on regularization hyperparameters, optimized for greater efficiency and accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improving deformable image registration by addressing computational inefficiency in regularization parameter tuning and ensuring smooth, physically plausible DVFs.

Method: Developed cIDI framework, leveraging Implicit Neural Representations to train across a distribution of hyperparameters, utilizing segmentation masks, and enabling advanced regularization with automatic differentiation.

Result: Evaluation on DIR-LAB dataset showed high accuracy and robustness in deformation vector field prediction.

Conclusion: cIDI simplifies and enhances regularization in DIR by optimizing for hyperparameters efficiently, ensuring a smooth and consistent DVF.

Abstract: Regularization is essential in deformable image registration (DIR) to ensure
that the estimated Deformation Vector Field (DVF) remains smooth, physically
plausible, and anatomically consistent. However, fine-tuning regularization
parameters in learning-based DIR frameworks is computationally expensive, often
requiring multiple training iterations. To address this, we propose cIDI, a
novel DIR framework based on Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) that
conditions the registration process on regularization hyperparameters. Unlike
conventional methods that require retraining for each regularization
hyperparameter setting, cIDIR is trained over a prior distribution of these
hyperparameters, then optimized over the regularization hyperparameters by
using the segmentations masks as an observation. Additionally, cIDIR models a
continuous and differentiable DVF, enabling seamless integration of advanced
regularization techniques via automatic differentiation. Evaluated on the
DIR-LAB dataset, $\operatorname{cIDIR}$ achieves high accuracy and robustness
across the dataset.

*Qiang Wang,Mengchao Wang,Fan Jiang,Yaqi Fan,Yonggang Qi,Mu Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FantasyPortrait is a model for generating high-quality facial animations from static images, excelling in emotion-rich and multi-character scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous techniques faced challenges in capturing emotional nuances, cross-reenactment artifacts, and multi-character interference.

Method: FantasyPortrait employs a diffusion transformer, an expression-augmented learning strategy, and a masked cross-attention mechanism.

Result: It achieves state-of-the-art performance in rendering facial animations, validated by a proposed Multi-Expr dataset and ExprBench benchmarks.

Conclusion: FantasyPortrait effectively resolves challenges in expressive and coordinated multi-character facial animations, offering significant advancements over prior methods.

Abstract: Producing expressive facial animations from static images is a challenging
task. Prior methods relying on explicit geometric priors (e.g., facial
landmarks or 3DMM) often suffer from artifacts in cross reenactment and
struggle to capture subtle emotions. Furthermore, existing approaches lack
support for multi-character animation, as driving features from different
individuals frequently interfere with one another, complicating the task. To
address these challenges, we propose FantasyPortrait, a diffusion transformer
based framework capable of generating high-fidelity and emotion-rich animations
for both single- and multi-character scenarios. Our method introduces an
expression-augmented learning strategy that utilizes implicit representations
to capture identity-agnostic facial dynamics, enhancing the model's ability to
render fine-grained emotions. For multi-character control, we design a masked
cross-attention mechanism that ensures independent yet coordinated expression
generation, effectively preventing feature interference. To advance research in
this area, we propose the Multi-Expr dataset and ExprBench, which are
specifically designed datasets and benchmarks for training and evaluating
multi-character portrait animations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
FantasyPortrait significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both
quantitative metrics and qualitative evaluations, excelling particularly in
challenging cross reenactment and multi-character contexts. Our project page is

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The study improves accuracy in diagnosing wrist pathologies using a small dataset, integrating X-ray images with patient metadata, and leveraging fine-grained pre-training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diagnosing wrist pathologies in children is time-intensive and requires specialized skills. Limited medical imaging datasets make the use of advanced computer vision challenging.

Method: The researchers treat the problem as fine-grained recognition to detect subtle pathologies, enhance the model by combining X-ray images with metadata, and use fine-grained pre-trained weights instead of general datasets like ImageNet.

Result: The approach boosts diagnostic accuracy by 2% for limited datasets and over 10% for larger fracture-focused datasets.

Conclusion: Using fine-grained strategies and combining patient metadata with imaging significantly enhances the detection of wrist pathologies, even with limited datasets.

Abstract: Wrist pathologies are frequently observed, particularly among children who
constitute the majority of fracture cases. However, diagnosing these conditions
is time-consuming and requires specialized expertise. Computer vision presents
a promising avenue, contingent upon the availability of extensive datasets, a
notable challenge in medical imaging. Therefore, reliance solely on one
modality, such as images, proves inadequate, especially in an era of diverse
and plentiful data types. In this study, we employ a multifaceted approach to
address the challenge of recognizing wrist pathologies using an extremely
limited dataset. Initially, we approach the problem as a fine-grained
recognition task, aiming to identify subtle X-ray pathologies that conventional
CNNs overlook. Secondly, we enhance network performance by fusing patient
metadata with X-ray images. Thirdly, rather than pre-training on a
coarse-grained dataset like ImageNet, we utilize weights trained on a
fine-grained dataset. While metadata integration has been used in other medical
domains, this is a novel application for wrist pathologies. Our results show
that a fine-grained strategy and metadata integration improve diagnostic
accuracy by 2% with a limited dataset and by over 10% with a larger
fracture-focused dataset.

*Keli Deng,Jie Nie,Yuntao Qian*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a method called ULDM for reconstructing hyperspectral images (HSIs) from RGB images by leveraging RGB pre-trained diffusion models and separating spectral-spatial information.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the challenge of estimating unobservable spectral features in hyperspectral image reconstruction from RGB images, utilizing spatial knowledge embedded in RGB models.

Method: The method involves extending RGB latent diffusion models (LDMs) into unobservable feature LDMs (ULDMs) using a two-stage pipeline: spectral structure representation learning via a spectral autoencoder (SpeUAE) and spectral-spatial distribution learning.

Result: Experimental results show that the ULDM achieves state-of-the-art performance on spectral reconstruction and downstream tasks like relighting.

Conclusion: By effectively modeling spectral-spatial distributions in latent space, the proposed ULDM approach advances hyperspectral image reconstruction, demonstrating superior accuracy and utility.

Abstract: Spectral reconstruction (SR) is a crucial problem in image processing that
requires reconstructing hyperspectral images (HSIs) from the corresponding RGB
images. A key difficulty in SR is estimating the unobservable feature, which
encapsulates significant spectral information not captured by RGB imaging
sensors. The solution lies in effectively constructing the spectral-spatial
joint distribution conditioned on the RGB image to complement the unobservable
feature. Since HSIs share a similar spatial structure with the corresponding
RGB images, it is rational to capitalize on the rich spatial knowledge in RGB
pre-trained models for spectral-spatial joint distribution learning. To this
end, we extend the RGB pre-trained latent diffusion model (RGB-LDM) to an
unobservable feature LDM (ULDM) for SR. As the RGB-LDM and its corresponding
spatial autoencoder (SpaAE) already excel in spatial knowledge, the ULDM can
focus on modeling spectral structure. Moreover, separating the unobservable
feature from the HSI reduces the redundant spectral information and empowers
the ULDM to learn the joint distribution in a compact latent space.
Specifically, we propose a two-stage pipeline consisting of spectral structure
representation learning and spectral-spatial joint distribution learning to
transform the RGB-LDM into the ULDM. In the first stage, a spectral
unobservable feature autoencoder (SpeUAE) is trained to extract and compress
the unobservable feature into a 3D manifold aligned with RGB space. In the
second stage, the spectral and spatial structures are sequentially encoded by
the SpeUAE and the SpaAE, respectively. The ULDM is then acquired to model the
distribution of the coded unobservable feature with guidance from the
corresponding RGB images. Experimental results on SR and downstream relighting
tasks demonstrate that our proposed method achieves state-of-the-art
performance.

### [120] [VisionThink: Smart and Efficient Vision Language Model via Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13348)
*Senqiao Yang,Junyi Li,Xin Lai,Bei Yu,Hengshuang Zhao,Jiaya Jia*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VisionThink, a novel approach to visual-language models, dynamically adjusts image resolution and token quantities, improving efficiency while maintaining strong performance in OCR and general VQA tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the inefficiency of current VLMs using an excessive number of visual tokens, focusing on optimizing token usage without compromising performance.

Method: The proposed method involves dynamically processing images at different resolutions using a reinforcement learning-based mechanism, allowing the model to decide when higher resolution is needed.

Result: The method achieves fine-grained OCR task performance and substantially reduces visual token usage on simpler tasks, retaining overall model effectiveness.

Conclusion: VisionThink offers a more efficient, task-specific approach to visual token utilization in VLMs, demonstrating both superior efficiency and effectiveness.

Abstract: Recent advancements in vision-language models (VLMs) have improved
performance by increasing the number of visual tokens, which are often
significantly longer than text tokens. However, we observe that most real-world
scenarios do not require such an extensive number of visual tokens. While the
performance drops significantly in a small subset of OCR-related tasks, models
still perform accurately in most other general VQA tasks with only 1/4
resolution. Therefore, we propose to dynamically process distinct samples with
different resolutions, and present a new paradigm for visual token compression,
namely, VisionThink. It starts with a downsampled image and smartly decides
whether it is sufficient for problem solving. Otherwise, the model could output
a special token to request the higher-resolution image. Compared to existing
Efficient VLM methods that compress tokens using fixed pruning ratios or
thresholds, VisionThink autonomously decides whether to compress tokens case by
case. As a result, it demonstrates strong fine-grained visual understanding
capability on OCR-related tasks, and meanwhile saves substantial visual tokens
on simpler tasks. We adopt reinforcement learning and propose the LLM-as-Judge
strategy to successfully apply RL to general VQA tasks. Moreover, we carefully
design a reward function and penalty mechanism to achieve a stable and
reasonable image resize call ratio. Extensive experiments demonstrate the
superiority, efficiency, and effectiveness of our method. Our code is available

*Uranik Berisha,Jens Mehnert,Alexandru Paul Condurache*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a one-shot pruning method called Variance-Based Pruning that effectively compresses models with minimal fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Training and deploying large models like Vision Transformers is computationally expensive and unsuitable for resource-constrained hardware. Traditional structured pruning requires costly retraining to maintain performance.

Method: Variance-Based Pruning selects neurons for pruning based on activation statistics and integrates mean activations back into the model to reduce performance degradation. This minimizes fine-tuning requirements.

Result: The method retains over 70% of DeiT-Base's original performance immediately after pruning and achieves 99% of the original accuracy with 10 epochs of fine-tuning. It also reduces computational costs (35% MAC reduction), model size (36% reduction), and speeds up the model by 1.44x.

Conclusion: Variance-Based Pruning offers an efficient and effective approach to compress large models with minimal performance loss and retraining demands, making it suitable for deployment on resource-limited hardware.

Abstract: Increasingly expensive training of ever larger models such as Vision
Transfomers motivate reusing the vast library of already trained
state-of-the-art networks. However, their latency, high computational costs and
memory demands pose significant challenges for deployment, especially on
resource-constrained hardware. While structured pruning methods can reduce
these factors, they often require costly retraining, sometimes for up to
hundreds of epochs, or even training from scratch to recover the lost accuracy
resulting from the structural modifications. Maintaining the provided
performance of trained models after structured pruning and thereby avoiding
extensive retraining remains a challenge. To solve this, we introduce
Variance-Based Pruning, a simple and structured one-shot pruning technique for
efficiently compressing networks, with minimal finetuning. Our approach first
gathers activation statistics, which are used to select neurons for pruning.
Simultaneously the mean activations are integrated back into the model to
preserve a high degree of performance. On ImageNet-1k recognition tasks, we
demonstrate that directly after pruning DeiT-Base retains over 70% of its
original performance and requires only 10 epochs of fine-tuning to regain 99%
of the original accuracy while simultaneously reducing MACs by 35% and model
size by 36%, thus speeding up the model by 1.44x.

*Zihua Zhao,Feng Hong,Mengxi Chen,Pengyi Chen,Benyuan Liu,Jiangchao Yao,Ya Zhang,Yanfeng Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The study introduces DISSect, a differential-informed sample selection method to improve training efficiency in contrastive multimodal models by addressing the noisy correspondence problem.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation arises from the need to reduce computational consumption while training multimodal models on large datasets, and from the limitations of existing sample selection methods in handling noisy correspondence during training.

Method: The proposed DISSect method utilizes the difference between predictions of the current model and a historical model to better identify high-quality training samples. It incorporates a robust differential-based sample selection mechanism with theoretical analysis to mitigate noisy correspondence during training.

Result: Experiments on three benchmark datasets and related downstream tasks show that DISSect consistently surpasses state-of-the-art methods in performance.

Conclusion: DISSect provides an efficient way to accelerate training by selecting better samples and mitigating noise, offering a meaningful improvement in contrastive-learning-based multimodal training pipelines.

Abstract: The remarkable success of contrastive-learning-based multimodal models has
been greatly driven by training on ever-larger datasets with expensive compute
consumption. Sample selection as an alternative efficient paradigm plays an
important direction to accelerate the training process. However, recent
advances on sample selection either mostly rely on an oracle model to offline
select a high-quality coreset, which is limited in the cold-start scenarios, or
focus on online selection based on real-time model predictions, which has not
sufficiently or efficiently considered the noisy correspondence. To address
this dilemma, we propose a novel Differential-Informed Sample Selection
(DISSect) method, which accurately and efficiently discriminates the noisy
correspondence for training acceleration. Specifically, we rethink the impact
of noisy correspondence on contrastive learning and propose that the
differential between the predicted correlation of the current model and that of
a historical model is more informative to characterize sample quality. Based on
this, we construct a robust differential-based sample selection and analyze its
theoretical insights. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets and
various downstream tasks demonstrate the consistent superiority of DISSect over
current state-of-the-art methods. Source code is available at:

### [123] [Beyond Fully Supervised Pixel Annotations: Scribble-Driven Weakly-Supervised Framework for Image Manipulation Localization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13018)
*Songlin Li,Guofeng Yu,Zhiqing Guo,Yunfeng Diao,Dan Ma,Gaobo Yang,Liejun Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper presents a weakly supervised method for image manipulation localization using scribble annotations, achieving superior results compared to existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: IML methods often rely on large-scale datasets with detailed pixel-level annotations, which are costly and challenging to acquire. To find a balance between accuracy and annotation efficiency, this study explores the use of scribble annotations as a form of weak supervision.

Method: The authors created a scribble-based IML dataset and proposed a weakly supervised framework incorporating: 1) structural consistency loss for self-supervised training, 2) a prior-aware feature modulation module (PFMM), 3) a gated adaptive fusion module (GAFM), and 4) a confidence-aware entropy minimization loss.

Result: The proposed method outperformed existing fully supervised IML approaches in both in-distribution and out-of-distribution test settings.

Conclusion: Utilizing scribble annotations paired with the proposed weakly supervised technique enhances pixel-level annotation efficiency while ensuring high localization performance for image manipulation detection.

Abstract: Deep learning-based image manipulation localization (IML) methods have
achieved remarkable performance in recent years, but typically rely on
large-scale pixel-level annotated datasets. To address the challenge of
acquiring high-quality annotations, some recent weakly supervised methods
utilize image-level labels to segment manipulated regions. However, the
performance is still limited due to insufficient supervision signals. In this
study, we explore a form of weak supervision that improves the annotation
efficiency and detection performance, namely scribble annotation supervision.
We re-annotated mainstream IML datasets with scribble labels and propose the
first scribble-based IML (Sc-IML) dataset. Additionally, we propose the first
scribble-based weakly supervised IML framework. Specifically, we employ
self-supervised training with a structural consistency loss to encourage the
model to produce consistent predictions under multi-scale and augmented inputs.
In addition, we propose a prior-aware feature modulation module (PFMM) that
adaptively integrates prior information from both manipulated and authentic
regions for dynamic feature adjustment, further enhancing feature
discriminability and prediction consistency in complex scenes. We also propose
a gated adaptive fusion module (GAFM) that utilizes gating mechanisms to
regulate information flow during feature fusion, guiding the model toward
emphasizing potential tampered regions. Finally, we propose a confidence-aware
entropy minimization loss (${\mathcal{L}}_{ {CEM }}$). This loss dynamically
regularizes predictions in weakly annotated or unlabeled regions based on model
uncertainty, effectively suppressing unreliable predictions. Experimental
results show that our method outperforms existing fully supervised approaches
in terms of average performance both in-distribution and out-of-distribution.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces MaskGIL, an improved Masked AutoRegressive model for efficient and high-quality image generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aimed to address the performance gap between Masked AutoRegressive models and standard AutoRegressive models while enhancing the efficiency of the image generation process.

Method: The study evaluated different image tokenizers, modified the architecture by replacing causal attention with bidirectional attention, incorporated 2D RoPE, and scaled the model's parameters from 111M to 1.4B.

Result: MaskGIL achieved a FID score of 3.71 on the ImageNet 256x256 benchmark, matching state-of-the-art AR models, using only 8 inference steps (compared to AR's 256 steps). Additionally, it demonstrated capabilities in text-driven image generation, AR acceleration, and speech-to-image conversion.

Conclusion: MaskGIL balances quality and efficiency, rivaling state-of-the-art AR models using significantly fewer inference steps, and extends its applicability to various other tasks like real-time speech-to-image conversion.

Abstract: AutoRegressive (AR) models have made notable progress in image generation,
with Masked AutoRegressive (MAR) models gaining attention for their efficient
parallel decoding. However, MAR models have traditionally underperformed when
compared to standard AR models. This study refines the MAR architecture to
improve image generation quality. We begin by evaluating various image
tokenizers to identify the most effective one. Subsequently, we introduce an
improved Bidirectional LLaMA architecture by replacing causal attention with
bidirectional attention and incorporating 2D RoPE, which together form our
advanced model, MaskGIL. Scaled from 111M to 1.4B parameters, MaskGIL achieves
a FID score of 3.71, matching state-of-the-art AR models in the ImageNet
256x256 benchmark, while requiring only 8 inference steps compared to the 256
steps of AR models. Furthermore, we develop a text-driven MaskGIL model with
775M parameters for generating images from text at various resolutions. Beyond
image generation, MaskGIL extends to accelerate AR-based generation and enable
real-time speech-to-image conversion. Our codes and models are available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper presents the Hierarchical Coresets Selection (HCS) mechanism to improve Vision-Language Models (VLMs) for complex wide-area scene understanding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VLMs struggle with adaptation to unseen complex wide-area scenes, and the authors seek to enhance their performance without additional fine-tuning.

Method: HCS uses a theoretically guaranteed importance function to refine selected regions based on utility, representativeness, robustness, and synergy. It progressively selects minimal interpretable regions and works as a plug-and-play solution for VLMs.

Result: HCS improves VLM performance and universality across various tasks without requiring additional fine-tuning.

Conclusion: The proposed HCS mechanism is an effective, adaptable method to enhance VLM capabilities for complex scenes.

Abstract: Scene understanding is one of the core tasks in computer vision, aiming to
extract semantic information from images to identify objects, scene categories,
and their interrelationships. Although advancements in Vision-Language Models
(VLMs) have driven progress in this field, existing VLMs still face challenges
in adaptation to unseen complex wide-area scenes. To address the challenges,
this paper proposes a Hierarchical Coresets Selection (HCS) mechanism to
advance the adaptation of VLMs in complex wide-area scene understanding. It
progressively refines the selected regions based on the proposed theoretically
guaranteed importance function, which considers utility, representativeness,
robustness, and synergy. Without requiring additional fine-tuning, HCS enables
VLMs to achieve rapid understandings of unseen scenes at any scale using
minimal interpretable regions while mitigating insufficient feature density.
HCS is a plug-and-play method that is compatible with any VLM. Experiments
demonstrate that HCS achieves superior performance and universality in various
tasks.

### [126] [Label-Consistent Dataset Distillation with Detector-Guided Refinement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13074)
*Yawen Zou,Guang Li,Zi Wang,Chunzhi Gu,Chao Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A method is proposed to improve dataset distillation using a detector-guided framework to refine synthetic samples for label consistency and high quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The aim is to overcome limitations in existing dataset distillation methods, such as label inconsistencies and insufficient detail, which degrade model performance.

Method: A pre-trained detector identifies anomalous synthetic samples (lacking confidence or accurate labeling) and a diffusion model generates improved alternatives. Selection of final samples is based on detector confidence and diversity.

Result: The method synthesizes high-quality and detailed surrogate datasets, achieving state-of-the-art performance in validation tests.

Conclusion: The proposed framework enhances dataset distillation processes, balancing label accuracy and intra-class diversity for more effective downstream tasks.

Abstract: Dataset distillation (DD) aims to generate a compact yet informative dataset
that achieves performance comparable to the original dataset, thereby reducing
demands on storage and computational resources. Although diffusion models have
made significant progress in dataset distillation, the generated surrogate
datasets often contain samples with label inconsistencies or insufficient
structural detail, leading to suboptimal downstream performance. To address
these issues, we propose a detector-guided dataset distillation framework that
explicitly leverages a pre-trained detector to identify and refine anomalous
synthetic samples, thereby ensuring label consistency and improving image
quality. Specifically, a detector model trained on the original dataset is
employed to identify anomalous images exhibiting label mismatches or low
classification confidence. For each defective image, multiple candidates are
generated using a pre-trained diffusion model conditioned on the corresponding
image prototype and label. The optimal candidate is then selected by jointly
considering the detector's confidence score and dissimilarity to existing
qualified synthetic samples, thereby ensuring both label accuracy and
intra-class diversity. Experimental results demonstrate that our method can
synthesize high-quality representative images with richer details, achieving
state-of-the-art performance on the validation set.

*Riku Inoue,Masamitsu Tsuchiya,Yuji Yasui*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces Channel-wise Motion Features, a cost-volume-based motion segmentation model that improves efficiency and real-time application.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Detecting objects accurately and in real-time for safety-critical robotics applications is challenging due to computational costs of existing models using multiple subnetworks.

Method: The paper implements a novel representation called Channel-wise Motion Features, which exclusively uses a Pose Network to extract depth and 3D motion features, while avoiding other subnetworks.

Result: The proposed method achieves roughly 4x higher FPS compared to state-of-the-art models in datasets like KITTI and Cityscapes, while maintaining similar accuracy and reducing model parameters to 25%.

Conclusion: Channel-wise Motion Features enable efficient, accurate motion segmentation suitable for real-time robotics applications by overcoming computational cost barriers.

Abstract: For safety-critical robotics applications such as autonomous driving, it is
important to detect all required objects accurately in real-time. Motion
segmentation offers a solution by identifying dynamic objects from the scene in
a class-agnostic manner. Recently, various motion segmentation models have been
proposed, most of which jointly use subnetworks to estimate Depth, Pose,
Optical Flow, and Scene Flow. As a result, the overall computational cost of
the model increases, hindering real-time performance.
  In this paper, we propose a novel cost-volume-based motion feature
representation, Channel-wise Motion Features. By extracting depth features of
each instance in the feature map and capturing the scene's 3D motion
information, it offers enhanced efficiency. The only subnetwork used to build
Channel-wise Motion Features is the Pose Network, and no others are required.
Our method not only achieves about 4 times the FPS of state-of-the-art models
in the KITTI Dataset and Cityscapes of the VCAS-Motion Dataset, but also
demonstrates equivalent accuracy while reducing the parameters to about 25$\%$.

*Riku Inoue,Masamitsu Tsuchiya,Yuji Yasui*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Decoupled PROB, enhancing Open World Object Detection (OWOD) by resolving model conflicts and improving feature extraction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: OWOD requires detecting unknown objects without supervision and incrementally learning new classes, but conflicts in objectness and class predictions limit progress.

Method: The proposed Decoupled PROB model utilizes ETOP to resolve prediction conflicts and TDQI for efficient feature extraction of known and unknown objects.

Result: Decoupled PROB achieves improved metrics on OWOD benchmarks, outperforming state-of-the-art models.

Conclusion: Early termination of predictions and better query initialization significantly enhance OWOD performance, showcasing Decoupled PROB's effectiveness.

Abstract: Open World Object Detection (OWOD) is a challenging computer vision task that
extends standard object detection by (1) detecting and classifying unknown
objects without supervision, and (2) incrementally learning new object classes
without forgetting previously learned ones. The absence of ground truths for
unknown objects makes OWOD tasks particularly challenging. Many methods have
addressed this by using pseudo-labels for unknown objects. The recently
proposed Probabilistic Objectness transformer-based open-world detector (PROB)
is a state-of-the-art model that does not require pseudo-labels for unknown
objects, as it predicts probabilistic objectness. However, this method faces
issues with learning conflicts between objectness and class predictions.
  To address this issue and further enhance performance, we propose a novel
model, Decoupled PROB. Decoupled PROB introduces Early Termination of
Objectness Prediction (ETOP) to stop objectness predictions at appropriate
layers in the decoder, resolving the learning conflicts between class and
objectness predictions in PROB. Additionally, we introduce Task-Decoupled Query
Initialization (TDQI), which efficiently extracts features of known and unknown
objects, thereby improving performance. TDQI is a query initialization method
that combines query selection and learnable queries, and it is a module that
can be easily integrated into existing DETR-based OWOD models. Extensive
experiments on OWOD benchmarks demonstrate that Decoupled PROB surpasses all
existing methods across several metrics, significantly improving performance.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper presents DiffOSeg, a two-stage diffusion-based framework that addresses variability in medical image segmentation by combining expert consensus and individual preferences.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of traditional segmentation methods that fail to account for annotator biases arising from imaging ambiguity and diverse clinical expertise.

Method: DiffOSeg operates in two stages: Stage I generates a probabilistic consensus across all experts, while Stage II uses adaptive prompts to capture individual expert preferences.

Result: The proposed framework outperforms current state-of-the-art methods across various metrics on the LIDC-IDRI and NPC-170 datasets.

Conclusion: DiffOSeg effectively balances consensus-driven and preference-driven segmentation, providing a comprehensive solution to address annotation variability in medical imaging.

Abstract: Annotation variability remains a substantial challenge in medical image
segmentation, stemming from ambiguous imaging boundaries and diverse clinical
expertise. Traditional deep learning methods producing single deterministic
segmentation predictions often fail to capture these annotator biases. Although
recent studies have explored multi-rater segmentation, existing methods
typically focus on a single perspective -- either generating a probabilistic
``gold standard'' consensus or preserving expert-specific preferences -- thus
struggling to provide a more omni view. In this study, we propose DiffOSeg, a
two-stage diffusion-based framework, which aims to simultaneously achieve both
consensus-driven (combining all experts' opinions) and preference-driven
(reflecting experts' individual assessments) segmentation. Stage I establishes
population consensus through a probabilistic consensus strategy, while Stage II
captures expert-specific preference via adaptive prompts. Demonstrated on two
public datasets (LIDC-IDRI and NPC-170), our model outperforms existing
state-of-the-art methods across all evaluated metrics. Source code is available

TL;DR: The paper introduces GLAD (Generalizable LoRA Tuning with Regularized Gradient), a simpler and more general framework that outperforms existing prompt tuning methods for pre-trained vision-language models in downstream tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome overfitting and generalization issues faced by existing prompt tuning methods for pre-trained vision-language models, particularly in few-shot scenarios.

Method: The authors propose GLAD, combining an existing LoRA technique with a new gradient-based regularization mechanism to improve stability and generalization during optimization.

Result: GLAD outperforms current state-of-the-art prompt-based methods in generalization tasks across 15 benchmark datasets, excelling in novel class, image domain, and cross-dataset generalization.

Conclusion: GLAD provides a simpler, more robust, and effective approach for prompt tuning of pre-trained vision-language models, addressing overfitting and enhancing generalizability.

Abstract: Pre-trained vision-language models, such as CLIP, show impressive zero-shot
recognition ability and can be easily transferred to specific downstream tasks
via prompt tuning, even with limited training data. However, existing prompt
tuning methods face two main challenges: (1) In few-shot scenarios, data
scarcity often leads to overfitting, making the model sensitive to changes in
the input domain. (2) To mitigate overfitting, these methods typically rely on
complex task-specific model architectures and sensitive hyperparameter tuning,
severely restricting their general applicability. To address these issues, we
propose a simpler and more general framework called GLAD (Generalizable LoRA
tuning with RegulArized GraDient). We show that merely applying LoRA achieves
performance in downstream tasks comparable to current state-of-the-art
prompt-based methods. While LoRA is effective and easy to use, it remains
susceptible to overfitting in few-shot learning scenarios. To mitigate this
risk, we introduce a gradient-based regularization technique. This technique
effectively steers the optimization trajectory, encouraging the model to find a
more stable parameter region that is robust to variations in data distribution.
Through extensive experiments conducted on 15 benchmark datasets, we
demonstrate that GLAD outperforms previous tuning approaches in terms of
base-to-novel class generalization, image domain generalization, and
cross-dataset generalization. The code will be publicly available.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a fully automated pipeline for fetal lung maturity assessment using deep learning and diffusion-weighted MRI.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the time-consuming and clinically limited manual segmentation process in assessing fetal lung maturity using intra-voxel incoherent motion (IVIM) analysis.

Method: A deep learning-based 3D nnU-Net model for fetal lung segmentation was developed, followed by voxel-wise model-fitting to quantify IVIM parameters.

Result: The segmentation model achieved a mean Dice coefficient of 82.14%. Model results showed no difference between nnU-Net-predicted and manual segmentations.

Conclusion: The automated pipeline supports accurate and feasible fetal lung maturity assessment, advancing its clinical applicability.

Abstract: Fetal lung maturity is a critical indicator for predicting neonatal outcomes
and the need for post-natal intervention, especially for pregnancies affected
by fetal growth restriction. Intra-voxel incoherent motion analysis has shown
promising results for non-invasive assessment of fetal lung development, but
its reliance on manual segmentation is time-consuming, thus limiting its
clinical applicability. In this work, we present an automated lung maturity
evaluation pipeline for diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance images that
consists of a deep learning-based fetal lung segmentation model and a
model-fitting lung maturity assessment. A 3D nnU-Net model was trained on
manually segmented images selected from the baseline frames of 4D
diffusion-weighted MRI scans. The segmentation model demonstrated robust
performance, yielding a mean Dice coefficient of 82.14%. Next, voxel-wise model
fitting was performed based on both the nnU-Net-predicted and manual lung
segmentations to quantify IVIM parameters reflecting tissue microstructure and
perfusion. The results suggested no differences between the two. Our work shows
that a fully automated pipeline is possible for supporting fetal lung maturity
assessment and clinical decision-making.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Personalizing pre-trained large-scale generative models to meet individual user preferences without suffering from catastrophic forgetting or requiring excessive parameters.

Method: R^2MoE framework combines a mixture-of-experts structure with routing distillation to minimize forgetting, incorporates redundancy removal for parameter efficiency, and employs hierarchical local attention for improved interference mitigation.

Result: R^2MoE significantly reduces forgetting rates by 87.8% and parameter usage by 63.3%, surpassing existing methods in generating conceptually faithful images on the CustomConcept 101 dataset.

Conclusion: The proposed framework ensures efficient and effective lifelong learning for visual concept personalization, presenting a novel solution to core challenges in generative model adaptation.

Abstract: Enabling large-scale generative models to continuously learn new visual
concepts is essential for personalizing pre-trained models to meet individual
user preferences. Existing approaches for continual visual concept learning are
constrained by two fundamental challenges: catastrophic forgetting and
parameter expansion. In this paper, we propose Redundancy-Removal Mixture of
Experts (R^2MoE), a parameter-efficient framework for lifelong visual concept
learning that effectively learns new concepts while incurring minimal parameter
overhead. Our framework includes three key innovative contributions: First, we
propose a mixture-of-experts framework with a routing distillation mechanism
that enables experts to acquire concept-specific knowledge while preserving the
gating network's routing capability, thereby effectively mitigating
catastrophic forgetting. Second, we propose a strategy for eliminating
redundant layer-wise experts that reduces the number of expert parameters by
fully utilizing previously learned experts. Third, we employ a hierarchical
local attention-guided inference approach to mitigate interference between
generated visual concepts. Extensive experiments have demonstrated that our
method generates images with superior conceptual fidelity compared to the
state-of-the-art (SOTA) method, achieving an impressive 87.8\% reduction in
forgetting rates and 63.3\% fewer parameters on the CustomConcept 101 dataset.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges such as high computational cost, spatial misalignment, and difficulty capturing localized structural differences in 3D point cloud anomaly detection.

Method: Introduces a registration-based approach where test samples align with multiple normal prototypes, clusters are formed based on keypoints, and anomalies are identified through cluster-level feature comparisons.

Result: Demonstrated state-of-the-art performance on the Real3D-AD benchmark for both object-level and point-level anomaly detection using only raw features.

Conclusion: The framework overcomes existing challenges in 3D point cloud analysis and enables precise anomaly localization through keypoint-guided clustering and multi-prototype registration.

Abstract: High-resolution 3D point clouds are highly effective for detecting subtle
structural anomalies in industrial inspection. However, their dense and
irregular nature imposes significant challenges, including high computational
cost, sensitivity to spatial misalignment, and difficulty in capturing
localized structural differences. This paper introduces a registration-based
anomaly detection framework that combines multi-prototype alignment with
cluster-wise discrepancy analysis to enable precise 3D anomaly localization.
Specifically, each test sample is first registered to multiple normal
prototypes to enable direct structural comparison. To evaluate anomalies at a
local level, clustering is performed over the point cloud, and similarity is
computed between features from the test sample and the prototypes within each
cluster. Rather than selecting cluster centroids randomly, a keypoint-guided
strategy is employed, where geometrically informative points are chosen as
centroids. This ensures that clusters are centered on feature-rich regions,
enabling more meaningful and stable distance-based comparisons. Extensive
experiments on the Real3D-AD benchmark demonstrate that the proposed method
achieves state-of-the-art performance in both object-level and point-level
anomaly detection, even using only raw features.

### [134] [Leveraging Language Prior for Infrared Small Target Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13113)
*Pranav Singh,Pravendra Singh*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a novel multimodal framework for InfraRed Small Target Detection (IRSTD) by combining language and image modalities for enhanced detection accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the limitations of existing IRSTD methods that rely solely on image data and to leverage recent advances in vision-language models for improved detection of small infrared targets.

Method: A multimodal IRSTD framework is developed that incorporates language priors obtained via state-of-the-art GPT-4 vision model and prompt engineering. This framework combines textual descriptions with infrared images and introduces a new multimodal dataset for validation.

Result: The method achieved significant performance improvements over state-of-the-art benchmarks on two datasets. It demonstrated relative gains of up to 67.87% and 113.43% in various metrics like IoU, nIoU, Pd, and Fa.

Conclusion: The study confirms the effectiveness of integrating language priors into IRSTD, highlighting the potential of vision-language approaches in enhancing performance and introducing a valuable multimodal dataset for future research.

Abstract: IRSTD (InfraRed Small Target Detection) detects small targets in infrared
blurry backgrounds and is essential for various applications. The detection
task is challenging due to the small size of the targets and their sparse
distribution in infrared small target datasets. Although existing IRSTD methods
and datasets have led to significant advancements, they are limited by their
reliance solely on the image modality. Recent advances in deep learning and
large vision-language models have shown remarkable performance in various
visual recognition tasks. In this work, we propose a novel multimodal IRSTD
framework that incorporates language priors to guide small target detection. We
leverage language-guided attention weights derived from the language prior to
enhance the model's ability for IRSTD, presenting a novel approach that
combines textual information with image data to improve IRSTD capabilities.
Utilizing the state-of-the-art GPT-4 vision model, we generate text
descriptions that provide the locations of small targets in infrared images,
employing careful prompt engineering to ensure improved accuracy. Due to the
absence of multimodal IR datasets, existing IRSTD methods rely solely on image
data. To address this shortcoming, we have curated a multimodal infrared
dataset that includes both image and text modalities for small target
detection, expanding upon the popular IRSTD-1k and NUDT-SIRST datasets. We
validate the effectiveness of our approach through extensive experiments and
comprehensive ablation studies. The results demonstrate significant
improvements over the state-of-the-art method, with relative percentage
differences of 9.74%, 13.02%, 1.25%, and 67.87% in IoU, nIoU, Pd, and Fa on the
NUAA-SIRST subset, and 4.41%, 2.04%, 2.01%, and 113.43% on the IRSTD-1k subset
of the LangIR dataset, respectively.

*Xiaozheng Jiang,Wei Zhang,Xuerui Mao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RS-TinyNet is a new model designed for detecting tiny objects in remote sensing imagery, surpassing state-of-the-art methods by enhancing feature saliency and reconstruction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Detecting tiny objects in remote sensing imagery is difficult due to their limited spatial details, weak features, and complex backgrounds, and existing methods perform poorly in these scenarios.

Method: The paper proposes RS-TinyNet, which employs multi-stage feature fusion and enhancement via three modules: multi-dimensional collaborative attention (MDCA), an auxiliary reversible branch (ARB), and a progressive fusion detection head (PFDH).

Result: RS-TinyNet significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art detectors, achieving 4.0% AP and 6.5% AP75 improvements on the AI-TOD dataset, with additional validation on the DIOR dataset.

Conclusion: The proposed RS-TinyNet provides an effective and scalable approach to tackle tiny object detection in challenging remote sensing scenarios.

Abstract: Detecting tiny objects in remote sensing (RS) imagery has been a
long-standing challenge due to their extremely limited spatial information,
weak feature representations, and dense distributions across complex
backgrounds. Despite numerous efforts devoted, mainstream detectors still
underperform in such scenarios. To bridge this gap, we introduce RS-TinyNet, a
multi-stage feature fusion and enhancement model explicitly tailored for RS
tiny object detection in various RS scenarios. RS-TinyNet comes with two novel
designs: tiny object saliency modeling and feature integrity reconstruction.
Guided by these principles, we design three step-wise feature enhancement
modules. Among them, the multi-dimensional collaborative attention (MDCA)
module employs multi-dimensional attention to enhance the saliency of tiny
objects. Additionally, the auxiliary reversible branch (ARB) and a progressive
fusion detection head (PFDH) module are introduced to preserve information flow
and fuse multi-level features to bridge semantic gaps and retain structural
detail. Comprehensive experiments on public RS dataset AI-TOD show that our
RS-TinyNet surpasses existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) detectors by 4.0% AP and
6.5% AP75. Evaluations on DIOR benchmark dataset further validate its superior
detection performance in diverse RS scenarios. These results demonstrate that
the proposed multi-stage feature fusion strategy offers an effective and
practical solution for tiny object detection in complex RS environments.

*Arian Mousakhan,Sudhanshu Mittal,Silvio Galesso,Karim Farid,Thomas Brox*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a state-of-the-art world model for autonomous driving using only video data and simple design decisions, excelling in complex scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing world models for autonomous driving struggle with long-horizon generation and generalization in challenging scenarios.

Method: The authors developed a model trained on 280 hours of video data, using a hybrid tokenizer to compare discrete token and continuous autoregressive models, without relying on additional data such as maps or depth.

Result: The proposed model achieved state-of-the-art performance with only 469M parameters, excelling particularly in difficult maneuvers, and demonstrated the superiority of continuous autoregressive models over discrete tokens.

Conclusion: Continuous autoregressive models are deemed more robust and powerful for autonomous driving tasks, with the project's resources made publicly available for further exploration.

Abstract: Existing world models for autonomous driving struggle with long-horizon
generation and generalization to challenging scenarios. In this work, we
develop a model using simple design choices, and without additional supervision
or sensors, such as maps, depth, or multiple cameras. We show that our model
yields state-of-the-art performance, despite having only 469M parameters and
being trained on 280h of video data. It particularly stands out in difficult
scenarios like turning maneuvers and urban traffic. We test whether discrete
token models possibly have advantages over continuous models based on flow
matching. To this end, we set up a hybrid tokenizer that is compatible with
both approaches and allows for a side-by-side comparison. Our study concludes
in favor of the continuous autoregressive model, which is less brittle on
individual design choices and more powerful than the model built on discrete
tokens. Code, models and qualitative results are publicly available at

*Hongyang Zhao,Tianyu Liang,Sina Davari,Daeho Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a synthetic dataset creation method using generative AI for improving DNN construction worker detection, achieving high accuracy on both synthetic and real datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to tackle the problem of insufficient and diverse training data for deep neural networks, specifically in the construction domain.

Method: The study utilized generative AI (Midjourney) to create 12,000 synthetic images, leveraging 3000 specific prompts to enhance diversity and realism. Manual labeling was conducted to prepare the dataset for deep neural network training.

Result: The trained model achieved average precisions (APs) of 0.937 and 0.642 on real construction images and APs of 0.994 and 0.919 on synthetic images across different IoU thresholds.

Conclusion: Generative AI platforms like Midjourney show promise in alleviating data scarcity issues. However, their performance on real-world datasets indicates potential limitations requiring further exploration.

Abstract: While recent advancements in deep neural networks (DNNs) have substantially
enhanced visual AI's capabilities, the challenge of inadequate data diversity
and volume remains, particularly in construction domain. This study presents a
novel image synthesis methodology tailored for construction worker detection,
leveraging the generative-AI platform Midjourney. The approach entails
generating a collection of 12,000 synthetic images by formulating 3000
different prompts, with an emphasis on image realism and diversity. These
images, after manual labeling, serve as a dataset for DNN training. Evaluation
on a real construction image dataset yielded promising results, with the model
attaining average precisions (APs) of 0.937 and 0.642 at
intersection-over-union (IoU) thresholds of 0.5 and 0.5 to 0.95, respectively.
Notably, the model demonstrated near-perfect performance on the synthetic
dataset, achieving APs of 0.994 and 0.919 at the two mentioned thresholds.
These findings reveal both the potential and weakness of generative AI in
addressing DNN training data scarcity.

*Keerthi Veeramachaneni,Praveen Tirupattur,Amrit Singh Bedi,Mubarak Shah*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a method using pre-trained visual models for detecting AI-generated videos with generic content, achieving over 90% accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As AI-generated visual content becomes more realistic, there is an urgent need for effective methods to detect such content, particularly in videos that extend beyond DeepFakes to generic contexts.

Method: The proposed method leverages pre-trained visual models to extract features that naturally distinguish real and generated videos. By applying a simple linear classification layer on these features, the detection performance is further enhanced.

Result: The method was validated on a new dataset (VID-AID), comprising over 10,000 AI-generated videos and 4,000 real ones. It achieved high detection accuracy, exceeding 90% on average.

Conclusion: The study successfully demonstrates a high-performing method for detecting AI-generated videos using pre-trained visual models, and plans to release resources to spur further research in this field.

Abstract: Recent advances in Generative AI (GenAI) have led to significant improvements
in the quality of generated visual content. As AI-generated visual content
becomes increasingly indistinguishable from real content, the challenge of
detecting the generated content becomes critical in combating misinformation,
ensuring privacy, and preventing security threats. Although there has been
substantial progress in detecting AI-generated images, current methods for
video detection are largely focused on deepfakes, which primarily involve human
faces. However, the field of video generation has advanced beyond DeepFakes,
creating an urgent need for methods capable of detecting AI-generated videos
with generic content. To address this gap, we propose a novel approach that
leverages pre-trained visual models to distinguish between real and generated
videos. The features extracted from these pre-trained models, which have been
trained on extensive real visual content, contain inherent signals that can
help distinguish real from generated videos. Using these extracted features, we
achieve high detection performance without requiring additional model training,
and we further improve performance by training a simple linear classification
layer on top of the extracted features. We validated our method on a dataset we
compiled (VID-AID), which includes around 10,000 AI-generated videos produced
by 9 different text-to-video models, along with 4,000 real videos, totaling
over 7 hours of video content. Our evaluation shows that our approach achieves
high detection accuracy, above 90% on average, underscoring its effectiveness.
Upon acceptance, we plan to publicly release the code, the pre-trained models,
and our dataset to support ongoing research in this critical area.

### [139] [Efficient Adaptation of Pre-trained Vision Transformer underpinned by Approximately Orthogonal Fine-Tuning Strategy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13260)
*Yiting Yang,Hao Luo,Yuan Sun,Qingsen Yan,Haokui Zhang,Wei Dong,Guoqing Wang,Peng Wang,Yang Yang,Hengtao Shen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces 'Approximately Orthogonal Fine-Tuning' (AOFT), a new strategy for parameter-efficient fine-tuning of Vision Transformers (ViT) by generating approximately orthogonal weight matrices for better generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper is motivated by the observation that Vision Transformers (ViT) exhibit approximate orthogonality in backbone weight matrices, a property absent in current Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods, which might limit their generalization capability.

Method: AOFT uses a single learnable vector to generate approximately orthogonal vectors that form down/up-projection matrices, aligning these with the backbone's properties.

Result: The approach demonstrated competitive performance across multiple downstream image classification tasks, validating its effectiveness in improving generalization.

Conclusion: Fine-tuning strategies that incorporate approximate orthogonality, such as AOFT, can enhance the generalization capabilities of Vision Transformers, making them more effective for downstream applications.

Abstract: A prevalent approach in Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) of pre-trained
Vision Transformers (ViT) involves freezing the majority of the backbone
parameters and solely learning low-rank adaptation weight matrices to
accommodate downstream tasks. These low-rank matrices are commonly derived
through the multiplication structure of down-projection and up-projection
matrices, exemplified by methods such as LoRA and Adapter. In this work, we
observe an approximate orthogonality among any two row or column vectors within
any weight matrix of the backbone parameters; however, this property is absent
in the vectors of the down/up-projection matrices. Approximate orthogonality
implies a reduction in the upper bound of the model's generalization error,
signifying that the model possesses enhanced generalization capability. If the
fine-tuned down/up-projection matrices were to exhibit this same property as
the pre-trained backbone matrices, could the generalization capability of
fine-tuned ViTs be further augmented? To address this question, we propose an
Approximately Orthogonal Fine-Tuning (AOFT) strategy for representing the
low-rank weight matrices. This strategy employs a single learnable vector to
generate a set of approximately orthogonal vectors, which form the
down/up-projection matrices, thereby aligning the properties of these matrices
with those of the backbone. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our
method achieves competitive performance across a range of downstream image
classification tasks, confirming the efficacy of the enhanced generalization
capability embedded in the down/up-projection matrices.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces DiffClean, a method to remove makeup effects using a text-guided diffusion model, improving age estimation and face verification accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Age verification systems can be misled by makeup, risking unauthorized access to age-restricted services.

Method: DiffClean employs a text-guided diffusion model to erase makeup traces from facial images.

Result: The proposed method enhances minor vs. adult age estimation accuracy by 4.8% and increases face verification True Match Rate (TMR) by 8.9% at FMR=0.01%.

Conclusion: DiffClean outperforms baseline methods in combating makeup attacks, contributing to more accurate and secure age verification systems.

Abstract: Accurate age verification can protect underage users from unauthorized access
to online platforms and e-commerce sites that provide age-restricted services.
However, accurate age estimation can be confounded by several factors,
including facial makeup that can induce changes to alter perceived identity and
age to fool both humans and machines. In this work, we propose DiffClean which
erases makeup traces using a text-guided diffusion model to defend against
makeup attacks. DiffClean improves age estimation (minor vs. adult accuracy by
4.8%) and face verification (TMR by 8.9% at FMR=0.01%) over competing baselines
on digitally simulated and real makeup images.

TL;DR: FashionPose is a novel framework enabling text-guided generation of personalized garment visuals with flexible poses and lighting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the need for realistic and controllable garment visualization in fashion e-commerce, as current methods lack flexibility in pose and illumination adaptability.

Method: FashionPose introduces a text-guided pipeline that predicts a 2D human pose, generates high-fidelity images using a diffusion model, and applies a lightweight relighting module, all driven by textual input.

Result: The framework achieves fine-grained pose synthesis and efficient, consistent relighting, outperforming existing methods in flexibility and realism.

Conclusion: FashionPose provides a pioneering solution for text-driven, personalized garment visualization, making it practical for virtual fashion displays.

Abstract: Realistic and controllable garment visualization is critical for fashion
e-commerce, where users expect personalized previews under diverse poses and
lighting conditions. Existing methods often rely on predefined poses, limiting
semantic flexibility and illumination adaptability. To address this, we
introduce FashionPose, the first unified text-to-pose-to-relighting generation
framework. Given a natural language description, our method first predicts a 2D
human pose, then employs a diffusion model to generate high-fidelity person
images, and finally applies a lightweight relighting module, all guided by the
same textual input. By replacing explicit pose annotations with text-driven
conditioning, FashionPose enables accurate pose alignment, faithful garment
rendering, and flexible lighting control. Experiments demonstrate fine-grained
pose synthesis and efficient, consistent relighting, providing a practical
solution for personalized virtual fashion display.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper addresses issues with the reasoning-based pose estimation (RPE) benchmark used for pose-aware multimodal large language models. Key challenges like reproducibility errors, scenario imbalance, and poor annotations are resolved by refining ground-truth data and making it publicly available.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The primary motivation is to address reproducibility and benchmark-quality issues in commonly used evaluations for pose-aware multimodal language models, enabling fair and accurate performance assessments.

Method: The authors refined ground-truth annotations of the RPE benchmark through meticulous visual matching, addressing limitations such as image redundancy and ambiguous textual descriptions. They made these refined annotations open-source to improve evaluation consistency.

Result: The paper removes critical errors in the current RPE benchmark, creating a more robust and reliable resource for quantitative evaluations.

Conclusion: By refining and releasing the annotations as an open-source resource, this work significantly enhances the reproducibility and reliability of pose-aware multimodal evaluation standards.

Abstract: The reasoning-based pose estimation (RPE) benchmark has emerged as a widely
adopted evaluation standard for pose-aware multimodal large language models
(MLLMs). Despite its significance, we identified critical reproducibility and
benchmark-quality issues that hinder fair and consistent quantitative
evaluations. Most notably, the benchmark utilizes different image indices from
those of the original 3DPW dataset, forcing researchers into tedious and
error-prone manual matching processes to obtain accurate ground-truth (GT)
annotations for quantitative metrics (\eg, MPJPE, PA-MPJPE). Furthermore, our
analysis reveals several inherent benchmark-quality limitations, including
significant image redundancy, scenario imbalance, overly simplistic poses, and
ambiguous textual descriptions, collectively undermining reliable evaluations
across diverse scenarios. To alleviate manual effort and enhance
reproducibility, we carefully refined the GT annotations through meticulous
visual matching and publicly release these refined annotations as an
open-source resource, thereby promoting consistent quantitative evaluations and
facilitating future advancements in human pose-aware multimodal reasoning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance real-time applications by enabling fast and accurate detection of hand-object interactions for intuitive user experiences.

Method: The proposed approach utilizes a cascaded architecture combining an action recognition module (Mamba model with EfficientNetV2) and an object detection module (fine-tuned YOLOWorld).

Result: The Mamba model achieves 38.52% p-AP on the ENIGMA-51 benchmark at 30fps, while the YOLOWorld reaches an 85.13% AP for hands and objects detection.

Conclusion: The cascaded architecture effectively detects hand-object interactions in real time, showing promise for improving egocentric vision-based applications.

Abstract: Hand-object interaction detection remains an open challenge in real-time
applications, where intuitive user experiences depend on fast and accurate
detection of interactions with surrounding objects. We propose an efficient
approach for detecting hand-objects interactions from streaming egocentric
vision that operates in real time. Our approach consists of an action
recognition module and an object detection module for identifying active
objects upon confirmed interaction. Our Mamba model with EfficientNetV2 as
backbone for action recognition achieves 38.52% p-AP on the ENIGMA-51 benchmark
at 30fps, while our fine-tuned YOLOWorld reaches 85.13% AP for hand and object.
We implement our models in a cascaded architecture where the action recognition
and object detection modules operate sequentially. When the action recognition
predicts a contact state, it activates the object detection module, which in
turn performs inference on the relevant frame to detect and classify the active
object.

TL;DR: The paper optimizes Diffusion Transformers (DiT) for real-time video generation on mobile devices like smartphones, achieving over 10 FPS on an iPhone 16 Pro Max.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion Transformers are powerful for video generation but are computationally intensive, making them impractical for mobile devices and real-time use.

Method: The paper proposes three key strategies: a compressed VAE for input dimensionality reduction, a KD-guided tri-level pruning strategy for mobile adaptation, and adversarial step distillation for reducing inference steps to only four.

Result: The optimized model generates more than 10 frames per second on a mobile device while maintaining high visual quality.

Conclusion: It is feasible to achieve high-quality, real-time video generation on resource-constrained devices using the proposed optimizations in DiT.

Abstract: Diffusion Transformers (DiT) have shown strong performance in video
generation tasks, but their high computational cost makes them impractical for
resource-constrained devices like smartphones, and real-time generation is even
more challenging. In this work, we propose a series of novel optimizations to
significantly accelerate video generation and enable real-time performance on
mobile platforms. First, we employ a highly compressed variational autoencoder
(VAE) to reduce the dimensionality of the input data without sacrificing visual
quality. Second, we introduce a KD-guided, sensitivity-aware tri-level pruning
strategy to shrink the model size to suit mobile platform while preserving
critical performance characteristics. Third, we develop an adversarial step
distillation technique tailored for DiT, which allows us to reduce the number
of inference steps to four. Combined, these optimizations enable our model to
achieve over 10 frames per second (FPS) generation on an iPhone 16 Pro Max,
demonstrating the feasibility of real-time, high-quality video generation on
mobile devices.

TL;DR: This paper introduces a method to improve the spatio-temporal consistency of view synthesis for humans in sparse-view videos using a 4D diffusion model enhanced by a sliding iterative denoising process.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the lack of spatio-temporal consistency in generated videos from existing methods of human view synthesis using sparse-view inputs.

Method: The method defines a latent grid encoding images, camera poses, and human poses. A sliding iterative denoising process is applied to the grid alternately across spatial and temporal dimensions, enhancing 4D consistency while maintaining GPU memory efficiency.

Result: The proposed method significantly improves the quality and consistency of novel-view video synthesis, performing better than existing approaches on DNA-Rendering and ActorsHQ datasets.

Conclusion: The sliding iterative denoising process effectively improves the 4D spatio-temporal consistency in human view synthesis, making the method both high-quality and efficient.

Abstract: This paper addresses the challenge of high-fidelity view synthesis of humans
with sparse-view videos as input. Previous methods solve the issue of
insufficient observation by leveraging 4D diffusion models to generate videos
at novel viewpoints. However, the generated videos from these models often lack
spatio-temporal consistency, thus degrading view synthesis quality. In this
paper, we propose a novel sliding iterative denoising process to enhance the
spatio-temporal consistency of the 4D diffusion model. Specifically, we define
a latent grid in which each latent encodes the image, camera pose, and human
pose for a certain viewpoint and timestamp, then alternately denoising the
latent grid along spatial and temporal dimensions with a sliding window, and
finally decode the videos at target viewpoints from the corresponding denoised
latents. Through the iterative sliding, information flows sufficiently across
the latent grid, allowing the diffusion model to obtain a large receptive field
and thus enhance the 4D consistency of the output, while making the GPU memory
consumption affordable. The experiments on the DNA-Rendering and ActorsHQ
datasets demonstrate that our method is able to synthesize high-quality and
consistent novel-view videos and significantly outperforms the existing
approaches. See our project page for interactive demos and video results:

Motivation: The motivation is to address the lack of stability and high error rates in the generation of complex concepts in visual tasks, which is an under-explored area.

Method: The method includes designing targeted experiments to identify causal factors for poor concept responses and introducing IMBA loss, an online, minimal-code-change approach to enhance concept response capabilities.

Result: Their approach significantly improved the concept response capability of baseline models, achieving highly competitive results on their benchmark and other public test datasets.

Conclusion: The study successfully addresses a complex problem in visual generation tasks, offering an impactful solution with wide applicability and efficiency due to minimal coding overhead.

Abstract: In visual generation tasks, the responses and combinations of complex

for poor concept responses through elaborately designed experiments. We also
design a concept-wise equalization loss function (IMBA loss) to address this
issue. Our proposed method is online, eliminating the need for offline dataset
processing, and requires minimal code changes. In our newly proposed complex

TL;DR: AutoPartGen is a model designed to generate 3D objects composed of parts by predicting one part at a time, using inputs like images, masks, or existing 3D objects. It achieves state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The research aims to address the challenge of 3D object generation by leveraging part-based compositional design, allowing for better geometric expressiveness and flexibility.

Method: Using latent 3D representations from 3DShape2VecSet, AutoPartGen generates parts autoregressively, conditioned on previously generated parts and additional inputs, until all parts are completed.

Result: AutoPartGen demonstrated superior performance in both overall 3D object generation and part-level quality compared to previous methods.

Conclusion: AutoPartGen effectively combines autoregressive generation and compositional latent spaces to excel at generating coherent 3D objects from various inputs.

Abstract: We introduce AutoPartGen, a model that generates objects composed of 3D parts
in an autoregressive manner. This model can take as input an image of an
object, 2D masks of the object's parts, or an existing 3D object, and generate
a corresponding compositional 3D reconstruction. Our approach builds upon
3DShape2VecSet, a recent latent 3D representation with powerful geometric
expressiveness. We observe that this latent space exhibits strong compositional
properties, making it particularly well-suited for part-based generation tasks.
Specifically, AutoPartGen generates object parts autoregressively, predicting
one part at a time while conditioning on previously generated parts and
additional inputs, such as 2D images, masks, or 3D objects. This process
continues until the model decides that all parts have been generated, thus
determining automatically the type and number of parts. The resulting parts can
be seamlessly assembled into coherent objects or scenes without requiring
additional optimization. We evaluate both the overall 3D generation
capabilities and the part-level generation quality of AutoPartGen,
demonstrating that it achieves state-of-the-art performance in 3D part
generation.

Motivation: The motivating issue is the instability and failures of previous geometry reconstruction methods caused by reliance on a fixed reference view, which introduces suboptimal inductive biases.

Method: The paper introduces $
 pi^3$, a permutation-equivariant feed-forward neural network that predicts affine-invariant camera poses and scale-invariant local point maps, eliminating reference frames to ensure robustness and scalability.

Result: The $
 pi^3 model achieves state-of-the-art performance across tasks such as camera pose estimation, monocular/video depth estimation, and dense point map reconstruction.

Conclusion: The novel architecture of $
 pi^3 is robust, scalable, and bias-free, offering significant advances in visual geometry reconstruction without reliance on designated viewpoints.

Abstract: We introduce $\pi^3$, a feed-forward neural network that offers a novel
approach to visual geometry reconstruction, breaking the reliance on a
conventional fixed reference view. Previous methods often anchor their
reconstructions to a designated viewpoint, an inductive bias that can lead to
instability and failures if the reference is suboptimal. In contrast, $\pi^3$
employs a fully permutation-equivariant architecture to predict
affine-invariant camera poses and scale-invariant local point maps without any
reference frames. This design makes our model inherently robust to input
ordering and highly scalable. These advantages enable our simple and bias-free
approach to achieve state-of-the-art performance on a wide range of tasks,
including camera pose estimation, monocular/video depth estimation, and dense
point map reconstruction. Code and models are publicly available.

*Yichi Zhang,Yici Yan,Alex Schwing,Zhizhen Zhao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper enhances hierarchical flow matching for generative modeling using mini-batch couplings to optimize the complexity of velocity fields across levels, yielding improved results on various datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of modeling complex multi-modal velocity distributions in flow-matching generative models, and to refine the hierarchical approach for better performance.

Method: The authors introduce mini-batch couplings in hierarchical flow matching, allowing for the gradual adjustment of complexity in velocity distributions across different ODE hierarchy levels.

Result: Their approach demonstrates improved results on synthetic and imaging data, validating the benefits of mini-batch couplings in handling multi-modality.

Conclusion: Integrating mini-batch couplings into hierarchical flow matching enhances its ability to model multi-modal distributions, improving generative modeling performance.

Abstract: Flow matching has emerged as a compelling generative modeling approach that
is widely used across domains. To generate data via a flow matching model, an
ordinary differential equation (ODE) is numerically solved via forward
integration of the modeled velocity field. To better capture the multi-modality
that is inherent in typical velocity fields, hierarchical flow matching was
recently introduced. It uses a hierarchy of ODEs that are numerically
integrated when generating data. This hierarchy of ODEs captures the
multi-modal velocity distribution just like vanilla flow matching is capable of
modeling a multi-modal data distribution. While this hierarchy enables to model
multi-modal velocity distributions, the complexity of the modeled distribution
remains identical across levels of the hierarchy. In this paper, we study how
to gradually adjust the complexity of the distributions across different levels
of the hierarchy via mini-batch couplings. We show the benefits of mini-batch
couplings in hierarchical rectified flow matching via compelling results on
synthetic and imaging data. Code is available at

*Shihao Wang,Guo Chen,De-an Huang,Zhiqi Li,Minghan Li,Guilin Li,Jose M. Alvarez,Lei Zhang,Zhiding Yu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes VideoITG, enhancing video understanding in Video-LLMs by using customized frame sampling guided by user instructions and the VidThinker annotation framework.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome challenges in long video understanding which current unsupervised methods fail to address effectively.

Method: Introduces the VideoITG approach, with VidThinker as the core pipeline for automated instruction-based annotation, generating clip captions, retrieving video segments, and selecting key frames.

Result: Created VideoITG-40K dataset (40K videos, 500K annotations) and demonstrated improved performance of VideoITG when integrated with Video-LLMs on multimodal video understanding benchmarks.

Conclusion: VideoITG enhances video frame selection and understanding, showing promise for advancing Video-LLM performance in complex scenarios.

Abstract: Recent studies have revealed that selecting informative and relevant video
frames can significantly improve the performance of Video Large Language Models
(Video-LLMs). Current methods, such as reducing inter-frame redundancy,
employing separate models for image-text relevance assessment, or utilizing
temporal video grounding for event localization, substantially adopt
unsupervised learning paradigms, whereas they struggle to address the complex
scenarios in long video understanding. We propose Instructed Temporal Grounding
for Videos (VideoITG), featuring customized frame sampling aligned with user
instructions. The core of VideoITG is the VidThinker pipeline, an automated
annotation framework that explicitly mimics the human annotation process.
First, it generates detailed clip-level captions conditioned on the
instruction; then, it retrieves relevant video segments through
instruction-guided reasoning; finally, it performs fine-grained frame selection
to pinpoint the most informative visual evidence. Leveraging VidThinker, we
construct the VideoITG-40K dataset, containing 40K videos and 500K instructed
temporal grounding annotations. We then design a plug-and-play VideoITG model,
which takes advantage of visual language alignment and reasoning capabilities
of Video-LLMs, for effective frame selection in a discriminative manner.
Coupled with Video-LLMs, VideoITG achieves consistent performance improvements
across multiple multimodal video understanding benchmarks, showing its
superiority and great potentials for video understanding.

*Yiliang Wan,Nitin Shivaraman,Akshaye Shenoi,Xiang Liu,Tao Luo,Jialin Li*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: This paper proposes leveraging strong synchrony properties in modern data centers to design distributed protocols for better performance. A new replication protocol named Chora is introduced, showing significant throughput improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Modern data centers have the potential to provide strong network synchrony, unlike typical assumptions in distributed protocol design. Leveraging this, systems can operate more efficiently.

Method: The authors engineered a network design with enhanced synchrony using kernel-bypass networking and multithreaded architecture, achieving sub-2 microsecond round bounds. They then co-designed Chora, a replication protocol exploiting these synchrony properties.

Result: Chora demonstrated a 255% improvement in throughput compared to single-leader protocols and a 109% improvement over multi-leader protocols.

Conclusion: Strong network synchrony in modern data centers can transform distributed protocol designs, as evidenced by Chora's performance gains. This work suggests potential efficiency in future infrastructure architectures.

Abstract: Distributed systems, such as state machine replication, are critical
infrastructures for modern applications. Practical distributed protocols make
minimum assumptions about the underlying network: They typically assume a
partially synchronous or fully asynchronous network model. In this work, we
argue that modern data center systems can be designed to provide strong
synchrony properties in the common case, where servers move in synchronous
lock-step rounds. We prove this hypothesis by engineering a practical design
that uses a combination of kernel-bypass network, multithreaded architecture,
and loosened round length, achieving a tight round bound under 2us. Leveraging
our engineered networks with strong synchrony, we co-design a new replication
protocol, Chora. Chora exploits the network synchrony property to efficiently
pipeline multiple replication instances, while allowing all replicas to propose
in parallel without extra coordination. Through experiments, we show that Chora
achieves 255% and 109% improvement in throughput over state-of-the-art
single-leader and multi-leader protocols, respectively.

Method: A reinforcement learning-based intelligent scheduling algorithm optimizes resource allocation by continuous agent-environment interaction.

Result: The method demonstrates improved system response speed, throughput, optimized resource utilization, energy reduction, and adaptability across diverse resource conditions.

Conclusion: The proposed approach surpasses static resource allocation methods by offering real-time adaptability and superior optimization in dynamic environments.

Abstract: This paper proposes a reinforcement learning-based method for microservice
resource scheduling and optimization, aiming to address issues such as uneven
resource allocation, high latency, and insufficient throughput in traditional
microservice architectures. In microservice systems, as the number of services
and the load increase, efficiently scheduling and allocating resources such as
computing power, memory, and storage becomes a critical research challenge. To
address this, the paper employs an intelligent scheduling algorithm based on
reinforcement learning. Through the interaction between the agent and the
environment, the resource allocation strategy is continuously optimized. In the
experiments, the paper considers different resource conditions and load
scenarios, evaluating the proposed method across multiple dimensions, including
response time, throughput, resource utilization, and cost efficiency. The
experimental results show that the reinforcement learning-based scheduling
method significantly improves system response speed and throughput under low
load and high concurrency conditions, while also optimizing resource
utilization and reducing energy consumption. Under multi-dimensional resource
conditions, the proposed method can consider multiple objectives and achieve
optimized resource scheduling. Compared to traditional static resource
allocation methods, the reinforcement learning model demonstrates stronger
adaptability and optimization capability. It can adjust resource allocation
strategies in real time, thereby maintaining good system performance in
dynamically changing load and resource environments.

TL;DR: The paper highlights inherent limitations of parallel computing for sequential problems, urging focus on scaling serial computation in AI.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While parallelization drives advancements in machine learning, the authors aim to emphasize the significance of sequential computation for tasks that inherently require dependent steps.

Method: The authors employ complexity theory to formalize the difference between parallel and serial computational tasks and analyze machine learning architectures.

Result: The study reveals fundamental challenges faced by parallel-centric architectures when handling inherently serial problems like reasoning and simulations.

Conclusion: Deliberate scaling of serial computation is vital for future progress in AI as it tackles increasingly complex and sequential tasks.

Abstract: While machine learning has advanced through massive parallelization, we
identify a critical blind spot: some problems are fundamentally sequential.
These "inherently serial" problems-from mathematical reasoning to physical
simulations to sequential decision-making-require dependent computational steps
that cannot be parallelized. Drawing from complexity theory, we formalize this
distinction and demonstrate that current parallel-centric architectures face
fundamental limitations on such tasks. We argue that recognizing the serial
nature of computation holds profound implications on machine learning, model
design, hardware development. As AI tackles increasingly complex reasoning,
deliberately scaling serial computation-not just parallel computation-is
essential for continued progress.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes integrating mental imagery into AI using a machine thinking framework composed of a Cognitive Thinking Unit and three auxiliary units, validated through testing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of current models, which cannot reason independently or integrate multisensory data autonomously, and to overcome the difficulty AI agents face in integrating knowledge across multiple domains.

Method: The authors introduce a machine thinking framework composed of four units: a Cognitive Thinking Unit, and three auxiliary units (Input Data, Needs, and Mental Imagery). Information is processed as natural language sentences or sketches.

Result: The framework was validated through testing, and the results were presented, showcasing its potential for enhancing AI's reasoning and decision-making capabilities.

Conclusion: Integrating mental imagery and modular units into machine reasoning could initiate and enhance the thinking process in AI systems, pushing their abilities towards more autonomous functionalities.

Abstract: Although existing models can interact with humans and provide satisfactory
responses, they lack the ability to act autonomously or engage in independent
reasoning. Furthermore, input data in these models is typically provided as
explicit queries, even when some sensory data is already acquired.
  In addition, AI agents, which are computational entities designed to perform
tasks and make decisions autonomously based on their programming, data inputs,
and learned knowledge, have shown significant progress. However, they struggle
with integrating knowledge across multiple domains, unlike humans.
  Mental imagery plays a fundamental role in the brain's thinking process,
which involves performing tasks based on internal multisensory data, planned
actions, needs, and reasoning capabilities. In this paper, we investigate how
to integrate mental imagery into a machine thinking framework and how this
could be beneficial in initiating the thinking process. Our proposed machine
thinking framework integrates a Cognitive thinking unit supported by three
auxiliary units: the Input Data Unit, the Needs Unit, and the Mental Imagery
Unit. Within this framework, data is represented as natural language sentences
or drawn sketches, serving both informative and decision-making purposes. We
conducted validation tests for this framework, and the results are presented
and discussed.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper examines LLM training startup overhead, its causes, and proposes Bootseer to optimize it, achieving a 50% reduction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Startup overhead in large-scale LLM training wastes GPU time (3.5% in one case) and delays execution cycles, especially in industrial environments.

Method: The authors conducted in-depth analysis of real production data on startup overhead, identified key bottlenecks, and proposed Bootseer with optimizations like hot block prefetching, dependency snapshotting, and HDFS-FUSE.

Result: Bootseer reduces LLM training startup overhead by 50% when deployed and tested on real production workloads.

Conclusion: Optimizing training startup overhead in LLMs is crucial for industrial efficiency, and Bootseer provides substantial improvements.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have become a cornerstone of modern AI, driving
breakthroughs in natural language processing and expanding into multimodal jobs
involving images, audio, and video. As with most computational software, it is
important to distinguish between ordinary runtime performance and startup
overhead. Prior research has focused on runtime performance: improving training
efficiency and stability. This work focuses instead on the increasingly
critical issue of startup overhead in training: the delay before training jobs
begin execution. Startup overhead is particularly important in large,
industrial-scale LLMs, where failures occur more frequently and multiple teams
operate in iterative update-debug cycles. In one of our training clusters, more
than 3.5% of GPU time is wasted due to startup overhead alone.
  In this work, we present the first in-depth characterization of LLM training
startup overhead based on real production data. We analyze the components of
startup cost, quantify its direct impact, and examine how it scales with job
size. These insights motivate the design of Bootseer, a system-level
optimization framework that addresses three primary startup bottlenecks: (a)
container image loading, (b) runtime dependency installation, and (c) model
checkpoint resumption. To mitigate these bottlenecks, Bootseer introduces three
techniques: (a) hot block record-and-prefetch, (b) dependency snapshotting, and
(c) striped HDFS-FUSE. Bootseer has been deployed in a production environment
and evaluated on real LLM training workloads, demonstrating a 50% reduction in
startup overhead.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The authors present IncA-DES, a machine learning framework designed for evolving data streams with concept drift, excelling in accuracy and efficiency through local experts, a concept drift detector, and an Online K-d tree.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation stems from the challenges posed by concept drift in data streams, which requires methods capable of adapting to changes in data distribution over time efficiently.

Method: The authors propose IncA-DES, which trains local experts over time, uses a concept drift detector for adaptation, employs an overlap-based classification filter for efficiency, and integrates an Online K-d tree for fast instance removal and handling of data imbalance.

Result: Experimental results demonstrated that IncA-DES achieved the highest average accuracy compared to seven state-of-the-art methods across varying label availability conditions and exhibited superior processing time among top methods.

Conclusion: IncA-DES significantly improves accuracy and efficiency for concept drift scenarios, with its innovations like the Online K-d tree showing promise for real-world data stream applications.

Abstract: Data streams pose challenges not usually encountered in batch-based ML. One
of them is concept drift, which is characterized by the change in data
distribution over time. Among many approaches explored in literature, the
fusion of classifiers has been showing good results and is getting growing
attention. DS methods, due to the ensemble being instance-based, seem to be an
efficient choice under drifting scenarios. However, some attention must be paid
to adapting such methods for concept drift. The training must be done in order
to create local experts, and the commonly used neighborhood-search DS may
become prohibitive with the continuous arrival of data. In this work, we
propose IncA-DES, which employs a training strategy that promotes the
generation of local experts with the assumption that different regions of the
feature space become available with time. Additionally, the fusion of a concept
drift detector supports the maintenance of information and adaptation to a new
concept. An overlap-based classification filter is also employed in order to
avoid using the DS method when there is a consensus in the neighborhood, a
strategy that we argue every DS method should employ, as it was shown to make
them more applicable and quicker. Moreover, aiming to reduce the processing
time of the kNN, we propose an Online K-d tree algorithm, which can quickly
remove instances without becoming inconsistent and deals with unbalancing
concerns that may occur in data streams. Experimental results showed that the
proposed framework got the best average accuracy compared to seven
state-of-the-art methods considering different levels of label availability and
presented the smaller processing time between the most accurate methods.
Additionally, the fusion with the Online K-d tree has improved processing time
with a negligible loss in accuracy. We have made our framework available in an
online repository.

Result: Experiments show that ParametricSplit outperforms traditional activations in low-dimensional scenarios while maintaining competitive performance in higher dimensions.

Conclusion: Topology-aware activation functions like ParametricSplit have the potential to improve neural network architectures by better managing data topology. Available code supports reproducibility and further exploration.

Abstract: This study explores novel activation functions that enhance the ability of

limitations of traditional activation functions like $\mathrm{ReLU}$, we
propose $\mathrm{SmoothSplit}$ and $\mathrm{ParametricSplit}$, which introduce

TL;DR: This paper addresses fairness in federated learning by proposing FedGA, which uses the Gini coefficient to measure and adapt global model updates to reduce performance disparity among clients, showing promising results across multiple datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Performance disparities caused by data heterogeneity in federated learning raise fairness concerns that need to be addressed to ensure equitable outcomes for all clients.

Method: FedGA uses the Gini coefficient to measure fairness, establishes a link between the Gini coefficient and the global model's update scale, and adjusts aggregation weights dynamically based on real-time fairness measurements.

Result: Experiments on datasets like Office-Caltech-10, CIFAR-10, and Synthetic demonstrate that FedGA improves fairness metrics such as variance and the Gini coefficient while preserving overall performance.

Conclusion: FedGA effectively addresses fairness in federated learning, reducing client disparities without compromising the model's quality.

Abstract: Fairness has emerged as one of the key challenges in federated learning. In
horizontal federated settings, data heterogeneity often leads to substantial
performance disparities across clients, raising concerns about equitable model
behavior. To address this issue, we propose FedGA, a fairness-aware federated
learning algorithm. We first employ the Gini coefficient to measure the
performance disparity among clients. Based on this, we establish a relationship
between the Gini coefficient $G$ and the update scale of the global model
${U_s}$, and use this relationship to adaptively determine the timing of
fairness intervention. Subsequently, we dynamically adjust the aggregation
weights according to the system's real-time fairness status, enabling the
global model to better incorporate information from clients with relatively
poor performance.We conduct extensive experiments on the Office-Caltech-10,
CIFAR-10, and Synthetic datasets. The results show that FedGA effectively
improves fairness metrics such as variance and the Gini coefficient, while
maintaining strong overall performance, demonstrating the effectiveness of our
approach.

Motivation: Current biochemical screening assay text data is underutilized in drug discovery due to its unstructured nature.

Method: Assay2Mol employs large language models to retrieve relevant assay records and use in-context learning for candidate molecule generation.

Result: Assay2Mol demonstrates superior performance in generating ligand molecules and improves synthesizability compared to previous ML approaches.

Conclusion: The Assay2Mol workflow is a promising tool for enhancing early-stage drug discovery using underutilized biochemical assay data.

Abstract: Scientific databases aggregate vast amounts of quantitative data alongside
descriptive text. In biochemistry, molecule screening assays evaluate the
functional responses of candidate molecules against disease targets.
Unstructured text that describes the biological mechanisms through which these
targets operate, experimental screening protocols, and other attributes of
assays offer rich information for new drug discovery campaigns but has been
untapped because of that unstructured format. We present Assay2Mol, a large
language model-based workflow that can capitalize on the vast existing
biochemical screening assays for early-stage drug discovery. Assay2Mol
retrieves existing assay records involving targets similar to the new target
and generates candidate molecules using in-context learning with the retrieved
assay screening data. Assay2Mol outperforms recent machine learning approaches
that generate candidate ligand molecules for target protein structures, while
also promoting more synthesizable molecule generation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the specific problem of clustering ranking vectors for improved personalization and large-scale decision-making, which traditional k-means clustering does not adequately handle.

Method: The study establishes NP-hardness, provides solutions for single-cluster cases, proposes the KRCA algorithm for approximations, and introduces a BnB algorithm to optimize cluster reconstruction. Theoretical error bounds are derived.

Result: KRCA significantly improves clustering solution quality and computational efficiency over baseline solutions, demonstrated through extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets.

Conclusion: KRC offers methodological advancements, highlighting its use in personalization and decision-making, with scope for further research.

Abstract: We study the problem of clustering ranking vectors, where each vector
represents preferences as an ordered list of distinct integers. Specifically,
we focus on the k-centroids ranking vectors clustering problem (KRC), which
aims to partition a set of ranking vectors into k clusters and identify the
centroid of each cluster. Unlike classical k-means clustering (KMC), KRC
constrains both the observations and centroids to be ranking vectors. We
establish the NP-hardness of KRC and characterize its feasible set. For the
single-cluster case, we derive a closed-form analytical solution for the
optimal centroid, which can be computed in linear time. To address the
computational challenges of KRC, we develop an efficient approximation
algorithm, KRCA, which iteratively refines initial solutions from KMC, referred
to as the baseline solution. Additionally, we introduce a branch-and-bound
(BnB) algorithm for efficient cluster reconstruction within KRCA, leveraging a
decision tree framework to reduce computational time while incorporating a
controlling parameter to balance solution quality and efficiency. We establish
theoretical error bounds for KRCA and BnB. Through extensive numerical
experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets, we demonstrate that KRCA
consistently outperforms baseline solutions, delivering significant
improvements in solution quality with fast computational times. This work
highlights the practical significance of KRC for personalization and
large-scale decision making, offering methodological advancements and insights

### [163] [Second-Order Bounds for [0,1]-Valued Regression via Betting Loss](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12584)
*Yinan Li,Kwang-Sung Jun*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper addresses $[0,1]$-valued regression, showing that the log loss minimizer achieves improved generalization bounds (first-order), and introduces the betting loss for variance-adaptive bounds (second-order).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve generalization bounds for regression problems, especially by advancing from first-order bounds to stricter second-order bounds.

Method: Analyzing the regression problem using log loss for first-order bounds and proposing the betting loss for second-order bounds, which adapt to variance without prior knowledge.

Result: The log loss minimizer achieves first-order bounds, and the proposed betting loss achieves variance-dependent second-order bounds.

Conclusion: The proposed betting loss marks a step forward in regression analysis, offering variance-adaptive bounds without requiring explicit modeling of label variance or distributions.

Abstract: We consider the $[0,1]$-valued regression problem in the i.i.d. setting. In a
related problem called cost-sensitive classification, \citet{foster21efficient}
have shown that the log loss minimizer achieves an improved generalization
bound compared to that of the squared loss minimizer in the sense that the
bound scales with the cost of the best classifier, which can be arbitrarily
small depending on the problem at hand. Such a result is often called a
first-order bound. For $[0,1]$-valued regression, we first show that the log
loss minimizer leads to a similar first-order bound. We then ask if there
exists a loss function that achieves a variance-dependent bound (also known as
a second order bound), which is a strict improvement upon first-order bounds.
We answer this question in the affirmative by proposing a novel loss function
called the betting loss. Our result is ``variance-adaptive'' in the sense that
the bound is attained \textit{without any knowledge about the variance}, which
is in contrast to modeling label (or reward) variance or the label distribution
itself explicitly as part of the function class such as distributional
reinforcement learning.

### [164] [Are encoders able to learn landmarkers for warm-starting of Hyperparameter Optimization?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12604)
*Antoni Zajko,Katarzyna Woźnica*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces two methods for representing tabular data with a specific focus on improving Bayesian Hyperparameter Optimization (HPO).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Representing heterogeneous tabular datasets for meta-learning remains unsolved. The authors aim to improve this with a focus on HPO warm-starting.

Method: Two novel methods: (1) deep metric learning and (2) landmarkers reconstruction, were proposed for tabular representation learning, with an emphasis on capturing landmarking properties.

Result: While the methods align well with landmarkers, they do not consistently enhance performance in the meta-task of HPO warm-starting.

Conclusion: The proposed approaches are effective in learning landmarking properties but may lack direct impact in improving HPO warm-starting performance outcomes.

Abstract: Effectively representing heterogeneous tabular datasets for meta-learning
purposes is still an open problem. Previous approaches rely on representations
that are intended to be universal. This paper proposes two novel methods for
tabular representation learning tailored to a specific meta-task -
warm-starting Bayesian Hyperparameter Optimization. Both follow the specific
requirement formulated by ourselves that enforces representations to capture
the properties of landmarkers. The first approach involves deep metric
learning, while the second one is based on landmarkers reconstruction. We
evaluate the proposed encoders in two ways. Next to the gain in the target
meta-task, we also use the degree of fulfillment of the proposed requirement as
the evaluation metric. Experiments demonstrate that while the proposed encoders
can effectively learn representations aligned with landmarkers, they may not
directly translate to significant performance gains in the meta-task of HPO
warm-starting.

### [165] [Learning What Matters: Probabilistic Task Selection via Mutual Information for Model Finetuning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12612)
*Prateek Chanda,Saral Sureka,Parth Pratim Chatterjee,Krishnateja Killamsetty,Nikhil Shivakumar Nayak,Ganesh Ramakrishnan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes TASKPGM, a scalable framework for optimizing task mixture proportions in finetuning large language models (LLMs), demonstrating theoretical guarantees and empirical improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The current process for selecting an optimal blend of task datasets for finetuning LLMs is largely manual and heuristic-driven, leading to inefficiencies.

Method: TASKPGM uses an energy function over a Markov Random Field (MRF) to optimize task mixture proportions. It incorporates behavioral divergences like Jensen-Shannon Divergence and Pointwise Mutual Information to model task relationships and provides a closed-form solution under simplex constraints.

Result: TASKPGM demonstrates consistent empirical improvements in LLM finetuning performance on evaluation suites such as MMLU and BIGBench for models like Llama 2 and Mistral.

Conclusion: TASKPGM represents a principled and effective approach for improving LLM finetuning. It offers both performance gains and interpretability for task influence and mixture composition.

Abstract: The performance of finetuned large language models (LLMs) hinges critically
on the composition of the training mixture. However, selecting an optimal blend
of task datasets remains a largely manual, heuristic driven process, with
practitioners often relying on uniform or size based sampling strategies. We
introduce TASKPGM, a principled and scalable framework for mixture optimization
that selects continuous task proportions by minimizing an energy function over
a Markov Random Field (MRF). Task relationships are modeled using behavioral
divergences such as Jensen Shannon Divergence and Pointwise Mutual Information
computed from the predictive distributions of single task finetuned models. Our
method yields a closed form solution under simplex constraints and provably
balances representativeness and diversity among tasks. We provide theoretical
guarantees, including weak submodularity for budgeted variants, and demonstrate
consistent empirical improvements on Llama 2 and Mistral across evaluation
suites such as MMLU and BIGBench. Beyond performance, TASKPGM offers
interpretable insights into task influence and mixture composition, making it a
powerful tool for efficient and robust LLM finetuning.

### [166] [Reasoning-Finetuning Repurposes Latent Representations in Base Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12638)
*Jake Ward,Chuqiao Lin,Constantin Venhoff,Neel Nanda*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper investigates backtracking behavior in reasoning models, finding it stems from repurposed directions already latent in base model activations, rather than newly learned capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the mechanisms behind backtracking behavior in reasoning models and how reasoning fine-tuning repurposes or modifies latent base model representations.

Method: The authors identified a specific direction in the residual stream of a base model (Llama-3.1-8B) that induces backtracking in a reasoning fine-tuned model, DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-8B, and analyzed its effects compared to token-level attributes.

Result: They found that this steering direction systematically induces backtracking in the reasoning model but does not induce it in the base model, suggesting a repurposing of pre-existing representations by fine-tuning.

Conclusion: Reasoning-finetuned models like DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-8B do not learn backtracking from scratch but instead repurpose existing structures in the base model to form new behavior-oriented circuits.

Abstract: Backtracking, an emergent behavior elicited by reasoning fine-tuning, has
been shown to be a key mechanism in reasoning models' enhanced capabilities.
Prior work has succeeded in manipulating this behavior via steering vectors,
but the underlying mechanism remains poorly understood. In this work, we show
that the emergence of backtracking in DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-8B is in part
driven by a repurposed direction already present in base model activations.
Specifically, we identify a direction in base Llama-3.1-8B's residual stream
which systematically induces backtracking when used to steer the distilled
reasoning model, and find that the effects of steering with this direction
cannot be trivially explained by token-level attributes. We further find that
this direction does not induce backtracking in the base model, suggesting that
the reasoning finetuning process repurposes pre-existing representations to
form new behavioral circuits. Additionally, we hypothesize that this direction
is one of several which may work together to mediate backtracking. Our findings
offer a compelling picture that reasoning-finetuned models repurpose
pre-existing base model representations, rather than learn new capabilities
from scratch.

### [167] [Improving physics-informed neural network extrapolation via transfer learning and adaptive activation functions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12659)
*Athanasios Papastathopoulos-Katsaros,Alexandra Stavrianidi,Zhandong Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces methods to improve Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) in extrapolation tasks, utilizing transfer learning and adaptive activation functions, achieving significant error reductions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: PINNs, though effective in combining physics with data-driven modeling, face challenges like poor extrapolation beyond training domains and sensitivity to activation functions.

Method: The authors introduce transfer learning using carefully selected collocation points in an extended domain and propose an adaptive activation function modeled as a linear combination of standard functions.

Result: Experiments showed an average reduction of 40% in relative L2 error and 50% in mean absolute error in extrapolation while maintaining computational efficiency.

Conclusion: The proposed improvements significantly boost PINN extrapolation capabilities, enhancing robustness, accuracy, and computational efficiency.

Abstract: Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) are deep learning models that
incorporate the governing physical laws of a system into the learning process,
making them well-suited for solving complex scientific and engineering
problems. Recently, PINNs have gained widespread attention as a powerful
framework for combining physical principles with data-driven modeling to
improve prediction accuracy. Despite their successes, however, PINNs often
exhibit poor extrapolation performance outside the training domain and are
highly sensitive to the choice of activation functions (AFs). In this paper, we
introduce a transfer learning (TL) method to improve the extrapolation
capability of PINNs. Our approach applies transfer learning (TL) within an
extended training domain, using only a small number of carefully selected
collocation points. Additionally, we propose an adaptive AF that takes the form
of a linear combination of standard AFs, which improves both the robustness and
accuracy of the model. Through a series of experiments, we demonstrate that our
method achieves an average of 40% reduction in relative L2 error and an average
of 50% reduction in mean absolute error in the extrapolation domain, all
without a significant increase in computational cost. The code is available at

### [168] [Federated Learning in Open- and Closed-Loop EMG Decoding: A Privacy and Performance Perspective](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12652)
*Kai Malcolm,César Uribe,Momona Yamagami*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This study explores federated learning (FL) for neural decoding, demonstrating its strengths and challenges in balancing performance and privacy in open-loop versus closed-loop settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The current neural interfaces face challenges in sharing sensitive neural data—crucial for training decoders—while preserving user privacy.

Method: FL-based neural decoding was tested on high-dimensional electromyography signals in both open-loop simulations and closed-loop real-time scenarios.

Result: In open-loop setups, FL outperformed local learning in both performance and privacy, but in closed-loop real-time settings, local learning achieved better performance at the expense of privacy.

Conclusion: FL methods must be tailored to adapt to real-time, single-user applications to achieve an optimal balance between performance and privacy.

Abstract: Invasive and non-invasive neural interfaces hold promise as high-bandwidth
input devices for next-generation technologies. However, neural signals
inherently encode sensitive information about an individual's identity and
health, making data sharing for decoder training a critical privacy challenge.
Federated learning (FL), a distributed, privacy-preserving learning framework,
presents a promising solution, but it remains unexplored in closed-loop
adaptive neural interfaces. Here, we introduce FL-based neural decoding and
systematically evaluate its performance and privacy using high-dimensional
electromyography signals in both open- and closed-loop scenarios. In open-loop
simulations, FL significantly outperformed local learning baselines,
demonstrating its potential for high-performance, privacy-conscious neural
decoding. In contrast, closed-loop user studies required adapting FL methods to
accommodate single-user, real-time interactions, a scenario not supported by
standard FL. This modification resulted in local learning decoders surpassing
the adapted FL approach in closed-loop performance, yet local learning still
carried higher privacy risks. Our findings highlight a critical
performance-privacy tradeoff in real-time adaptive applications and indicate
the need for FL methods specifically designed for co-adaptive, single-user
applications.

### [169] [A Kernel Distribution Closeness Testing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12843)
*Zhijian Zhou,Liuhua Peng,Xunye Tian,Feng Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A new metric, norm-adaptive MMD (NAMMD), is proposed to improve distribution closeness testing for complex data by scaling MMD values using RKHS norms, achieving higher test power and validating results experimentally.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional methods for distribution closeness testing struggle with complex data, as they rely on simpler metrics like total variation. Introducing maximum mean discrepancy (MMD) is promising, but the lack of distinctiveness for different distribution norms in RKHS poses challenges.

Method: Norm-adaptive MMD (NAMMD) is designed to scale MMD values with RKHS norms of distributions, addressing the limitations of conventional MMD. NAMMD-based DCT is further built upon this, with rigorous theoretical proofs validating its improvements.

Result: NAMMD-based DCT demonstrates higher test power and bounds type-I error, validated through a series of experiments on synthetic noise and real-image datasets. Additionally, NAMMD improves performance for two-sample testing scenarios.

Conclusion: NAMMD effectively addresses limitations in existing methods, enhancing distribution closeness testing and two-sample testing with stronger test power and reliable results, making it suitable for complex data applications.

Abstract: The distribution closeness testing (DCT) assesses whether the distance
between a distribution pair is at least $\epsilon$-far. Existing DCT methods
mainly measure discrepancies between a distribution pair defined on discrete
one-dimensional spaces (e.g., using total variation), which limits their
applications to complex data (e.g., images). To extend DCT to more types of
data, a natural idea is to introduce maximum mean discrepancy (MMD), a powerful
measurement of the distributional discrepancy between two complex
distributions, into DCT scenarios. However, we find that MMD's value can be the
same for many pairs of distributions that have different norms in the same
reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS), making MMD less informative when
assessing the closeness levels for multiple distribution pairs. To mitigate the
issue, we design a new measurement of distributional discrepancy, norm-adaptive
MMD (NAMMD), which scales MMD's value using the RKHS norms of distributions.
Based on the asymptotic distribution of NAMMD, we finally propose the
NAMMD-based DCT to assess the closeness levels of a distribution pair.
Theoretically, we prove that NAMMD-based DCT has higher test power compared to
MMD-based DCT, with bounded type-I error, which is also validated by extensive
experiments on many types of data (e.g., synthetic noise, real images).
Furthermore, we also apply the proposed NAMMD for addressing the two-sample
testing problem and find NAMMD-based two-sample test has higher test power than
the MMD-based two-sample test in both theory and experiments.

TL;DR: The paper explores data heterogeneity issues, focusing on differences in data formats and the importance of appropriate data transformation for optimizing AI training and model adaptation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a lack of comprehensive reviews on strategies for addressing data heterogeneity, which hampers AI efficiency and model adaptability.

Method: This survey categorizes and systematically analyzes contemporary strategies to address data heterogeneity, focusing on transformation techniques for resolving format disparities.

Result: The study identifies key strategies and challenges involved in mitigating data heterogeneity issues, emphasizing the role of transformation techniques.

Conclusion: Effective data transformation methods are critical in resolving heterogeneity to optimize AI performance across industries, yet reviews addressing these methods are limited.

Abstract: Data heterogeneity is a prevalent issue, stemming from various conflicting
factors, making its utilization complex. This uncertainty, particularly
resulting from disparities in data formats, frequently necessitates the
involvement of experts to find resolutions. Current methodologies primarily
address conflicts related to data structures and schemas, often overlooking the
pivotal role played by data transformation. As the utilization of artificial
intelligence (AI) continues to expand, there is a growing demand for a more
streamlined data preparation process, and data transformation becomes
paramount. It customizes training data to enhance AI learning efficiency and
adapts input formats to suit diverse AI models. Selecting an appropriate
transformation technique is paramount in preserving crucial data details.
Despite the widespread integration of AI across various industries,
comprehensive reviews concerning contemporary data transformation approaches
are scarce. This survey explores the intricacies of data heterogeneity and its
underlying sources. It systematically categorizes and presents strategies to
address heterogeneity stemming from differences in data formats, shedding light
on the inherent challenges associated with each strategy.

TL;DR: PinFM is a foundational transformer-based model with 20B+ parameters developed to understand billion-scale user activity sequences. It has been optimized for scalability and latency, enabling effective recommendations in a high-throughput industrial environment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in leveraging user activity sequences for recommendations in billion-scale systems, while meeting tight cost, latency, and scalability requirements.

Method: The authors pretrained a 20B+ parameter transformer on extensive user activity data, fine-tuned it for specific applications, and introduced infrastructure and algorithmic optimizations like the Deduplicated Cross-Attention Transformer (DCAT).

Result: PinFM achieved a 600% throughput improvement and a 20% increase in engagement with new items when tested on Pinterest data.

Conclusion: PinFM successfully deploys novel techniques to address industrial recommender system challenges, enhancing the user experience for over a half billion users on Pinterest.

Abstract: User activity sequences have emerged as one of the most important signals in
recommender systems. We present a foundational model, PinFM, for understanding
user activity sequences across multiple applications at a billion-scale visual
discovery platform. We pretrain a transformer model with 20B+ parameters using
extensive user activity data, then fine-tune it for specific applications,
efficiently coupling it with existing models. While this
pretraining-and-fine-tuning approach has been popular in other domains, such as
Vision and NLP, its application in industrial recommender systems presents
numerous challenges. The foundational model must be scalable enough to score
millions of items every second while meeting tight cost and latency constraints
imposed by these systems. Additionally, it should capture the interactions
between user activities and other features and handle new items that were not
present during the pretraining stage.
  We developed innovative techniques to address these challenges. Our
infrastructure and algorithmic optimizations, such as the Deduplicated
Cross-Attention Transformer (DCAT), improved our throughput by 600% on
Pinterest internal data. We demonstrate that PinFM can learn interactions
between user sequences and candidate items by altering input sequences, leading
to a 20% increase in engagement with new items. PinFM is now deployed to help
improve the experience of more than a half billion users across various
applications.

TL;DR: The paper develops a stochastic differential equation (SDE) framework to analyze the dynamics of stochastic gradient descent (SGD) in neural network weight matrices and provides theoretical insights into their spectral structure.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Despite the success of deep learning, the theoretical understanding regarding how and why neural networks train remains unclear. This paper aims to bridge that gap by analyzing the training dynamics of weight matrices using a novel mathematical approach.

Method: The authors use a continuous-time, matrix-valued stochastic differential equation framework. They derive exact SDEs that describe the dynamics of singular values in weight matrices, providing theoretical explanations for empirically observed phenomena such as the 'bulk+tail' spectral structure.

Result: The paper shows that squared singular values follow Dyson Brownian motion with eigenvalue repulsion and that their stationary distributions align with gamma-type densities with power-law tails. Experimental validation on transformer and MLP models demonstrates agreement between theory and observed data.

Conclusion: This work provides a rigorous mathematical foundation for understanding weight matrix dynamics in deep learning, offering insights into why deep learning methods are effective.

Abstract: Deep neural networks have revolutionized machine learning, yet their training
dynamics remain theoretically unclear-we develop a continuous-time,
matrix-valued stochastic differential equation (SDE) framework that rigorously
connects the microscopic dynamics of SGD to the macroscopic evolution of
singular-value spectra in weight matrices. We derive exact SDEs showing that
squared singular values follow Dyson Brownian motion with eigenvalue repulsion,
and characterize stationary distributions as gamma-type densities with
power-law tails, providing the first theoretical explanation for the
empirically observed 'bulk+tail' spectral structure in trained networks.
Through controlled experiments on transformer and MLP architectures, we
validate our theoretical predictions and demonstrate quantitative agreement
between SDE-based forecasts and observed spectral evolution, providing a
rigorous foundation for understanding why deep learning works.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve training efficiency and model performance by addressing issues of varied data quality and redundancy in large real-world datasets.

Method: A dynamic dataset pruning framework that adaptively selects training samples using task-driven difficulty and cross-modality semantic consistency, leveraging pretrained multimodal foundation models.

Result: The framework effectively filters out uninformative samples and demonstrates the potential of cross-modality alignment for robust sample selection.

Conclusion: Integrating cross-modality alignment enables more efficient and robust data-centric learning practices across diverse application domains.

Abstract: Modern deep models are trained on large real-world datasets, where data
quality varies and redundancy is common. Data-centric approaches such as
dataset pruning have shown promise in improving training efficiency and model
performance. However, most existing methods rely on static heuristics or
task-specific metrics, limiting their robustness and generalizability across
domains. In this work, we introduce a dynamic dataset pruning framework that
adaptively selects training samples based on both task-driven difficulty and
cross-modality semantic consistency. By incorporating supervision from
pretrained multimodal foundation models, our approach captures training
dynamics while effectively filtering out uninformative samples. Our work
highlights the potential of integrating cross-modality alignment for robust
sample selection, advancing data-centric learning toward more efficient and
robust practices across application domains.

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Layer Separation (LySep) model to optimize deep learning-based solutions for PDEs by decomposing deep networks into shallow networks, improving performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing deep learning methods struggle with non-convex loss functions, poor convergence, and gradient issues when solving partial differential equations (PDEs).

Method: Introduce auxiliary variables to decouple deep neural network layers into shallow architectures and design loss functions for neighboring layer pairs, updated by specialized alternating direction algorithms.

Result: The proposed LySep model demonstrated improved loss minimization and error reduction in high-dimensional tests, and theoretical consistency with the original deep model was confirmed.

Conclusion: The LySep framework successfully addresses optimization challenges in deep neural networks and opens up new potential for improving PDE solutions.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a new optimization framework, the layer separation
(LySep) model, to improve the deep learning-based methods in solving partial
differential equations. Due to the highly non-convex nature of the loss
function in deep learning, existing optimization algorithms often converge to
suboptimal local minima or suffer from gradient explosion or vanishing,
resulting in poor performance. To address these issues, we introduce auxiliary
variables to separate the layers of deep neural networks. Specifically, the
output and its derivatives of each layer are represented by auxiliary
variables, effectively decomposing the deep architecture into a series of
shallow architectures. New loss functions with auxiliary variables are
established, in which only variables from two neighboring layers are coupled.
Corresponding algorithms based on alternating directions are developed, where
many variables can be updated optimally in closed forms. Moreover, we provide
theoretical analyses demonstrating the consistency between the LySep model and
the original deep model. High-dimensional numerical results validate our theory
and demonstrate the advantages of LySep in minimizing loss and reducing
solution error.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The financial risks for SMEs listed on the NEEQ platform are high due to their limited size and financial resilience. Current methods are insufficient to address these risks comprehensively.

Method: The authors developed a Triple-Channel Graph Isomorphism Network (GIN) that integrates numeric, textual, and graph-based enterprise relationship data. An attention-based mechanism and gating unit combine these representations for superior prediction robustness and accuracy.

Result: Experiments with data from 7,731 NEEQ companies show that the proposed model outperforms traditional machine learning and single-modality systems in metrics like AUC, Precision, Recall, and F1 Score.

Conclusion: This framework advances financial risk prediction for SMEs, offering a comprehensive tool for regulators and investors while contributing to theoretical and practical understanding of risk modeling.

Abstract: With the continuous evolution of China's multi-level capital market, the
National Equities Exchange and Quotations (NEEQ), also known as the "New Third
Board," has become a critical financing platform for small and medium-sized
enterprises (SMEs). However, due to their limited scale and financial
resilience, many NEEQ-listed companies face elevated risks of financial
distress. To address this issue, we propose a multi-channel deep learning
framework that integrates structured financial indicators, textual disclosures,
and enterprise relationship data for comprehensive financial risk prediction.
Specifically, we design a Triple-Channel Graph Isomorphism Network (GIN) that
processes numeric, textual, and graph-based inputs separately. These
modality-specific representations are fused using an attention-based mechanism
followed by a gating unit to enhance robustness and prediction accuracy.
Experimental results on data from 7,731 real-world NEEQ companies demonstrate
that our model significantly outperforms traditional machine learning methods

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces FLDmamba, a novel framework utilizing Fourier and Laplace transforms to improve long-term time series predictions. It outperforms Transformer-based and Mamba-based architectures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for time series predictions face challenges such as non-stationarity, multi-scale periodicity, and transient dynamics. The inefficiency of Transformers and the limitations of State-Space Models, like Mamba, motivate the need for a more robust and efficient solution.

Method: The proposed FLDmamba integrates Fourier and Laplace transforms to effectively capture multi-scale periodicity and transient dynamics while enhancing resistance to data noise problems in time series.

Result: Experiments demonstrate that FLDmamba achieves superior results on benchmarks, surpassing Transformer-based and other Mamba-based models in accuracy and efficiency for long-term predictions.

Conclusion: FLDmamba addresses the challenges associated with time series prediction by combining Fourier and Laplace transforms, offering a robust alternative to existing models and pushing the boundaries in long-term time series prediction tasks.

Abstract: Time series prediction, a crucial task across various domains, faces
significant challenges due to the inherent complexities of time series data,
including non-stationarity, multi-scale periodicity, and transient dynamics,
particularly when tackling long-term predictions. While Transformer-based
architectures have shown promise, their quadratic complexity with sequence
length hinders their efficiency for long-term predictions. Recent advancements
in State-Space Models, such as Mamba, offer a more efficient alternative for
long-term modeling, but they cannot capture multi-scale periodicity and
transient dynamics effectively. Meanwhile, they are susceptible to data noise
issues in time series. This paper proposes a novel framework, FLDmamba (Fourier
and Laplace Transform Decomposition Mamba), addressing these limitations.
FLDmamba leverages the strengths of both Fourier and Laplace transforms to
effectively capture both multi-scale periodicity, transient dynamics within
time series data, and improve the robustness of the model to the data noise
issue. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that FLDmamba achieves superior
performance on time series prediction benchmarks, outperforming both
Transformer-based and other Mamba-based architectures. To promote the

### [178] [PMKLC: Parallel Multi-Knowledge Learning-based Lossless Compression for Large-Scale Genomics Database](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12805)
*Hui Sun,Yanfeng Ding,Liping Yi,Huidong Ma,Gang Wang,Xiaoguang Liu,Cheng Zhong,Wentong Cai*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces PMKLC, a novel learning-based lossless genomic data compressor with improved compression ratio, throughput, and robustness, benchmarked against 14 baselines across 15 datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing learning-based lossless compressors face challenges such as inadequate compression ratios, low throughput, and poor robustness, limiting their adoption in genomic data applications.

Method: The PMKLC framework integrates automated multi-knowledge learning for compression, a GPU-accelerated ($s$,$k$)-mer encoder, data block partitioning, the SMP mechanism for parallelism, and two operational modes (PMKLC-S for single GPU and PMKLC-M for multi-GPU).

Result: PMKLC-S/M outperformed 14 baselines in tests, achieving up to 73.609% and 73.480% better compression ratios, and up to 3.036x and 10.710x higher throughput, respectively. The models also demonstrated superior robustness and memory efficiency.

Conclusion: PMKLC-S/M show significant advancements in compression efficiency, throughput, robustness, and memory usage, making them suitable for diverse genomic data scenarios and resource-constrained settings.

Abstract: Learning-based lossless compressors play a crucial role in large-scale
genomic database backup, storage, transmission, and management. However, their
1) inadequate compression ratio, 2) low compression \& decompression
throughput, and 3) poor compression robustness limit their widespread adoption
and application in both industry and academia. To solve those challenges, we
propose a novel \underline{P}arallel \underline{M}ulti-\underline{K}nowledge
\underline{L}earning-based \underline{C}ompressor (PMKLC) with four crucial
designs: 1) We propose an automated multi-knowledge learning-based compression
framework as compressors' backbone to enhance compression ratio and robustness;
2) we design a GPU-accelerated ($s$,$k$)-mer encoder to optimize compression
throughput and computing resource usage; 3) we introduce data block
partitioning and Step-wise Model Passing (SMP) mechanisms for parallel
acceleration; 4) We design two compression modes PMKLC-S and PMKLC-M to meet
the complex application scenarios, where the former runs on a
resource-constrained single GPU and the latter is multi-GPU accelerated. We
benchmark PMKLC-S/M and 14 baselines (7 traditional and 7 leaning-based) on 15
real-world datasets with different species and data sizes. Compared to
baselines on the testing datasets, PMKLC-S/M achieve the average compression
ratio improvement up to 73.609\% and 73.480\%, the average throughput
improvement up to 3.036$\times$ and 10.710$\times$, respectively. Besides,
PMKLC-S/M also achieve the best robustness and competitive memory cost,
indicating its greater stability against datasets with different probability
distribution perturbations, and its strong ability to run on memory-constrained
devices.

*Sven Dummer,Dongwei Ye,Christoph Brune*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces RONOM, combining Reduced Order Modeling (ROM) and neural operators to achieve superior performance in partial differential equation modeling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations of existing computational models like ROM and neural operators in handling varying discretizations and quantifying errors in physics-based scenarios.

Method: Developing RONOM framework by blending concepts of ROM and operator learning, establishing error bounds, and testing on numerical examples.

Result: RONOM achieves comparable generalization performance and excels in spatial super-resolution, discretization robustness, and temporal super-resolution compared to existing neural operators.

Conclusion: RONOM effectively bridges ROM and neural operator methods, offering flexibility, accuracy, and robustness in computational modeling.

Abstract: Time-dependent partial differential equations are ubiquitous in physics-based
modeling, but they remain computationally intensive in many-query scenarios,
such as real-time forecasting, optimal control, and uncertainty quantification.
Reduced-order modeling (ROM) addresses these challenges by constructing a
low-dimensional surrogate model but relies on a fixed discretization, which
limits flexibility across varying meshes during evaluation. Operator learning
approaches, such as neural operators, offer an alternative by parameterizing
mappings between infinite-dimensional function spaces, enabling adaptation to
data across different resolutions. Whereas ROM provides rigorous numerical
error estimates, neural operator learning largely focuses on discretization
convergence and invariance without quantifying the error between the
infinite-dimensional and the discretized operators. This work introduces the
reduced-order neural operator modeling (RONOM) framework, which bridges
concepts from ROM and operator learning. We establish a discretization error
bound analogous to those in ROM, and get insights into RONOM's discretization
convergence and discretization robustness. Moreover, two numerical examples are
presented that compare RONOM to existing neural operators for solving partial
differential equations. The results demonstrate that RONOM using standard
vector-to-vector neural networks achieves comparable performance in input
generalization and superior performance in both spatial super-resolution and
discretization robustness, while also offering novel insights into temporal
super-resolution scenarios.

### [180] [From Novelty to Imitation: Self-Distilled Rewards for Offline Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12815)
*Gaurav Chaudhary,Laxmidhar Behera*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces ReLOAD, a framework for offline RL that uses intrinsic rewards from state transition prediction errors, eliminating the need for handcrafted reward annotations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the practical challenges of offline RL, particularly the dependency on explicit and often expensive reward annotations.

Method: ReLOAD leverages Random Network Distillation (RND) to create intrinsic rewards. It trains a predictor network to mimic target network embeddings based on expert state transitions and uses prediction errors as rewards.

Result: ReLOAD performs robustly on the D4RL benchmark, achieving results comparable to offline RL methods that use traditional reward annotations.

Conclusion: ReLOAD simplifies offline RL by eliminating the need for explicit reward annotations, thereby encouraging broader and more accessible applications of offline RL.

Abstract: Offline Reinforcement Learning (RL) aims to learn effective policies from a
static dataset without requiring further agent-environment interactions.
However, its practical adoption is often hindered by the need for explicit
reward annotations, which can be costly to engineer or difficult to obtain
retrospectively. To address this, we propose ReLOAD (Reinforcement Learning
with Offline Reward Annotation via Distillation), a novel reward annotation
framework for offline RL. Unlike existing methods that depend on complex
alignment procedures, our approach adapts Random Network Distillation (RND) to
generate intrinsic rewards from expert demonstrations using a simple yet
effective embedding discrepancy measure. First, we train a predictor network to
mimic a fixed target network's embeddings based on expert state transitions.
Later, the prediction error between these networks serves as a reward signal
for each transition in the static dataset. This mechanism provides a structured
reward signal without requiring handcrafted reward annotations. We provide a
formal theoretical construct that offers insights into how RND prediction
errors effectively serve as intrinsic rewards by distinguishing expert-like
transitions. Experiments on the D4RL benchmark demonstrate that ReLOAD enables
robust offline policy learning and achieves performance competitive with
traditional reward-annotated methods.

*Kaiqi Jiang,Jeremy Cohen,Yuanzhi Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper investigates how the eigenvectors of Neural Tangent Kernels (NTKs) behave during the Edge of Stability (EoS), observing alignment with training targets and providing analysis for linear networks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the missing understanding of NTK eigenvector behavior during the Edge of Stability (EoS) in Gradient Descent (GD) training.

Method: The study combines empirical observations across architectures with a theoretical analysis of a two-layer linear network.

Result: It was observed that larger learning rates result in greater alignment of NTK eigenvectors with training targets.

Conclusion: This work deepens the understanding of training dynamics in deep learning, particularly how NTK eigenvectors behave during EoS.

Abstract: The study of Neural Tangent Kernels (NTKs) in deep learning has drawn
increasing attention in recent years. NTKs typically actively change during
training and are related to feature learning. In parallel, recent work on
Gradient Descent (GD) has found a phenomenon called Edge of Stability (EoS), in
which the largest eigenvalue of the NTK oscillates around a value inversely
proportional to the step size. However, although follow-up works have explored
the underlying mechanism of such eigenvalue behavior in depth, the
understanding of the behavior of the NTK eigenvectors during EoS is still
missing. This paper examines the dynamics of NTK eigenvectors during EoS in
detail. Across different architectures, we observe that larger learning rates
cause the leading eigenvectors of the final NTK, as well as the full NTK
matrix, to have greater alignment with the training target. We then study the
underlying mechanism of this phenomenon and provide a theoretical analysis for
a two-layer linear network. Our study enhances the understanding of GD training
dynamics in deep learning.

*Danilo Avola,Andrea Bernardini,Francesco Danese,Mario Lezoche,Maurizio Mancini,Daniele Pannone,Amedeo Ranaldi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a transformer-based method for identifying individuals using Wi-Fi signals (CSI) while stationary, achieving 99.82% accuracy using low-cost hardware.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore human identification using Wi-Fi signals (CSI) as a privacy-preserving and non-intrusive alternative to vision-based systems, particularly in stationary scenarios.

Method: A tailored preprocessing pipeline processes CSI data, and a dual-branch transformer architecture handles amplitude and phase modalities separately for classification.

Result: Achieved 99.82% classification accuracy using the proposed method, outperforming conventional convolutional and multilayer perceptron baselines.

Conclusion: The paper demonstrates the feasibility of passive, device-free person identification using commodity Wi-Fi hardware, underscoring the discriminative power of CSI-based techniques in real-world environments.

Abstract: Wi-Fi sensing is gaining momentum as a non-intrusive and privacy-preserving
alternative to vision-based systems for human identification. However, person
identification through wireless signals, particularly without user motion,
remains largely unexplored. Most prior wireless-based approaches rely on
movement patterns, such as walking gait, to extract biometric cues. In
contrast, we propose a transformer-based method that identifies individuals
from Channel State Information (CSI) recorded while the subject remains
stationary. CSI captures fine-grained amplitude and phase distortions induced
by the unique interaction between the human body and the radio signal. To
support evaluation, we introduce a dataset acquired with ESP32 devices in a
controlled indoor environment, featuring six participants observed across
multiple orientations. A tailored preprocessing pipeline, including outlier
removal, smoothing, and phase calibration, enhances signal quality. Our
dual-branch transformer architecture processes amplitude and phase modalities
separately and achieves 99.82\% classification accuracy, outperforming
convolutional and multilayer perceptron baselines. These results demonstrate
the discriminative potential of CSI perturbations, highlighting their capacity
to encode biometric traits in a consistent manner. They further confirm the
viability of passive, device-free person identification using low-cost
commodity Wi-Fi hardware in real-world settings.

*Chongli Qin,Jost Tobias Springenberg*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper explores the connection between supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning (RL), proposing an improved variant called importance weighted supervised fine-tuning (iw-SFT), which optimizes a tighter bound on the RL objective and outperforms traditional SFT in various tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to improve supervised fine-tuning (SFT) by leveraging its inherent connection to reinforcement learning (RL), aiming to achieve better performance with simpler and more effective training techniques.

Method: The paper introduces importance weighted supervised fine-tuning (iw-SFT), a modified SFT approach that reweights the data based on importance, leading to a tighter optimization of the RL objective. This method leverages quality-scored data for further generalization.

Result: iw-SFT demonstrates competitive performance with advanced RL algorithms on large language models and continuous control tasks, achieving results like 66.7% on the AIME 2024 dataset.

Conclusion: The study shows that iw-SFT is a simple yet effective extension of traditional SFT, bridging the gap with RL methodologies and improving over standard practices in fine-tuning language models and control policy training.

Abstract: Behavior Cloning (BC) on curated (or filtered) data is the predominant
paradigm for supervised fine-tuning (SFT) of large language models; as well as
for imitation learning of control policies. Here, we draw on a connection
between this successful strategy and the theory and practice of finding optimal
policies via Reinforcement Learning (RL). Building on existing literature, we
clarify that SFT can be understood as maximizing a lower bound on the RL
objective in a sparse reward setting. Giving support to its often observed good
performance. From this viewpoint, we realize that a small modification to SFT
leads to an importance weighted variant that behaves closer to training with RL
as it: i) optimizes a tighter bound to the RL objective and, ii) can improve
performance compared to SFT on curated data. We refer to this variant as
importance weighted supervised fine-tuning (iw-SFT). We show that it is easy to
implement and can be further generalized to training with quality scored data.
The resulting SFT variants are competitive with more advanced RL algorithms for
large language models and for training policies in continuous control tasks.
For example achieving 66.7% on the AIME 2024 dataset.

TL;DR: This work studies the feasibility of using ear-EEG signals for biometric authentication and achieves 82% accuracy in identifying subjects.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional EEG-based biometric systems are secure but lack usability due to cumbersome setups. This paper aims to replace scalp-based EEG with a more practical and user-friendly ear-EEG approach.

Method: The authors developed a framework extracting temporal and spectral features from ear-EEG signals, utilizing a fully connected deep neural network for subject identification.

Result: Experimental results exhibited an average identification accuracy of 82% using the currently available ear-EEG dataset.

Conclusion: Ear-EEG is a promising and practical method for biometric authentication in real-world systems.

Abstract: This work explores the feasibility of biometric authentication using EEG
signals acquired through in-ear devices, commonly referred to as ear-EEG.
Traditional EEG-based biometric systems, while secure, often suffer from low
usability due to cumbersome scalp-based electrode setups. In this study, we
propose a novel and practical framework leveraging ear-EEG signals as a
user-friendly alternative for everyday biometric authentication. The system
extracts an original combination of temporal and spectral features from ear-EEG
signals and feeds them into a fully connected deep neural network for subject
identification. Experimental results on the only currently available ear-EEG
dataset suitable for different purposes, including biometric authentication,
demonstrate promising performance, with an average accuracy of 82\% in a
subject identification scenario. These findings confirm the potential of
ear-EEG as a viable and deployable direction for next-generation real-world
biometric systems.

TL;DR: The paper presents VIDAR, a framework that uses video diffusion-based pre-training and a masked dynamics model to advance bimanual robotic manipulation with minimal human demonstration data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address data scarcity and embodiment heterogeneity, which are significant barriers to scaling bimanual robotic manipulation in real-world diverse settings.

Method: The researchers introduced a two-stage VIDAR framework featuring video diffusion-based pre-training with 750K multi-view videos and a masked inverse dynamics model for extracting action-relevant information without pixel-level labels.

Result: VIDAR demonstrates generalization to unseen tasks and backgrounds with just 20 minutes of demonstration data, outperforming state-of-the-art methods while requiring only 1% of typical data.

Conclusion: The study establishes the potential of video foundation models paired with masked prediction techniques to facilitate scalable, generalizable robotic manipulation in real-world environments.

Abstract: Bimanual robotic manipulation, which involves the coordinated control of two
robotic arms, is foundational for solving challenging tasks. Despite recent
progress in general-purpose manipulation, data scarcity and embodiment
heterogeneity remain serious obstacles to further scaling up in bimanual
settings. In this paper, we introduce VIdeo Diffusion for Action Reasoning
(VIDAR), a two-stage framework that leverages large-scale, diffusion-based
video pre-training and a novel masked inverse dynamics model for action
prediction. We pre-train the video diffusion model on 750K multi-view videos
from three real-world bimanual robot platforms, utilizing a unified observation
space that encodes robot, camera, task, and scene contexts. Our masked inverse
dynamics model learns masks to extract action-relevant information from
generated trajectories without requiring pixel-level labels, and the masks can
effectively generalize to unseen backgrounds. Our experiments demonstrate that
with only 20 minutes of human demonstrations on an unseen robot platform (only
1% of typical data requirements), VIDAR generalizes to unseen tasks and
backgrounds with strong semantic understanding, surpassing state-of-the-art
methods. Our findings highlight the potential of video foundation models,
coupled with masked action prediction, to enable scalable and generalizable
robotic manipulation in diverse real-world settings.

*Luca Stradiotti,Dario Pesenti,Stefano Teso,Jesse Davis*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces ULER, a machine learning framework to reject predictions with low-quality explanations, using human feedback to enhance trust and decision-making in high-stakes applications like credit scoring.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve trust assessment and decision-making in high-stakes applications, where low-quality explanations for machine learning predictions can hinder users' understanding and belief in the predictions.

Method: The proposed method involves a rejector framework, ULER, which evaluates the quality of explanations using human ratings and per-feature relevance judgments, focusing on popular attribution techniques.

Result: ULER outperforms existing methods for learning to reject low-quality explanations across eight classification and regression benchmarks, as well as a new publicly released human-annotated dataset.

Conclusion: Equipping predictors with the ability to reject low-quality explanations can improve trust and decision-making, and ULER provides a promising approach for addressing this challenge.

Abstract: Machine Learning predictors are increasingly being employed in high-stakes
applications such as credit scoring. Explanations help users unpack the reasons
behind their predictions, but are not always "high quality''. That is,
end-users may have difficulty interpreting or believing them, which can
complicate trust assessment and downstream decision-making. We argue that
classifiers should have the option to refuse handling inputs whose predictions
cannot be explained properly and introduce a framework for learning to reject
low-quality explanations (LtX) in which predictors are equipped with a rejector
that evaluates the quality of explanations. In this problem setting, the key
challenges are how to properly define and assess explanation quality and how to
design a suitable rejector. Focusing on popular attribution techniques, we
introduce ULER (User-centric Low-quality Explanation Rejector), which learns a
simple rejector from human ratings and per-feature relevance judgments to
mirror human judgments of explanation quality. Our experiments show that ULER
outperforms both state-of-the-art and explanation-aware learning to reject
strategies at LtX on eight classification and regression benchmarks and on a
new human-annotated dataset, which we will publicly release to support future
research.

*Jiadong Chen,Hengyu Ye,Fuxin Jiang,Xiao He,Tieying Zhang,Jianjun Chen,Xiaofeng Gao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes Fremer, a deep forecasting model focusing on efficiency, accuracy, and robustness for cloud service workload forecasting, outperforming state-of-the-art models while reducing computational costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation stems from addressing inefficiencies of Transformer-based models for workload forecasting in cloud environments and leveraging frequency domain techniques for better performance.

Method: Fremer incorporates advanced algorithms designed for efficient and accurate workload forecasting, specifically targeting multi-period patterns while employing frequency domain methodologies.

Result: Extensive experiments indicate that Fremer surpasses SOTA models in metrics like MSE, MAE, and SMAPE, achieving reductions in parameter size and computational costs. Furthermore, practical tests show improvements in latency and resource consumption.

Conclusion: Fremer is an innovative and practical forecasting model excelling in multi-period workload forecasting scenarios, proving to be both effective academically and applicable practically in real environments like Kubernetes.

Abstract: Workload forecasting is pivotal in cloud service applications, such as
auto-scaling and scheduling, with profound implications for operational
efficiency. Although Transformer-based forecasting models have demonstrated
remarkable success in general tasks, their computational efficiency often falls
short of the stringent requirements in large-scale cloud environments. Given
that most workload series exhibit complicated periodic patterns, addressing
these challenges in the frequency domain offers substantial advantages. To this
end, we propose Fremer, an efficient and effective deep forecasting model.
Fremer fulfills three critical requirements: it demonstrates superior
efficiency, outperforming most Transformer-based forecasting models; it
achieves exceptional accuracy, surpassing all state-of-the-art (SOTA) models in
workload forecasting; and it exhibits robust performance for multi-period
series. Furthermore, we collect and open-source four high-quality, open-source
workload datasets derived from ByteDance's cloud services, encompassing
workload data from thousands of computing instances. Extensive experiments on
both our proprietary datasets and public benchmarks demonstrate that Fremer
consistently outperforms baseline models, achieving average improvements of
5.5% in MSE, 4.7% in MAE, and 8.6% in SMAPE over SOTA models, while
simultaneously reducing parameter scale and computational costs. Additionally,
in a proactive auto-scaling test based on Kubernetes, Fremer improves average
latency by 18.78% and reduces resource consumption by 2.35%, underscoring its
practical efficacy in real-world applications.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces an uncertainty-aware approach to guide explainability in machine learning by distinguishing between aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The increasing complexity of machine learning models has reduced interpretability, demanding new methods for transparent model predictions.

Method: The authors use uncertainty quantification—aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty—to select and refine explanation methods, emphasizing robustness and informativeness.

Result: The proposed framework improves robustness and attainability of explanations in machine learning and deep learning scenarios.

Conclusion: Uncertainty quantification adds a valuable layer to model explanation methods, enhancing transparency in predictions across different learning paradigms.

Abstract: Recent advancements in machine learning have emphasized the need for
transparency in model predictions, particularly as interpretability diminishes
when using increasingly complex architectures. In this paper, we propose
leveraging prediction uncertainty as a complementary approach to classical
explainability methods. Specifically, we distinguish between aleatoric
(data-related) and epistemic (model-related) uncertainty to guide the selection
of appropriate explanations. Epistemic uncertainty serves as a rejection
criterion for unreliable explanations and, in itself, provides insight into
insufficient training (a new form of explanation). Aleatoric uncertainty
informs the choice between feature-importance explanations and counterfactual
explanations. This leverages a framework of explainability methods driven by
uncertainty quantification and disentanglement. Our experiments demonstrate the
impact of this uncertainty-aware approach on the robustness and attainability
of explanations in both traditional machine learning and deep learning
scenarios.

TL;DR: Researchers introduce TReconLM, a language model-based trace reconstruction approach that improves sequence recovery from noisy copies in scenarios like DNA data storage.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the issue of reconstructing original sequences affected by deletions, insertions, and substitutions, which is critical for applications such as DNA data storage that suffer from errors during synthesis, storage, and sequencing.

Method: The authors present TReconLM, which utilizes language models trained on next-token prediction. These models are pretrained on synthetic data and fine-tuned on real data to handle specific error patterns effectively.

Result: TReconLM achieves superior performance compared to state-of-the-art trace reconstruction methods, including other deep learning approaches, by recovering a significantly higher fraction of sequences without errors.

Conclusion: The research demonstrates the potential of TReconLM as a more effective and accurate tool in trace reconstruction, paving the way for improved technology performance in DNA data storage and similar fields.

Abstract: The general trace reconstruction problem seeks to recover an original
sequence from its noisy copies independently corrupted by deletions,
insertions, and substitutions. This problem arises in applications such as DNA
data storage, a promising storage medium due to its high information density
and longevity. However, errors introduced during DNA synthesis, storage, and
sequencing require correction through algorithms and codes, with trace
reconstruction often used as part of the data retrieval process. In this work,
we propose TReconLM, which leverages language models trained on next-token
prediction for trace reconstruction. We pretrain language models on synthetic
data and fine-tune on real-world data to adapt to technology-specific error
patterns. TReconLM outperforms state-of-the-art trace reconstruction
algorithms, including prior deep learning approaches, recovering a
substantially higher fraction of sequences without error.

TL;DR: The paper introduces two modifications to the DAPO algorithm, leveraging a mixed-policy approach to enhance stability and efficiency in policy optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard policy gradient methods struggle with instability and sample inefficiency, especially in sparse reward environments.

Method: The authors propose incorporating a pre-trained guiding policy for off-policy experience and utilizing zero-reward samples guided by an expert policy to improve training stability and sample efficiency.

Result: The modifications improve training stability, speed of convergence, and sample efficiency in policy optimization. The proposed objectives converge theoretically to optimal solutions in reinforcement learning.

Conclusion: The mixed-policy approach balances exploration and exploitation effectively, advancing the efficiency and stability of policy optimization in reinforcement learning contexts.

Abstract: This paper introduces two novel modifications to the Differentiable Automatic
Post-editing Optimization (DAPO) algorithm, approached from a mixed-policy
perspective. Standard policy gradient methods can suffer from instability and
sample inefficiency, particularly in sparse reward settings. To address this,
we first propose a method that incorporates a pre-trained, stable guiding
policy ($\piphi$) to provide off-policy experience, thereby regularizing the
training of the target policy ($\pion$). This approach improves training
stability and convergence speed by adaptively adjusting the learning step size.
Secondly, we extend this idea to re-utilize zero-reward samples, which are
often discarded by dynamic sampling strategies like DAPO's. By treating these
samples as a distinct batch guided by the expert policy, we further enhance
sample efficiency. We provide a theoretical analysis for both methods,
demonstrating that their objective functions converge to the optimal solution
within the established theoretical framework of reinforcement learning. The
proposed mixed-policy framework effectively balances exploration and
exploitation, promising more stable and efficient policy optimization.

*Weiqiu You,Anton Xue,Shreya Havaldar,Delip Rao,Helen Jin,Chris Callison-Burch,Eric Wong*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces ARES, a probabilistic framework that detects and corrects propagated errors in reasoning chains generated by large language models through an inductive method providing nuanced scoring and statistical soundness guarantees.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Initial errors in reasoning chains often propagate in large language models, causing reliability issues in final conclusions, while existing detection methods fail to address this propagation effectively.

Method: The ARES framework judges each claim based solely on previously-assessed sound premises using an inductive probabilistic approach, offering nuanced scores instead of binary labels and certified statistical guarantees.

Result: ARES achieves state-of-the-art performance across four benchmarks, significantly improving Macro-F1 scores (+8.2 points) and demonstrating robustness in very long reasoning chains by excelling in detecting propagated errors (+27.6 F1 points).

Conclusion: ARES offers a robust solution to error propagation in reasoning chains, improving reliability and providing statistical assurance of soundness, which enhances error detection and correction capabilities in large language models.

Abstract: In reasoning chains generated by large language models (LLMs), initial errors
often propagate and undermine the reliability of the final conclusion. Current
LLM-based error detection methods often fail to detect propagated errors
because they do not properly account for how earlier errors might corrupt
judgments of downstream reasoning. To better detect such propagated errors, we
introduce Autoregressive Reasoning Entailment Stability (ARES), a novel
probabilistic framework that prevents error propagation by judging each claim
based only on previously-assessed sound premises. This inductive method yields
a nuanced score for each step and provides certified statistical guarantees of
its soundness, rather than a brittle binary label. ARES achieves
state-of-the-art performance across four benchmarks (72.1% Macro-F1, +8.2
points) and demonstrates superior robustness on very long synthetic reasoning
chains, where it excels at detecting propagated errors (90.3% F1, +27.6
points).

Motivation: The paper aims to advance AI model interpretability, crucial for healthcare applications where decisions can have significant consequences.

Method: The authors utilized sparse autoencoders (SAEs) to explore the internal representations of MAIRA-2, applying metrics for automated interpretability to identify clinical features.

Result: They revealed key internal concepts like medical devices, pathologies, longitudinal changes, and related textual features within MAIRA-2. The steering experiments demonstrated some directional control over the model's behavior.

Conclusion: While practical and methodological hurdles remain, the work provides early insights into MAIRA-2's internal representations and emphasizes increased transparency in radiology-focused AI systems.

Abstract: Interpretability can improve the safety, transparency and trust of AI models,
which is especially important in healthcare applications where decisions often
carry significant consequences. Mechanistic interpretability, particularly
through the use of sparse autoencoders (SAEs), offers a promising approach for

In this study, we apply Matryoshka-SAE to the radiology-specialised multimodal
large language model, MAIRA-2, to interpret its internal representations. Using
large-scale automated interpretability of the SAE features, we identify a range

tube placements, pacemaker presence), pathologies such as pleural effusion and
cardiomegaly, longitudinal changes and textual features. We further examine the
influence of these features on model behaviour through steering, demonstrating
directional control over generations with mixed success. Our results reveal
practical and methodological challenges, yet they offer initial insights into
the internal concepts learned by MAIRA-2 - marking a step toward deeper

### [193] [A Spectral Interpretation of Redundancy in a Graph Reservoir](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12963)
*Anna Bison,Alessandro Sperduti*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a variant of the Multiresolution Reservoir Graph Neural Network (MRGNN) that employs a Fairing algorithm to better handle over-smoothing in graphs while improving smoothing control for applications like graph classification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Over-smoothing in graphs occurs when repeated layer applications in GNNs lead to convergence towards low-frequency graph signals, limiting training efficiency and effectiveness. The paper aims to address this issue in spectral reservoir computing models.

Method: The approach revisits the definition of the reservoir in MRGNN by incorporating the Fairing algorithm from surface design, adapted to graphs using the Laplacian operator. This algorithm acts as a pass-band spectral filter that enables smoothing without shrinkage and uses spectral coefficients for random walk modulation.

Result: Theoretical analysis shows that tuning spectral coefficients modulates redundant random walks. Exploratory experiments demonstrate the feasibility and potential of integrating the Fairing algorithm in MRGNN architecture to enhance performance in graph-related tasks.

Conclusion: The study establishes a novel spectral formulation connecting smoothing control with GNN architectures, providing insights into leveraging the Fairing algorithm for improved graph processing. It identifies future directions for advancing graph classification and related tasks.

Abstract: Reservoir computing has been successfully applied to graphs as a
preprocessing method to improve the training efficiency of Graph Neural
Networks (GNNs). However, a common issue that arises when repeatedly applying
layer operators on graphs is over-smoothing, which consists in the convergence
of graph signals toward low-frequency components of the graph Laplacian. This
work revisits the definition of the reservoir in the Multiresolution Reservoir
Graph Neural Network (MRGNN), a spectral reservoir model, and proposes a
variant based on a Fairing algorithm originally introduced in the field of
surface design in computer graphics. This algorithm provides a pass-band
spectral filter that allows smoothing without shrinkage, and it can be adapted
to the graph setting through the Laplacian operator. Given its spectral
formulation, this method naturally connects to GNN architectures for tasks
where smoothing, when properly controlled, can be beneficial,such as graph
classification. The core contribution of the paper lies in the theoretical
analysis of the algorithm from a random walks perspective. In particular, it
shows how tuning the spectral coefficients can be interpreted as modulating the
contribution of redundant random walks. Exploratory experiments based on the
MRGNN architecture illustrate the potential of this approach and suggest
promising directions for future research.

*Reza Riahi Samani,Alfredo Nunez,Bart De Schutter*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces the WaveletInception-BiLSTM network, a deep learning framework for drive-by vibrations-based infrastructure health monitoring, achieving significant advances in railway track stiffness estimation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Develop a deep learning-based system to efficiently monitor infrastructure health using drive-by vibration signals.

Method: WaveletInception-BiLSTM network integrates Learnable Wavelet Packet Transform, 1D Inception, and BiLSTM layers to extract spectral, multi-scale, and bi-directional temporal features for health estimation.

Result: In simulated railway track analysis, the approach outperformed state-of-the-art methods in predicting ballast and railpad stiffness parameters.

Conclusion: The methodology demonstrates potential for accurate, localized, and automated infrastructure health monitoring.

Abstract: This paper presents a novel deep learning-based framework for infrastructure
health monitoring using drive-by vibration response signals. Recognizing the
importance of spectral and temporal information, we introduce the
WaveletInception-BiLSTM network. The WaveletInception feature extractor
utilizes a Learnable Wavelet Packet Transform (LWPT) as the stem for extracting
vibration signal features, incorporating spectral information in the early
network layers. This is followed by 1D Inception networks that extract
multi-scale, high-level features at deeper layers. The extracted vibration
signal features are then integrated with operational conditions via a Long
Short-term Memory (LSTM) layer. The resulting feature extraction network
effectively analyzes drive-by vibration signals across various measurement
speeds without preprocessing and uses LSTM to capture interrelated temporal
dependencies among different modes of information and to create feature vectors
for health condition estimation. The estimator head is designed with a
sequential modeling architecture using bidirectional LSTM (BiLSTM) networks,
capturing bi-directional temporal relationships from drive-by measurements.
This architecture allows for a high-resolution, beam-level assessment of
infrastructure health conditions. A case study focusing on railway track
stiffness estimation with simulated drive-by vibration signals shows that the
model significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in estimating railway
ballast and railpad stiffness parameters. Results underscore the potential of
this approach for accurate, localized, and fully automated drive-by
infrastructure health monitoring.

*Youssef Tawfilis,Hossam Amer,Minar El-Aasser,Tallal Elshabrawy*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a novel decentralized GAN training method utilizing data on underutilized devices without sharing raw data, combining Clustered Federated Learning and Heterogeneous split learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges of training generative AI models requiring large datasets and computational resources, especially in decentralized settings with privacy concerns and underutilized devices.

Method: Combines KLD-weighted Clustered Federated Learning for handling data heterogeneity and multi-domain datasets with Heterogeneous U-Shaped split learning to address device constraints and strict data-sharing limitations.

Result: Experimental results show consistent and significant improvements in image generation and classification metrics, achieving 1.1x–2.2x better scores and up to 50% boosts in multi-domain non-IID scenarios, with reduced latency.

Conclusion: The proposed method successfully enables decentralized training of GANs across resource-constrained heterogeneous devices while preserving strict data privacy, improving both performance and efficiency.

Abstract: Federated Learning has gained increasing attention for its ability to enable
multiple nodes to collaboratively train machine learning models without sharing
their raw data. At the same time, Generative AI -- particularly Generative
Adversarial Networks (GANs) -- have achieved remarkable success across a wide
range of domains, such as healthcare, security, and Image Generation. However,
training generative models typically requires large datasets and significant
computational resources, which are often unavailable in real-world settings.
Acquiring such resources can be costly and inefficient, especially when many
underutilized devices -- such as IoT devices and edge devices -- with varying
capabilities remain idle. Moreover, obtaining large datasets is challenging due
to privacy concerns and copyright restrictions, as most devices are unwilling
to share their data. To address these challenges, we propose a novel approach
for decentralized GAN training that enables the utilization of distributed data
and underutilized, low-capability devices while not sharing data in its raw
form. Our approach is designed to tackle key challenges in decentralized
environments, combining KLD-weighted Clustered Federated Learning to address
the issues of data heterogeneity and multi-domain datasets, with Heterogeneous
U-Shaped split learning to tackle the challenge of device heterogeneity under
strict data sharing constraints -- ensuring that no labels or raw data, whether
real or synthetic, are ever shared between nodes. Experimental results shows
that our approach demonstrates consistent and significant improvements across
key performance metrics, where it achieves 1.1x -- 2.2x higher image generation
scores, an average 10% boost in classification metrics (up to 50% in
multi-domain non-IID settings), in much lower latency compared to several
benchmarks. Find our code at https://github.com/youssefga28/HuSCF-GAN.

*Nikita Koriagin,Yaroslav Aksenov,Daniil Laptev,Gleb Gerasimov,Nikita Balagansky,Daniil Gavrilov*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper presents a method to enhance Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) for domain-specific interpretability in Large Language Models (LLMs) without full retraining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Sparse Autoencoders often fail to capture domain-specific features that are absent or underrepresented in their training datasets.

Method: A residual learning-based secondary SAE is trained on the reconstruction error of a pretrained SAE for domain-specific texts. The sum of the outputs from both models is used for inference.

Result: Significant improvements in LLM metrics such as cross-entropy and explained variance across various domains were achieved, enabling the capture of domain-specific features.

Conclusion: The introduced method improves domain-targeted interpretability of SAEs in LLMs while preserving general task performance.

Abstract: Sparse Autoencoders have emerged as powerful tools for interpreting the
internal representations of Large Language Models, yet they often fail to
capture domain-specific features not prevalent in their training corpora. This
paper introduces a residual learning approach that addresses this feature
blindness without requiring complete retraining. We propose training a
secondary SAE specifically to model the reconstruction error of a pretrained
SAE on domain-specific texts, effectively capturing features missed by the
primary model. By summing the outputs of both models during inference, we
demonstrate significant improvements in both LLM cross-entropy and explained
variance metrics across multiple specialized domains. Our experiments show that
this method efficiently incorporates new domain knowledge into existing SAEs
while maintaining their performance on general tasks. This approach enables
researchers to selectively enhance SAE interpretability for specific domains of
interest, opening new possibilities for targeted mechanistic interpretability
of LLMs.

### [197] [SMART: Relation-Aware Learning of Geometric Representations for Knowledge Graphs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13001)
*Kossi Amouzouvi,Bowen Song,Andrea Coletta,Luigi Bellomarini,Jens Lehmann,Sahar Vahdati*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper presents an enhanced framework for Knowledge Graph Embedding (KGE) models by assigning relation-specific geometric transformations, improving embedding quality and performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address the limitations of current KGE models that use one-size-fits-all geometric transformations for relations, omitting relation-specific considerations.

Method: A framework that evaluates and ranks the suitability of different geometric transformations for each relation, with options for assigning the best transformation or using majority voting. Low-dimensional attention mechanisms are used to learn relation-specific transformations, which are then used for high-dimensional embeddings.

Result: The proposed model demonstrates competitive performance against existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) KGE models on three benchmark knowledge graphs and a real-world financial knowledge graph.

Conclusion: The framework effectively captures relation-specific transformations, providing a significant advancement in the flexibility and accuracy of KGE models.

Abstract: Knowledge graph representation learning approaches provide a mapping between
symbolic knowledge in the form of triples in a knowledge graph (KG) and their
feature vectors. Knowledge graph embedding (KGE) models often represent
relations in a KG as geometric transformations. Most state-of-the-art (SOTA)
KGE models are derived from elementary geometric transformations (EGTs), such
as translation, scaling, rotation, and reflection, or their combinations. These
geometric transformations enable the models to effectively preserve specific
structural and relational patterns of the KG. However, the current use of EGTs
by KGEs remains insufficient without considering relation-specific
transformations. Although recent models attempted to address this problem by
ensembling SOTA baseline models in different ways, only a single or composite
version of geometric transformations are used by such baselines to represent
all the relations. In this paper, we propose a framework that evaluates how
well each relation fits with different geometric transformations. Based on this
ranking, the model can: (1) assign the best-matching transformation to each
relation, or (2) use majority voting to choose one transformation type to apply
across all relations. That is, the model learns a single relation-specific EGT
in low dimensional vector space through an attention mechanism. Furthermore, we
use the correlation between relations and EGTs, which are learned in a low
dimension, for relation embeddings in a high dimensional vector space. The
effectiveness of our models is demonstrated through comprehensive evaluations
on three benchmark KGs as well as a real-world financial KG, witnessing a
performance comparable to leading models

*Luis Basora,Louison Bocquet-Nouaille,Elinirina Robinson,Serge Le Gonidec*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper presents a fault detection and diagnostics system for reusable space launch vehicle engine valves using temporal convolutional autoencoders, gradient boosting classifiers, and additional techniques for reliability, based on simulated data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop an onboard fault detection and diagnostic solution for the electrical systems of reusable space launcher engine valves, addressing broader requirements like confidence estimation, OOD detection, and false alarm control.

Method: The proposed method uses a temporal convolutional autoencoder for automated feature extraction, coupled with binary and multiclass gradient boosting classifiers for fault detection and diagnosis. The system includes calibrated probability outputs, inductive conformal anomaly detection for OOD cases, and techniques like CUSUM for false alarm control.

Result: The framework was evaluated on simulated data, demonstrating its effectiveness in identifying both normal and faulty operational scenarios, though real-world validation remains pending.

Conclusion: The solution shows promise as a first step toward meeting operational requirements for fault detection in reusable space launchers, but further testing with real-world data is needed to ensure its maturity and reliability.

Abstract: In the context of the health monitoring for the next generation of reusable
space launchers, we outline a first step toward developing an onboard fault
detection and diagnostic capability for the electrical system that controls the
engine valves. Unlike existing approaches in the literature, our solution is
designed to meet a broader range of key requirements. This includes estimating
confidence levels for predictions, detecting out-of-distribution (OOD) cases,
and controlling false alarms. The proposed solution is based on a temporal
convolutional autoencoder to automatically extract low-dimensional features
from raw sensor data. Fault detection and diagnosis are respectively carried
out using a binary and a multiclass classifier trained on the autoencoder
latent and residual spaces. The classifiers are histogram-based gradient
boosting models calibrated to output probabilities that can be interpreted as
confidence levels. A relatively simple technique, based on inductive conformal
anomaly detection, is used to identify OOD data. We leverage other simple yet
effective techniques, such as cumulative sum control chart (CUSUM) to limit the
false alarms, and threshold moving to address class imbalance in fault
detection. The proposed framework is highly configurable and has been evaluated
on simulated data, covering both nominal and anomalous operational scenarios.
The results indicate that our solution is a promising first step, though
testing with real data will be necessary to ensure that it achieves the
required maturity level for operational use.

### [199] [Confidence-Filtered Relevance (CFR): An Interpretable and Uncertainty-Aware Machine Learning Framework for Naturalness Assessment in Satellite Imagery](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13034)
*Ahmed Emam,Ribana Roscher*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Confidence-Filtered Relevance (CFR) framework, combining uncertainty estimation and relevance interpretability for assessing naturalness in satellite imagery.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current satellite-based monitoring of protected natural areas faces challenges in interpretability and understanding the role of uncertainty in naturalness assessment.

Method: The CFR framework combines LRP Attention Rollout with Deep Deterministic Uncertainty (DDU) estimation, analyzing relevance heatmaps by partitioning data based on uncertainty thresholds.

Result: When applied to the AnthroProtect dataset, CFR highlighted key natural features (like shrublands and forests) and showed that higher uncertainty leads to less interpretable and more ambiguous relevance heatmaps.

Conclusion: CFR offers a systematic, data-centric method to analyze how uncertainty impacts the interpretability of naturalness patterns, aiding in ecological monitoring.

Abstract: Protected natural areas play a vital role in ecological balance and ecosystem
services. Monitoring these regions at scale using satellite imagery and machine
learning is promising, but current methods often lack interpretability and
uncertainty-awareness, and do not address how uncertainty affects naturalness
assessment. In contrast, we propose Confidence-Filtered Relevance (CFR), a
data-centric framework that combines LRP Attention Rollout with Deep
Deterministic Uncertainty (DDU) estimation to analyze how model uncertainty
influences the interpretability of relevance heatmaps. CFR partitions the
dataset into subsets based on uncertainty thresholds, enabling systematic
analysis of how uncertainty shapes the explanations of naturalness in satellite
imagery. Applied to the AnthroProtect dataset, CFR assigned higher relevance to
shrublands, forests, and wetlands, aligning with other research on naturalness
assessment. Moreover, our analysis shows that as uncertainty increases, the
interpretability of these relevance heatmaps declines and their entropy grows,
indicating less selective and more ambiguous attributions. CFR provides a
data-centric approach to assess the relevance of patterns to naturalness in
satellite imagery based on their associated certainty.

*Lefei Shen,Mouxiang Chen,Han Fu,Xiaoxue Ren,Xiaoyun Joy Wang,Jianling Sun,Zhuo Li,Chenghao Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes a taxonomy to better evaluate Transformer architectures in long-term time series forecasting (LTSF) by disentangling time-series-specific designs, identifying key insights for optimal designs, and presenting a combined improved model.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a lack of clarity on the effectiveness of different Transformer architectures (encoder-only, encoder-decoder, decoder-only) for LTSF due to their integration with time-series-specific designs.

Method: The authors introduce a taxonomy that separates architecture design elements, such as attention mechanisms and normalization layers, to enable unbiased comparisons. They conduct extensive experiments to evaluate different configurations.

Result: The study reveals that bi-directional joint attention, complete forecasting aggregation, and the direct-mapping paradigm lead to the best performance. Their combined model surpasses several existing models.

Conclusion: The proposed taxonomy clarifies the impact of various architectural choices in Transformer-based LTSF. The findings offer guidance for designing more effective models, providing a framework for consistent evaluation.

Abstract: Transformer-based models have recently become dominant in Long-term Time
Series Forecasting (LTSF), yet the variations in their architecture, such as
encoder-only, encoder-decoder, and decoder-only designs, raise a crucial
question: What Transformer architecture works best for LTSF tasks? However,
existing models are often tightly coupled with various time-series-specific
designs, making it difficult to isolate the impact of the architecture itself.
To address this, we propose a novel taxonomy that disentangles these designs,
enabling clearer and more unified comparisons of Transformer architectures. Our
taxonomy considers key aspects such as attention mechanisms, forecasting
aggregations, forecasting paradigms, and normalization layers. Through
extensive experiments, we uncover several key insights: bi-directional
attention with joint-attention is most effective; more complete forecasting
aggregation improves performance; and the direct-mapping paradigm outperforms
autoregressive approaches. Furthermore, our combined model, utilizing optimal
architectural choices, consistently outperforms several existing models,
reinforcing the validity of our conclusions. We hope these findings offer
valuable guidance for future research on Transformer architectural designs in
LTSF. Our code is available at https://github.com/HALF111/TSF_architecture.

TL;DR: This paper explores the PAC and online learnability of hypothesis classes formed by copies of an infinite graph induced by vertex permutations, revealing foundational conditions and classifications related to learnability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper seeks to understand how labeling in infinite graphs can be learned under permutations and to determine the fundamental learnability conditions of such graphs.

Method: The authors analyze finite-support vertex permutations, automorphic triviality conditions, relaxations of extension properties, and classifications using descriptive set and computability theory.

Result: The study links PAC learnability to online learnability through automorphic triviality, characterizes graphs under 2-vertex permutations, and subdivides infinite graphs into a four-class complexity partition.

Conclusion: PAC learnability of finite-support copies gives insights into online learnability of infinite graph isomorphism types, with equivalence in learnability across different vertex permutation scales.

Abstract: We study PAC and online learnability of hypothesis classes formed by copies
of a countably infinite graph G, where each copy is induced by permuting G's
vertices. This corresponds to learning a graph's labeling, knowing its
structure and label set. We consider classes where permutations move only
finitely many vertices. Our main result shows that PAC learnability of all such
finite-support copies implies online learnability of the full isomorphism type
of G, and is equivalent to the condition of automorphic triviality. We also
characterize graphs where copies induced by swapping two vertices are not
learnable, using a relaxation of the extension property of the infinite random
graph. Finally, we show that, for all G and k>2, learnability for k-vertex
permutations is equivalent to that for 2-vertex permutations, yielding a
four-class partition of infinite graphs, whose complexity we also determine
using tools coming from both descriptive set theory and computability theory.

Result: DASViT generated architectures outperform ViT-B/16 across multiple datasets while using fewer parameters and achieving higher efficiency in terms of FLOPs.

Conclusion: DASViT demonstrates the potential of differentiable NAS for ViTs, providing innovative designs with improved performance and efficiency over traditional approaches.

Abstract: Designing effective neural networks is a cornerstone of deep learning, and
Neural Architecture Search (NAS) has emerged as a powerful tool for automating
this process. Among the existing NAS approaches, Differentiable Architecture
Search (DARTS) has gained prominence for its efficiency and ease of use,
inspiring numerous advancements. Since the rise of Vision Transformers (ViT),
researchers have applied NAS to explore ViT architectures, often focusing on
macro-level search spaces and relying on discrete methods like evolutionary
algorithms. While these methods ensure reliability, they face challenges in
discovering innovative architectural designs, demand extensive computational
resources, and are time-intensive. To address these limitations, we introduce
Differentiable Architecture Search for Vision Transformer (DASViT), which
bridges the gap in differentiable search for ViTs and uncovers novel designs.
Experiments show that DASViT delivers architectures that break traditional
Transformer encoder designs, outperform ViT-B/16 on multiple datasets, and
achieve superior efficiency with fewer parameters and FLOPs.

Conclusion: MUPAX advances explainable AI by offering a reliable and universal method that fosters trust and understanding while improving model performance. Its release promises wider application for AI systems.

Abstract: Robust XAI techniques should ideally be simultaneously deterministic, model

AGNOSTIC EXPLAINABLE AI (MUPAX), a deterministic, model agnostic explainability
technique, with guaranteed convergency. MUPAX measure theoretic formulation
gives principled feature importance attribution through structured perturbation
analysis that discovers inherent input patterns and eliminates spurious
relationships. We evaluate MUPAX on an extensive range of data modalities and
tasks: audio classification (1D), image classification (2D), volumetric medical
image analysis (3D), and anatomical landmark detection, demonstrating dimension
agnostic effectiveness. The rigorous convergence guarantees extend to any loss
function and arbitrary dimensions, making MUPAX applicable to virtually any
problem context for AI. By contrast with other XAI methods that typically
decrease performance when masking, MUPAX not only preserves but actually
enhances model accuracy by capturing only the most important patterns of the
original data. Extensive benchmarking against the state of the XAI art
demonstrates MUPAX ability to generate precise, consistent and understandable
explanations, a crucial step towards explainable and trustworthy AI systems.

*Hyo-Jeong Jang,Hye-Bin Shin,Seong-Whan Lee*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper presents a cross-modal knowledge distillation framework aimed at improving EEG-based cognitive state monitoring by addressing challenges related to modality gap and label misalignment through feature semantic alignment and task-specific distillation techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reducing errors and improving model performance in EEG-based cognitive state monitoring, which suffers from noise and label inconsistencies, by leveraging knowledge distillation from visual models.

Method: A novel framework using a prototype-based similarity module for feature semantic alignment and a task-specific distillation head to resolve label misalignment.

Result: The method achieved better performance in EEG-based emotion regression and classification compared to unimodal and multimodal baselines on a public dataset.

Conclusion: This framework effectively bridges gaps in multimodal knowledge distillation, enhancing performance in brain-computer interface applications.

Abstract: Electroencephalography (EEG) is a fundamental modality for cognitive state
monitoring in brain-computer interfaces (BCIs). However, it is highly
susceptible to intrinsic signal errors and human-induced labeling errors, which
lead to label noise and ultimately degrade model performance. To enhance EEG
learning, multimodal knowledge distillation (KD) has been explored to transfer
knowledge from visual models with rich representations to EEG-based models.
Nevertheless, KD faces two key challenges: modality gap and soft label
misalignment. The former arises from the heterogeneous nature of EEG and visual
feature spaces, while the latter stems from label inconsistencies that create
discrepancies between ground truth labels and distillation targets. This paper
addresses semantic uncertainty caused by ambiguous features and weakly defined
labels. We propose a novel cross-modal knowledge distillation framework that
mitigates both modality and label inconsistencies. It aligns feature semantics
through a prototype-based similarity module and introduces a task-specific
distillation head to resolve label-induced inconsistency in supervision.
Experimental results demonstrate that our approach improves EEG-based emotion
regression and classification performance, outperforming both unimodal and
multimodal baselines on a public multimodal dataset. These findings highlight
the potential of our framework for BCI applications.

*Yuanxin Zhuang,Dazhong Shen,Ying Sun*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Neural Graph Topic Model (NGTM), a framework that generates interpretable graphs by leveraging latent topics, enabling both structural transparency and control.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current graph generation methods lack interpretability, making it hard to understand the decisions behind generated structures.

Method: NGTM utilizes topic modeling-inspired techniques, representing graphs as mixtures of latent topics, coupled with a global structural variable for transparent graph generation.

Result: NGTM achieves competitive graph generation quality while providing fine-grained interpretability and user control over graph features.

Conclusion: NGTM effectively balances the quality and interpretability of graph generation, advancing the field with a focus on semantic tracing and user-guided customization.

Abstract: Graph generation plays a pivotal role across numerous domains, including
molecular design and knowledge graph construction. Although existing methods
achieve considerable success in generating realistic graphs, their
interpretability remains limited, often obscuring the rationale behind
structural decisions. To address this challenge, we propose the Neural Graph
Topic Model (NGTM), a novel generative framework inspired by topic modeling in
natural language processing. NGTM represents graphs as mixtures of latent
topics, each defining a distribution over semantically meaningful
substructures, which facilitates explicit interpretability at both local and
global scales. The generation process transparently integrates these topic
distributions with a global structural variable, enabling clear semantic
tracing of each generated graph. Experiments demonstrate that NGTM achieves
competitive generation quality while uniquely enabling fine-grained control and
interpretability, allowing users to tune structural features or induce
biological properties through topic-level adjustments.

Result: Fine-tuned open-source TTS models on the NVTTS dataset match the performance of proprietary systems such as CosyVoice2, measured by human evaluation and metrics like speaker similarity and NV fidelity.

Conclusion: The release of the NVTTS dataset and its annotation guidelines provides a valuable resource for expressive TTS research, addressing a crucial dataset availability challenge.

Abstract: Current expressive speech synthesis models are constrained by the limited
availability of open-source datasets containing diverse nonverbal vocalizations
(NVs). In this work, we introduce NonverbalTTS (NVTTS), a 17-hour open-access
dataset annotated with 10 types of NVs (e.g., laughter, coughs) and 8 emotional
categories. The dataset is derived from popular sources, VoxCeleb and Expresso,
using automated detection followed by human validation. We propose a
comprehensive pipeline that integrates automatic speech recognition (ASR), NV
tagging, emotion classification, and a fusion algorithm to merge transcriptions
from multiple annotators. Fine-tuning open-source text-to-speech (TTS) models
on the NVTTS dataset achieves parity with closed-source systems such as
CosyVoice2, as measured by both human evaluation and automatic metrics,
including speaker similarity and NV fidelity. By releasing NVTTS and its
accompanying annotation guidelines, we address a key bottleneck in expressive
TTS research. The dataset is available at

### [208] [Spectral Bellman Method: Unifying Representation and Exploration in RL](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13181)
*Ofir Nabati,Bo Dai,Shie Mannor,Guy Tennenholtz*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces Spectral Bellman Representation, a new framework aligning representation learning with value-based reinforcement learning tasks, improving structured exploration and performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current representation learning in RL is primarily model-based and doesn't align well with value-based RL tasks, necessitating a more task-aligned approach.

Method: The authors derived a framework from the Inherent Bellman Error condition, linking value function distributions to Bellman operator dynamics via feature covariance. They designed an objective for learning state-action features aligned with these dynamics and applied simple modifications to existing algorithms.

Result: The proposed method enhanced structured exploration, improved performance in hard-exploration and long-horizon tasks, and extended naturally to multi-step Bellman operators.

Conclusion: Spectral Bellman Representation provides a theoretically-grounded and effective approach to learning better representations for value-based RL, aligning feature covariance with Bellman dynamics.

Abstract: The effect of representation has been demonstrated in reinforcement learning,
from both theoretical and empirical successes. However, the existing
representation learning mainly induced from model learning aspects, misaligning
with our RL tasks. This work introduces Spectral Bellman Representation, a
novel framework derived from the Inherent Bellman Error (IBE) condition, which
aligns with the fundamental structure of Bellman updates across a space of
possible value functions, therefore, directly towards value-based RL. Our key
insight is the discovery of a fundamental spectral relationship: under the
zero-IBE condition, the transformation of a distribution of value functions by
the Bellman operator is intrinsically linked to the feature covariance
structure. This spectral connection yields a new, theoretically-grounded
objective for learning state-action features that inherently capture this
Bellman-aligned covariance. Our method requires a simple modification to
existing algorithms. We demonstrate that our learned representations enable
structured exploration, by aligning feature covariance with Bellman dynamics,
and improve overall performance, particularly in challenging hard-exploration
and long-horizon credit assignment tasks. Our framework naturally extends to
powerful multi-step Bellman operators, further broadening its impact. Spectral
Bellman Representation offers a principled and effective path toward learning
more powerful and structurally sound representations for value-based
reinforcement learning.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper leverages Monotone Gradient Networks (mGradNets) to efficiently learn optimal transport maps using the Monge-Ampère equation, showcasing its effectiveness in robot swarm control.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To solve the Monge formulation of the optimal transport problem, particularly for modern applications like robot swarm control, by leveraging the structural advantages of mGradNets.

Method: The authors employ Monotone Gradient Networks (mGradNets), defining a training loss function based on the Monge-Ampère equation, to learn optimal transport mappings directly.

Result: The use of mGradNets shows empirical success in effectively learning optimal transport maps, demonstrated through applications like robot swarm control.

Conclusion: The structural bias of mGradNets enables effective learning of optimal transport maps, making them a valuable tool for solving problems like robot swarm control.

Abstract: Monotone gradient functions play a central role in solving the Monge
formulation of the optimal transport problem, which arises in modern
applications ranging from fluid dynamics to robot swarm control. When the
transport cost is the squared Euclidean distance, Brenier's theorem guarantees
that the unique optimal map is the gradient of a convex function, namely a
monotone gradient map, and it satisfies a Monge-Amp\`ere equation. In
[arXiv:2301.10862] [arXiv:2404.07361], we proposed Monotone Gradient Networks
(mGradNets), neural networks that directly parameterize the space of monotone
gradient maps. In this work, we leverage mGradNets to directly learn the
optimal transport mapping by minimizing a training loss function defined using
the Monge-Amp\`ere equation. We empirically show that the structural bias of
mGradNets facilitates the learning of optimal transport maps and employ our
method for a robot swarm control problem.

*Etienne Le Naour,Tahar Nabil,Ghislain Agoua*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces MoTM, a model leveraging implicit neural representations (INRs) for robust time-series data imputation across various scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Out-of-domain time series imputation remains underexplored, despite advancements in time series forecasting models.

Method: MoTM combines independently trained INRs with a ridge regressor to adapt to new contexts during inference, supporting diverse and shifting data distributions.

Result: The proposed model demonstrates strong generalization in both in-domain and out-of-domain imputation cases, handling scenarios like block missingness, pointwise missingness, and variable sampling rates.

Conclusion: MoTM represents progress toward an adaptable foundation model for time series imputation, capable of addressing diverse and challenging missing data scenarios.

Abstract: Recent years have witnessed a growing interest for time series foundation
models, with a strong emphasis on the forecasting task. Yet, the crucial task
of out-of-domain imputation of missing values remains largely underexplored. We
propose a first step to fill this gap by leveraging implicit neural
representations (INRs). INRs model time series as continuous functions and
naturally handle various missing data scenarios and sampling rates. While they
have shown strong performance within specific distributions, they struggle
under distribution shifts. To address this, we introduce MoTM (Mixture of
Timeflow Models), a step toward a foundation model for time series imputation.
Building on the idea that a new time series is a mixture of previously seen
patterns, MoTM combines a basis of INRs, each trained independently on a
distinct family of time series, with a ridge regressor that adapts to the
observed context at inference. We demonstrate robust in-domain and
out-of-domain generalization across diverse imputation scenarios (e.g., block
and pointwise missingness, variable sampling rates), paving the way for
adaptable foundation imputation models.

*Maria Margarida Mascarenhas,Jilles De Blauwe,Mikael Amelin,Hussain Kazmi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This study evaluates whether using asynchronously published electricity prices from interconnected markets due to differing gate closure times improves forecast accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To determine if asynchronously published market prices from interconnected electricity markets can enhance forecast accuracy in markets with later gate closure times.

Method: The research uses a state-of-the-art ensemble of forecasting models and analyzes the inclusion of price data from interconnected markets (Germany-Luxembourg, Austria, and Switzerland) to improve predictions in Belgian (BE) and Swedish (SE3) zones.

Result: Forecast accuracy improved by 22% in Belgium and 9% in Sweden, even under extreme market conditions. Insights were also gathered on the need for frequent recalibration and the diminishing returns of using more market data.

Conclusion: Incorporating interconnected market data improves forecast performance but requires careful model recalibration and selection of relevant data sources to ensure efficiency. Implications are significant for optimizing bidding strategies in volatile markets.

Abstract: Accurate short-term electricity price forecasting is crucial for
strategically scheduling demand and generation bids in day-ahead markets. While
data-driven techniques have shown considerable prowess in achieving high
forecast accuracy in recent years, they rely heavily on the quality of input
covariates. In this paper, we investigate whether asynchronously published
prices as a result of differing gate closure times (GCTs) in some bidding zones
can improve forecasting accuracy in other markets with later GCTs. Using a
state-of-the-art ensemble of models, we show significant improvements of 22%
and 9% in forecast accuracy in the Belgian (BE) and Swedish bidding zones (SE3)
respectively, when including price data from interconnected markets with
earlier GCT (Germany-Luxembourg, Austria, and Switzerland). This improvement
holds for both general as well as extreme market conditions. Our analysis also
yields further important insights: frequent model recalibration is necessary
for maximum accuracy but comes at substantial additional computational costs,
and using data from more markets does not always lead to better performance - a
fact we delve deeper into with interpretability analysis of the forecast
models. Overall, these findings provide valuable guidance for market
participants and decision-makers aiming to optimize bidding strategies within
increasingly interconnected and volatile European energy markets.

### [212] [Merge Kernel for Bayesian Optimization on Permutation Space](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13263)
*Zikai Xie,Linjiang Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a new kernel for Bayesian Optimization on permutation spaces inspired by sorting algorithms, offering improved efficiency and performance over the Mallows kernel.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Bayesian Optimization's current methods for permutation spaces rely on computationally expensive approaches, necessitating alternatives that reduce complexity without sacrificing performance.

Method: The authors devise the Merge Kernel, derived from merge sort, to reduce computational complexity from quadratic to linearithmic. They also integrate task-agnostic descriptors like shift histograms, split-pair lines, and sliding-window motifs for robustness and enhanced modeling.

Result: Empirical tests show the Merge Kernel surpasses the Mallows kernel in multiple benchmarks, offering better performance despite its compact structure.

Conclusion: The Merge Kernel is a more efficient and effective kernel for Bayesian Optimization in permutation spaces, demonstrating robust improvements over existing methods.

Abstract: Bayesian Optimization (BO) algorithm is a standard tool for black-box
optimization problems. The current state-of-the-art BO approach for permutation
spaces relies on the Mallows kernel-an $\Omega(n^2)$ representation that
explicitly enumerates every pairwise comparison. Inspired by the close
relationship between the Mallows kernel and pairwise comparison, we propose a
novel framework for generating kernel functions on permutation space based on
sorting algorithms. Within this framework, the Mallows kernel can be viewed as
a special instance derived from bubble sort. Further, we introduce the
\textbf{Merge Kernel} constructed from merge sort, which replaces the quadratic
complexity with $\Theta(n\log n)$ to achieve the lowest possible complexity.
The resulting feature vector is significantly shorter, can be computed in
linearithmic time, yet still efficiently captures meaningful permutation
distances. To boost robustness and right-invariance without sacrificing
compactness, we further incorporate three lightweight, task-agnostic
descriptors: (1) a shift histogram, which aggregates absolute element
displacements and supplies a global misplacement signal; (2) a split-pair line,
which encodes selected long-range comparisons by aligning elements across the
two halves of the whole permutation; and (3) sliding-window motifs, which
summarize local order patterns that influence near-neighbor objectives. Our
empirical evaluation demonstrates that the proposed kernel consistently
outperforms the state-of-the-art Mallows kernel across various permutation
optimization benchmarks. Results confirm that the Merge Kernel provides a more
compact yet more effective solution for Bayesian optimization in permutation
space.

### [213] [Boosting Team Modeling through Tempo-Relational Representation Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13305)
*Vincenzo Marco De Luca,Giovanna Varni,Andrea Passerini*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: TRENN introduces a novel tempo-relational architecture to model temporal and relational dynamics in teams, and its extension MT-TRENN predicts multiple team constructs simultaneously with high performance and explainability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing team modeling methods fail to simultaneously capture dynamics, relations, and provide actionable recommendations, which limits their practical utility in enhancing team performance.

Method: TRENN consists of a temporal graph extractor, tempo-relational encoder, a decoder for predictions, and explainability modules. MT-TRENN extends TRENN by adding a multi-task prediction head.

Result: TRENN and MT-TRENN outperform approaches relying solely on relational or temporal information, while offering interpretable insights for actionable recommendations.

Conclusion: The proposed TRENN and its extension MT-TRENN advance team modeling by addressing practical gaps, enabling better team performance insights in Human-Centered AI applications.

Abstract: Team modeling remains a fundamental challenge at the intersection of
Artificial Intelligence and the Social Sciences. Social Science research
emphasizes the need to jointly model dynamics and relations, while practical
applications demand unified models capable of inferring multiple team
constructs simultaneously, providing interpretable insights and actionable
recommendations to enhance team performance. However, existing works do not
meet these practical demands. To bridge this gap, we present TRENN, a novel
tempo-relational architecture that integrates: (i) an automatic temporal graph
extractor, (ii) a tempo-relational encoder, (iii) a decoder for team construct
prediction, and (iv) two complementary explainability modules. TRENN jointly
captures relational and temporal team dynamics, providing a solid foundation
for MT-TRENN, which extends TReNN by replacing the decoder with a multi-task
head, enabling the model to learn shared Social Embeddings and simultaneously
predict multiple team constructs, including Emergent Leadership, Leadership
Style, and Teamwork components. Experimental results demonstrate that our
approach significantly outperforms approaches that rely exclusively on temporal
or relational information. Additionally, experimental evaluation has shown that
the explainability modules integrated in MT-TRENN yield interpretable insights
and actionable suggestions to support team improvement. These capabilities make
our approach particularly well-suited for Human-Centered AI applications, such
as intelligent decision-support systems in high-stakes collaborative
environments.

*Kyeongjin Ahn,Sungwon Han,Seungeon Lee,Donghyun Ahn,Hyoshin Kim,Jungwon Kim,Jihee Kim,Sangyoon Park,Meeyoung Cha*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces GeoReg, a regression model integrating satellite imagery and geospatial data with the aid of large language models (LLMs) for socio-economic indicator estimation in data-scarce regions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the challenge of estimating critical socio-economic indicators in regions with limited data, particularly developing countries, which often lack comprehensive resources.

Method: GeoReg utilizes LLMs to extract features from diverse data sources, categorizing correlations between features and indicators, and applies a linear estimator with weight constraints alongside nonlinear transformations to improve prediction accuracy.

Result: Experiments conducted across three countries in different development stages showcased GeoReg's superior performance in estimating socio-economic indicators compared to conventional baselines.

Conclusion: GeoReg demonstrates that advanced integration of LLMs, satellite imagery, and geospatial data can effectively overcome data scarcity issues, aiding socio-economic development and policy-making in low-resource settings.

Abstract: Socio-economic indicators like regional GDP, population, and education
levels, are crucial to shaping policy decisions and fostering sustainable
development. This research introduces GeoReg a regression model that integrates
diverse data sources, including satellite imagery and web-based geospatial
information, to estimate these indicators even for data-scarce regions such as
developing countries. Our approach leverages the prior knowledge of large
language model (LLM) to address the scarcity of labeled data, with the LLM
functioning as a data engineer by extracting informative features to enable
effective estimation in few-shot settings. Specifically, our model obtains
contextual relationships between data features and the target indicator,
categorizing their correlations as positive, negative, mixed, or irrelevant.
These features are then fed into the linear estimator with tailored weight
constraints for each category. To capture nonlinear patterns, the model also
identifies meaningful feature interactions and integrates them, along with
nonlinear transformations. Experiments across three countries at different
stages of development demonstrate that our model outperforms baselines in
estimating socio-economic indicators, even for low-income countries with
limited data availability.

### [215] [Training Transformers with Enforced Lipschitz Constants](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13338)
*Laker Newhouse,R. Preston Hess,Franz Cesista,Andrii Zahorodnii,Jeremy Bernstein,Phillip Isola*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This study develops novel tools to enforce Lipschitz constraints for neural networks, allowing transformers to train with these guarantees. The results show promise but reveal trade-offs between performance and stability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Neural networks are sensitive to perturbations, leading to challenges like adversarial vulnerability, divergent training, and overfitting. Ensuring Lipschitz continuity has been proposed as a solution, but implementation in modern architectures like transformers is underexplored.

Method: The authors introduce computationally efficient tools to maintain norm-constrained weight matrices and apply them to train Lipschitz-certified transformers. Experiments include different optimizers like Muon, which improves Lipschitz bounds compared to AdamW, and co-designed weight constraint methods.

Result: With methods and optimizers optimized for Lipschitz constraints, a 2-Lipschitz transformer achieves 60% validation accuracy on Shakespeare text, while a 10-Lipschitz transformer achieves 21% accuracy on internet text. However, to match NanoGPT's baseline accuracy, a much higher Lipschitz bound is required.

Conclusion: While the study achieves Lipschitz-certified transformer training without additional stability measures, the trade-offs in Lipschitz bounds, performance, and scalability highlight the need for further refinement.

Abstract: Neural networks are often highly sensitive to input and weight perturbations.
This sensitivity has been linked to pathologies such as vulnerability to
adversarial examples, divergent training, and overfitting. To combat these
problems, past research has looked at building neural networks entirely from
Lipschitz components. However, these techniques have not matured to the point
where researchers have trained a modern architecture such as a transformer with
a Lipschitz certificate enforced beyond initialization. To explore this gap, we
begin by developing and benchmarking novel, computationally-efficient tools for
maintaining norm-constrained weight matrices. Applying these tools, we are able
to train transformer models with Lipschitz bounds enforced throughout training.
We find that optimizer dynamics matter: switching from AdamW to Muon improves
standard methods -- weight decay and spectral normalization -- allowing models
to reach equal performance with a lower Lipschitz bound. Inspired by Muon's
update having a fixed spectral norm, we co-design a weight constraint method
that improves the Lipschitz vs. performance tradeoff on MLPs and 2M parameter
transformers. Our 2-Lipschitz transformer on Shakespeare text reaches
validation accuracy 60%. Scaling to 145M parameters, our 10-Lipschitz
transformer reaches 21% accuracy on internet text. However, to match the
NanoGPT baseline validation accuracy of 39.4%, our Lipschitz upper bound
increases to 10^264. Nonetheless, our Lipschitz transformers train without
stability measures such as layer norm, QK norm, and logit tanh softcapping.

TL;DR: The paper investigates an approach combining evolutionary algorithms and generative adversarial networks (GANs) to craft adversarial attacks on image classifiers, achieving notable success rates for handwritten digits and object images.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the security challenges of adversarial attacks on AI-based image classification models by developing more effective generation methods.

Method: An approach that uses evolutionary algorithms to explore the latent space of a GAN for creating adversarial attack vectors.

Result: Achieved success rates of up to 35% for handwritten digits and 75% for object images, surpassing other search methods and related works.

Conclusion: The method demonstrated its effectiveness in generating adversarial attacks across diverse datasets, even under conditions with higher complexity and data richness.

Abstract: Image classification currently faces significant security challenges due to
adversarial attacks, which consist of intentional alterations designed to
deceive classification models based on artificial intelligence. This article
explores an approach to generate adversarial attacks against image classifiers
using a combination of evolutionary algorithms and generative adversarial
networks. The proposed approach explores the latent space of a generative
adversarial network with an evolutionary algorithm to find vectors representing
adversarial attacks. The approach was evaluated in two case studies
corresponding to the classification of handwritten digits and object images.
The results showed success rates of up to 35% for handwritten digits, and up to
75% for object images, improving over other search methods and reported results
in related works. The applied method proved to be effective in handling data
diversity on the target datasets, even in problem instances that presented
additional challenges due to the complexity and richness of information.

Main category: cs.NE

TL;DR: This paper empirically analyzes different coevolutionary strategies for training GANs and finds that full generational replacement consistently performs better for sample quality and diversity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GANs are powerful but difficult to train due to problems like mode collapse and instability. Coevolutionary methods are seen as a promising solution but require further investigation to optimize their effectiveness.

Method: The study compares coevolutionary training schemes—(mu,lambda), (mu+lambda) with elitism, and (mu+lambda) with tournament selection—on synthetic low-dimensional datasets and an image benchmark (MNIST).

Result: The (mu,lambda) strategy with generational replacement consistently outperformed others in terms of sample quality and diversity, especially with larger offspring sizes. Elitist methods converge prematurely and reduce diversity.

Conclusion: Balancing exploration and exploitation dynamics is crucial for effective coevolutionary GAN training, and (mu,lambda) replacement offers a promising direction.

Abstract: Generative adversarial networks (GANs) are powerful generative models but
remain challenging to train due to pathologies suchas mode collapse and
instability. Recent research has explored co-evolutionary approaches, in which
populations of generators and discriminators are evolved, as a promising
solution. This paper presents an empirical analysis of different coevolutionary
GAN training strategies, focusing on the impact of selection and replacement
mechanisms. We compare (mu,lambda), (mu+lambda) with elitism, and (mu+lambda)
with tournament selection coevolutionary schemes, along with a non-evolutionary
population based multi-generator multi-discriminator GAN baseline, across both
synthetic low-dimensional datasets (blob and gaussian mixtures) and an
image-based benchmark (MNIST). Results show that full generational replacement,
i.e., (mu,lambda), consistently outperforms in terms of both sample quality and
diversity, particularly when combined with larger offspring sizes. In contrast,
elitist approaches tend to converge prematurely and suffer from reduced
diversity. These findings highlight the importance of balancing exploration and
exploitation dynamics in coevolutionary GAN training and provide guidance for
designing more effective population-based generative models.

*Tom Smeding,Mikołaj Konarski,Simon Peyton Jones,Andrew Fitzgibbon*

Main category: cs.PL

TL;DR: The paper presents a multidimensional array-focused reverse-mode AD algorithm using dual numbers with minimal performance impact, sacrificing generality for efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve performance in reverse-mode AD, especially in array programs, by addressing limitations of the dual-numbers method.

Method: The approach integrates vectorisation transformations, adapts dual-numbers reverse AD to a first-order array language, and employs symbolic interpretation for compilation.

Result: The algorithm supports selected higher-order array combinators and simplifies AD by reducing program higher-orderness, enabling efficient 'dual arrays' handling.

Conclusion: The method achieves efficient dual-numbers AD for multidimensional arrays, though it limits generalizability to certain higher-order constructs.

Abstract: The standard dual-numbers construction works well for forward-mode automatic
differentiation (AD) and is attractive due to its simplicity; recently, it also
has been adapted to reverse-mode AD, but practical performance, especially on
array programs, leaves a lot to be desired. In this paper we introduce
first-class support for multidimensional arrays in dual-numbers reverse-mode AD
with little to no performance overhead. The algorithm consists of three
loosely-coupled components: a semantics-preserving vectorisation code
transformation (the bulk-operation transform or BOT), a fairly straightforward
lifting of the basic dual-numbers reverse AD algorithm to a mostly first-order
array language, and symbolic interpretation to achieve an end-to-end
compilation pipeline. Unfortunately, we lose some of the nice generalisable
aspects of dual-numbers AD in the process, most importantly support for
higher-order code.
  We do support some higher-order array combinators, but only a
carefully-chosen set: 'build' (elementwise array construction), 'gather' and
'scatter'. In return, the BOT can eliminate the essential (for AD)
higher-orderness of the input program, meaning that AD gets essentially
presented with a first-order program. This allows the naive trick of lifting
dual numbers to "dual arrays" to work without much modification.

Main category: cs.PL

TL;DR: The paper presents a mechanized and provably accurate semantics for modern JavaScript regular expressions, validated through real-world applications and proof automation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of mechanized, faithful, and practical semantics for modern regular expressions, especially those with backtracking semantics, while offering tools for formal verification.

Method: The authors devised a mechanized semantics model verified to align with the ECMAScript specification. They applied this to contextual equivalence and validated it using the Rocq proof assistant.

Result: They proved contextual equivalence for modern regex rewrites and provided the first formal proof of the PikeVM algorithm, capturing an entire backtracking tree including match priorities.

Conclusion: The study advances regular expression understanding by offering a faithful mechanized semantics that supports both theoretical exploration and practical verification.

Abstract: We present the first mechanized, succinct, practical, complete, and
proven-faithful semantics for a modern regular expression language with
backtracking semantics. We ensure its faithfulness by proving it equivalent to
a preexisting line-by-line embedding of the official ECMAScript specification
of JavaScript regular expressions. We demonstrate its practicality by
presenting two real-world applications. First, a new notion of contextual
equivalence for modern regular expressions, which we use to prove or disprove
rewrites drawn from previous work. Second, the first formal proof of the PikeVM
algorithm used in many real-world engines. In contrast with the specification
and other formalization work, our semantics captures not only the top-priority
match, but a full backtracking tree recording all possible matches and their
respective priority. All our definitions and results have been mechanized in
the Rocq proof assistant.

Main category: cs.PL

TL;DR: The paper presents Astrogator, a system that improves correctness guarantees for code generated by large language models (LLMs) using formal query language and verification techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs often generate incorrect code, and users without strong programming skills struggle to detect and fix errors. Formal correctness guarantees are needed to enhance AI Code Assistants and extend their utility to less knowledgeable users.

Method: The authors propose incorporating a formal query language for representing user intent, which can then be matched to the generated code through symbolic interpretation and verification. The Astrogator system was built for the Ansible programming language.

Result: Tests on a benchmark of 21 code-generation tasks showed Astrogator verifying correct code in 83% of cases and identifying incorrect code in 92% of cases.

Conclusion: Astrogator demonstrates the feasibility of using formal methods to improve LLM-generated code, which could enhance user trust and the usability of AI Code Assistants.

Abstract: In the past few years LLMs have emerged as a tool that can aid programmers by
taking natural language descriptions and generating code based on it. However,
LLMs often generate incorrect code that users need to fix and the literature
suggests users often struggle to detect these errors. In this work we seek to
offer formal guarantees of correctness to LLM generated code; such guarantees
could improve the experience of using AI Code Assistants and potentially enable
natural language programming for users with little or no programming knowledge.
To address this challenge we propose to incorporate a formal query language
that can represent a user's intent in a formally defined but natural
language-like manner that a user can confirm matches their intent. Then, using
such a query we propose to verify LLM generated code to ensure it matches the
user's intent. We implement these ideas in our system, Astrogator, for the
Ansible programming language which includes such a formal query language, a
calculus for representing the behavior of Ansible programs, and a symbolic
interpreter which is used for the verification. On a benchmark suite of 21
code-generation tasks, our verifier is able to verify correct code in 83% of
cases and identify incorrect code in 92%.

TL;DR: This paper introduces a method for LiDAR simulation that factors in specific sensor characteristics for improved accuracy over existing techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current NVS methods for LiDAR simulation fail to adequately address sensor-specific effects.

Method: The authors explicitly model LiDAR sensor characteristics like rolling shutter, laser power variations, and intensity falloff to refine simulation accuracy.

Result: Their approach outperforms existing methods quantitatively and qualitatively and can perform advanced resimulation tasks like high-resolution LiDAR scans.

Conclusion: The method improves LiDAR simulation accuracy and provides advanced capabilities, offering a publicly available code and dataset for further research.

Abstract: Methods for Novel View Synthesis (NVS) have recently found traction in the
field of LiDAR simulation and large-scale 3D scene reconstruction. While
solutions for faster rendering or handling dynamic scenes have been proposed,
LiDAR specific effects remain insufficiently addressed. By explicitly modeling
sensor characteristics such as rolling shutter, laser power variations, and
intensity falloff, our method achieves more accurate LiDAR simulation compared
to existing techniques. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach
through quantitative and qualitative comparisons with state-of-the-art methods,
as well as ablation studies that highlight the importance of each sensor model
component. Beyond that, we show that our approach exhibits advanced
resimulation capabilities, such as generating high resolution LiDAR scans in

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing approaches struggle to generalize tasks effectively in embodied environments, especially without explicit reward signals. FMs and WMs offer complementary advantages, but combining them has been underexplored.

Method: FOUNDER learns a mapping function to align FM representations with WM state spaces. With this map, it uses goal-conditioned policy learning via imagination and temporal-distance-based reward signals.

Result: FOUNDER outperforms prior methods in multi-task offline visual control benchmarks, effectively handling complex observations and domain gaps. It captures deep task semantics and aligns consistently with true reward functions.

Conclusion: This framework is promising in enhancing generalization and complex task-solving in embodied environments while validating its reward functions through consistency with empirical results.

Abstract: Foundation Models (FMs) and World Models (WMs) offer complementary strengths
in task generalization at different levels. In this work, we propose FOUNDER, a
framework that integrates the generalizable knowledge embedded in FMs with the
dynamic modeling capabilities of WMs to enable open-ended task solving in
embodied environments in a reward-free manner. We learn a mapping function that
grounds FM representations in the WM state space, effectively inferring the
agent's physical states in the world simulator from external observations. This
mapping enables the learning of a goal-conditioned policy through imagination
during behavior learning, with the mapped task serving as the goal state. Our
method leverages the predicted temporal distance to the goal state as an
informative reward signal. FOUNDER demonstrates superior performance on various
multi-task offline visual control benchmarks, excelling in capturing the
deep-level semantics of tasks specified by text or videos, particularly in
scenarios involving complex observations or domain gaps where prior methods
struggle. The consistency of our learned reward function with the ground-truth
reward is also empirically validated. Our project website is

*Yuhang Lu,Jiadong Tu,Yuexin Ma,Xinge Zhu*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces ReAL-AD, a reasoning-augmented framework for end-to-end autonomous driving, integrating human-like hierarchical decision-making for improved adaptability and reduced information loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing end-to-end autonomous driving models rely on fixed and sparse trajectory supervision, failing to capture human drivers' hierarchical reasoning processes.

Method: ReAL-AD structures decision-making into three tiers: Driving Strategy, Driving Decision, and Driving Operation. It uses Vision-Language Models (VLMs) for situational awareness and introduces modules for strategic reasoning, tactical decision-making, and hierarchical trajectory decoding.

Result: The proposed framework improves planning accuracy and safety by over 30%, enhancing interpretability and human-like reasoning in autonomous driving.

Conclusion: ReAL-AD offers a comprehensive improvement in end-to-end autonomous driving by emulating human cognitive processes through hierarchical reasoning, situational awareness, and structured decision-making.

Abstract: End-to-end autonomous driving has emerged as a promising approach to unify
perception, prediction, and planning within a single framework, reducing
information loss and improving adaptability. However, existing methods often
rely on fixed and sparse trajectory supervision, limiting their ability to
capture the hierarchical reasoning process that human drivers naturally employ.
To bridge this gap, we propose ReAL-AD, a Reasoning-Augmented Learning
framework that structures decision-making in autonomous driving based on the
three-tier human cognitive model: Driving Strategy, Driving Decision, and
Driving Operation, where Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are incorporated to
enhance situational awareness and structured reasoning across these levels.
Specifically, we introduce: (1) the Strategic Reasoning Injector, which
formulates high-level driving strategies by interpreting complex traffic
contexts from VLM-generated insights; (2) the Tactical Reasoning Integrator,
which refines strategic intent into interpretable tactical choices such as lane
changes, overtaking, and speed adjustments; and (3) the Hierarchical Trajectory
Decoder, which progressively translates tactical decisions into precise control
actions for smooth and human-like trajectory execution. Extensive evaluations
show that integrating our framework improves planning accuracy and safety by
over 30%, making end-to-end autonomous driving more interpretable and aligned
with human-like hierarchical reasoning. The project page can be found at:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To leverage the reasoning and creative capabilities of foundation models in automating the invention and use of tools, which serves as an alternative form of physical intelligence in robotics.

Method: VLMgineer combines vision language models' code generation abilities with evolutionary search to co-design tools and action plans. It evaluates these designs on various manipulation tasks.

Result: VLMgineer consistently designs tools and policies that outperform human-crafted and human-specified alternatives, turning complex robotics challenges into straightforward solutions.

Conclusion: Automating tool invention with VLMgineer shows promise in enhancing physical intelligence for robotics, and the authors provide resources to encourage further research in this area.

Abstract: Tool design and use reflect the ability to understand and manipulate the
physical world through creativity, planning, and foresight. As such, these
capabilities are often regarded as measurable indicators of intelligence across
biological species. While much of today's research on robotic intelligence
focuses on generating better controllers, inventing smarter tools offers a
complementary form of physical intelligence: shifting the onus of
problem-solving onto the tool's design. Given the vast and impressive
common-sense, reasoning, and creative capabilities of today's foundation
models, we investigate whether these models can provide useful priors to
automatically design and effectively wield such tools? We present VLMgineer, a
framework that harnesses the code generation abilities of vision language
models (VLMs) together with evolutionary search to iteratively co-design
physical tools and the action plans that operate them to perform a task. We
evaluate VLMgineer on a diverse new benchmark of everyday manipulation
scenarios that demand creative tool design and use. Across this suite,
VLMgineer consistently discovers tools and policies that solve tasks more
effectively and innovatively, transforming challenging robotics problems into
straightforward executions. It also outperforms VLM-generated designs from
human specifications and existing human-crafted tools for everyday tasks. To
facilitate future research on automated tool invention, we will release our
benchmark and code.

Abstract: Soil moisture is a quantity of interest in many application areas including
agriculture and climate modeling. Existing methods are not suitable for scale
applications due to large deployment costs in high-resolution sensing
applications such as for variable irrigation. In this work, we design, build
and field deploy an autonomous mobile robot, MoistureMapper, for soil moisture
sensing. The robot is equipped with Time Domain Reflectometry (TDR) sensors and
a direct push drill mechanism for deploying the sensor to measure volumetric
water content in the soil. Additionally, we implement and evaluate multiple
adaptive sampling strategies based on a Gaussian Process based modeling to
build a spatial mapping of moisture distribution in the soil. We present
results from large scale computational simulations and proof-of-concept
deployment on the field. The adaptive sampling approach outperforms a greedy
benchmark approach and results in up to 30\% reduction in travel distance and

*Nathaniel Rose,Arif Ahmed,Emanuel Gutierrez-Cornejo,Parikshit Maini*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces a neural network-based approach, IMUnet, to estimate robot platform stability using proprioceptive data without needing terrain or force models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional stability metrics for wheeled robots in off-road environments require precise measurements that are difficult to obtain in real-world conditions.

Method: IMUnet, a lightweight neural network, predicts stability using IMU and velocity inputs. Additionally, a vision-based ArUco tracking method computes a scalar stability score (C3) as training feedback.

Result: The approach was successfully evaluated on diverse terrain types and speeds, demonstrating generalization to unseen conditions.

Conclusion: IMUnet provides a reliable data-driven way to estimate robot stability, with potential applications in precision tasks and traversability planning for various industries.

Abstract: Navigating in off-road environments for wheeled mobile robots is challenging
due to dynamic and rugged terrain. Traditional physics-based stability metrics,
such as Static Stability Margin (SSM) or Zero Moment Point (ZMP) require
knowledge of contact forces, terrain geometry, and the robot's precise
center-of-mass that are difficult to measure accurately in real-world field
conditions. In this work, we propose a learning-based approach to estimate
robot platform stability directly from proprioceptive data using a lightweight
neural network, IMUnet. Our method enables data-driven inference of robot
stability without requiring an explicit terrain model or force sensing.
  We also develop a novel vision-based ArUco tracking method to compute a
scalar score to quantify robot platform stability called C3 score. The score
captures image-space perturbations over time as a proxy for physical
instability and is used as a training signal for the neural network based
model. As a pilot study, we evaluate our approach on data collected across
multiple terrain types and speeds and demonstrate generalization to previously
unseen conditions. These initial results highlight the potential of using IMU
and robot velocity as inputs to estimate platform stability. The proposed
method finds application in gating robot tasks such as precision actuation and
sensing, especially for mobile manipulation tasks in agricultural and space
applications. Our learning method also provides a supervision mechanism for
perception based traversability estimation and planning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The research is motivated by the need to improve mobile robot navigation systems, especially in detecting ground-level obstacles that traditional LiDAR sensors fail to recognize.

Method: The authors proposed ASCnet, a lightweight segmentation model using MobileNetV2 as a backbone and Atrous Strip Convolution Spatial Pyramid Pooling (ASCSPP) to extract deformable linear object features.

Result: The method achieved a mean Intersection over Union (Miou) score of 75.3% and an inference speed of 9.3 FPS on the Jetson Orin Nano device, outperforming existing DLO detection models.

Conclusion: The proposed ASC-SW framework demonstrates effective DLO detection and navigation capabilities, validated on a physical robot platform and optimized for edge computing devices.

Abstract: With the rapid development of lightweight visual neural network
architectures, traditional high-performance vision models have undergone
significant compression, greatly improving their computational efficiency and
energy consumption ratio. This makes them feasible for deployment on
resource-constrained edge computing devices. We propose a visual-assisted
navigation framework called Atrous Strip Convolution-Sliding Window (ASC-SW),
which leverages a depth camera and a lightweight visual neural network to
assist map-based mobile robot navigation. This framework compensates for the
inability of traditional light detection and range (LiDAR) sensors to detect
ground-level obstacles such as ground-level wires. We introduce a lightweight
and efficient segmentation model, Atrous Strip Convolution Network (ASCnet),
for detecting deformable linear objects (DLOs). MobileNetV2 is used as the
backbone network, and Atrous Strip Convolution Spatial Pyramid Pooling (ASCSPP)
is designed to extract DLO features more effectively. Atrous Strip Convolution
is integrated into ASCSPP to accurately identify the linear structure of DLOs
with low computational cost. Additionally, a Sliding Window (SW)
post-processing module is proposed to denoise the output in complex
environments, improving recognition accuracy. Our method strikes a balance
between inference speed and segmentation performance. It achieves a mean
Intersection over Union (Miou) score of 75.3% on a self-built dataset and
reaches 9.3 FPS inference speed on the Jetson Orin Nano edge device. Overall,
our approach outperforms existing DLO detection models and has been
successfully validated on a physical robotic platform.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper investigates the role of gait parameters (duty factor, phase shift, and stride duration) on the energy efficiency of quadrupedal robots through simulations and experiments, demonstrating that optimizing these parameters can significantly reduce energy consumption.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address a gap in the study of energy efficiency in quadrupedal locomotion, focusing not on mechanical design or actuation but on the impact of gait parameters.

Method: The method involves modeling the Unitree A1 quadrupedal robot, developing a locomotion controller to adjust gait parameters, and conducting simulations and experimental validations of bounding gaits at different speeds.

Result: Simulations and experiments show that optimizing gait parameters leads to significant energy savings, proving that these parameters critically affect energy consumption.

Conclusion: Optimizing gait parameters enhances energy efficiency in quadrupedal robots, contributing to the development of energy-efficient control strategies and their application to commercially available platforms.

Abstract: Energy efficiency is a critical factor in the performance and autonomy of
quadrupedal robots. While previous research has focused on mechanical design
and actuation improvements, the impact of gait parameters on energetics has
been less explored. In this paper, we hypothesize that gait parameters,
specifically duty factor, phase shift, and stride duration, are key
determinants of energy consumption in quadrupedal locomotion. To test this
hypothesis, we modeled the Unitree A1 quadrupedal robot and developed a
locomotion controller capable of independently adjusting these gait parameters.
Simulations of bounding gaits were conducted in Gazebo across a range of gait
parameters at three different speeds: low, medium, and high. Experimental tests
were also performed to validate the simulation results. The findings
demonstrate that optimizing gait parameters can lead to significant reductions
in energy consumption, enhancing the overall efficiency of quadrupedal
locomotion. This work contributes to the advancement of energy-efficient
control strategies for legged robots, offering insights directly applicable to
commercially available platforms.

*Fujing Xie,Sören Schwertfeger,Hermann Blum*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces a robot mapping and navigation system that considers dynamic object changes, leveraging semantic priors and LLMs to achieve better retrieval success.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional open-vocabulary robot mapping methods struggle with outdated maps due to object movement. The paper aims to address this scalability and dynamic mapping issue.

Method: The authors develop a mapping and navigation system that combines environment grounding with the reasoning capabilities of LLMs, adopting an active online approach for object-goal navigation.

Result: The proposed approach achieves higher retrieval success at shorter paths for static objects and significantly outperforms existing methods for dynamic or unmapped object queries, as validated by experiments.

Conclusion: Mapping for robots should prioritize environmental context over high-fidelity detail, and integrating semantic reasoning improves navigation efficiency for dynamic queries.

Abstract: Recent open-vocabulary robot mapping methods enrich dense geometric maps with
pre-trained visual-language features, achieving a high level of detail and
guiding robots to find objects specified by open-vocabulary language queries.
While the issue of scalability for such approaches has received some attention,
another fundamental problem is that high-detail object mapping quickly becomes
outdated, as objects get moved around a lot. In this work, we develop a mapping
and navigation system for object-goal navigation that, from the ground up,
considers the possibilities that a queried object can have moved, or may not be
mapped at all. Instead of striving for high-fidelity mapping detail, we
consider that the main purpose of a map is to provide environment grounding and
context, which we combine with the semantic priors of LLMs to reason about
object locations and deploy an active, online approach to navigate to the
objects. Through simulated and real-world experiments we find that our approach
tends to have higher retrieval success at shorter path lengths for static
objects and by far outperforms prior approaches in cases of dynamic or unmapped
object queries. We provide our code and dataset at:

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper presents a lightweight and robust navigation method for mobile robots using feature flow without requiring accurate localization or dense reconstruction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The main challenge in mobile robot self-navigation is striking a balance between efficiency and robustness in complex environments.

Method: The authors introduce feature flow to map pixel bias to robot motion through a qualitative model. A keyframe graph encodes relative motion via feature flow, and navigation minimizes feature flow discrepancies using a probabilistic motion planning approach.

Result: Extensive experiments showed that the proposed method is more robust and efficient than baseline approaches and is well-suited for mobile platforms.

Conclusion: The proposed method achieves efficient and reliable visual-based navigation for robots without relying on dense reconstructions or precise localization, and the source code is publicly available to aid the research community.

Abstract: Though visual and repeat navigation is a convenient solution for mobile robot
self-navigation, achieving balance between efficiency and robustness in task
environment still remains challenges. In this paper, we propose a novel visual
and repeat robotic autonomous navigation method that requires no accurate
localization and dense reconstruction modules, which makes our system featured
by lightweight and robustness. Firstly, feature flow is introduced and we
develop a qualitative mapping between feature flow and robot's motion, in which
feature flow is defined as pixel location bias between matched features. Based
on the mapping model, the map outputted by the teaching phase is represented as
a keyframe graph, in which the feature flow on the edge encodes the relative
motion between adjacent keyframes. Secondly, the visual repeating navigation is
essentially modeled as a feature flow minimization problem between current
observation and the map keyframe. To drive the robot to consistently reduce the
feature flow between current frame and map keyframes without accurate
localization, a probabilistic motion planning is developed based on our
qualitative feature flow-motion mapping indicator. Extensive experiments using
our mobile platform demonstrates that our proposed method is lightweight,
robust, and superior to baselines. The source code has been made public at

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper explores Long-term Active Embodied Question Answering (LA-EQA), requiring robots to use memory and exploration to answer temporally-grounded questions. A structured memory inspired by the mind palace method is proposed, leading to better performance over baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable robots to operate effectively over extended periods, utilizing long-term memory and exploration to answer complex, temporally-grounded questions in dynamic environments.

Method: The authors introduce a structured memory system inspired by the mind palace method, using scene-graph-based world instances. They also apply value-of-information-based stopping criteria to balance memory recall and exploration for effective decision-making.

Result: The proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in terms of answer accuracy and exploration efficiency. The evaluation includes real-world tasks and benchmarks spanning simulated and industrial environments.

Conclusion: The integration of structured memory and exploration strategies allows robots to tackle the LA-EQA problem effectively, showcasing significant improvements in robot reasoning and task performance over prolonged operational periods.

Abstract: As robots become increasingly capable of operating over extended periods --
spanning days, weeks, and even months -- they are expected to accumulate
knowledge of their environments and leverage this experience to assist humans
more effectively. This paper studies the problem of Long-term Active Embodied
Question Answering (LA-EQA), a new task in which a robot must both recall past
experiences and actively explore its environment to answer complex,
temporally-grounded questions. Unlike traditional EQA settings, which typically
focus either on understanding the present environment alone or on recalling a
single past observation, LA-EQA challenges an agent to reason over past,
present, and possible future states, deciding when to explore, when to consult
its memory, and when to stop gathering observations and provide a final answer.
Standard EQA approaches based on large models struggle in this setting due to
limited context windows, absence of persistent memory, and an inability to
combine memory recall with active exploration. To address this, we propose a
structured memory system for robots, inspired by the mind palace method from
cognitive science. Our method encodes episodic experiences as scene-graph-based
world instances, forming a reasoning and planning algorithm that enables
targeted memory retrieval and guided navigation. To balance the
exploration-recall trade-off, we introduce value-of-information-based stopping
criteria that determines when the agent has gathered sufficient information. We
evaluate our method on real-world experiments and introduce a new benchmark
that spans popular simulation environments and actual industrial sites. Our
approach significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, yielding
substantial gains in both answer accuracy and exploration efficiency.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper presents a method to minimize reliance on engineering expertise and reduce hallucinations when using large language models (LLMs) in robotic control systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs show promise in robotic control systems but require carefully designed examples and may hallucinate, posing challenges in execution and evaluation.

Method: The authors propose DEMONSTRATE, which uses inverse optimal control and multitask learning to replace engineered prompts with task demonstrations collected through robot teleoperation or guidance.

Result: The approach reduces dependence on human expertise, learns from fewer demonstrations, and aids in hallucination assessment prior to task execution.

Conclusion: DEMONSTRATE provides a practical solution for integrating LLMs with robotic systems while simplifying demonstration inputs and improving task reliability.

Abstract: The integration of large language models (LLMs) with control systems has
demonstrated significant potential in various settings, such as task completion
with a robotic manipulator. A main reason for this success is the ability of
LLMs to perform in-context learning, which, however, strongly relies on the
design of task examples, closely related to the target tasks. Consequently,
employing LLMs to formulate optimal control problems often requires task
examples that contain explicit mathematical expressions, designed by trained
engineers. Furthermore, there is often no principled way to evaluate for
hallucination before task execution. To address these challenges, we propose
DEMONSTRATE, a novel methodology that avoids the use of LLMs for complex
optimization problem generations, and instead only relies on the embedding
representations of task descriptions. To do this, we leverage tools from
inverse optimal control to replace in-context prompt examples with task
demonstrations, as well as the concept of multitask learning, which ensures
target and example task similarity by construction. Given the fact that
hardware demonstrations can easily be collected using teleoperation or guidance
of the robot, our approach significantly reduces the reliance on engineering
expertise for designing in-context examples. Furthermore, the enforced
multitask structure enables learning from few demonstrations and assessment of
hallucinations prior to task execution. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our
method through simulation and hardware experiments involving a robotic arm
tasked with tabletop manipulation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the issue of misalignment between high-level decisions generated by Vision-Language Models and the low-level actions needed in OOD autonomous driving situations.

Method: The paper proposes LaViPlan, a framework that employs Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) to optimize Vision-Language Models using planning-oriented metrics.

Result: LaViPlan enhances situational awareness and decision-making capabilities of Vision-Language Models under OOD conditions.

Conclusion: The framework provides a promising post-training solution for VLMs in autonomous driving, effectively mitigating the vision-language-action misalignment issue.

Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios in autonomous driving refer to situations
that deviate from the training domain, often leading to unexpected and
potentially hazardous behavior from planners that lack prior exposure to such
cases. Recently, Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have been introduced into
autonomous driving research for their promising generalization capabilities in
OOD settings. Early studies demonstrated that VLMs could recognize OOD
scenarios and generate user-level decisions such as "go straight" or "turn
right." However, a new challenge has emerged due to the misalignment between
the VLM's high-level decisions or visual reasoning expressed in language, and
the low-level predicted trajectories interpreted as actions. In this paper, we
propose LaViPlan, a framework that leverages Reinforcement Learning with
Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) to optimize VLMs using planning-oriented metrics.
This approach addresses the vision-language-action misalignment observed in
existing VLMs fine-tuned via supervised learning, which can recognize driving
scenarios but often produce context-unaware decisions. Experimental results
demonstrate that our method improves situational awareness and decision-making
under OOD conditions, highlighting its potential to mitigate the misalignment
issue. This work introduces a promising post-training paradigm for VLM agents
in the context of autonomous driving.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SLAM algorithms require accurate ground truth trajectories, but current MoCap systems are hindered by calibration errors and jitter, which limit robust rotation and inter-frame error evaluations.

Method: The paper proposes MoCap2GT, a joint optimization system utilizing MoCap data, IMU measurements, B-spline pose parameterization, and degeneracy-aware measurement rejection strategies.

Result: MoCap2GT demonstrates superior performance in generating high-precision GT trajectories compared to existing methods, aiding precise SLAM algorithm evaluation.

Conclusion: MoCap2GT addresses critical inaccuracies in MoCap systems and supports SLAM benchmarking through improved trajectory estimation, enhancing evaluations significantly.

Abstract: Marker-based optical motion capture (MoCap) systems are widely used to
provide ground truth (GT) trajectories for benchmarking SLAM algorithms.
However, the accuracy of MoCap-based GT trajectories is mainly affected by two
factors: spatiotemporal calibration errors between the MoCap system and the
device under test (DUT), and inherent MoCap jitter. Consequently, existing
benchmarks focus primarily on absolute translation error, as accurate
assessment of rotation and inter-frame errors remains challenging, hindering
thorough SLAM evaluation. This paper proposes MoCap2GT, a joint optimization
approach that integrates MoCap data and inertial measurement unit (IMU)
measurements from the DUT for generating high-precision GT trajectories.
MoCap2GT includes a robust state initializer to ensure global convergence,
introduces a higher-order B-spline pose parameterization on the SE(3) manifold
with variable time offset to effectively model MoCap factors, and employs a
degeneracy-aware measurement rejection strategy to enhance estimation accuracy.
Experimental results demonstrate that MoCap2GT outperforms existing methods and
significantly contributes to precise SLAM benchmarking. The source code is

TL;DR: The paper introduces a reinforcement learning-based training scheme to improve diffusion motion planning models by optimizing non-differentiable objectives like safety and goal-reaching.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Autonomous robots need safe and effective motion planning, but existing diffusion models lack efficient optimization of non-differentiable metrics crucial for decision-making.

Method: The proposed method combines reinforcement learning with a reward-weighted dynamic thresholding algorithm to enable diffusion models to better account for safety and effectiveness.

Result: Experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art performance on pedestrian datasets (CrowdNav, ETH-UCY), surpassing baseline methods.

Conclusion: The reinforcement learning approach enhances diffusion models for motion planning, proving effective in optimizing safety and goal-reaching objectives in dynamic environments.

Abstract: Safe and effective motion planning is crucial for autonomous robots.
Diffusion models excel at capturing complex agent interactions, a fundamental
aspect of decision-making in dynamic environments. Recent studies have
successfully applied diffusion models to motion planning, demonstrating their
competence in handling complex scenarios and accurately predicting multi-modal
future trajectories. Despite their effectiveness, diffusion models have
limitations in training objectives, as they approximate data distributions
rather than explicitly capturing the underlying decision-making dynamics.
However, the crux of motion planning lies in non-differentiable downstream
objectives, such as safety (collision avoidance) and effectiveness
(goal-reaching), which conventional learning algorithms cannot directly
optimize. In this paper, we propose a reinforcement learning-based training
scheme for diffusion motion planning models, enabling them to effectively learn
non-differentiable objectives that explicitly measure safety and effectiveness.
Specifically, we introduce a reward-weighted dynamic thresholding algorithm to
shape a dense reward signal, facilitating more effective training and
outperforming models trained with differentiable objectives. State-of-the-art
performance on pedestrian datasets (CrowdNav, ETH-UCY) compared to various
baselines demonstrates the versatility of our approach for safe and effective
motion planning.

Motivation: To ensure the safety and robustness of AI in complex environments despite sensor degradation, which impacts input data quality and AI inference.

Method: The framework involves identifying camera noise factors, extending degradation models with domain expertise, and performing situation coverage analysis for systematic elicitation of safety requirements.

Result: The paper provides an initial step towards combining noise factor analysis with situational coverage to robustly formulate and assess completeness in safety requirements for AI perception systems.

Conclusion: The presented framework demonstrates a promising pathway for prioritizing robustness in AI-based perception systems, especially in automotive domains prone to sensor degradation.

Abstract: AI-based robots and vehicles are expected to operate safely in complex and
dynamic environments, even in the presence of component degradation. In such
systems, perception relies on sensors such as cameras to capture environmental
data, which is then processed by AI models to support decision-making. However,
degradation in sensor performance directly impacts input data quality and can
impair AI inference. Specifying safety requirements for all possible sensor
degradation scenarios leads to unmanageable complexity and inevitable gaps. In
this position paper, we present a novel framework that integrates camera noise
factor identification with situation coverage analysis to systematically elicit
robustness-related safety requirements for AI-based perception systems. We
focus specifically on camera degradation in the automotive domain. Building on
an existing framework for identifying degradation modes, we propose involving
domain, sensor, and safety experts, and incorporating Operational Design Domain
specifications to extend the degradation model by incorporating noise factors
relevant to AI performance. Situation coverage analysis is then applied to
identify representative operational contexts. This work marks an initial step
toward integrating noise factor analysis and situational coverage to support
principled formulation and completeness assessment of robustness requirements
for camera-based AI perception.

TL;DR: This paper presents VLN-PE, a platform for realistic Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) with physical robotic embodiments, analyzing their challenges and limitations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the gap between current VLN advances, which assume idealized robot environments, and the real-world physical challenges posed by actual robotic deployments.

Method: Introduced VLN-PE, a platform accommodating humanoid, quadruped, and wheeled robots; tested ego-centric methods such as single-step classification, dense waypoint prediction, and LLM-based map integration.

Result: Observed significant degradation in VLN performance under physical conditions, including limited observation space, environmental lighting changes, and physical issues like collisions and falls.

Conclusion: VLN-PE demonstrates the weak generalization of present models in realistic settings, highlights areas for improvement, and serves as a tool for advancing practical VLN solutions.

Abstract: Recent Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) advancements are promising, but
their idealized assumptions about robot movement and control fail to reflect
physically embodied deployment challenges. To bridge this gap, we introduce
VLN-PE, a physically realistic VLN platform supporting humanoid, quadruped, and
wheeled robots. For the first time, we systematically evaluate several
ego-centric VLN methods in physical robotic settings across different technical
pipelines, including classification models for single-step discrete action
prediction, a diffusion model for dense waypoint prediction, and a train-free,
map-based large language model (LLM) integrated with path planning. Our results
reveal significant performance degradation due to limited robot observation
space, environmental lighting variations, and physical challenges like
collisions and falls. This also exposes locomotion constraints for legged
robots in complex environments. VLN-PE is highly extensible, allowing seamless
integration of new scenes beyond MP3D, thereby enabling more comprehensive VLN
evaluation. Despite the weak generalization of current models in physical
deployment, VLN-PE provides a new pathway for improving cross-embodiment's
overall adaptability. We hope our findings and tools inspire the community to
rethink VLN limitations and advance robust, practical VLN models. The code is

*Julien Wacquez,Elisabetta Zibetti,Joffrey Becker,Lorenzo Aloe,Fabio Amadio,Salvatore Anzalone,Lola Cañamero,Serena Ivaldi*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper advocates for an interdisciplinary approach to understanding trust in human-robot interaction, integrating insights from sociology and robotics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper is motivated by the increasing presence of robots in daily life and questions about trust between humans and robots, which have been insufficiently addressed in a cohesive and interdisciplinary way.

Method: The authors draw on insights from both social sciences and robotics to explore how trust is shaped, tested, and made visible in human-robot interactions.

Result: The paper fosters a dialogue between disciplines, proposing a more grounded and adaptable framework for understanding trust in human-robot relationships.

Conclusion: An interdisciplinary approach combining sociology and robotics is essential to better address and conceptualize trust in human-robot interaction.

Abstract: As robots find their way into more and more aspects of everyday life,
questions around trust are becoming increasingly important. What does it mean
to trust a robot? And how should we think about trust in relationships that
involve both humans and non-human agents? While the field of Human-Robot
Interaction (HRI) has made trust a central topic, the concept is often
approached in fragmented ways. At the same time, established work in sociology,
where trust has long been a key theme, is rarely brought into conversation with
developments in robotics. This article argues that we need a more
interdisciplinary approach. By drawing on insights from both social sciences
and social robotics, we explore how trust is shaped, tested and made visible.
Our goal is to open up a dialogue between disciplines and help build a more
grounded and adaptable framework for understanding trust in the evolving world
of human-robot interaction.

*Sanjeev Ramkumar Sudha,Joel Jose,Erlend M. Coates*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper introduces an efficient adaptive informative planning method using streaming sparse Gaussian processes (GPs) to address challenges in real-time robotic information gathering, especially for mapping unknown or dynamic environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to overcome challenges with Gaussian process (GP) regression in robotic information gathering, specifically its scalability and real-time performance when dealing with large datasets in unknown or dynamic environments.

Method: The proposed method introduces an adaptive informative planning approach leveraging streaming sparse GPs to map continuous scalar fields efficiently, tested through synthetic simulations and real-world datasets.

Result: The method demonstrated similar mapping accuracy compared to existing benchmarks while significantly reducing computational complexity during extended missions.

Conclusion: The proposed approach is validated as an efficient alternative for adaptive informative planning, suitable for large-scale or long-term robotic missions.

Abstract: Robotic information gathering (RIG) techniques refer to methods where mobile
robots are used to acquire data about the physical environment with a suite of
sensors. Informative planning is an important part of RIG where the goal is to
find sequences of actions or paths that maximize efficiency or the quality of
information collected. Many existing solutions solve this problem by assuming
that the environment is known in advance. However, real environments could be
unknown or time-varying, and adaptive informative planning remains an active
area of research. Adaptive planning and incremental online mapping are required
for mapping initially unknown or varying spatial fields. Gaussian process (GP)
regression is a widely used technique in RIG for mapping continuous spatial
fields. However, it falls short in many applications as its real-time
performance does not scale well to large datasets. To address these challenges,
this paper proposes an efficient adaptive informative planning approach for
mapping continuous scalar fields with GPs with streaming sparse GPs. Simulation
experiments are performed with a synthetic dataset and compared against
existing benchmarks. Finally, it is also verified with a real-world dataset to
further validate the efficacy of the proposed method. Results show that our
method achieves similar mapping accuracy to the baselines while reducing
computational complexity for longer missions.

### [240] [ZipMPC: Compressed Context-Dependent MPC Cost via Imitation Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13088)
*Rahel Rickenbach,Alan A. Lahoud,Erik Schaffernicht,Melanie N. Zeilinger,Johannes A. Stork*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: ZipMPC is a method that uses neural networks to learn compressed, context-sensitive cost functions, enabling short-horizon MPCs to approximate long-horizon MPC performance while maintaining low computation costs and ensuring constraint satisfaction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The computational demands of model predictive control limit its use in real-time systems, forcing shorter prediction horizons, which negatively impact control performance and long-term objective optimization.

Method: ZipMPC employs differentiable MPC with neural networks to generate gradients of an imitation loss through the MPC optimization process. This allows it to learn cost functions that simulate long-horizon MPC behavior within a short-horizon framework.

Result: The proposed method improves long-term objective optimization, maintains computational efficiency, ensures constraints are met, and generalizes to unseen environments. In autonomous racing experiments, ZipMPC outperformed baselines and achieved near long-horizon MPC performance.

Conclusion: ZipMPC offers a practical solution for enabling long-horizon-level performance in computationally constrained scenarios, showing robust applicability to both training and unseen environments.

Abstract: The computational burden of model predictive control (MPC) limits its
application on real-time systems, such as robots, and often requires the use of
short prediction horizons. This not only affects the control performance, but
also increases the difficulty of designing MPC cost functions that reflect the
desired long-term objective. This paper proposes ZipMPC, a method that imitates
a long-horizon MPC behaviour by learning a compressed and context-dependent
cost function for a short-horizon MPC. It improves performance over alternative
methods, such as approximate explicit MPC and automatic cost parameter tuning,
in particular in terms of i) optimizing the long term objective; ii)
maintaining computational costs comparable to a short-horizon MPC; iii)
ensuring constraint satisfaction; and iv) generalizing control behaviour to
environments not observed during training. For this purpose, ZipMPC leverages
the concept of differentiable MPC with neural networks to propagate gradients
of the imitation loss through the MPC optimization. We validate our proposed
method in simulation and real-world experiments on autonomous racing. ZipMPC
consistently completes laps faster than selected baselines, achieving lap times
close to the long-horizon MPC baseline. In challenging scenarios where the
short-horizon MPC baseline fails to complete a lap, ZipMPC is able to do so. In
particular, these performance gains are also observed on tracks unseen during
training.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces GraspGen, a framework for improving robot 6-DOF grasping using a DiffusionTransformer and an efficient discriminator, bolstered by a new dataset of 53 million grasps. It outperforms existing methods in simulations and real-world tests.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Despite advances, existing learning-based 6-DOF grasping approaches struggle to generalize effectively in varied robots and real-world environments. The paper seeks to address this gap.

Method: GraspGen makes use of a DiffusionTransformer for grasp generation and an efficient discriminator for filtering grasps. A novel training strategy is introduced, alongside a new dataset of 53 million grasps for scalability.

Result: GraspGen surpasses existing methods in simulations using different grippers and achieves state-of-the-art results on the FetchBench benchmark. It also performs effectively with a real robot in noisy conditions.

Conclusion: GraspGen establishes itself as a robust, generalizable approach to 6-DOF grasping, capable of improving performance across varied scenarios and conditions.

Abstract: Grasping is a fundamental robot skill, yet despite significant research
advancements, learning-based 6-DOF grasping approaches are still not turnkey
and struggle to generalize across different embodiments and in-the-wild
settings. We build upon the recent success on modeling the object-centric grasp
generation process as an iterative diffusion process. Our proposed framework,
GraspGen, consists of a DiffusionTransformer architecture that enhances grasp
generation, paired with an efficient discriminator to score and filter sampled
grasps. We introduce a novel and performant on-generator training recipe for
the discriminator. To scale GraspGen to both objects and grippers, we release a
new simulated dataset consisting of over 53 million grasps. We demonstrate that
GraspGen outperforms prior methods in simulations with singulated objects
across different grippers, achieves state-of-the-art performance on the
FetchBench grasping benchmark, and performs well on a real robot with noisy
visual observations.

### [242] [Aligning Humans and Robots via Reinforcement Learning from Implicit Human Feedback](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13171)
*Suzie Kim,Hye-Bin Shin,Seong-Whan Lee*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel reinforcement learning framework that uses EEG-based implicit human feedback to address sparse reward scenarios and validates its effectiveness using a robotic task.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional RL struggles with sparse rewards, requiring complex external reward designs, while existing RLHF methods depend on explicit feedback, which hinders natural interactions and burdens users.

Method: The proposed RLIHF framework utilizes EEG-based error-related potentials (ErrPs) as implicit feedback, processed via a pre-trained decoder, to guide reinforcement learning without explicit user input.

Result: In a simulated robot arm task, the approach achieved performance comparable to agents trained with densely crafted rewards, demonstrating the viability of EEG-based feedback for RL.

Conclusion: Utilizing implicit neural signals like EEG for reinforcement learning offers a scalable and user-friendly alternative for human-aligned AI training, particularly in robotic settings.

Abstract: Conventional reinforcement learning (RL) ap proaches often struggle to learn
effective policies under sparse reward conditions, necessitating the manual
design of complex, task-specific reward functions. To address this limitation,
rein forcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) has emerged as a promising
strategy that complements hand-crafted rewards with human-derived evaluation
signals. However, most existing RLHF methods depend on explicit feedback
mechanisms such as button presses or preference labels, which disrupt the
natural interaction process and impose a substantial cognitive load on the
user. We propose a novel reinforcement learning from implicit human feedback
(RLIHF) framework that utilizes non-invasive electroencephalography (EEG)
signals, specifically error-related potentials (ErrPs), to provide continuous,
implicit feedback without requiring explicit user intervention. The proposed
method adopts a pre-trained decoder to transform raw EEG signals into
probabilistic reward components, en abling effective policy learning even in
the presence of sparse external rewards. We evaluate our approach in a
simulation environment built on the MuJoCo physics engine, using a Kinova Gen2
robotic arm to perform a complex pick-and-place task that requires avoiding
obstacles while manipulating target objects. The results show that agents
trained with decoded EEG feedback achieve performance comparable to those
trained with dense, manually designed rewards. These findings validate the
potential of using implicit neural feedback for scalable and human-aligned
reinforcement learning in interactive robotics.

*Marina Y. Aoyama,Sethu Vijayakumar,Tetsuya Narita*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper addresses the challenge of teaching robots tool manipulation, proposing a few-shot transfer framework using multimodal sensing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Robots face challenges in tool manipulation due to complex contact relationships and limitations in tactile sensing data.

Method: The authors propose a framework involving pre-training in simulation and fine-tuning with human demonstrations to bridge the sim-to-real gap.

Result: The framework successfully enabled the Franka Emika robot arm to learn tool-use skills with diverse tools using minimal demonstrations.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates that multimodal sensing and transfer learning strategies can effectively teach robots new tool-use skills.

Abstract: Tools extend the manipulation abilities of robots, much like they do for
humans. Despite human expertise in tool manipulation, teaching robots these
skills faces challenges. The complexity arises from the interplay of two
simultaneous points of contact: one between the robot and the tool, and another
between the tool and the environment. Tactile and proximity sensors play a
crucial role in identifying these complex contacts. However, learning tool
manipulation using these sensors remains challenging due to limited real-world
data and the large sim-to-real gap. To address this, we propose a few-shot
tool-use skill transfer framework using multimodal sensing. The framework
involves pre-training the base policy to capture contact states common in
tool-use skills in simulation and fine-tuning it with human demonstrations
collected in the real-world target domain to bridge the domain gap. We validate
that this framework enables teaching surface-following tasks using tools with
diverse physical and geometric properties with a small number of demonstrations
on the Franka Emika robot arm. Our analysis suggests that the robot acquires
new tool-use skills by transferring the ability to recognise tool-environment
contact relationships from pre-trained to fine-tuned policies. Additionally,
combining proximity and tactile sensors enhances the identification of contact
states and environmental geometry.

Result: The method was validated on differential-drive and quadruped robots, demonstrating its effectiveness across various STL specifications.

Conclusion: The proposed model-free co-design strategy successfully generates feasible STL-compliant motion plans across different robotic systems and scenarios.

Abstract: This work presents a novel co-design strategy that integrates trajectory
planning and control to handle STL-based tasks in autonomous robots. The method
consists of two phases: $(i)$ learning spatio-temporal motion primitives to
encapsulate the inherent robot-specific constraints and $(ii)$ constructing an
STL-compliant motion plan from these primitives. Initially, we employ
reinforcement learning to construct a library of control policies that perform
trajectories described by the motion primitives. Then, we map motion primitives
to spatio-temporal characteristics. Subsequently, we present a sampling-based
STL-compliant motion planning strategy tailored to meet the STL specification.

TL;DR: This study focuses on reducing the data collection needed for training robotic visuomotor policies by utilizing external datasets and developing novel techniques like optic flow-based World Models and Latent Policy Steering (LPS).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the data-intensive nature of training visuomotor robot policies and minimize the cost and effort involved in collecting training demonstrations.

Method: They use optic flow as an embodiment-agnostic action representation to train a World Model (WM) across diverse datasets, followed by finetuning on specific robot data. Additionally, a method called Latent Policy Steering (LPS) is introduced to optimize policy outputs using the latent space of the WM.

Result: In real-world tests, combining the policy with an optic-flow-based WM led to over 50% relative performance improvement with 30 demonstrations, and over 20% with 50 demonstrations. This was achieved by leveraging datasets from other robots and human play data.

Conclusion: The approach significantly reduces the need for large amounts of robotic training data, demonstrating that pretrained World Models and optimization techniques like LPS can effectively improve policy performance.

Abstract: Learning visuomotor policies via imitation has proven effective across a wide
range of robotic domains. However, the performance of these policies is heavily
dependent on the number of training demonstrations, which requires expensive
data collection in the real world. In this work, we aim to reduce data
collection efforts when learning visuomotor robot policies by leveraging
existing or cost-effective data from a wide range of embodiments, such as
public robot datasets and the datasets of humans playing with objects (human
data from play). Our approach leverages two key insights. First, we use optic
flow as an embodiment-agnostic action representation to train a World Model
(WM) across multi-embodiment datasets, and finetune it on a small amount of
robot data from the target embodiment. Second, we develop a method, Latent
Policy Steering (LPS), to improve the output of a behavior-cloned policy by
searching in the latent space of the WM for better action sequences. In real
world experiments, we observe significant improvements in the performance of
policies trained with a small amount of data (over 50% relative improvement
with 30 demonstrations and over 20% relative improvement with 50
demonstrations) by combining the policy with a WM pretrained on two thousand
episodes sampled from the existing Open X-embodiment dataset across different
robots or a cost-effective human dataset from play.

Motivation: The diversity of QSDKs, such as Qiskit, Cirq, and PennyLane, complicates interoperability and cross-platform hybrid quantum-classical software development.

Method: The study positions LLMs as language-agnostic transpilers, which leverage pretrained knowledge and contextual reasoning to convert quantum programs between QSDKs without manual transformation rules.

Result: LLMs provide a scalable and flexible alternative to traditional rule-based transpilers, preserving functional equivalence during conversion.

Conclusion: This approach paves the way for intelligent and general-purpose transpilation, addressing the quantum software portability challenge.

Abstract: There exist various Software Development Kits (SDKs) tailored to different
quantum computing platforms. These are known as Quantum SDKs (QSDKs). Examples
include but are not limited to Qiskit, Cirq, and PennyLane. However, this
diversity presents significant challenges for interoperability and
cross-platform development of hybrid quantum-classical software systems.
Traditional rule-based transpilers for translating code between QSDKs are
time-consuming to design and maintain, requiring deep expertise and rigid
mappings in the source and destination code. In this study, we explore the use
of Large Language Models (LLMs) as a flexible and automated solution.
Leveraging their pretrained knowledge and contextual reasoning capabilities, we
position LLMs as programming language-agnostic transpilers capable of
converting quantum programs from one QSDK to another while preserving
functional equivalence. Our approach eliminates the need for manually defined
transformation rules and offers a scalable solution to quantum software
portability. This work represents a step toward enabling intelligent,
general-purpose transpilation in the quantum computing ecosystem.

Motivation: LLMs are powerful but limited by their inability to handle extensive codebases or reasoning over explicit code structures, necessitating advanced solutions for large-scale software automation.

Method: The paper introduces Kodezi Chronos, leveraging a multi-level embedding memory engine combining vector and graph-based indexing to handle ultra-long contexts and perform real-time, autonomous code maintenance tasks.

Result: Chronos shows a 23% improvement in real-world bug detection, reduces debugging cycles by up to 40%, and outperforms traditional and sequence-based approaches in large-scale code comprehension.

Conclusion: Kodezi Chronos advances the state of autonomous software maintenance, improving efficiency, code reliability, and reducing manual intervention, paving the way for optimized software ecosystems.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have advanced code generation and software
automation, but are fundamentally constrained by limited inference-time context
and lack of explicit code structure reasoning. We introduce Kodezi Chronos, a
next-generation architecture for autonomous code understanding, debugging, and
maintenance, designed to operate across ultra-long contexts comprising entire
codebases, histories, and documentation, all without fixed window limits.
Kodezi Chronos leverages a multi-level embedding memory engine, combining
vector and graph-based indexing with continuous code-aware retrieval. This
enables efficient and accurate reasoning over millions of lines of code,
supporting repository-scale comprehension, multi-file refactoring, and
real-time self-healing actions. Our evaluation introduces a novel Multi Random
Retrieval benchmark, specifically tailored to the software engineering domain.
Unlike classical retrieval benchmarks, this method requires the model to
resolve arbitrarily distant and obfuscated associations across code artifacts,
simulating realistic tasks such as variable tracing, dependency migration, and
semantic bug localization. Chronos outperforms prior LLMs and code models,
demonstrating a 23% improvement in real-world bug detection and reducing
debugging cycles by up to 40% compared to traditional sequence-based
approaches. By natively interfacing with IDEs and CI/CD workflows, Chronos
enables seamless, autonomous software maintenance, elevating code reliability
and productivity while reducing manual effort. These results mark a critical
advance toward self-sustaining, continuously optimized software ecosystems.

RL-for-SE, there remains a lack of a comprehensive and systematic survey of
this evolving field. To address this gap, we reviewed 115 peer-reviewed studies
published across 22 premier SE venues since the introduction of DRL. We
conducted a comprehensive analysis of publication trends, categorized SE topics
and RL algorithms, and examined key factors such as dataset usage, model design
and optimization, and evaluation practices. Furthermore, we identified open
challenges and proposed future research directions to guide and inspire ongoing
work in this evolving area. To summarize, this survey offers the first
systematic mapping of RL applications in software engineering, aiming to
support both researchers and practitioners in navigating the current landscape
and advancing the field. Our artifacts are publicly available:

### [251] [When Retriever Meets Generator: A Joint Model for Code Comment Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12558)
*Tien P. T. Le,Anh M. T. Bui,Huy N. D. Pham,Alessio Bucaioni,Phuong T. Nguyen*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper introduces RAGSum, a unified framework that tightly integrates retrieval and generation for automated source code comment generation, outperforming existing baselines on multiple benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing approaches to generate comments for source code often handle retrieval and generation separately, leading to irrelevant or noisy results. There is a need for an effective and efficient framework to integrate these components seamlessly.

Method: The study uses CodeT5 as a backbone and applies a contrastive pre-training phase to shape code embeddings for better retrieval. An end-to-end training approach integrates retrieval and generation, using a composite loss to enhance both retrieval accuracy and comment-generation quality. Additionally, a self-refinement loop is introduced to refine the final comments.

Result: RAGSum was evaluated on Java, Python, and C benchmarks and outperformed three strong baselines in BLEU, METEOR, and ROUTE-L metrics.

Conclusion: The results highlight that integrating retrieval and generation can significantly improve automated comment generation for source code. This approach encourages further studies and refinements in this domain.

Abstract: Automatically generating concise, informative comments for source code can
lighten documentation effort and accelerate program comprehension.
Retrieval-augmented approaches first fetch code snippets with existing comments
and then synthesize a new comment, yet retrieval and generation are typically
optimized in isolation, allowing irrelevant neighbors topropagate noise
downstream. To tackle the issue, we propose a novel approach named RAGSum with
the aim of both effectiveness and efficiency in recommendations. RAGSum is
built on top offuse retrieval and generation using a single CodeT5 backbone. We
report preliminary results on a unified retrieval-generation framework built on
CodeT5. A contrastive pre-training phase shapes code embeddings for
nearest-neighbor search; these weights then seed end-to-end training with a
composite loss that (i) rewards accurate top-k retrieval; and (ii) minimizes
comment-generation error. More importantly, a lightweight self-refinement loop
is deployed to polish the final output. We evaluated theframework on three
cross-language benchmarks (Java, Python, C), and compared it with three
well-established baselines. The results show that our approach substantially
outperforms thebaselines with respect to BLEU, METEOR, and ROUTE-L. These
findings indicate that tightly coupling retrieval and generationcan raise the
ceiling for comment automation and motivateforthcoming replications and
qualitative developer studies.

*Samal Nursapa,Anastassiya Samuilova,Alessio Bucaioni. Phuong T. Nguyen*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper examines using pre-trained transformer models, CodeBERT and CodeT5, to recommend fixes for architectural smells, reporting high accuracy and F1 scores for CodeT5.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the gap between existing smell detection tools and actionable repair suggestions, improving software quality and maintainability.

Method: The authors framed the task as a three-class classification problem and fine-tuned CodeBERT and CodeT5 on over 2 million refactoring instances from 11,149 open-source Java projects.

Result: CodeT5 achieved 96.9% accuracy and 95.2% F1 score, outperforming CodeBERT and traditional baselines in recommending refactorings.

Conclusion: Transformer-based models show strong potential in refactoring recommendation systems, bridging the gap between detection and repair for architectural smells. Open-source code and data support future research.

Abstract: Architectural smells such as God Class, Cyclic Dependency, and Hub-like
Dependency degrade software quality and maintainability. Existing tools detect
such smells but rarely suggest how to fix them. This paper explores the use of
pre-trained transformer models--CodeBERT and CodeT5--for recommending suitable
refactorings based on detected smells. We frame the task as a three-class
classification problem and fine-tune both models on over 2 million refactoring
instances mined from 11,149 open-source Java projects. CodeT5 achieves 96.9%
accuracy and 95.2% F1, outperforming CodeBERT and traditional baselines. Our
results show that transformer-based models can effectively bridge the gap
between smell detection and actionable repair, laying the foundation for future
refactoring recommendation systems. We release all code, models, and data under
an open license to support reproducibility and further research.

*Kiana Kheiri,Aamna Aamir,Andriy Miranskyy,Chen Ding*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper fine-tuned a 32B model using GRPO and ORPO methods, achieving superior performance in generating Qiskit code compared to general-purpose baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs often generate flawed quantum programming code, requiring advancements in error resilience and optimization for better Qiskit code generation.

Method: Two RL methods (Group Relative Policy Optimization and Odds-Ratio Preference Optimization) were used to fine-tune the model with a richly annotated synthetic dataset.

Result: ORPO scored 56.29% Pass@1 on Qiskit HumanEval, and GRPO achieved 49%, surpassing general-purpose baselines. On original HumanEval, both models had scores above 63%.

Conclusion: While significant gains were made in Qiskit code generation, challenges remain in solving advanced tasks for quantum programming with AI assistance.

Abstract: Quantum circuits must be error-resilient, yet LLMs like Granite-20B-Code and
StarCoder often output flawed Qiskit code. We fine-tuned a 32 B model with two
RL methods, Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) and Odds-Ratio Preference
Optimization (ORPO), using a richly annotated synthetic dataset. On the Qiskit
HumanEval benchmark, ORPO reaches 56.29\% Pass@1 ($\approx+10$ pp over
Granite-8B-QK) and GRPO hits 49\%, both beating all general-purpose baselines;
on the original HumanEval they score 65.90\% and 63.00\%. GRPO excels on basic
tasks (42/54), ORPO on intermediate ones (41/68), and neither solves the five
advanced tasks, highlighting clear gains yet room for progress in AI-assisted
quantum programming.

### [254] [A Three-Phase Evaluation Approach for new Information and Data Models in the Smart Grid Domain](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12649)
*Christine van Stiphoudt,Sergio Potenciano Menci,Gilbert Fridgen*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper develops a three-phase evaluation approach combining explicit and implicit methods for assessing newly designed information and data models in smart grids.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Digitalization in smart grids has led to increased automated exchanges and the need for new models, making it crucial to evaluate these during the design phase to avoid disruptions.

Method: The authors employ design science research to create a three-phase evaluation approach, testing it through a case study involving an information and data model for industrial flexibility.

Result: The proposed evaluation approach was refined through the development and testing of specific models, highlighting its applicability and effectiveness.

Conclusion: The paper addresses a key gap by presenting a structured evaluation method for smart grid information and data models during the design process, and shares lessons learned along the way.

Abstract: The ongoing digitalisation of the smart grid is resulting in an increase in
automated information exchanges across distributed energy systems. This process
has led to the development of new information and data models when the existing
ones fall short. To prevent potential disruptions caused by flaws in the newly
designed information and data models, it is essential to evaluate them during
the design process before they are implemented in operation.
  Currently, general explicit evaluation approaches outside the smart grid
domain stay at a high level without defining clear steps. Meanwhile, implicit
evaluation approaches in the smart grid domain focus on testing systems that
utilise information and data models already in use for functionality in terms
of conformance and interoperability. Notably, no combination of explicit and
implicit evaluation approaches for newly designed information and data models
offers a clearly defined set of steps during their design process in the smart
grid context.
  Consequently, we design a three-phase evaluation approach using design
science research to address this gap. Our evaluation approach combines explicit
and implicit evaluation methods and is applicable when developing new
information and data models. We use the development of an information model and
data model focused on industrial flexibility descriptions to refine our
evaluation approach. Additionally, we provide lessons learned from our
experience.

*João Granja-Correia,Remedios Hernández-Linares,Luca Ferranti,Arménio Rego*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper proposes a new way to evaluate project success using a hierarchical Type-1 Mamdani fuzzy system.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of traditional Likert-scale measures that fail to adequately capture the complex and context-dependent nature of project success.

Method: The study integrates fuzzy logic into an existing construct, utilizing a hierarchical Type-1 Mamdani fuzzy system focusing on sustained positive user impact and de-emphasizing secondary aspects like stakeholder satisfaction.

Result: The proposed system offers a potentially more accurate and dynamic evaluation of project success, with adaptability to complex scenarios.

Conclusion: This novel approach has the potential to redefine project success metrics, but further empirical research and expanded applications in social sciences are needed.

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel approach to project success evaluation by
integrating fuzzy logic into an existing construct. Traditional Likert-scale
measures often overlook the context-dependent and multifaceted nature of
project success. The proposed hierarchical Type-1 Mamdani fuzzy system
prioritizes sustained positive impact for end-users, reducing emphasis on
secondary outcomes like stakeholder satisfaction and internal project success.
This dynamic approach may provide a more accurate measure of project success
and could be adaptable to complex evaluations. Future research will focus on
empirical testing and broader applications of fuzzy logic in social science.

*Salvador D. Escobedo*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper proposes a structured method, SCM, for using large language models (LLMs) in software development, advocating for a single, long-context conversation for better clarity and traceability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors address the need for a structured approach to interactions with LLMs in software development, countering the current trend of passive reliance.

Method: The SCM emphasizes a structured, single long-context conversation covering all project stages, guided by principles like cognitive clarity, traceability, modularity, and documentation.

Result: SCM is presented as a principled methodology offering structured phases and practices, proposing a shift from ad hoc LLM interactions to active developer-guided processes.

Conclusion: The SCM methodology redefines the developer's role as an active supervisor, ensuring systematic and efficient use of intelligent tools like LLMs.

Abstract: We propose the Single Conversation Methodology (SCM), a novel and pragmatic
approach to software development using large language models (LLMs). In
contrast to ad hoc interactions with generative AI, SCM emphasizes a structured
and persistent development dialogue, where all stages of a project - from
requirements to architecture and implementation - unfold within a single,
long-context conversation. The methodology is grounded on principles of
cognitive clarity, traceability, modularity, and documentation. We define its
phases, best practices, and philosophical stance, while arguing that SCM offers
a necessary correction to the passive reliance on LLMs prevalent in current
practices. We aim to reassert the active role of the developer as architect and
supervisor of the intelligent tool.

### [257] [Investigating the Performance of Small Language Models in Detecting Test Smells in Manual Test Cases](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13035)
*Keila Lucas,Rohit Gheyi,Márcio Ribeiro,Fabio Palomba,Luana Martins,Elvys Soares*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The study explored using Small Language Models (SLMs) to automatically identify test smells in manual software testing, achieving high accuracy and autonomy in detection and suggestions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual testing often encounters issues such as ambiguity or redundancy, which reduce reliability and maintainability. Current detection tools are limited in scalability and require manual rule definitions, prompting the need for a more efficient solution.

Method: The authors evaluated three SLMs—Gemma3, Llama3.2, and Phi-4—on 143 Ubuntu test cases for their ability to detect seven types of test smells. Performance analysis focused on accuracy (pass@2) and autonomous explanations.

Result: Phi-4 achieved superior results with a pass@2 metric of 97% for detecting test smells, outperforming Gemma3 and Llama3.2, which both achieved approximately 91%. The models also autonomously explained issues and suggested improvements.

Conclusion: Small Language Models demonstrate substantial potential to identify and address test smells effectively and autonomously, enhancing the quality of manual test cases and preserving data privacy. They provide scalable, low-cost solutions without extensive rule definitions.

Abstract: Manual testing, in which testers follow natural language instructions to
validate system behavior, remains crucial for uncovering issues not easily
captured by automation. However, these test cases often suffer from test
smells, quality issues such as ambiguity, redundancy, or missing checks that
reduce test reliability and maintainability. While detection tools exist, they
typically require manual rule definition and lack scalability. This study
investigates the potential of Small Language Models (SLMs) for automatically
detecting test smells. We evaluate Gemma3, Llama3.2, and Phi-4 on 143
real-world Ubuntu test cases, covering seven types of test smells. Phi-4
achieved the best results, reaching a pass@2 of 97% in detecting sentences with
test smells, while Gemma3 and Llama3.2 reached approximately 91%. Beyond
detection, SLMs autonomously explained issues and suggested improvements, even
without explicit prompt instructions. They enabled low-cost, concept-driven
identification of diverse test smells without relying on extensive rule
definitions or syntactic analysis. These findings highlight the potential of
SLMs as efficient tools that preserve data privacy and can improve test quality
in real-world scenarios.

*Dongming Jin,Weisong Sun,Jiangping Huang,Peng Liang,Jifeng Xuan,Yang Liu,Zhi Jin*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper proposes iReDev, a knowledge-driven multi-agent framework for intelligent requirement development, aiming to facilitate human-agent collaboration and enhance requirement development processes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in requirement development, such as time consumption, labor intensity, and limited assistance from multi-agent systems and human-agent collaboration.

Method: The iReDev framework consists of six knowledge-driven agents that collaborate using an event-driven communication mechanism involving artifact pool monitoring and human-in-the-loop for stakeholder alignment.

Result: Evaluation shows that iReDev outperforms existing development baselines across multiple metrics in generating software requirement specifications.

Conclusion: The framework improves requirement development by integrating human knowledge with agents, enhancing collaboration, and allowing quick adaptation to new requirements. Future directions are suggested for advancement.

Abstract: Requirements development is a critical phase as it is responsible for
providing a clear understanding of what stakeholders need. It involves
collaboration among stakeholders to extract explicit requirements and address
potential conflicts, which is time-consuming and labor-intensive. Recently,
multi-agent systems for software development have attracted much attention.
However, existing research provides limited support for requirements
development and overlooks the injection of human knowledge into agents and the
human-agent collaboration. % To address these issues, this paper proposes a
knowledge-driven multi-agent framework for intelligent requirement development,
named iReDev. iReDev features: iReDev consists of six knowledge-driven agents
to support the entire requirements development. They collaboratively perform
various tasks to produce a software requirements specification. iReDev focuses
on integrating human knowledge for agents, enabling them to simulate real-world
stakeholders. iReDev uses an event-driven communication mechanism based on an
artifact pool. Agents continuously monitor the pool and autonomously trigger
the next action based on its changes, enabling iReDev to handle new
requirements quickly. iReDev introduces a human-in-the-loop mechanism to
support human-agent collaboration, ensuring that the generated artifacts align
with the expectations of stakeholders. We evaluated the generated artifacts and
results show that iReDev outperforms existing baselines in multiple aspects. We
further envision three key directions and hope this work can facilitate the
development of intelligent requirements development.

### [259] [A Conceptual Framework for Requirements Engineering of Pretrained-Model-Enabled Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13095)
*Dongming Jin,Zhi Jin,Linyu Li,Xiaohong Chen*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper explores challenges and proposes a new framework for requirements engineering in pretrained-model-enabled systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rise of pretrained models in software systems poses unique challenges to traditional requirements engineering due to their emergent and unpredictable nature.

Method: Proposed a conceptual framework tailored to address these challenges and suggested future research directions.

Result: Outlined research directions and conceptual tools for addressing the challenges in requirements engineering.

Conclusion: Advocates for innovative approaches in requirements engineering to address the transformation in software systems powered by pretrained models.

Abstract: Recent advances in large pretrained models have led to their widespread
integration as core components in modern software systems. The trend is
expected to continue in the foreseeable future. Unlike traditional software
systems governed by deterministic logic, systems powered by pretrained models
exhibit distinctive and emergent characteristics, such as ambiguous capability
boundaries, context-dependent behavior, and continuous evolution. These
properties fundamentally challenge long-standing assumptions in requirements
engineering, including functional decomposability and behavioral
predictability. This paper investigates this problem and advocates for a
rethinking of existing requirements engineering methodologies. We propose a
conceptual framework tailored to requirements engineering of
pretrained-model-enabled software systems and outline several promising
research directions within this framework. This vision helps provide a guide
for researchers and practitioners to tackle the emerging challenges in
requirements engineering of pretrained-model-enabled systems.

*Andreas Pointner,Josef Pichler,Herbert Prähofer*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper presents a method for reconstructing semantic aspects of input handling by inferring attributed grammars from recursive descent parsers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Incomplete or outdated specifications for software systems make it challenging to fully grasp the semantic aspects of input processing, which grammar mining tools have largely ignored.

Method: The authors propose a dynamic analysis approach to monitor the runtime behavior of parsers and embed semantic actions into grammar rules, forming attributed grammars.

Result: The approach successfully reproduces program behavior, as demonstrated through experiments on initial programs.

Conclusion: Their work offers a systematic way to extract and recover both syntax and semantics, enhancing specification completeness for software systems.

Abstract: Software systems that process structured inputs often lack complete and
up-to-date specifications, which specify the input syntax and the semantics of
input processing. While grammar mining techniques have focused on recovering
syntactic structures, the semantics of input processing remains largely
unexplored. In this work, we introduce a novel approach for inferring
attributed grammars from parser implementations. Given an input grammar, our
technique dynamically analyzes the implementation of recursive descent parsers
to reconstruct the semantic aspects of input handling, resulting in
specifications in the form of attributed grammars. By observing program
executions and mapping the program's runtime behavior to the grammar, we
systematically extract and embed semantic actions into the grammar rules. This
enables comprehensive specification recovery. We demonstrate the feasibility of
our approach using an initial set of programs, showing that it can accurately
reproduce program behavior through the generated attributed grammars.

### [261] [Detecting LLM-generated Code with Subtle Modification by Adversarial Training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13123)
*Xin Yin,Xinrui Li,Chao Ni,Xiaodan Xu,Xiaohu Yang*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper proposes CodeGPTSensor+, an improved detection method for Large Language Model (LLM)-generated code, particularly when the code has undergone modifications, using adversarial training to increase robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation stems from the widespread application of LLM-generated code in various tasks, which has raised concerns about compliance, copyright, and quality. Existing detection methods lack robustness in handling modified LLM-generated code, creating a pressing need for a more effective solution.

Method: They introduced CodeGPTSensor+, which improves upon its predecessor by incorporating an adversarial training framework. A crucial component is the Multi-objective Identifier and Structure Transformation (MIST) module that systematically generates high-quality adversarial samples to enhance the model's robustness.

Result: Experiments conducted on the HMCorp dataset revealed that CodeGPTSensor+ significantly improves detection accuracy on adversarial test sets while maintaining high performance on original test sets. This demonstrates a robust resistance to adversarial attacks.

Conclusion: CodeGPTSensor+ offers an effective and robust solution for detecting LLM-generated code, even when modifications are made, addressing critical concerns in the domain of compliance and code quality.

Abstract: With the rapid development of Large Language Models (LLMs), their powerful
code-generation capabilities have been widely applied in tasks like code
completion and automated development, demonstrating the value of improving
coding efficiency. However, the extensive use of LLM-generated code also raises
several new challenges. On the one hand, issues such as the regulation of code
provenance, copyright disputes, and code quality have become increasingly
concerning. How to effectively detect LLM-generated code and ensure its
compliant and responsible use has become a critical and urgent issue. On the
other hand, in practical applications, LLM-generated code is often subject to
manual modifications, such as variable renaming or structural adjustments.
Although some recent studies have proposed training-based and zero-shot methods
for detecting LLM-generated code, these approaches show insufficient robustness
when facing modified LLM-generated code, and there is a lack of an effective
solution. To address the real-world scenario where LLM-generated code may
undergo minor modifications, we propose CodeGPTSensor+, an enhanced version of
CodeGPTSensor, which employs adversarial training to improve robustness against
input perturbations. CodeGPTSensor+ integrates an adversarial sample generation
module, Multi-objective Identifier and Structure Transformation (MIST), which
systematically generates both high-quality and representative adversarial
samples. This module effectively enhances the model's resistance against
diverse adversarial attacks. Experimental results on the HMCorp dataset
demonstrate that CodeGPTSensor+ significantly improves detection accuracy on
the adversarial test set while maintaining high accuracy on the original test
set, showcasing superior robustness compared to CodeGPTSensor.

*Mia-Katrin Kvalsund,Mikkel Elle Lepperød*

Main category: q-bio.NC

TL;DR: This review connects the minicolumn hypothesis of the brain to neural module repetition in AI, exploring its potential to address challenges like scalability, efficiency, and robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Modern AI systems lack the robustness, adaptability, and efficiency found in biological brains, and there’s no extensive review synthesizing insights on cortical column-inspired neural architectures.

Method: The paper examines neural module repetition inspired by minicolumns, distinguishing between architectural repetition and parameter-shared module repetition, drawing connections to collective intelligence properties.

Result: It posits that parameter-shared module repetition leads to generalist modules, offering simplicity, adaptability, energy efficiency, and robustness, with evidence for some generalization capabilities but lacking theoretical development.

Conclusion: Repeated neural module architectures inspired by the brain’s minicolumns have untapped potential to address modern AI challenges, particularly in energy efficiency, scalability, adaptability, and robustness.

Abstract: While modern AI continues to advance, the biological brain remains the
pinnacle of neural networks in its robustness, adaptability, and efficiency.
This review explores an AI architectural path inspired by the brain's
structure, particularly the minicolumn hypothesis, which views the neocortex as
a distributed system of repeated modules - a structure we connect to collective
intelligence (CI). Despite existing work, there is a lack of comprehensive
reviews connecting the cortical column to the architectures of repeated neural
modules. This review aims to fill that gap by synthesizing historical,
theoretical, and methodological perspectives on neural module repetition. We
distinguish between architectural repetition - reusing structure - and
parameter-shared module repetition, where the same functional unit is repeated
across a network. The latter exhibits key CI properties such as robustness,
adaptability, and generalization. Evidence suggests that the repeated module
tends to converge toward a generalist module: simple, flexible problem solvers
capable of handling many roles in the ensemble. This generalist tendency may
offer solutions to longstanding challenges in modern AI: improved energy
efficiency during training through simplicity and scalability, and robust
embodied control via generalization. While empirical results suggest such
systems can generalize to out-of-distribution problems, theoretical results are
still lacking. Overall, architectures featuring module repetition remain an
emerging and unexplored architectural strategy, with significant untapped
potential for both efficiency, robustness, and adaptiveness. We believe that a
system that adopts the benefits of CI, while adhering to architectural and
functional principles of the minicolumns, could challenge the modern AI
problems of scalability, energy consumption, and democratization.

*Spyridon Revithis,Nadine Marcus*

Main category: q-bio.NC

TL;DR: The paper explores Self-Organising Maps (SOMs) for cognitive modelling of neurodevelopmental disorders, introducing a biologically-inspired oscillating SOM network. It finds similar map behaviors in both standard and new models but highlights improved biological realism in the modified approach.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to assess and enhance the theoretical and applied validity of SOMs for modeling cognitive processes, particularly in neurodevelopmental disorders like autism and schizophrenia.

Method: The paper introduces an oscillating Topological Neighbourhood in SOMs to increase biological plausibility. Both standard and modified SOMs are tested with neurocomputational theories through computer simulations based on an updated model.

Result: The proposed oscillating SOM shows similar map formation and outputs to standard SOMs but offers better biological realism, aligning with neuroscientific expectations.

Conclusion: The oscillating SOM provides a more realistic computational model of brain function while maintaining the effectiveness of standard SOMs for cognitive modelling.

Abstract: Background/Introduction: In this paper, the neural network class of
Self-Organising Maps (SOMs) is investigated in terms of its theoretical and
applied validity for cognitive modelling, particularly of neurodevelopmental
disorders.
  Methods: A modified SOM network type, with increased biological plausibility,
incorporating a type of cortical columnar oscillation in the form of an
oscillating Topological Neighbourhood (TN), is introduced and applied alongside
the standard SOM. Aspects of two neurodevelopmental disorders, autism and
schizophrenia, are modelled using SOM networks, based on existing
neurocomputational theories. Both standard and oscillating-TN SOM training is
employed with targeted modifications in the TN width function. Computer
simulations are conducted using revised versions of a previously introduced
model (IPSOM) based on a new modelling hypothesis.
  Results/Conclusions: The results demonstrate that there is strong similarity
between standard and oscillating-TN SOM modelling in terms of map formation
behaviour, output and structure, while the oscillating version offers a more
realistic computational analogue of brain function. Neuroscientific and
computational arguments are presented to validate the proposed SOM modification
within a cognitive modelling framework.

*David Freire-Obregón,Agnieszka Dubiel,Prasoon Kumar Vinodkumar,Gholamreza Anbarjafari,Dorota Kamińska,Modesto Castrillón-Santana*

Main category: q-bio.NC

TL;DR: The paper proposes a framework to make bi-hemispheric EEG emotion recognition models interpretable by adapting LIME for structured, dual-input data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve the interpretability of deep learning EEG classifiers for emotion recognition, especially in scenarios where sensitive applications like cognitive modeling require transparency.

Method: The study introduces a tailored version of LIME suitable for structured dual-stream EEG networks. This method breaks down prediction relevance at the channel level across hemispheres and emotional classes, using a dataset from VR-based EEG recordings.

Result: The method reveals emotion-specific hemispheric activation patterns corresponding with neuroscientific findings, like lateralization in particular emotions and posterior asymmetries. It also enables aggregated, neurophysiologically consistent insights about model decision-making.

Conclusion: The proposed interpretability framework aligns computational results with established neurophysiological phenomena, improving model transparency and supporting its potential in sensitive applications.

Abstract: Recent advances have shown promise in emotion recognition from
electroencephalogram (EEG) signals by employing bi-hemispheric neural
architectures that incorporate neuroscientific priors into deep learning
models. However, interpretability remains a significant limitation for their
application in sensitive fields such as affective computing and cognitive
modeling. In this work, we introduce a post-hoc interpretability framework
tailored to dual-stream EEG classifiers, extending the Local Interpretable
Model-Agnostic Explanations (LIME) approach to accommodate structured,
bi-hemispheric inputs. Our method adapts LIME to handle structured two-branch
inputs corresponding to left and right-hemisphere EEG channel groups. It
decomposes prediction relevance into per-channel contributions across
hemispheres and emotional classes. We apply this framework to a previously
validated dual-branch recurrent neural network trained on EmoNeuroDB, a dataset
of EEG recordings captured during a VR-based emotion elicitation task. The
resulting explanations reveal emotion-specific hemispheric activation patterns
consistent with known neurophysiological phenomena, such as frontal
lateralization in joy and posterior asymmetry in sadness. Furthermore, we
aggregate local explanations across samples to derive global channel importance
profiles, enabling a neurophysiologically grounded interpretation of the
model's decisions. Correlation analysis between symmetric electrodes further
highlights the model's emotion-dependent lateralization behavior, supporting
the functional asymmetries reported in affective neuroscience.

*Yuki Tomoda,Ichiro Tsuda,Yutaka Yamaguti*

Main category: q-bio.NC

TL;DR: This paper presents a method to induce functional differentiation in neural networks by minimizing mutual information, revealing insights into how functional modularity arises before structural modularity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how functional specialization and modularity emerge in the brain, as well as in artificial neural networks, which is critical for comprehending complex brain systems.

Method: The authors minimize mutual information between neural subgroups using mutual information neural estimation to induce functional differentiation, applying the method to tasks like working memory and chaotic signal separation.

Result: The method achieves high task performance while demonstrating clear functional modularity and moderate structural modularity, with functional differentiation emerging earlier than structural modularity.

Conclusion: Functional specialization precedes and likely drives structural reorganization, highlighting how information-theoretic principles guide brain development and artificial neural network modularity.

Abstract: Functional differentiation in the brain emerges as distinct regions
specialize and is key to understanding brain function as a complex system.
Previous research has modeled this process using artificial neural networks
with specific constraints. Here, we propose a novel approach that induces
functional differentiation in recurrent neural networks by minimizing mutual
information between neural subgroups via mutual information neural estimation.
We apply our method to a 2-bit working memory task and a chaotic signal
separation task involving Lorenz and R\"ossler time series. Analysis of network
performance, correlation patterns, and weight matrices reveals that mutual
information minimization yields high task performance alongside clear
functional modularity and moderate structural modularity. Importantly, our
results show that functional differentiation, which is measured through
correlation structures, emerges earlier than structural modularity defined by
synaptic weights. This suggests that functional specialization precedes and
probably drives structural reorganization within developing neural networks.
Our findings provide new insights into how information-theoretic principles may
govern the emergence of specialized functions and modular structures during
artificial and biological brain development.

### [266] [Physics constrained learning of stochastic characteristics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12661)
*Pardha Sai Krishna Ala,Ameya Salvi,Venkat Krovi,Matthias Schmid*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper develops a learning-based methodology to estimate noise characteristics for improving accuracy in vehicle state estimation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The accurate selection of covariance matrices is critical for effective state estimation, yet designing these matrices is challenging due to noise uncertainties and complexity in noise modeling.

Method: The authors introduce a learning-based approach, employing diverse loss functions to accurately identify noise characteristics.

Result: The proposed methodology successfully enhances the performance of real-time vehicle state estimation.

Conclusion: Learning-driven strategies are promising for noise characteristic identification, aiding in improved state estimation practices.

Abstract: Accurate state estimation requires careful consideration of uncertainty
surrounding the process and measurement models; these characteristics are
usually not well-known and need an experienced designer to select the
covariance matrices. An error in the selection of covariance matrices could
impact the accuracy of the estimation algorithm and may sometimes cause the
filter to diverge. Identifying noise characteristics has long been a
challenging problem due to uncertainty surrounding noise sources and
difficulties in systematic noise modeling. Most existing approaches try
identifying unknown covariance matrices through an optimization algorithm
involving innovation sequences. In recent years, learning approaches have been
utilized to determine the stochastic characteristics of process and measurement
models. We present a learning-based methodology with different loss functions
to identify noise characteristics and test these approaches' performance for
real-time vehicle state estimation

*Krishnakumar Balasubramanian,Nathan Ross*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper analyzes finite-dimensional distributions (FDDs) of deep neural networks with random weights, establishing Gaussian approximations and convergence rates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the theoretical behavior of deep neural networks through finite-dimensional distributions when weights are initialized randomly.

Method: Using Gaussian approximation bounds with Wasserstein-$1$ norm and considering Lipschitz activation functions while allowing layer widths to scale arbitrarily.

Result: Achieved convergence rates of order $n^{-({1}/{6})^{L-1} + \epsilon}$, under proportional scaling of layer widths with $L$ hidden layers.

Conclusion: The study generalizes Gaussian approximation methods to neural networks with random initialized weights, providing deeper insights into scaling behavior and approximations.

Abstract: We study the Finite-Dimensional Distributions (FDDs) of deep neural networks
with randomly initialized weights that have finite-order moments. Specifically,
we establish Gaussian approximation bounds in the Wasserstein-$1$ norm between
the FDDs and their Gaussian limit assuming a Lipschitz activation function and
allowing the layer widths to grow to infinity at arbitrary relative rates. In
the special case where all widths are proportional to a common scale parameter
$n$ and there are $L-1$ hidden layers, we obtain convergence rates of order
$n^{-({1}/{6})^{L-1} + \epsilon}$, for any $\epsilon > 0$.

### [268] [Self Balancing Neural Network: A Novel Method to Estimate Average Treatment Effect](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12818)
*Atomsa Gemechu Abdisa,Yingchun Zhou,Yuqi Qiu*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: This study introduces a novel method called the 'Self-balancing neural network' (Sbnet) to address bias in estimating average treatment effects caused by confounding variables in observational studies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation stems from the challenge of bias in estimating average treatment effects in observational studies, where confounding variables and instrumental variables create complications not present in randomized controlled trials.

Method: The authors developed a self-balancing neural network (Sbnet) that uses a balancing net to estimate pseudo propensity scores and incorporates a multi-pseudo propensity score framework to estimate the average treatment effect in a single step.

Result: The proposed methods demonstrated superior performance in comparison to state-of-the-art methods across three simulation setups and real-world datasets.

Conclusion: The Self-balancing neural network (Sbnet) effectively reduces bias in average treatment effect estimation and outperforms existing methodologies, offering a robust solution for observational studies.

Abstract: In observational studies, confounding variables affect both treatment and
outcome. Moreover, instrumental variables also influence the treatment
assignment mechanism. This situation sets the study apart from a standard
randomized controlled trial, where the treatment assignment is random. Due to
this situation, the estimated average treatment effect becomes biased. To
address this issue, a standard approach is to incorporate the estimated
propensity score when estimating the average treatment effect. However, these
methods incur the risk of misspecification in propensity score models. To solve
this issue, a novel method called the "Self balancing neural network" (Sbnet),
which lets the model itself obtain its pseudo propensity score from the
balancing net, is proposed in this study. The proposed method estimates the
average treatment effect by using the balancing net as a key part of the
feedforward neural network. This formulation resolves the estimation of the
average treatment effect in one step. Moreover, the multi-pseudo propensity
score framework, which is estimated from the diversified balancing net and used
for the estimation of the average treatment effect, is presented. Finally, the
proposed methods are compared with state-of-the-art methods on three simulation
setups and real-world datasets. It has been shown that the proposed
self-balancing neural network shows better performance than state-of-the-art
methods.

*Yaniv Shulman*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: This paper proposes a Bayesian framework for modeling and identifying Linear Time-Variant (LTV) systems using modern machine learning techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenging problem of identifying Linear Time-Variant (LTV) systems from noisy input-output data while rigorously quantifying uncertainty.

Method: The authors propose modeling the system's impulse response as a stochastic process, using Bayesian neural networks, Gaussian Processes, and scalable variational inference techniques.

Result: The framework achieves robust inference of LTI system properties from a single noisy observation, demonstrates superior data efficiency in ambient noise tomography, and effectively tracks continuously varying LTV impulse responses.

Conclusion: The proposed Bayesian framework offers a flexible and robust approach for uncertainty-aware system identification in dynamic environments, introducing the new system class termed Linear Time-Invariant in Expectation (LTIE).

Abstract: The identification of Linear Time-Variant (LTV) systems from input-output
data is a fundamental yet challenging ill-posed inverse problem. This work
introduces a unified Bayesian framework that models the system's impulse
response, $h(t, \tau)$, as a stochastic process. We decompose the response into
a posterior mean and a random fluctuation term, a formulation that provides a
principled approach for quantifying uncertainty and naturally defines a new,
useful system class we term Linear Time-Invariant in Expectation (LTIE). To
perform inference, we leverage modern machine learning techniques, including
Bayesian neural networks and Gaussian Processes, using scalable variational
inference. We demonstrate through a series of experiments that our framework
can robustly infer the properties of an LTI system from a single noisy
observation, show superior data efficiency compared to classical methods in a
simulated ambient noise tomography problem, and successfully track a
continuously varying LTV impulse response by using a structured Gaussian
Process prior. This work provides a flexible and robust methodology for
uncertainty-aware system identification in dynamic environments.

### [270] [When Pattern-by-Pattern Works: Theoretical and Empirical Insights for Logistic Models with Missing Values](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13024)
*Christophe Muller,Erwan Scornet,Julie Josse*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: This paper addresses response prediction with partially missing inputs in logistic models, presenting a Pattern-by-Pattern (PbP) strategy that effectively approximates Bayes probabilities and comparing various imputation strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study is motivated by the challenges in accurately predicting outcomes with partially missing inputs, especially in logistic models where parameter estimation alone is not enough.

Method: The authors theoretically analyze the PbP strategy, proving its effectiveness in different missing data scenarios (MCAR, MAR, MNAR), and empirically compare multiple methods (imputation, complete case analysis, PbP, and EM) using classification and parameter inference tasks.

Result: The study reveals that for low sample sizes, mean imputation serves as a viable baseline, while iterative methods like MICE.RF.Y perform better. For larger samples, PbP excels in Gaussian mixtures, while MICE.RF.Y is better for nonlinear features.

Conclusion: The paper provides a detailed guide for handling missing data in logistic regression, recommending PbP for specific scenarios and MICE.RF.Y for nonlinear contexts or larger datasets.

Abstract: Predicting a response with partially missing inputs remains a challenging
task even in parametric models, since parameter estimation in itself is not
sufficient to predict on partially observed inputs. Several works study
prediction in linear models. In this paper, we focus on logistic models, which
present their own difficulties. From a theoretical perspective, we prove that a
Pattern-by-Pattern strategy (PbP), which learns one logistic model per
missingness pattern, accurately approximates Bayes probabilities in various
missing data scenarios (MCAR, MAR and MNAR). Empirically, we thoroughly compare
various methods (constant and iterative imputations, complete case analysis,
PbP, and an EM algorithm) across classification, probability estimation,
calibration, and parameter inference. Our analysis provides a comprehensive
view on the logistic regression with missing values. It reveals that mean
imputation can be used as baseline for low sample sizes, and improved
performance is obtained via nonlinear multiple iterative imputation techniques
with the labels (MICE.RF.Y). For large sample sizes, PbP is the best method for
Gaussian mixtures, and we recommend MICE.RF.Y in presence of nonlinear
features.

### [271] [Relation-Aware Slicing in Cross-Domain Alignment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13194)
*Dhruv Sarkar,Aprameyo Chakrabartty,Anish Chakrabarty,Swagatam Das*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Relation-Aware Slicing Distribution (RASD) to address inefficiencies and lack of representative power in the Sliced Gromov-Wasserstein (SGW) distance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve computational efficiency and representative power of SGW by addressing the issue of uninformative projection directions in slicing mechanisms.

Method: The authors propose Relation-Aware Projecting Direction (RAPD) and derive RASD, which allows fast sampling for Monte Carlo approximation, and introduce the RASGW distance and its importance-weighted variant (IWRASGW).

Result: The proposed RASGW distance offers better theoretical properties and demonstrated empirical effectiveness in alignment tasks compared to SGW variants.

Conclusion: The innovative slicing method resolves the inefficiencies in SGW, showing promise in both theory and practical applications for alignment-related tasks with improved computational and representational capabilities.

Abstract: The Sliced Gromov-Wasserstein (SGW) distance, aiming to relieve the
computational cost of solving a non-convex quadratic program that is the
Gromov-Wasserstein distance, utilizes projecting directions sampled uniformly
from unit hyperspheres. This slicing mechanism incurs unnecessary computational
costs due to uninformative directions, which also affects the representative
power of the distance. However, finding a more appropriate distribution over
the projecting directions (slicing distribution) is often an optimization
problem in itself that comes with its own computational cost. In addition, with
more intricate distributions, the sampling itself may be expensive. As a
remedy, we propose an optimization-free slicing distribution that provides fast
sampling for the Monte Carlo approximation. We do so by introducing the
Relation-Aware Projecting Direction (RAPD), effectively capturing the pairwise
association of each of two pairs of random vectors, each following their
ambient law. This enables us to derive the Relation-Aware Slicing Distribution
(RASD), a location-scale law corresponding to sampled RAPDs. Finally, we
introduce the RASGW distance and its variants, e.g., IWRASGW (Importance
Weighted RASGW), which overcome the shortcomings experienced by SGW. We
theoretically analyze its properties and substantiate its empirical prowess
using extensive experiments on various alignment tasks.

### [272] [Achieving Robust Channel Estimation Neural Networks by Designed Training Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12630)
*Dianxin Luan,John Thompson*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: This paper proposes offline-trained neural networks for cognitive communications that generalize robustly to unseen wireless channels, sidestepping the need for real-time channel information or updates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the unreliable extrapolation of data-driven neural networks in time-variant wireless channels, and the impracticality of real-time fine-tuning due to latency and computational constraints.

Method: The authors introduce design criteria for synthetic training datasets, ensuring that neural networks achieve consistent performance (in terms of MSE) on unseen channels. They also propose a benchmark design for intelligent operation across channel profiles, tested on neural networks of varying complexity.

Result: Simulations demonstrated that the proposed neural networks uphold robust generalization across both fixed and variable wireless channel profiles, independent of neural network architecture.

Conclusion: Offline-trained neural networks with the proposed synthetic datasets can reliably generalize to diverse wireless channels, making them viable for real-world use without prior channel knowledge or parameter adjustments.

Abstract: Channel estimation is crucial in cognitive communications, as it enables
intelligent spectrum sensing and adaptive transmission by providing accurate
information about the current channel state. However, in many papers neural
networks are frequently tested by training and testing on one example channel
or similar channels. This is because data-driven methods often degrade on new
data which they are not trained on, as they cannot extrapolate their training
knowledge. This is despite the fact physical channels are often assumed to be
time-variant. However, due to the low latency requirements and limited
computing resources, neural networks may not have enough time and computing
resources to execute online training to fine-tune the parameters. This
motivates us to design offline-trained neural networks that can perform
robustly over wireless channels, but without any actual channel information
being known at design time. In this paper, we propose design criteria to
generate synthetic training datasets for neural networks, which guarantee that
after training the resulting networks achieve a certain mean squared error
(MSE) on new and previously unseen channels. Therefore, neural network
solutions require no prior channel information or parameters update for
real-world implementations. Based on the proposed design criteria, we further
propose a benchmark design which ensures intelligent operation for different
channel profiles. To demonstrate general applicability, we use neural networks
with different levels of complexity to show that the generalization achieved
appears to be independent of neural network architecture. From simulations,
neural networks achieve robust generalization to wireless channels with both
fixed channel profiles and variable delay spreads.

*Mohammed Guhdar,Ramadhan J. Mstafa,Abdulhakeem O. Mohammed*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: This study introduces a unified deep learning framework combining ResNet-based CNN, attention mechanisms, and novel data augmentation strategies to robustly analyze diverse biological signals such as ECG and EEG, achieving state-of-the-art performance across benchmark datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper is motivated by the need to address challenges in effectively analyzing different physiological signals and overcoming class imbalances found in biomedical datasets.

Method: The paper proposes a ResNet-based CNN architecture with attention mechanisms, advanced preprocessing steps (wavelet denoising, baseline removal, and standardization), innovative data augmentation (time-domain concatenation), and Focal Loss to manage class imbalances.

Result: The framework demonstrated high accuracy in benchmark datasets: UCI Seizure EEG (99.96%), MIT-BIH Arrhythmia (99.78%), and PTB Diagnostic ECG (100%), showing robustness across signal types.

Conclusion: The proposed architecture is effective for diverse biomedical signal analysis, both in performance and efficiency, making it suitable for deployment in wearable or resource-constrained devices.

Abstract: The increasing need for accurate and unified analysis of diverse biological
signals, such as ECG and EEG, is paramount for comprehensive patient
assessment, especially in synchronous monitoring. Despite advances in
multi-sensor fusion, a critical gap remains in developing unified architectures
that effectively process and extract features from fundamentally different
physiological signals. Another challenge is the inherent class imbalance in
many biomedical datasets, often causing biased performance in traditional
methods. This study addresses these issues by proposing a novel and unified
deep learning framework that achieves state-of-the-art performance across
different signal types. Our method integrates a ResNet-based CNN with an
attention mechanism, enhanced by a novel data augmentation strategy:
time-domain concatenation of multiple augmented variants of each signal to
generate richer representations. Unlike prior work, we scientifically increase
signal complexity to achieve future-reaching capabilities, which resulted in
the best predictions compared to the state of the art. Preprocessing steps
included wavelet denoising, baseline removal, and standardization. Class
imbalance was effectively managed through the combined use of this advanced
data augmentation and the Focal Loss function. Regularization techniques were
applied during training to ensure generalization. We rigorously evaluated the
proposed architecture on three benchmark datasets: UCI Seizure EEG, MIT-BIH
Arrhythmia, and PTB Diagnostic ECG. It achieved accuracies of 99.96%, 99.78%,
and 100%, respectively, demonstrating robustness across diverse signal types
and clinical contexts. Finally, the architecture requires ~130 MB of memory and
processes each sample in ~10 ms, suggesting suitability for deployment on
low-end or wearable devices.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome computational and performance challenges faced by classical machine learning and deep learning models when dealing with high-dimensional biomedical data for dementia prediction.

Method: The authors used quantum transfer learning to enhance a weak classical deep learning model for binary classification of dementia using the OASIS 2 dataset. They also analyzed the effects of noise on their QTL-based approach.

Result: QTL demonstrated improved effectiveness in transforming suboptimal classical models into robust and efficient solutions for dementia detection tasks.

Conclusion: Quantum machine learning techniques, particularly QTL, show promise in advancing the field of healthcare technology, delivering better outcomes for complex biomedical problems such as dementia detection.

Abstract: Dementia is a devastating condition with profound implications for
individuals, families, and healthcare systems. Early and accurate detection of
dementia is critical for timely intervention and improved patient outcomes.
While classical machine learning and deep learning approaches have been
explored extensively for dementia prediction, these solutions often struggle
with high-dimensional biomedical data and large-scale datasets, quickly
reaching computational and performance limitations. To address this challenge,
quantum machine learning (QML) has emerged as a promising paradigm, offering
faster training and advanced pattern recognition capabilities. This work aims
to demonstrate the potential of quantum transfer learning (QTL) to enhance the
performance of a weak classical deep learning model applied to a binary
classification task for dementia detection. Besides, we show the effect of
noise on the QTL-based approach, investigating the reliability and robustness
of this method. Using the OASIS 2 dataset, we show how quantum techniques can
transform a suboptimal classical model into a more effective solution for
biomedical image classification, highlighting their potential impact on
advancing healthcare technology.

TL;DR: SpoQFL is a framework for Quantum Federated Learning that addresses quantum noise heterogeneity, improving model robustness and training performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Quantum Federated Learning faces challenges due to quantum noise heterogeneity, which reduces training performance.

Method: SpoQFL uses sporadic learning to dynamically adapt training strategies in response to noise fluctuations.

Result: SpoQFL exhibits superior training performance and convergence stability in experiments with real-world datasets.

Conclusion: SpoQFL enhances the efficiency and reliability of Quantum Federated Learning in noisy quantum environments.

Abstract: Quantum Federated Learning (QFL) is an emerging paradigm that combines
quantum computing and federated learning (FL) to enable decentralized model
training while maintaining data privacy over quantum networks. However, quantum
noise remains a significant barrier in QFL, since modern quantum devices
experience heterogeneous noise levels due to variances in hardware quality and
sensitivity to quantum decoherence, resulting in inadequate training
performance. To address this issue, we propose SpoQFL, a novel QFL framework
that leverages sporadic learning to mitigate quantum noise heterogeneity in
distributed quantum systems. SpoQFL dynamically adjusts training strategies
based on noise fluctuations, enhancing model robustness, convergence stability,
and overall learning efficiency. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets
demonstrate that SpoQFL significantly outperforms conventional QFL approaches,
achieving superior training performance and more stable convergence.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current SLU systems rely on separate models for individual tasks like spoken NER and SA, leading to increased complexity, limited cross-task interaction, and underutilization of heterogeneous datasets available across tasks.

Method: The paper proposes UniSLU, a unified generative framework that integrates ASR, spoken NER, and SA tasks within a single architecture using a unified representation. It leverages large language models for improved generative capabilities and task interactions.

Result: UniSLU achieves superior performance on SLU tasks compared to multiple benchmark methods through extensive experiments on public datasets.

Conclusion: UniSLU simplifies SLU systems while achieving higher performance, making it viable for real-world multimedia applications. The code and models will be released for future research.

Abstract: Spoken Language Understanding (SLU) plays a crucial role in speech-centric
multimedia applications, enabling machines to comprehend spoken language in
scenarios such as meetings, interviews, and customer service interactions. SLU
encompasses multiple tasks, including Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR),
spoken Named Entity Recognition (NER), and spoken Sentiment Analysis (SA).
However, existing methods often rely on separate model architectures for
individual tasks such as spoken NER and SA, which increases system complexity,
limits cross-task interaction, and fails to fully exploit heterogeneous
datasets available across tasks. To address these limitations, we propose
UniSLU, a unified framework that jointly models multiple SLU tasks within a
single architecture. Specifically, we propose a unified representation for
diverse SLU tasks, enabling full utilization of heterogeneous datasets across
multiple tasks. Built upon this representation, we propose a unified generative
method that jointly models ASR, spoken NER, and SA tasks, enhancing task
interactions and enabling seamless integration with large language models to
harness their powerful generative capabilities. Extensive experiments on public
SLU datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, achieving superior
SLU performance compared to several benchmark methods, making it well-suited
for real-world speech-based multimedia scenarios. We will release all code and

TL;DR: The paper discusses the importance of addressing software quality in university-level programming courses and analyzes student projects to identify common quality issues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Limited focus on software quality in programming and software engineering education, especially in intermediate-level courses.

Method: A static analysis pipeline using SonarQube and ArchUnit was applied to evaluate 83 student projects for code smells and architectural anti-patterns.

Result: The study identified recurring software quality issues and provided evidence of specific challenges faced by students working on complex object-oriented projects.

Conclusion: The findings offer insights for improving software engineering curricula, emphasizing quality-oriented development practices, and better preparing students for real-world software challenges.

Abstract: When teaching Programming and Software Engineering in Bachelor's Degree
programs, the emphasis on creating functional software projects often
overshadows the focus on software quality, a trend that aligns with ACM
curricula recommendations. Software Engineering courses are typically
introduced later in the curriculum, and can generally allocate only limited
time to quality-related topics, leaving educators with the challenge of
deciding which quality aspects to prioritize. In this decision, the literature
offers limited guidance, as most existing studies focus on code written by
novice students and small code units, making it unclear whether those findings
extend to intermediate-level students with foundational object-oriented
programming skills working on more complex software projects. To address this
gap, we analyze 83 object-oriented team projects developed by 172 university
students across 4 different editions of the Object-Oriented Programming course.
We apply a static analysis pipeline used in prior research to assess software
quality, combining SonarQube and ArchUnit to detect code smells and
architectural anti-patterns. Our findings highlight recurring quality issues
and offer concrete evidence of the challenges students face at this stage,
providing valuable guidance for educators aiming to continuously improve
Software Engineering curricula and promote quality-oriented development
practices.

Motivation: The authors aim to understand how well LLMs can replicate the imperfect, iterative, and stylistically varied coding patterns of students to better align with real-world learning and programming dynamics.

Method: The authors conducted experiments using timestamped student submission data, employing both low- and high-resolution modeling. They evaluated LLM-generated code on semantic, functional, and stylistic parameters and applied fine-tuning for better alignment with student code.

Result: Fine-tuned models showed significant improvement in mimicking real student coding behavior, including error patterns, stylistic diversity, and iterative improvements.

Conclusion: To model realistic student coding, it is essential to incorporate learning dynamics via context-aware generation, temporal modeling, and multi-dimensional evaluation approaches.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown strong performance on programming
tasks, but can they generate student-like code like real students - imperfect,
iterative, and stylistically diverse? We present ParaStudent, a systematic
study of LLM-based "student-like" code generation in an introductory
programming course setting. Using a dataset of timestamped student submissions
across multiple semesters, we design low- and high-resolution experiments to
model student progress and evaluate code outputs along semantic, functional,
and stylistic dimensions. Our results show that fine-tuning significantly
improves alignment with real student trajectories and captures error patterns,
incremental improvements, and stylistic variations more faithfully. This study
shows that modeling realistic student code requires capturing learning dynamics
through context-aware generation, temporal modeling, and multi-dimensional
evaluation. Code for experiments and evaluation is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address how traditional FOSS copyleft principles can be adapted to generative AI, especially to mitigate challenges like openwashing and misuse.

Method: The paper evaluates the CCAI license through a three-part framework: legal feasibility, policy justification, and cross-contextual analysis of benefits and risks.

Result: The CCAI license offers enhanced developer control, incentivizes open source AI, and mitigates risks, but highlights the need for complementary regulations due to increased risk of misuse.

Conclusion: The CCAI license, when paired with robust regulations, is a viable tool for preserving FOSS principles in generative AI.

Abstract: The proliferation of generative AI systems has created new challenges for the
Free and Open Source Software (FOSS) community, particularly regarding how
traditional copyleft principles should apply when open source code is used to
train AI models. This article introduces the Contextual Copyleft AI (CCAI)
license, a novel licensing mechanism that extends copyleft requirements from
training data to the resulting generative AI models. The CCAI license offers
significant advantages, including enhanced developer control, incentivization
of open source AI development, and mitigation of openwashing practices. This is
demonstrated through a structured three-part evaluation framework that examines
(1) legal feasibility under current copyright law, (2) policy justification
comparing traditional software and AI contexts, and (3) synthesis of
cross-contextual benefits and risks. However, the increased risk profile of
open source AI, particularly the potential for direct misuse, necessitates
complementary regulatory approaches to achieve an appropriate risk-benefit
balance. The paper concludes that when implemented within a robust regulatory
environment focused on responsible AI usage, the CCAI license provides a viable
mechanism for preserving and adapting core FOSS principles to the evolving
landscape of generative AI development.

Motivation: Traditional financial derivative pricing methods focus on expected values, limiting insights into risk, tail distribution, and uncertainty. This paper addresses this limitation by proposing a distributional approach.

Method: The approach incorporates residual vector quantization (RVQ) with task-specific loss guidance, applied to intermediate features of pre-trained speech and audio models, enabling adaptable tokenizer designs for various configurations.

Result: The method provides ultra-low bitrates while maintaining performance in automatic speech recognition and audio classification, demonstrating its efficiency.

Conclusion: This flexible and efficient ACoM method suits diverse tasks and architectures, highlighting its broad applicability and potential impact on machine-focused audio processing areas.

Abstract: Neural audio codecs, leveraging quantization algorithms, have significantly
impacted various speech/audio tasks. While high-fidelity reconstruction is
paramount for human perception, audio coding for machines (ACoM) prioritizes
efficient compression and downstream task performance, disregarding perceptual
nuances. This work introduces an efficient ACoM method that can compress and
quantize any chosen intermediate feature representation of an already trained
speech/audio downstream model. Our approach employs task-specific loss guidance
alongside residual vector quantization (RVQ) losses, providing ultra-low
bitrates (i.e., less than 200 bps) with a minimal loss of the downstream model
performance. The resulting tokenizer is adaptable to various bitrates and model
sizes for flexible deployment. Evaluated on automatic speech recognition and
audio classification, our method demonstrates its efficacy and potential for
broader task and architectural applicability through appropriate
regularization.

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: The paper evaluates neural network models for simulating nonlinear elastic plate vibration, highlighting limitations and potential improvements for real-time audio synthesis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome computational challenges in simulating drum membranes using traditional methods, making physical modeling synthesis more viable for real-time audio applications.

Method: Comparative analysis of state-of-the-art neural network approaches, training them on short sequences and evaluating their autoregressive prediction capability for long sequences.

Result: The study identifies limitations in current models and emphasizes that time-domain prediction error isn't sufficient, suggesting performance gaps in neural modeling.

Conclusion: Neural network methods show promise but require significant improvements for accurate and efficient real-time modeling of nonlinear vibrations.

Abstract: Physical modelling synthesis aims to generate audio from physical simulations
of vibrating structures. Thin elastic plates are a common model for drum
membranes. Traditional numerical methods like finite differences and finite
elements offer high accuracy but are computationally demanding, limiting their
use in real-time audio applications. This paper presents a comparative analysis
of neural network-based approaches for solving the vibration of nonlinear
elastic plates. We evaluate several state-of-the-art models, trained on short
sequences, for prediction of long sequences in an autoregressive fashion. We
show some of the limitations of these models, and why is not enough to look at
the prediction error in the time domain. We discuss the implications for
real-time audio synthesis and propose future directions for improving neural
approaches to model nonlinear vibration.

### [283] [SHIELD: A Secure and Highly Enhanced Integrated Learning for Robust Deepfake Detection against Adversarial Attacks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13170)
*Kutub Uddin,Awais Khan,Muhammad Umar Farooq,Khalid Malik*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: This paper introduces SHIELD, a collaborative learning method to counteract generative anti-forensic (AF) attacks on deepfake audio detection, achieving high robustness and accuracy across diverse datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rise of deepfake audio poses threats like misinformation, and existing detection methods are vulnerable to anti-forensic attacks, particularly generative adversarial networks.

Method: The SHIELD framework incorporates an auxiliary defense generative model to identify AF signatures, alongside a triplet model to learn correlations between real, attacked, and generated audios, enhancing detection robustness.

Result: SHIELD demonstrated a substantial improvement in accuracy, achieving over 98% accuracy in both matched and mismatched settings across ASVspoof2019, In-the-Wild, and HalfTruth datasets, countering AF attacks.

Conclusion: SHIELD effectively addresses the vulnerabilities of deepfake detection systems to AF attacks, providing a robust solution for detecting audio manipulations with high accuracy.

Abstract: Audio plays a crucial role in applications like speaker verification,
voice-enabled smart devices, and audio conferencing. However, audio
manipulations, such as deepfakes, pose significant risks by enabling the spread
of misinformation. Our empirical analysis reveals that existing methods for
detecting deepfake audio are often vulnerable to anti-forensic (AF) attacks,
particularly those attacked using generative adversarial networks. In this
article, we propose a novel collaborative learning method called SHIELD to
defend against generative AF attacks. To expose AF signatures, we integrate an
auxiliary generative model, called the defense (DF) generative model, which
facilitates collaborative learning by combining input and output. Furthermore,
we design a triplet model to capture correlations for real and AF attacked
audios with real-generated and attacked-generated audios using auxiliary
generative models. The proposed SHIELD strengthens the defense against
generative AF attacks and achieves robust performance across various generative
models. The proposed AF significantly reduces the average detection accuracy
from 95.49% to 59.77% for ASVspoof2019, from 99.44% to 38.45% for In-the-Wild,
and from 98.41% to 51.18% for HalfTruth for three different generative models.
The proposed SHIELD mechanism is robust against AF attacks and achieves an
average accuracy of 98.13%, 98.58%, and 99.57% in match, and 98.78%, 98.62%,
and 98.85% in mismatch settings for the ASVspoof2019, In-the-Wild, and
HalfTruth datasets, respectively.

*Rajalaxmi Rajagopalan,Yu-Lin Wei,Romit Roy Choudhury*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: The paper discusses a hybrid approach using Sparse Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) for black-box optimization to optimize user satisfaction with audio filters, combining two types of user feedback.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To personalize audio experiences by determining the best audio filter that maximizes user satisfaction through novel hybrid querying techniques.

Method: Introduced a hybrid approach combining user feedback on both overall satisfaction and specific filter components, leveraging Sparse Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) to refine optimization.

Result: Demonstrated the hybrid method's effectiveness through both simulations and real-world experiments, achieving high satisfaction levels from user feedback on music and speech audio.

Conclusion: The hybrid querying approach outperforms singular feedback methods in black-box optimization and has potential applications beyond audio personalization, opening new research directions.

Abstract: We consider the problem of personalizing audio to maximize user experience.
Briefly, we aim to find a filter $h^*$, which applied to any music or speech,
will maximize the user's satisfaction. This is a black-box optimization problem
since the user's satisfaction function is unknown. Substantive work has been
done on this topic where the key idea is to play audio samples to the user,
each shaped by a different filter $h_i$, and query the user for their
satisfaction scores $f(h_i)$. A family of ``surrogate" functions is then
designed to fit these scores and the optimization method gradually refines
these functions to arrive at the filter $\hat{h}^*$ that maximizes
satisfaction. In certain applications, we observe that a second type of
querying is possible where users can tell us the individual elements $h^*[j]$
of the optimal filter $h^*$. Consider an analogy from cooking where the goal is
to cook a recipe that maximizes user satisfaction. A user can be asked to score
various cooked recipes (e.g., tofu fried rice) or to score individual
ingredients (say, salt, sugar, rice, chicken, etc.). Given a budget of $B$
queries, where a query can be of either type, our goal is to find the recipe
that will maximize this user's satisfaction. Our proposal builds on Sparse
Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) and shows how a hybrid approach can
outperform any one type of querying. Our results are validated through
simulations and real world experiments, where volunteers gave feedback on
music/speech audio and were able to achieve high satisfaction levels. We
believe this idea of hybrid querying opens new problems in black-box
optimization and solutions can benefit other applications beyond audio
personalization.

### [285] [Autoregressive Speech Enhancement via Acoustic Tokens](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12825)
*Luca Della Libera,Cem Subakan,Mirco Ravanelli*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: The paper explores speech enhancement using discrete acoustic tokens, introducing an autoregressive approach to tackle gaps in current methodologies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improving speech quality and intelligibility in real-world settings while exploring discrete representations as an alternative to acoustic models.

Method: Studied acoustic tokens for speech enhancement and proposed a novel autoregressive transducer architecture.

Result: Autoregressive model improved performance; acoustic tokens preserved speaker identity better than semantic tokens but lagged behind continuous representations.

Conclusion: The study shows potential in using discrete tokens for speech processing, prompting further research to bridge performance gaps with continuous models.

Abstract: In speech processing pipelines, improving the quality and intelligibility of
real-world recordings is crucial. While supervised regression is the primary
method for speech enhancement, audio tokenization is emerging as a promising
alternative for a smooth integration with other modalities. However, research
on speech enhancement using discrete representations is still limited. Previous
work has mainly focused on semantic tokens, which tend to discard key acoustic
details such as speaker identity. Additionally, these studies typically employ
non-autoregressive models, assuming conditional independence of outputs and
overlooking the potential improvements offered by autoregressive modeling. To
address these gaps we: 1) conduct a comprehensive study of the performance of
acoustic tokens for speech enhancement, including the effect of bitrate and
noise strength; 2) introduce a novel transducer-based autoregressive
architecture specifically designed for this task. Experiments on VoiceBank and
Libri1Mix datasets show that acoustic tokens outperform semantic tokens in
terms of preserving speaker identity, and that our autoregressive approach can
further improve performance. Nevertheless, we observe that discrete
representations still fall short compared to continuous ones, highlighting the
need for further research in this area.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the correctness of mutual exclusion algorithms under various shared register communication setups, including atomic and non-atomic registers.

Method: Model checking was employed with a focus on liveness verification using justness as the completeness criterion. Several concurrency relations were explored to model shared register assumptions.

Result: Demonstrations of correctness violations in various algorithms were presented, along with proposed improvements in some cases.

Conclusion: The paper highlights the necessity of assuming justness for proper verification and emphasizes the impact of shared register behavior on mutual exclusion algorithm correctness.

Abstract: We verify the correctness of a variety of mutual exclusion algorithms through
model checking. We look at algorithms where communication is via shared
read/write registers, where those registers can be atomic or non-atomic. For
the verification of liveness properties, it is necessary to assume a
completeness criterion to eliminate spurious counterexamples. We use justness
as completeness criterion. Justness depends on a concurrency relation; we
consider several such relations, modelling different assumptions on the working
of the shared registers. We present executions demonstrating the violation of
correctness properties by several algorithms, and in some cases suggest
improvements.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To utilize extensive data collected during the pandemic to enhance forecasting models and improve preparedness for future outbreaks.

Method: The study incorporates a large-scale case study using a comprehensive dataset including epidemiological, vaccination, policy, and weather data over two years.

Result: The analysis explores infection trends, evaluates the performance of forecasting models, and studies how external factors influenced disease dynamics.

Conclusion: Insights from the study contribute to better pandemic preparedness and response strategies by leveraging forecasts and external factor analyses.

Abstract: Emerging in December 2019, the COVID-19 pandemic caused widespread health,
economic, and social disruptions. Rapid global transmission overwhelmed
healthcare systems, resulting in high infection rates, hospitalisations, and
fatalities. To minimise the spread, governments implemented several
non-pharmaceutical interventions like lockdowns and travel restrictions. While
effective in controlling transmission, these measures also posed significant
economic and societal challenges. Although the WHO declared COVID-19 no longer
a global health emergency in May 2023, its impact persists, shaping public
health strategies. The vast amount of data collected during the pandemic offers
valuable insights into disease dynamics, transmission, and intervention
effectiveness. Leveraging these insights can improve forecasting models,
enhancing preparedness and response to future outbreaks while mitigating their
social and economic impact. This paper presents a large-scale case study on
COVID-19 forecasting in Cyprus, utilising a two-year dataset that integrates
epidemiological data, vaccination records, policy measures, and weather
conditions. We analyse infection trends, assess forecasting performance, and
examine the influence of external factors on disease dynamics. The insights
gained contribute to improved pandemic preparedness and response strategies.

Motivation: Investigate and improve graph data analysis methods, specifically for sparse directed graphs clustering.

Conclusion: The proposed matrix provides valuable clustering insights for sparse directed graphs, combining beneficial properties of previously studied matrices.

Abstract: Graph representation matrices are essential tools in graph data analysis.
Recently, Hermitian adjacency matrices have been proposed to investigate
directed graph structures. Previous studies have demonstrated that these
matrices can extract valuable information for clustering. In this paper, we
propose the complex non-backtracking matrix that integrates the properties of
the Hermitian adjacency matrix and the non-backtracking matrix. The proposed
matrix has similar properties with the non-backtracking matrix of undirected

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how predictions of self and others' behaviors can enhance competitive algorithms in multi-agent scenarios.

Method: The study introduces a two-predictor framework and applies it to a modified ski-rental problem with agents collaborating to purchase an asset license.

Result: When predictors are perfect, following self predictors yields optimal outcomes, but mispredictions affect robustness; a more robust algorithm is proposed and benchmarked.

Conclusion: The paper highlights the trade-offs between optimality and robustness in algorithm design, showcasing the benefits of a two-predictor framework for multi-agent systems.

Abstract: We study the power of (competitive) algorithms with predictions in a
multiagent setting. We introduce a two predictor framework, that assumes that
agents use one predictor for their future (self) behavior, and one for the
behavior of the other players. The main problem we are concerned with is
understanding what are the best competitive ratios that can be achieved by
employing such predictors, under various assumptions on predictor quality.
  As an illustration of our framework, we introduce and analyze a multiagent
version of the ski-rental problem. In this problem agents can collaborate by
pooling resources to get a group license for some asset. If the license price
is not met then agents have to rent the asset individually for the day at a
unit price. Otherwise the license becomes available forever to everyone at no
extra cost.
  In the particular case of perfect other predictions the algorithm that
follows the self predictor is optimal but not robust to mispredictions of
agent's future behavior; we give an algorithm with better robustness properties
and benchmark it.

Method: The authors designed a multivalued feedforward deep neural network, implemented with the JAX library, to locate Z/2 eigenfunctions. They analyzed specific cases where branch points were either fixed or allowed to move freely.

Result: The model successfully identified Z/2 eigenfunctions for three configurations: branch points fixed at tetrahedron vertices, branch points fixed at cube vertices, and branch points freely optimized to form a squashed tetrahedron.

Conclusion: Machine learning, particularly neural networks, shows promise in finding Z/2 eigenfunctions on a 2-sphere, demonstrating flexibility and effectiveness across different boundary conditions.

Abstract: We use machine learning to search for examples of Z/2 eigenfunctions on the

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges of high computational and environmental costs in DFT-based workflows for discovering efficient photovoltaic materials.

Method: This study replaces parts of a standard DFT workflow with ML surrogates, measures CO$_2$ emissions, and explores predictive efficacy using expanded datasets and tailored ML architectures.

Result: Hybrid ML/DFT strategies were found to balance accuracy and environmental impact, with ML models sometimes outperforming DFT workflows in consistency and predictive capabilities.

Conclusion: ML models present a viable, sustainable alternative to DFT in photovoltaic material screening, offering lower emissions and competitive accuracy while enabling data-driven advancements.

Abstract: Computational screening has become a powerful complement to experimental
efforts in the discovery of high-performance photovoltaic (PV) materials. Most
workflows rely on density functional theory (DFT) to estimate electronic and
optical properties relevant to solar energy conversion. Although more efficient
than laboratory-based methods, DFT calculations still entail substantial
computational and environmental costs. Machine learning (ML) models have
recently gained attention as surrogates for DFT, offering drastic reductions in
resource use with competitive predictive performance. In this study, we
reproduce a canonical DFT-based workflow to estimate the maximum efficiency
limit and progressively replace its components with ML surrogates. By
quantifying the CO$_2$ emissions associated with each computational strategy,
we evaluate the trade-offs between predictive efficacy and environmental cost.
Our results reveal multiple hybrid ML/DFT strategies that optimize different
points along the accuracy--emissions front. We find that direct prediction of
scalar quantities, such as maximum efficiency, is significantly more tractable
than using predicted absorption spectra as an intermediate step. Interestingly,
ML models trained on DFT data can outperform DFT workflows using alternative
exchange--correlation functionals in screening applications, highlighting the
consistency and utility of data-driven approaches. We also assess strategies to
improve ML-driven screening through expanded datasets and improved model
architectures tailored to PV-relevant features. This work provides a
quantitative framework for building low-emission, high-throughput discovery
pipelines.

*Tianxi Zhu,Yi Xu,Xiangyang Ji*

Main category: math.OC

TL;DR: This paper studies stochastic first-order methods (SFOMs) applied to weakly convex optimization under two types of gradient noise: sub-Weibull and $p$-bounded central moment ($p \in (1,2]$) noise. It explores their high-probability and in-expectation convergence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation lies in addressing the incomplete understanding of SFOMs' high-probability and in-expectation convergence in weakly convex optimization settings, especially under heavy-tailed gradient noise distributions.

Method: The paper investigates vanilla SsGD under sub-Weibull noise and clipped SsGD under $p$-BCM noise for weakly convex objectives, focusing on convergence properties and sample complexity.

Result: For sub-Weibull noise, vanilla SsGD's convergence properties match those of smooth objectives. For $p$-BCM noise, clipped SGD's theoretical dependence on failure probability remains similar, although its sample complexity is worse than the smooth optimization lower bound.

Conclusion: The findings extend the theoretical understanding of SFOMs in weakly convex optimization under heavy-tailed noises, demonstrating resilience to non-smoothness and non-convexity in certain cases but highlighting challenges in sample complexity.

Abstract: An increasing number of studies have focused on stochastic first-order
methods (SFOMs) under heavy-tailed gradient noises, which have been observed in
the training of practical deep learning models. In this paper, we focus on two
types of gradient noises: one is sub-Weibull noise, and the other is noise
under the assumption that it has a bounded $p$-th central moment ($p$-BCM) with
$p\in (1, 2]$. The latter is more challenging due to the occurrence of infinite
variance when $p\in (1, 2)$. Under these two gradient noise assumptions, the
in-expectation and high-probability convergence of SFOMs have been extensively
studied in the contexts of convex optimization and standard smooth
optimization. However, for weakly convex objectives-a class that includes all
Lipschitz-continuous convex objectives and smooth objectives-our understanding
of the in-expectation and high-probability convergence of SFOMs under these two
types of noises remains incomplete. We investigate the high-probability
convergence of the vanilla stochastic subgradient descent (SsGD) method under
sub-Weibull noises, as well as the high-probability and in-expectation
convergence of clipped SsGD under the $p$-BCM noises. Both analyses are
conducted in the context of weakly convex optimization. For weakly convex
objectives that may be non-convex and non-smooth, our results demonstrate that
the theoretical dependence of vanilla SsGD on the failure probability and
number of iterations under sub-Weibull noises does not degrade compared to the
case of smooth objectives. Under $p$-BCM noises, our findings indicate that the
non-smoothness and non-convexity of weakly convex objectives do not impact the
theoretical dependence of clipped SGD on the failure probability relative to
the smooth case; however, the sample complexity we derived is worse than a
well-known lower bound for smooth optimization.

Motivation: To bridge linear algebra principles with third-order tensors and explore their use in semidefinite programming and invariant applications.

Method: Uses the $\star_M$-product framework connected to matrix M and representation theory to analyze positive semidefiniteness and enable semidefinite programs for third-order tensors.

Result: The study characterizes specific nonnegative quadratic forms and provides solutions to low-rank tensor completion problems.

Conclusion: The $\star_M$-product provides a strong framework for studying positive semidefinite properties and solving practical tensor-based problems like quadratic form characterization and tensor completion.

Abstract: The $\star_M$-family of tensor-tensor products is a framework which
generalizes many properties from linear algebra to third order tensors. Here,
we investigate positive semidefiniteness and semidefinite programming under the
$\star_M$-product. Critical to our investigation is a connection between the
choice of matrix M in the $\star_M$-product and the representation theory of an
underlying group action. Using this framework, third order tensors equipped
with the $\star_M$-product are a natural setting for the study of invariant
semidefinite programs. As applications of the M-SDP framework, we provide a
characterization of certain nonnegative quadratic forms and solve low-rank
tensor completion problems.

TL;DR: The paper addresses unsupervised metric learning for classification without labeled data, focusing on algorithmic improvements and exploring replacements for optimal transport (OT) distances.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to improve data classification methods in unsupervised settings, where labeled samples are not available, by enhancing metric learning approaches.

Method: The paper investigates the stochastic random function iteration algorithm for convergence in learning distance metrics and explores replacing OT distances with Mahalanobis-like distances or graph Laplacian-based approaches.

Result: The authors establish linear convergence of the stochastic random function iteration algorithm, adapt Mahalanobis-like distances to the framework, and simplify computations using graph Laplacians.

Conclusion: Unsupervised metric learning can benefit from improved algorithms and alternative distance measures, enhancing classification in the absence of labeled data.

Abstract: Data classification without access to labeled samples remains a challenging
problem. It usually depends on an appropriately chosen distance between
features, a topic addressed in metric learning. Recently, Huizing, Cantini and
Peyr\'e proposed to simultaneously learn optimal transport (OT) cost matrices
between samples and features of the dataset. This leads to the task of finding
positive eigenvectors of a certain nonlinear function that maps cost matrices
to OT distances. Having this basic idea in mind, we consider both the
algorithmic and the modeling part of unsupervised metric learning. First, we
examine appropriate algorithms and their convergence. In particular, we propose
to use the stochastic random function iteration algorithm and prove that it
converges linearly for our setting, although our operators are not
paracontractive as it was required for convergence so far. Second, we ask the
natural question if the OT distance can be replaced by other distances. We show
how Mahalanobis-like distances fit into our considerations. Further, we examine
an approach via graph Laplacians. In contrast to the previous settings, we have
just to deal with linear functions in the wanted matrices here, so that simple
algorithms from linear algebra can be applied.

Main category: astro-ph.EP

TL;DR: The paper proposes utilizing Earth's J2 perturbation to aid CubeSats' orbital adjustments, significantly reducing fuel needs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CubeSats have limited propulsion and fuel, making precise orbital insertion challenging; new maneuvering techniques are needed for mission success.

Method: The method leverages Earth's J2 perturbation's secular effects to adjust orbital parameters passively, minimizing propulsion dependency. Numerical simulations validate its efficiency.

Result: Case studies demonstrate major fuel savings using the J2-augmented method compared to traditional approaches, confirming its effectiveness for accurate orbital insertion.

Conclusion: This strategy can enhance CubeSats' operational life and capabilities, offering a cost-effective solution for low-Earth orbit missions.

Abstract: The precise insertion of CubeSats into designated orbits is a complex task,
primarily due to the limited propulsion capabilities and constrained fuel
reserves onboard, which severely restrict the scope for large orbital
corrections. This limitation necessitates the development of more efficient
maneuvering techniques to ensure mission success. In this paper, we propose a
maneuvering sequence that exploits the natural J2 perturbation caused by the
Earth's oblateness. By utilizing the secular effects of this perturbation, it
is possible to passively influence key orbital parameters such as the argument
of perigee and the right ascension of the ascending node, thereby reducing the
need for extensive propulsion-based corrections. The approach is designed to
optimize the CubeSat's orbital insertion and minimize the total fuel required
for trajectory adjustments, making it particularly suitable for
fuel-constrained missions. The proposed methodology is validated through
comprehensive numerical simulations that examine different initial orbital
conditions and perturbation environments. Case studies are presented to
demonstrate the effectiveness of the J2-augmented strategy in achieving
accurate orbital insertion, showing a major reduction in fuel consumption
compared to traditional methods. The results underscore the potential of this
approach to extend the operational life and capabilities of CubeSats, offering
a viable solution for future low-Earth orbit missions.

### [297] [Perfect diffusion is $\mathsf{TC}^0$ -- Bad diffusion is Turing-complete](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12469)
*Yuxi Liu*

Main category: cs.CC

TL;DR: The paper investigates the computational complexity of diffusion-based language modeling and establishes a dichotomy in its performance tied to score function accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the capabilities and limitations of diffusion-based language models, especially regarding their computational complexity and ability for sequential tasks.

Method: Theoretical proofs were constructed to establish a dichotomy: in one direction, models with exact score function calculations are limited to $\mathsf{TC}^0$ complexity; in another, relaxing this requirement allows the model to simulate any Turing machine.

Result: The study identifies clear computational boundaries for diffusion models based on the precision of their score-matching network, revealing theoretical insights and suggesting potential design improvements.

Conclusion: Diffusion models exhibit a trade-off between precision and general computation power. Interpolating between sequential and parallel computation modes could outperform both Transformers and diffusion models in practical applications.

Abstract: This paper explores the computational complexity of diffusion-based language
modeling. We prove a dichotomy based on the quality of the score-matching
network in a diffusion model. In one direction, a network that exactly computes
the score function of some initial distribution can only perform language
modeling within the $\mathsf{TC}^0$ complexity class, reflecting limitations
tied to rapid convergence. In the other direction, we show that if there is no
requirement for the network to match any score function, then diffusion
modeling can simulate any Turing machine in a certain sense. This dichotomy
provides a theoretical lens on the capabilities and limitations of diffusion
models, particularly concerning tasks requiring sequential computation. We
conjecture extensions of our theoretical results, including for the case where
the diffusion model is not perfect, but merely good. We also discuss the wider
context and practical implications, and hypothesize that a machine learning
architecture that can interpolate between sequential and parallel modes of
operation would be superior to both Transformers and diffusion models.

*Guy Blanc,Caleb Koch,Carmen Strassle,Li-Yang Tan*

Main category: cs.CC

TL;DR: This paper studies computational-statistical tradeoffs in PAC learning, establishing bounds under \(\mathsf{NP}\)-hardness assumptions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Explore computational-efficiency tradeoffs in statistical learning and base them on standard \(\mathsf{NP}\)-hardness assumptions.

Method: Establish computational-statistical tradeoffs and characterize the relationship between \(\mathsf{RP}\) and \(\mathsf{NP}\), all via theoretical proofs.

Result: Sharp tradeoffs under \(\mathsf{NP}\)-hardness, RP and NP equivalency in learning, and novel \(\mathsf{NP}\)-hardness results for improper learning.

Conclusion: \(\mathsf{NP}\)-hardness leads to fundamental limits for efficient learning, advancing understanding of computational-statistical tradeoffs.

Abstract: A central question in computer science and statistics is whether efficient
algorithms can achieve the information-theoretic limits of statistical
problems. Many computational-statistical tradeoffs have been shown under
average-case assumptions, but since statistical problems are average-case in
nature, it has been a challenge to base them on standard worst-case
assumptions.
  In PAC learning where such tradeoffs were first studied, the question is
whether computational efficiency can come at the cost of using more samples
than information-theoretically necessary. We base such tradeoffs on
$\mathsf{NP}$-hardness and obtain:
  $\circ$ Sharp computational-statistical tradeoffs assuming $\mathsf{NP}$
requires exponential time: For every polynomial $p(n)$, there is an $n$-variate
class $C$ with VC dimension $1$ such that the sample complexity of
time-efficiently learning $C$ is $\Theta(p(n))$.
  $\circ$ A characterization of $\mathsf{RP}$ vs. $\mathsf{NP}$ in terms of
learning: $\mathsf{RP} = \mathsf{NP}$ iff every $\mathsf{NP}$-enumerable class
is learnable with $O(\mathrm{VCdim}(C))$ samples in polynomial time. The
forward implication has been known since (Pitt and Valiant, 1988); we prove the
reverse implication.
  Notably, all our lower bounds hold against improper learners. These are the
first $\mathsf{NP}$-hardness results for improperly learning a subclass of
polynomial-size circuits, circumventing formal barriers of Applebaum, Barak,
and Xiao (2008).

### [299] [Generative Multi-Target Cross-Domain Recommendation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12871)
*Jinqiu Jin,Yang Zhang,Junwei Pan,Fuli Feng,Hua Lu,Haijie Gu,Xiangnan He*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: The paper introduces GMC, a generative approach for multi-target cross-domain recommendation, solving issues with domain-shared entities and data dependency, while outperforming baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MTCDR faces challenges in scenarios with non-overlapping user-item entities and heavy reliance on auxiliary data. The paper aims to overcome these limitations to improve cross-domain recommendation.

Method: GMC uses discrete item identifiers to unify domain knowledge and formulates item recommendation as a next-token generation task. It includes domain-aware contrastive loss for identifier learning and applies domain-specific fine-tuning.

Result: Experiments on five public datasets show GMC's effectiveness, outperforming several baseline methods.

Conclusion: GMC demonstrates improved performance and addresses key challenges in multi-target cross-domain recommendation, while leveraging generative paradigms effectively.

Abstract: Recently, there has been a surge of interest in Multi-Target Cross-Domain
Recommendation (MTCDR), which aims to enhance recommendation performance across
multiple domains simultaneously. Existing MTCDR methods primarily rely on
domain-shared entities (\eg users or items) to fuse and transfer cross-domain
knowledge, which may be unavailable in non-overlapped recommendation scenarios.
Some studies model user preferences and item features as domain-sharable
semantic representations, which can be utilized to tackle the MTCDR task.
Nevertheless, they often require extensive auxiliary data for pre-training.
Developing more effective solutions for MTCDR remains an important area for
further exploration.
  Inspired by recent advancements in generative recommendation, this paper
introduces GMC, a generative paradigm-based approach for multi-target
cross-domain recommendation. The core idea of GMC is to leverage semantically
quantized discrete item identifiers as a medium for integrating multi-domain
knowledge within a unified generative model. GMC first employs an item
tokenizer to generate domain-shared semantic identifiers for each item, and
then formulates item recommendation as a next-token generation task by training
a domain-unified sequence-to-sequence model. To further leverage the domain
information to enhance performance, we incorporate a domain-aware contrastive
loss into the semantic identifier learning, and perform domain-specific
fine-tuning on the unified recommender. Extensive experiments on five public
datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of GMC compared to a range of baseline
methods.

*Muhammad Javed,Sedigh Khademi Habibabadi,Christopher Palmer,Hazel Clothier,Jim Buttery,Gerardo Luis Dimaguila*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: The paper introduces 'VaxPulse Query Corner,' a tool leveraging Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to address vaccine hesitancy by analyzing and providing nuanced insights into vaccine concerns on social media.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address vaccine hesitancy, which can harm public health, by developing a system that overcomes the limitations of current methods, such as topic modeling and LLMs, in capturing and contextualizing public vaccine concerns.

Method: The authors developed a tool called 'VaxPulse Query Corner,' which utilizes Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to analyze vaccine-related concerns on online platforms and answer complex public health queries.

Result: The tool was tested on 35,103 Shingrix-related social media posts, achieving high levels of answer faithfulness (0.96) and relevance (0.94).

Conclusion: 'VaxPulse Query Corner' is a promising solution for public health stakeholders to understand and address vaccine hesitancy by providing reliable and contextually relevant insights, ultimately aiding in the creation of targeted interventions to build vaccine confidence.

Abstract: Vaccine hesitancy threatens public health, leading to delayed or rejected
vaccines. Social media is a vital source for understanding public concerns, and
traditional methods like topic modelling often struggle to capture nuanced
opinions. Though trained for query answering, large Language Models (LLMs)
often miss current events and community concerns. Additionally, hallucinations
in LLMs can compromise public health communication. To address these
limitations, we developed a tool (VaxPulse Query Corner) using the Retrieval
Augmented Generation technique. It addresses complex queries about public
vaccine concerns on various online platforms, aiding public health
administrators and stakeholders in understanding public concerns and
implementing targeted interventions to boost vaccine confidence. Analysing
35,103 Shingrix social media posts, it achieved answer faithfulness (0.96) and
relevance (0.94).

### [301] [A Semi-Supervised Learning Method for the Identification of Bad Exposures in Large Imaging Surveys](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12784)
*Yufeng Luo,Adam D. Myers,Alex Drlica-Wagner,Dario Dematties,Salma Borchani,Frank Valdes,Arjun Dey,David Schlegel,Rongpu Zhou,DESI Legacy Imaging Surveys Team*

Main category: astro-ph.IM

TL;DR: This paper proposes a machine-learning-based framework to detect low-quality exposures in large astronomical imaging surveys, using a pipeline that integrates vision transformers (ViT) and k-Nearest Neighbor classifiers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: With increasing data volumes in astronomical imaging surveys, traditional methods like manual inspection for image anomaly detection have become impractical.

Method: The proposed method uses a semi-supervised pipeline combining a vision transformer (ViT) trained via self-supervised learning (SSL) and a k-Nearest Neighbor (kNN) classifier, validated on DECam data.

Result: The pipeline flagged 780 problematic exposures in DECaLS Data Release 11, all verified via visual inspection, demonstrating its efficiency and accuracy.

Conclusion: This scalable and adaptable machine-learning solution is well-suited for quality control in astronomical imaging surveys, improving efficiency and reducing the dependence on manual efforts.

Abstract: As the data volume of astronomical imaging surveys rapidly increases,
traditional methods for image anomaly detection, such as visual inspection by
human experts, are becoming impractical. We introduce a machine-learning-based
approach to detect poor-quality exposures in large imaging surveys, with a
focus on the DECam Legacy Survey (DECaLS) in regions of low extinction (i.e.,
$E(B-V)<0.04$). Our semi-supervised pipeline integrates a vision transformer
(ViT), trained via self-supervised learning (SSL), with a k-Nearest Neighbor
(kNN) classifier. We train and validate our pipeline using a small set of
labeled exposures observed by surveys with the Dark Energy Camera (DECam). A
clustering-space analysis of where our pipeline places images labeled in
``good'' and ``bad'' categories suggests that our approach can efficiently and
accurately determine the quality of exposures. Applied to new imaging being
reduced for DECaLS Data Release 11, our pipeline identifies 780 problematic
exposures, which we subsequently verify through visual inspection. Being highly
efficient and adaptable, our method offers a scalable solution for quality
control in other large imaging surveys.

*Harry Desmond*

Main category: astro-ph.IM

TL;DR: The paper introduces an Exhaustive Symbolic Regression algorithm to address key challenges in traditional symbolic regression and demonstrates its utility in solving astrophysics problems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional symbolic regression algorithms have challenges like unknown failure probability and unjustified function-selection procedures, which limit their reliability and scientific utility.

Method: The proposed method uses exhaustive search and the minimum description length principle to measure accuracy and complexity in units of information, enabling a balance between these aspects.

Result: The algorithm outperforms literature standards by identifying superior functions in astrophysics problems such as the universe's expansion, galaxy gravity behaviors, and inflaton field potential.

Conclusion: This effective and general-purpose Exhaustive Symbolic Regression methodology can be applied broadly, offering significant improvements in the accuracy and quality of scientific modeling.

Abstract: Symbolic regression is the machine learning method for learning functions
from data. After a brief overview of the symbolic regression landscape, I will
describe the two main challenges that traditional algorithms face: they have an
unknown (and likely significant) probability of failing to find any given good
function, and they suffer from ambiguity and poorly-justified assumptions in
their function-selection procedure. To address these I propose an exhaustive
search and model selection by the minimum description length principle, which
allows accuracy and complexity to be directly traded off by measuring each in
units of information. I showcase the resulting publicly available Exhaustive
Symbolic Regression algorithm on three open problems in astrophysics: the
expansion history of the universe, the effective behaviour of gravity in
galaxies and the potential of the inflaton field. In each case the algorithm
identifies many functions superior to the literature standards. This general
purpose methodology should find widespread utility in science and beyond.

*Joy Xiaoji Zhang,Jingsen Zhu,Hanyu Chen,Steve Marschner*

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: The paper presents a two-stage neural method using Transformer-based architectures for realistic and generalizable hair dynamics simulation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The challenge is to simulate realistic hair dynamics that generalize well across various hairstyles, body types, and motion scenarios, addressing issues such as hair-body penetrations.

Method: A two-stage approach: A Transformer-powered static network predicts static hair shapes, and a dynamic network uses cross-attention to combine static and motion data for dynamic hair behavior.

Result: The method achieves real-time, high-fidelity hair simulations demonstrating generalization to complex and unseen cases, supported by physics-informed losses.

Conclusion: The approach proves effective in generalizing dynamic hair simulations across diverse hair types and motions, resolving challenges like penetrations.

Abstract: Simulating hair dynamics that generalize across arbitrary hairstyles, body
shapes, and motions is a critical challenge. Our novel two-stage neural
solution is the first to leverage Transformer-based architectures for such a
broad generalization. We propose a Transformer-powered static network that
predicts static draped shapes for any hairstyle, effectively resolving
hair-body penetrations and preserving hair fidelity. Subsequently, a dynamic
network with a novel cross-attention mechanism fuses static hair features with
kinematic input to generate expressive dynamics and complex secondary motions.
This dynamic network also allows for efficient fine-tuning of challenging
motion sequences, such as abrupt head movements. Our method offers real-time
inference for both static single-frame drapes and dynamic drapes over pose
sequences. Our method demonstrates high-fidelity and generalizable dynamic hair
across various styles, guided by physics-informed losses, and can resolve
penetrations even for complex, unseen long hairstyles, highlighting its broad
generalization.

*Sheng Liu,Panos Papadimitratos*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This paper explores vulnerabilities in Federated Learning-based Road Condition Classification (RCC) systems caused by Targeted Label Flipping Attacks (TLFAs) and proposes the FLARE defensive mechanism to mitigate these attacks effectively.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Federated Learning helps preserve privacy in systems like autonomous driving RCC, but its distributed nature makes FL vulnerable to TLFAs, posing significant safety risks.

Method: 1) Identifying vulnerabilities in FL-RCC systems to TLFAs, 2) Developing a label-distance-based metric to assess attack risks, and 3) Proposing FLARE, a defense mechanism using neuron-wise analysis of the output layer.

Result: Experiments conducted on RCC tasks using various metrics, baselines, and models show the severity of TLFAs on FL systems and validate FLARE’s effectiveness in mitigating such attacks.

Conclusion: FL-RCC systems are exposed to risks from TLFAs, but mitigation mechanisms like FLARE can substantially improve the robustness and safety of such systems.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) has emerged as a promising solution for
privacy-preserving autonomous driving, specifically camera-based Road Condition
Classification (RCC) systems, harnessing distributed sensing, computing, and
communication resources on board vehicles without sharing sensitive image data.
However, the collaborative nature of FL-RCC frameworks introduces new
vulnerabilities: Targeted Label Flipping Attacks (TLFAs), in which malicious
clients (vehicles) deliberately alter their training data labels to compromise
the learned model inference performance. Such attacks can, e.g., cause a
vehicle to mis-classify slippery, dangerous road conditions as pristine and
exceed recommended speed. However, TLFAs for FL-based RCC systems are largely
missing. We address this challenge with a threefold contribution: 1) we
disclose the vulnerability of existing FL-RCC systems to TLFAs; 2) we introduce
a novel label-distance-based metric to precisely quantify the safety risks
posed by TLFAs; and 3) we propose FLARE, a defensive mechanism leveraging
neuron-wise analysis of the output layer to mitigate TLFA effects. Extensive
experiments across three RCC tasks, four evaluation metrics, six baselines, and
three deep learning models demonstrate both the severity of TLFAs on FL-RCC
systems and the effectiveness of FLARE in mitigating the attack impact.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This paper analyzes how advanced prompt injection attacks exploit traditional web security vulnerabilities, posing significant threats to AI-integrated systems, and provides architectural solutions to mitigate such risks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address increasing security threats posed by modern prompt injection attacks in agentic AI systems, especially as they integrate with traditional cybersecurity exploits.

Method: The study conducts a comprehensive analysis of how prompt injections interact with vulnerabilities like XSS and CSRF, leveraging benchmarks to evaluate existing defenses and proposing advanced mitigation strategies.

Result: The analysis reveals that traditional security measures, like web application firewalls and CSRF tokens, are ineffective against AI-enhanced prompt injection attacks. It also identifies hybrid threats combining AI worms and multi-agent infections.

Conclusion: The paper concludes with recommendations for securing AI-integrated systems using techniques like prompt isolation, runtime security, privilege separation, and advanced threat detection mechanisms.

Abstract: Prompt injection attacks, where malicious input is designed to manipulate AI
systems into ignoring their original instructions and following unauthorized
commands instead, were first discovered by Preamble, Inc. in May 2022 and
responsibly disclosed to OpenAI. Over the last three years, these attacks have
continued to pose a critical security threat to LLM-integrated systems. The
emergence of agentic AI systems, where LLMs autonomously perform multistep
tasks through tools and coordination with other agents, has fundamentally
transformed the threat landscape. Modern prompt injection attacks can now
combine with traditional cybersecurity exploits to create hybrid threats that
systematically evade traditional security controls. This paper presents a
comprehensive analysis of Prompt Injection 2.0, examining how prompt injections
integrate with Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF),
and other web security vulnerabilities to bypass traditional security measures.
We build upon Preamble's foundational research and mitigation technologies,
evaluating them against contemporary threats, including AI worms, multi-agent
infections, and hybrid cyber-AI attacks. Our analysis incorporates recent
benchmarks that demonstrate how traditional web application firewalls, XSS
filters, and CSRF tokens fail against AI-enhanced attacks. We also present
architectural solutions that combine prompt isolation, runtime security, and
privilege separation with novel threat detection capabilities.

### [306] [Differentially Private Conformal Prediction via Quantile Binary Search](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12497)
*Ogonnaya M. Romanus,Roberto Molinari*

Main category: stat.ME

TL;DR: The paper introduces a new differentially private approach for conformal prediction (P-COQS) using a randomized binary search for quantile computation, ensuring privacy of prediction sets while achieving robust performance and informativeness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address privacy leakage in conformal prediction methods, especially during the calibration phase, as existing solutions are limited.

Method: A general framework called Private Conformity via Quantile Search (P-COQS), utilizing a randomized binary search algorithm for differential privacy in quantile computation during calibration.

Result: The approach is robust to privacy noise, produces smaller prediction sets, and achieves favorable empirical coverage and efficiency compared to existing DP methods across various benchmark datasets.

Conclusion: P-COQS effectively balances privacy guarantees and prediction performance, proving to be a reliable alternative to existing methods for private conformal prediction.

Abstract: Most Differentially Private (DP) approaches focus on limiting privacy leakage
from learners based on the data that they are trained on, there are fewer
approaches that consider leakage when procedures involve a calibration dataset
which is common in uncertainty quantification methods such as Conformal
Prediction (CP). Since there is a limited amount of approaches in this
direction, in this work we deliver a general DP approach for CP that we call
Private Conformity via Quantile Search (P-COQS). The proposed approach adapts
an existing randomized binary search algorithm for computing DP quantiles in
the calibration phase of CP thereby guaranteeing privacy of the consequent
prediction sets. This however comes at a price of slightly under-covering with
respect to the desired $(1 - \alpha)$-level when using finite-sample
calibration sets (although broad empirical results show that the P-COQS
generally targets the required level in the considered cases). Confirming
properties of the adapted algorithm and quantifying the approximate coverage
guarantees of the consequent CP, we conduct extensive experiments to examine
the effects of privacy noise, sample size and significance level on the
performance of our approach compared to existing alternatives. In addition, we
empirically evaluate our approach on several benchmark datasets, including
CIFAR-10, ImageNet and CoronaHack. Our results suggest that the proposed method
is robust to privacy noise and performs favorably with respect to the current
DP alternative in terms of empirical coverage, efficiency, and informativeness.
Specifically, the results indicate that P-COQS produces smaller conformal
prediction sets while simultaneously targeting the desired coverage and privacy
guarantees in all these experimental settings.

### [307] [Cross-World Assumption and Refining Prediction Intervals for Individual Treatment Effects](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12581)
*Juraj Bodik,Yaxuan Huang,Bin Yu*

Main category: stat.ME

TL;DR: This paper introduces a novel approach to improve the prediction intervals for individual treatment effects (ITE) by incorporating cross-world correlation parameters and domain-specific bounds.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors highlight the importance of capturing unit-specific uncertainty in high-stakes decision-making, which is not adequately addressed by existing approaches like ATE and CATE due to the unidentifiability of ITEs.

Method: The authors propose the use of a cross-world correlation parameter $ \rho(x) $ to describe the dependence between potential outcomes, with reasonable and interpretable bounds informed by domain-expert knowledge. They then design prediction intervals satisfying statistical guarantees.

Result: The proposed method achieves substantially shorter prediction intervals (often under 1/3 of competitors' widths) while maintaining accurate and stable coverage guarantees.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates that incorporating cross-world correlation parameters into the analysis of ITE can make individual uncertainty quantification both statistically robust and practically meaningful, achieving asymptotic optimality under certain assumptions.

Abstract: While average treatment effects (ATE) and conditional average treatment
effects (CATE) provide valuable population- and subgroup-level summaries, they
fail to capture uncertainty at the individual level. For high-stakes
decision-making, individual treatment effect (ITE) estimates must be
accompanied by valid prediction intervals that reflect heterogeneity and
unit-specific uncertainty. However, the fundamental unidentifiability of ITEs
limits the ability to derive precise and reliable individual-level uncertainty
estimates. To address this challenge, we investigate the role of a cross-world
correlation parameter, $ \rho(x) = cor(Y(1), Y(0) | X = x) $, which describes
the dependence between potential outcomes, given covariates, in the
Neyman-Rubin super-population model with i.i.d. units. Although $ \rho $ is
fundamentally unidentifiable, we argue that in most real-world applications, it
is possible to impose reasonable and interpretable bounds informed by
domain-expert knowledge. Given $\rho$, we design prediction intervals for ITE,
achieving more stable and accurate coverage with substantially shorter widths;
often less than 1/3 of those from competing methods. The resulting intervals
satisfy coverage guarantees $P\big(Y(1) - Y(0) \in C_{ITE}(X)\big) \geq 1 -
\alpha$ and are asymptotically optimal under Gaussian assumptions. We provide
strong theoretical and empirical arguments that cross-world assumptions can
make individual uncertainty quantification both practically informative and
statistically valid.

TL;DR: The paper introduces RIDER, a method to address temporal distribution shifts in dynamically changing environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need to tackle challenges posed by temporal distribution shifts in machine learning models deployed in evolving scenarios.

Method: Development of RIDER, a risk minimization framework grounded in a random distribution shift model.

Result: RIDER improves out-of-sample predictive performance in datasets like Yearbook and excels in tasks like stock market volatility prediction and NYC taxi ride forecasting.

Conclusion: RIDER provides a robust and theoretically sound approach to handle temporal distribution shifts, outperforming standard methods in real-world applications.

Abstract: Temporal distribution shifts pose a key challenge for machine learning models
trained and deployed in dynamically evolving environments. This paper
introduces RIDER (RIsk minimization under Dynamically Evolving Regimes) which
derives optimally-weighted empirical risk minimization procedures under
temporal distribution shifts. Our approach is theoretically grounded in the
random distribution shift model, where random shifts arise as a superposition
of numerous unpredictable changes in the data-generating process. We show that
common weighting schemes, such as pooling all data, exponentially weighting
data, and using only the most recent data, emerge naturally as special cases in
our framework. We demonstrate that RIDER consistently improves out-of-sample
predictive performance when applied as a fine-tuning step on the Yearbook
dataset, across a range of benchmark methods in Wild-Time. Moreover, we show
that RIDER outperforms standard weighting strategies in two other real-world
tasks: predicting stock market volatility and forecasting ride durations in NYC
taxi data.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a deep Koopman approach using neural networks for improved modeling and control of vehicle dynamics, achieving better trajectory tracking in real-time experiments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing challenges in modeling and controlling autonomous vehicles due to the nonlinearity and coupling in vehicle dynamics, with a goal to bridge gaps in high-fidelity modeling using Koopman operator theory.

Method: Utilized deep neural networks to learn the Koopman operator and its invariant subspace, while incorporating bilinear interactions for model predictive control. Also integrated a cumulative error regulator (CER) to mitigate prediction errors.

Result: The novel controller demonstrated enhanced tracking accuracy in closed-loop testing using hardware-in-the-loop setups, including real-time validation on advanced embedded systems.

Conclusion: The proposed deep Koopman framework offers significant improvements in real-time predictive control and trajectory tracking of autonomous vehicles, demonstrating effective integration for practical use cases.

Abstract: Accurate modeling and control of autonomous vehicles remain a fundamental
challenge due to the nonlinear and coupled nature of vehicle dynamics. While
Koopman operator theory offers a framework for deploying powerful linear
control techniques, learning a finite-dimensional invariant subspace for
high-fidelity modeling continues to be an open problem. This paper presents a
deep Koopman approach for modeling and control of vehicle dynamics within the
curvilinear Frenet frame. The proposed framework uses a deep neural network
architecture to simultaneously learn the Koopman operator and its associated
invariant subspace from the data. Input-state bilinear interactions are
captured by the algorithm while preserving convexity, which makes it suitable
for real-time model predictive control (MPC) application. A multi-step
prediction loss is utilized during training to ensure long-horizon prediction
capability. To further enhance real-time trajectory tracking performance, the
model is integrated with a cumulative error regulator (CER) module, which
compensates for model mismatch by mitigating accumulated prediction errors.
Closed-loop performance is evaluated through hardware-in-the-loop (HIL)
experiments using a CarSim RT model as the target plant, with real-time
validation conducted on a dSPACE SCALEXIO system. The proposed controller
achieved significant reductions in tracking error relative to baseline
controllers, confirming its suitability for real-time implementation in
embedded autonomous vehicle systems.

Motivation: The motivation is to address the limitations of traditional TMC estimation methods, particularly inaccuracies of camera-based recognition under difficult conditions, and explore the potential of LiDAR technology for more reliable and precise traffic counting.

Method: The authors deployed and tested a dual-LiDAR system at an intersection in Rialto, California. The system uses 3D bounding box detections from LiDARs to classify vehicles based on direction, movement, and class.

Result: The dual-LiDAR system effectively estimated TMC and provided meaningful data trends and insights, highlighting irregularities. It demonstrated promising capabilities compared to traditional methods.

Conclusion: The study highlights the potential of dual-LiDAR systems for improved TMC estimation, and the authors discuss enhancements for further advancing traffic data accuracy and additional applications like trajectory forecasting and intent prediction.

Abstract: Traffic Movement Count (TMC) at intersections is crucial for optimizing
signal timings, assessing the performance of existing traffic control measures,
and proposing efficient lane configurations to minimize delays, reduce
congestion, and promote safety. Traditionally, methods such as manual counting,
loop detectors, pneumatic road tubes, and camera-based recognition have been
used for TMC estimation. Although generally reliable, camera-based TMC
estimation is prone to inaccuracies under poor lighting conditions during harsh
weather and nighttime. In contrast, Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR)
technology is gaining popularity in recent times due to reduced costs and its
expanding use in 3D object detection, tracking, and related applications. This
paper presents the authors' endeavor to develop, deploy and evaluate a
dual-LiDAR system at an intersection in the city of Rialto, California, for TMC
estimation. The 3D bounding box detections from the two LiDARs are used to
classify vehicle counts based on traffic directions, vehicle movements, and
vehicle classes. This work discusses the estimated TMC results and provides
insights into the observed trends and irregularities. Potential improvements
are also discussed that could enhance not only TMC estimation, but also
trajectory forecasting and intent prediction at intersections.

### [311] [On Accelerated Mixing of the No-U-turn Sampler](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13259)
*Stefan Oberdörster*

Main category: math.ST

TL;DR: The paper explores the No-U-turn Sampler's capability for accelerated convergence in sampling tasks, providing rigorous mixing guarantees for certain Gaussian target distributions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the lack of rigorous analysis on the No-U-turn Sampler's performance in achieving accelerated convergence despite its empirical success.

Method: The authors employ a combination of concentration of measure analysis for the tuner's behavior and coupling-based mixing analysis for Hamiltonian Monte Carlo.

Result: They precisely characterize the No-U-turn Sampler's behavior in certain Gaussian target distributions and provide rigorous guarantees on its mixing performance.

Conclusion: The study offers insights into the sampler's potential and limitations in delivering accelerated convergence, advancing theoretical understanding of its mechanism.

Abstract: Recent progress on the theory of variational hypocoercivity established that
Randomized Hamiltonian Monte Carlo -- at criticality -- can achieve pronounced
acceleration in its convergence and hence sampling performance over diffusive
dynamics. Manual critical tuning being unfeasible in practice has motivated
automated algorithmic solutions, notably the No-U-turn Sampler. Beyond its
empirical success, a rigorous study of this method's ability to achieve
accelerated convergence has been missing. We initiate this investigation
combining a concentration of measure approach to examine the automatic tuning
mechanism with a coupling based mixing analysis for Hamiltonian Monte Carlo. In
certain Gaussian target distributions, this yields a precise characterization
of the sampler's behavior resulting, in particular, in rigorous mixing
guarantees describing the algorithm's ability and limitations in achieving
accelerated convergence.

*Md. Tanvir Alam,Md. Ahasanul Alam,Md Mahmudur Rahman,Md. Mosaddek Khan*

Main category: cs.DB

TL;DR: This paper introduces rel-HNN, a hypergraph-based approach that models relational databases by capturing fine-grained intra-tuple relationships for improved learning, achieving better performance and scalability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep learning faces challenges in capturing relational semantics from relational databases due to fixed-size input limitations and oversimplifications in existing graph-based approaches.

Method: The rel-HNN framework models unique attribute-value pairs as nodes and tuples as hyperedges, creating multi-level representations. A split-parallel training algorithm is also introduced to enhance scalability via multi-GPU execution.

Result: rel-HNN achieves significantly better results in classification and regression tasks on real-world and benchmark datasets. The split-parallel training provides performance speed-ups up to 3.18x for relational data learning and 2.94x for hypergraph learning.

Conclusion: rel-HNN provides a fine-grained modeling approach for relational data, which outperforms existing methods while addressing scalability concerns through efficient parallel training.

Abstract: Relational databases (RDBs) are ubiquitous in enterprise and real-world
applications. Flattening the database poses challenges for deep learning models
that rely on fixed-size input representations to capture relational semantics
from the structured nature of relational data. Graph neural networks (GNNs)
have been proposed to address this, but they often oversimplify relational
structures by modeling all the tuples as monolithic nodes and ignoring
intra-tuple associations. In this work, we propose a novel hypergraph-based
framework, that we call rel-HNN, which models each unique attribute-value pair
as a node and each tuple as a hyperedge, enabling the capture of fine-grained
intra-tuple relationships. Our approach learns explicit multi-level
representations across attribute-value, tuple, and table levels. To address the
scalability challenges posed by large RDBs, we further introduce a
split-parallel training algorithm that leverages multi-GPU execution for
efficient hypergraph learning. Extensive experiments on real-world and
benchmark datasets demonstrate that rel-HNN significantly outperforms existing
methods in both classification and regression tasks. Moreover, our
split-parallel training achieves substantial speedups -- up to 3.18x for
learning on relational data and up to 2.94x for hypergraph learning -- compared
to conventional single-GPU execution.

Main category: cs.DB

TL;DR: The paper introduces a framework for converting football (soccer) data into an object-centric event log, incorporating a spatial dimension, to analyze complex process behavior in team sports.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address the limited availability of real-world object-centric event logs and explore how such logs can represent complex processes, leveraging the increasing availability of data in team sports, particularly football.

Method: The framework transforms football data into object-centric event logs, enriched with spatial data, and then evaluates the framework's effectiveness through real-world football datasets and various process representations.

Result: The framework successfully generates object-centric event logs using football data and demonstrates their utility in analyzing process behavior.

Conclusion: This work serves as the first example of using object-centric event logs in football analytics and suggests future studies on variant analysis and filtering techniques to address variability.

Abstract: Object-centric event logs expand the conventional single-case notion event
log by considering multiple objects, allowing for the analysis of more complex
and realistic process behavior. However, the number of real-world
object-centric event logs remains limited, and further studies are needed to
test their usefulness. The increasing availability of data from team sports can
facilitate object-centric process mining, leveraging both real-world data and
suitable use cases. In this paper, we present a framework for transforming
football (soccer) data into an object-centric event log, further enhanced with
a spatial dimension. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework by
generating object-centric event logs based on real-world football data and
discuss the results for varying process representations. With our paper, we
provide the first example for object-centric event logs in football analytics.
Future work should consider variant analysis and filtering techniques to better
handle variability

TL;DR: The paper introduces InSight, an AI app that assesses fundus images and patient data to accurately diagnose five common eye diseases, aiming to improve early screenings in resource-limited settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the global issue of accessibility to early screening for major eye diseases, especially in low- and middle-income countries with limited medical infrastructure.

Method: InSight employs a three-stage AI pipeline: real-time image quality assessment, multimodal disease diagnosis (MetaFusion combining patient and image data), and DR severity grading with preprocessing innovations like pretraining and multitask prediction models.

Result: InSight shows near-perfect accuracy in screening fundus image quality, achieves high diagnostic performance, outperforming image-only models by 4–6% in balanced accuracy, and offers generalization across smartphone and lab-captured images.

Conclusion: The AI represents a robust, lightweight, and computationally efficient solution for early detection of five major eye diseases, suitable for diverse imaging conditions and improving accessibility in under-resourced areas.

Abstract: Background/Objectives: Age-related macular degeneration, glaucoma, diabetic
retinopathy (DR), diabetic macular edema, and pathological myopia affect
hundreds of millions of people worldwide. Early screening for these diseases is
essential, yet access to medical care remains limited in low- and middle-income
countries as well as in resource-limited settings. We develop InSight, an
AI-based app that combines patient metadata with fundus images for accurate
diagnosis of five common eye diseases to improve accessibility of screenings.
  Methods: InSight features a three-stage pipeline: real-time image quality
assessment, disease diagnosis model, and a DR grading model to assess severity.
Our disease diagnosis model incorporates three key innovations: (a) Multimodal
fusion technique (MetaFusion) combining clinical metadata and images; (b)
Pretraining method leveraging supervised and self-supervised loss functions;
and (c) Multitask model to simultaneously predict 5 diseases. We make use of
BRSET (lab-captured images) and mBRSET (smartphone-captured images) datasets,
both of which also contain clinical metadata for model training/evaluation.
  Results: Trained on a dataset of BRSET and mBRSET images, the image quality
checker achieves near-100% accuracy in filtering out low-quality fundus images.
The multimodal pretrained disease diagnosis model outperforms models using only
images by 6% in balanced accuracy for BRSET and 4% for mBRSET.
  Conclusions: The InSight pipeline demonstrates robustness across varied image
conditions and has high diagnostic accuracy across all five diseases,
generalizing to both smartphone and lab captured images. The multitask model
contributes to the lightweight nature of the pipeline, making it five times
computationally efficient compared to having five individual models
corresponding to each disease.

mortality. The MedMNIST v2 dataset, inspired by MNIST, was recently introduced
to advance research in biomedical imaging and includes DermaMNIST, a dataset
for classifying pigmented lesions based on the HAM10000 dataset. This study
assesses ResNet-50 and EfficientNetV2L models for multi-class classification
using DermaMNIST, employing transfer learning and various layer configurations.
One configuration achieves results that match or surpass existing methods. This
study suggests that convolutional neural networks (CNNs) can drive progress in
biomedical image analysis, significantly enhancing diagnostic accuracy.

### [316] [Pathology-Guided Virtual Staining Metric for Evaluation and Training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12624)
*Qiankai Wang,James E. D. Tweel,Parsin Haji Reza,Anita Layton*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: This paper introduces PaPIS, a novel metric for evaluating virtual staining images, addressing shortcomings of conventional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current evaluation methods for virtual staining fail to assess pathology-relevant features effectively.

Method: PaPIS leverages deep learning features focused on cell morphology and employs feature decomposition inspired by Retinex for quality assessment.

Result: PaPIS better captures pathology-relevant visual cues, distinguishes cellular structures, and improves outcomes when integrated into virtual staining models.

Conclusion: Pathology-aware metrics like PaPIS are essential for advancing virtual staining technologies for clinical applications.

Abstract: Virtual staining has emerged as a powerful alternative to traditional
histopathological staining techniques, enabling rapid, reagent-free image
transformations. However, existing evaluation methods predominantly rely on
full-reference image quality assessment (FR-IQA) metrics such as structural
similarity, which are originally designed for natural images and often fail to
capture pathology-relevant features. Expert pathology reviews have also been
used, but they are inherently subjective and time-consuming.
  In this study, we introduce PaPIS (Pathology-Aware Perceptual Image
Similarity), a novel FR-IQA metric specifically tailored for virtual staining
evaluation. PaPIS leverages deep learning-based features trained on cell
morphology segmentation and incorporates Retinex-inspired feature decomposition
to better reflect histological perceptual quality. Comparative experiments
demonstrate that PaPIS more accurately aligns with pathology-relevant visual
cues and distinguishes subtle cellular structures that traditional and existing
perceptual metrics tend to overlook. Furthermore, integrating PaPIS as a
guiding loss function in a virtual staining model leads to improved
histological fidelity.
  This work highlights the critical need for pathology-aware evaluation
frameworks to advance the development and clinical readiness of virtual
staining technologies.

*Rajesh Sureddi,Saman Zadtootaghaj,Nabajeet Barman,Alan C. Bovik*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: This paper advances NR-IQA modeling by proposing a novel content-aware and quality-aware approach using contrastive triplet-based learning, addressing challenges of limited labeled data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to overcome the challenge of limited subjectively labeled data for No-Reference IQA, which hampers model development.

Method: The approach involves creating a custom dataset with reference content images and training a model using contrastive triplet-based learning to integrate both content and quality features.

Result: The model achieves strong generalization performance across publicly available datasets, using fewer samples for training.

Conclusion: The methodology demonstrates efficiency in training while improving perceptual quality prediction in NR-IQA tasks and contributes to advancing the broader IQA field.

Abstract: Image Quality Assessment (IQA) models aim to predict perceptual image quality
in alignment with human judgments. No-Reference (NR) IQA remains particularly
challenging due to the absence of a reference image. While deep learning has
significantly advanced this field, a major hurdle in developing NR-IQA models
is the limited availability of subjectively labeled data. Most existing deep
learning-based NR-IQA approaches rely on pre-training on large-scale datasets
before fine-tuning for IQA tasks. To further advance progress in this area, we
propose a novel approach that constructs a custom dataset using a limited
number of reference content images and introduces a no-reference IQA model that
incorporates both content and quality features for perceptual quality
prediction. Specifically, we train a quality-aware model using contrastive
triplet-based learning, enabling efficient training with fewer samples while
achieving strong generalization performance across publicly available datasets.

TL;DR: This paper introduces 'Pixel Perfect MegaMed,' a vision-language model for synthesizing ultra-high resolution (1024x1024) medical images like chest X-rays, showing improved visual fidelity and integration with text for clinical tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Preserving fine-grained details in high-resolution medical image synthesis, which is crucial for diagnosis, remains a key challenge for traditional generative models like GANs and VAEs.

Method: The paper proposes a multi-scale transformer architecture that combines vision-language alignment techniques tailored to medical contexts, synthesizing clinically accurate medical images from text prompts with resolutions up to 1024x1024.

Result: Pixel Perfect MegaMed performed effectively with the CheXpert dataset, generating clinically-reliable synthetic chest X-rays and offering measurable improvements for classification tasks, especially in low-data scenarios.

Conclusion: The Pixel Perfect MegaMed model advances medical image synthesis by bridging textual and visual data at high resolutions, benefiting diagnostic tasks and low-data environments while offering open-source accessibility.

Abstract: Medical image synthesis presents unique challenges due to the inherent
complexity and high-resolution details required in clinical contexts.
Traditional generative architectures such as Generative Adversarial Networks
(GANs) or Variational Auto Encoder (VAEs) have shown great promise for
high-resolution image generation but struggle with preserving fine-grained
details that are key for accurate diagnosis. To address this issue, we
introduce Pixel Perfect MegaMed, the first vision-language foundation model to
synthesize images at resolutions of 1024x1024. Our method deploys a multi-scale
transformer architecture designed specifically for ultra-high resolution
medical image generation, enabling the preservation of both global anatomical
context and local image-level details. By leveraging vision-language alignment
techniques tailored to medical terminology and imaging modalities, Pixel
Perfect MegaMed bridges the gap between textual descriptions and visual
representations at unprecedented resolution levels. We apply our model to the
CheXpert dataset and demonstrate its ability to generate clinically faithful
chest X-rays from text prompts. Beyond visual quality, these high-resolution
synthetic images prove valuable for downstream tasks such as classification,
showing measurable performance gains when used for data augmentation,
particularly in low-data regimes. Our code is accessible through the project

*Caixia Dong,Duwei Dai,Xinyi Han,Fan Liu,Xu Yang,Zongfang Li,Songhua Xu*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: The study proposes a novel framework combining Vision Transformers and CNNs for coronary artery segmentation, introducing advanced modules to improve performance and generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Developing accurate coronary artery segmentation methods is vital for CAD diagnosis but faces challenges like complex morphology and low tissue contrast.

Method: The framework integrates Vision Transformer and CNN encoders for capturing global and local features, fusing them via a cross-branch variational fusion module, alongside an evidential-learning uncertainty refinement module.

Result: Extensive testing on one in-house and two public datasets reveals superior segmentation performance and robustness compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: The proposed framework achieves significant advancements in coronary artery segmentation, addressing present challenges, with code made publicly available for further research.

Abstract: Accurate coronary artery segmentation is critical for computeraided diagnosis
of coronary artery disease (CAD), yet it remains challenging due to the small
size, complex morphology, and low contrast with surrounding tissues. To address
these challenges, we propose a novel segmentation framework that leverages the
power of vision foundation models (VFMs) through a parallel encoding
architecture. Specifically, a vision transformer (ViT) encoder within the VFM
captures global structural features, enhanced by the activation of the final
two ViT blocks and the integration of an attention-guided enhancement (AGE)
module, while a convolutional neural network (CNN) encoder extracts local
details. These complementary features are adaptively fused using a cross-branch
variational fusion (CVF) module, which models latent distributions and applies
variational attention to assign modality-specific weights. Additionally, we
introduce an evidential-learning uncertainty refinement (EUR) module, which
quantifies uncertainty using evidence theory and refines uncertain regions by
incorporating multi-scale feature aggregation and attention mechanisms, further
enhancing segmentation accuracy. Extensive evaluations on one in-house and two
public datasets demonstrate that the proposed framework significantly
outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving superior performance in
accurate coronary artery segmentation and showcasing strong generalization
across multiple datasets. The code is available at

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a method to improve orbital bone segmentation in facial CT images, using a consensus-driven system leveraging multiple outputs from a diffusion model to correct disconnected and under-segmented areas.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of accurately segmenting thin and ambiguous orbital bone regions in CT images for customized implant creation, as existing methods struggle with disconnected or incomplete segmentation.

Method: The paper proposes a framework using a conditional Bernoulli diffusion model trained on diverse annotation patterns to generate plausible segmentations. A consensus-based correction incorporates position proximity, consensus level, and gradient similarity to resolve challenges in segmentation.

Result: The framework outperforms existing segmentation methods, showing improved recall in ambiguous orbital regions while maintaining structural continuity.

Conclusion: The proposed framework improves accuracy and continuity in orbital bone segmentation, automates correction processes, and has practical applications in surgical planning and surgery.

Abstract: Accurate segmentation of orbital bones in facial computed tomography (CT)
images is essential for the creation of customized implants for reconstruction
of defected orbital bones, particularly challenging due to the ambiguous
boundaries and thin structures such as the orbital medial wall and orbital
floor. In these ambiguous regions, existing segmentation approaches often
output disconnected or under-segmented results. We propose a novel framework
that corrects segmentation results by leveraging consensus from multiple
diffusion model outputs. Our approach employs a conditional Bernoulli diffusion
model trained on diverse annotation patterns per image to generate multiple
plausible segmentations, followed by a consensus-driven correction that
incorporates position proximity, consensus level, and gradient direction
similarity to correct challenging regions. Experimental results demonstrate
that our method outperforms existing methods, significantly improving recall in
ambiguous regions while preserving the continuity of thin structures.
Furthermore, our method automates the manual process of segmentation result
correction and can be applied to image-guided surgical planning and surgery.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: The paper introduces fastWDM3D, a fast and accurate 3D tissue inpainting model that is significantly faster and achieves better performance compared to traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for healthy tissue inpainting, particularly DDPMs, deliver high-quality results but suffer from slow sampling speeds, limiting their practical utility. The motivation was to address these speed and efficiency limitations.

Method: The authors adapted a 2D image generation approach combining DDPMs with GANs, leveraging a variance-preserving noise schedule for 3D inpainting. Additionally, they developed fastWDM3D based on a 3D wavelet diffusion model without GAN involvement for faster results.

Result: Experiments demonstrated that fastWDM3D achieved an SSIM of 0.8571, MSE of 0.0079, and PSNR of 22.26 on the BraTS inpainting test set. It completed the process in just 1.81 seconds per image and was up to 800x faster than competing DDPM methods.

Conclusion: fastWDM3D significantly accelerates 3D healthy tissue inpainting, delivering excellent accuracy and quality, making it a promising tool in medical imaging applications.

Abstract: Healthy tissue inpainting has significant applications, including the
generation of pseudo-healthy baselines for tumor growth models and the
facilitation of image registration. In previous editions of the BraTS Local
Synthesis of Healthy Brain Tissue via Inpainting Challenge, denoising diffusion
probabilistic models (DDPMs) demonstrated qualitatively convincing results but
suffered from low sampling speed. To mitigate this limitation, we adapted a 2D
image generation approach, combining DDPMs with generative adversarial networks
(GANs) and employing a variance-preserving noise schedule, for the task of 3D
inpainting. Our experiments showed that the variance-preserving noise schedule
and the selected reconstruction losses can be effectively utilized for
high-quality 3D inpainting in a few time steps without requiring adversarial
training. We applied our findings to a different architecture, a 3D wavelet
diffusion model (WDM3D) that does not include a GAN component. The resulting
model, denoted as fastWDM3D, obtained a SSIM of 0.8571, a MSE of 0.0079, and a
PSNR of 22.26 on the BraTS inpainting test set. Remarkably, it achieved these
scores using only two time steps, completing the 3D inpainting process in 1.81
s per image. When compared to other DDPMs used for healthy brain tissue
inpainting, our model is up to 800 x faster while still achieving superior
performance metrics. Our proposed method, fastWDM3D, represents a promising
approach for fast and accurate healthy tissue inpainting. Our code is available

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: The paper introduces SpectraLift, a self-supervised framework for fusing low-resolution hyperspectral images (LR-HSI) with high-resolution multispectral images (HR-MSI) without needing ground truth HR-HSI or PSF calibration, showing superior performance in benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current hyperspectral image fusion methods rely on impractical requirements like point spread function (PSF) calibration or ground truth high-resolution hyperspectral images (HR-HSI), limiting their real-world applicability.

Method: SpectraLift trains a lightweight per-pixel multi-layer perceptron (MLP) using a synthetic low-resolution multispectral image (LR-MSI) derived from the LR-HSI and applies a spectral reconstruction loss ($\ell_1$) to optimize the network. It then maps the HR-MSI pixel-wise to estimate HR-HSI.

Result: SpectraLift achieves fast convergence, is independent of spatial blur and resolution, and surpasses state-of-the-art methods in PSNR, SAM, SSIM, and RMSE metrics.

Conclusion: The proposed SpectraLift framework enables efficient and practical hyperspectral image fusion without requiring impractical prior knowledge, making it viable for real-world applications.

Abstract: High-spatial-resolution hyperspectral images (HSI) are essential for
applications such as remote sensing and medical imaging, yet HSI sensors
inherently trade spatial detail for spectral richness. Fusing
high-spatial-resolution multispectral images (HR-MSI) with
low-spatial-resolution hyperspectral images (LR-HSI) is a promising route to
recover fine spatial structures without sacrificing spectral fidelity. Most
state-of-the-art methods for HSI-MSI fusion demand point spread function (PSF)
calibration or ground truth high resolution HSI (HR-HSI), both of which are
impractical to obtain in real world settings. We present SpectraLift, a fully
self-supervised framework that fuses LR-HSI and HR-MSI inputs using only the
MSI's Spectral Response Function (SRF). SpectraLift trains a lightweight
per-pixel multi-layer perceptron (MLP) network using ($i$)~a synthetic
low-spatial-resolution multispectral image (LR-MSI) obtained by applying the
SRF to the LR-HSI as input, ($ii$)~the LR-HSI as the output, and ($iii$)~an
$\ell_1$ spectral reconstruction loss between the estimated and true LR-HSI as
the optimization objective. At inference, SpectraLift uses the trained network
to map the HR-MSI pixel-wise into a HR-HSI estimate. SpectraLift converges in
minutes, is agnostic to spatial blur and resolution, and outperforms
state-of-the-art methods on PSNR, SAM, SSIM, and RMSE benchmarks.

TL;DR: The paper presents an approach to refine coarse-grained molecular dynamics (CGMD) simulations using Bayesian Optimization to improve their accuracy while maintaining computational efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current coarse-grained molecular dynamics (CGMD) methods like CG-Martini lack sufficient accuracy for domain-specific applications despite their lower computational costs compared to All-Atom (AA) molecular dynamics.

Method: The study employs Bayesian Optimization to refine general-purpose Martini3 topologies by optimizing bonded interaction parameters for specific coarse-grained mappings.

Result: An optimized CG potential applicable to any degree of polymerization was developed and validated, achieving comparable accuracy to AAMD while retaining the computational benefits of CGMD.

Conclusion: The proposed approach bridges the gap between efficiency and accuracy in multiscale molecular simulations, facilitating cost-effective and rapid molecular discovery.

Abstract: Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations are essential for accurately predicting
the physical and chemical properties of large molecular systems across various
pressure and temperature ensembles. However, the high computational costs
associated with All-Atom (AA) MD simulations have led to the development of
Coarse-Grained Molecular Dynamics (CGMD), providing a lower-dimensional
compression of the AA structure into representative CG beads, offering reduced
computational expense at the cost of predictive accuracy. Existing CGMD
methods, such as CG-Martini (calibrated against experimental data), aim to
generate an embedding of a topology that sufficiently generalizes across a
range of structures. Detrimentally, in attempting to specify parameterization
with applicability across molecular classes, it is unable to specialize to
domain-specific applications, where sufficient accuracy and computational speed
are critical. This work presents a novel approach to optimize derived results
from CGMD simulations by refining the general-purpose Martini3 topologies
specifically the bonded interaction parameters within a given coarse-grained
mapping - for domain-specific applications using Bayesian Optimization
methodologies. We have developed and validated a CG potential applicable to any
degree of polymerization, representing a significant advancement in the field.
Our optimized CG potential, based on the Martini3 framework, aims to achieve
accuracy comparable to AAMD while maintaining the computational efficiency of
CGMD. This approach bridges the gap between efficiency and accuracy in
multiscale molecular simulations, potentially enabling more rapid and

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the St. Petersburg paradox, which challenges decision theory due to its infinite expected value and lack of finite rational stakes, by exploring a solution that aligns more with how humans perceive numerical information.

Method: The paper defines a modified addition operation over coarse partitions of the outcome space, where numerical values are grouped into perceptual categories and replaced by representative values before their summation.

Result: It demonstrates that the St. Petersburg series can stabilize under this coarse addition method, achieving inertial stabilization through well-constructed partitions.

Conclusion: While not a definitive resolution to the paradox, the proposed framework suggests a plausible model for decision-making under cognitive limitations and has potential implications for behavioral and machine reasoning beyond this specific paradox.

Abstract: The St. Petersburg paradox presents a longstanding challenge in decision
theory. It describes a game whose expected value is infinite, yet for which no
rational finite stake can be determined. Traditional solutions introduce
auxiliary assumptions, such as diminishing marginal utility, temporal
discounting, or extended number systems. These methods often involve
mathematical refinements that may not correspond to how people actually
perceive or process numerical information. This paper explores an alternative
approach based on a modified operation of addition defined over coarse
partitions of the outcome space. In this model, exact numerical values are
grouped into perceptual categories, and each value is replaced by a
representative element of its group before being added. This method allows for
a phenomenon where repeated additions eventually cease to affect the outcome, a
behavior described as inertial stabilization. Although this is not intended as
a definitive resolution of the paradox, the proposed framework offers a
plausible way to represent how agents with limited cognitive precision might
handle divergent reward structures. We demonstrate that the St. Petersburg
series can become inert under this coarse addition for a suitably constructed
partition. The approach may also have broader applications in behavioral
modeling and the study of machine reasoning under perceptual limitations.

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: The paper investigates public perception and social impact of fully autonomous cybernetic avatars (CAs) used for physical support by conducting a demonstration and survey.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand public views and challenges concerning fully autonomous cybernetic avatars in daily life tasks.

Method: Large-scale demonstration and survey at a 19-day public event in Osaka, Japan with data collected from 2,285 visitors, including focused insights from 333 participants who interacted with fully autonomous CAs.

Result: Survey findings revealed interest in CAs for physical support yet highlighted concerns related to task reliability; cost and human-like interaction were deemed less significant concerns.

Conclusion: Fully autonomous CAs show promise for daily and workplace physical support, though reliability in task execution needs improvement for broader adoption.

Abstract: Cybernetic avatars (CAs) are key components of an avatar-symbiotic society,
enabling individuals to overcome physical limitations through virtual agents
and robotic assistants. While semi-autonomous CAs intermittently require human
teleoperation and supervision, the deployment of fully autonomous CAs remains a
challenge. This study evaluates public perception and potential social impacts
of fully autonomous CAs for physical support in daily life. To this end, we
conducted a large-scale demonstration and survey during Avatar Land, a 19-day
public event in Osaka, Japan, where fully autonomous robotic CAs, alongside
semi-autonomous CAs, performed daily object retrieval tasks. Specifically, we
analyzed responses from 2,285 visitors who engaged with various CAs, including
a subset of 333 participants who interacted with fully autonomous CAs and
shared their perceptions and concerns through a survey questionnaire. The
survey results indicate interest in CAs for physical support in daily life and
at work. However, concerns were raised regarding task execution reliability. In
contrast, cost and human-like interaction were not dominant concerns. Project

*Tianyu Song,Feng Li,Yuan Bi,Angelos Karlas,Amir Yousefi,Daniela Branzan,Zhongliang Jiang,Ulrich Eck,Nassir Navab*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: This paper introduces an Intelligent Virtual Sonographer (IVS) in XR to enhance communication and interaction among physicians, robotic ultrasound systems, and patients.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the communication gap between physicians, robotic ultrasound systems, and patients, improving interaction efficiency, trust, and patient experience.

Method: They developed an IVS agent leveraging large language models (LLMs), combined with speech-to-text, text-to-speech, and robotic control, in an Extended Reality (XR) framework.

Result: The system enables professional interaction with physicians, empathetic communication with patients, and real-time robotic ultrasound control, enhancing the overall process.

Conclusion: The IVS agent effectively bridges communication gaps, fostering trust in robotic systems and improving patient acceptance of robotic ultrasound.

Abstract: The advancement and maturity of large language models (LLMs) and robotics
have unlocked vast potential for human-computer interaction, particularly in
the field of robotic ultrasound. While existing research primarily focuses on
either patient-robot or physician-robot interaction, the role of an intelligent
virtual sonographer (IVS) bridging physician-robot-patient communication
remains underexplored. This work introduces a conversational virtual agent in
Extended Reality (XR) that facilitates real-time interaction between
physicians, a robotic ultrasound system(RUS), and patients. The IVS agent
communicates with physicians in a professional manner while offering empathetic
explanations and reassurance to patients. Furthermore, it actively controls the
RUS by executing physician commands and transparently relays these actions to
the patient. By integrating LLM-powered dialogue with speech-to-text,
text-to-speech, and robotic control, our system enhances the efficiency,
clarity, and accessibility of robotic ultrasound acquisition. This work
constitutes a first step toward understanding how IVS can bridge communication
gaps in physician-robot-patient interaction, providing more control and
therefore trust into physician-robot interaction while improving patient
experience and acceptance of robotic ultrasound.

### [327] [Autonomy for Older Adult-Agent Interaction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12767)
*Jiaxin An*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: The paper discusses aligning AI caregiving agents with elderly autonomy preferences across four identified dimensions and proposes research directions to enhance their applicability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation of this paper arises from the challenge of creating AI-powered agents that support older adults while respecting their autonomy.

Method: The authors examine autonomy through interdisciplinary perspectives, segment it into four dimensions, and suggest research directions such as addressing ethical aspects, operationalizing agent autonomy, and developing measures for autonomy.

Result: Key dimensions of autonomy for older adults are outlined, and initial strategies for ensuring alignment of agents with these aspects are proposed.

Conclusion: AI caregiving agents must incorporate ethical considerations and respect autonomy preferences of older adults while addressing practical implementation challenges.

Abstract: As the global population ages, artificial intelligence (AI)-powered agents
have emerged as potential tools to support older adults' caregiving. Prior
research has explored agent autonomy by identifying key interaction stages in
task processes and defining the agent's role at each stage. However, ensuring
that agents align with older adults' autonomy preferences remains a critical
challenge. Drawing on interdisciplinary conceptualizations of autonomy, this
paper examines four key dimensions of autonomy for older adults:
decision-making autonomy, goal-oriented autonomy, control autonomy, and social
responsibility autonomy. This paper then proposes the following research
directions: (1) Addressing social responsibility autonomy, which concerns the
ethical and social implications of agent use in communal settings; (2)
Operationalizing agent autonomy from the task perspective; and (3) Developing
autonomy measures.

*S. Schär,S. Marelli,B. Sudret*

Main category: stat.CO

TL;DR: The paper introduces mNARX+, an automated approach for constructing nonlinear autoregressive models to represent complex dynamical systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the dependence of traditional mNARX modeling on domain expertise for identifying auxiliary quantities and causal ordering in dynamical systems.

Method: A recursive, data-driven algorithm that selects temporal features based on their correlation with model prediction residuals to automate model construction.

Result: Tested on a Bouc-Wen oscillator and wind turbine simulator, mNARX+ demonstrated the ability to create accurate and stable surrogate models.

Conclusion: mNARX+ effectively reduces reliance on prior system knowledge, providing a systematic method to model dynamical systems with strong expressivity and stability.

Abstract: We propose an automatic approach for manifold nonlinear autoregressive with
exogenous inputs (mNARX) modeling that leverages the feature-based structure of
functional-NARX (F-NARX) modeling. This novel approach, termed mNARX+,
preserves the key strength of the mNARX framework, which is its expressivity
allowing it to model complex dynamical systems, while simultaneously addressing
a key limitation: the heavy reliance on domain expertise to identify relevant
auxiliary quantities and their causal ordering. Our method employs a
data-driven, recursive algorithm that automates the construction of the mNARX
model sequence. It operates by sequentially selecting temporal features based
on their correlation with the model prediction residuals, thereby automatically
identifying the most critical auxiliary quantities and the order in which they
should be modeled. This procedure significantly reduces the need for prior
system knowledge. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the mNARX+ algorithm on
two case studies: a Bouc-Wen oscillator with strong hysteresis and a complex
aero-servo-elastic wind turbine simulator. The results show that the algorithm
provides a systematic, data-driven method for creating accurate and stable
surrogate models for complex dynamical systems.

### [329] [Implementation and Analysis of GPU Algorithms for Vecchia Approximation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02740)
*Zachary James,Joseph Guinness*

Main category: stat.CO

TL;DR: The paper introduces GpGpU, a GPU-accelerated implementation for Vecchia Approximation in Gaussian Processes, achieving faster runtimes and improved accuracy compared to existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the computational burden of Gaussian Processes when analyzing large datasets and the lack of GPU-accelerated software for Vecchia Approximation, despite the effectiveness of GPUs in similar fields.

Method: Three GPU-based implementations for Vecchia Approximation are compared, with an emphasis on optimizing memory type and performance. The most efficient method is then incorporated into the GpGpU R package.

Result: GpGpU outperforms existing multi-core and GPU-based approaches in runtime and predictive accuracy, particularly on a large spatial-temporal dataset with over a million points.

Conclusion: The new GPU-based method for Vecchia Approximation introduced in GpGpU enables efficient and accurate analysis of large-scale datasets, making it a valuable tool for spatial statisticians.

Abstract: Gaussian Processes have become an indispensable part of the spatial
statistician's toolbox but are unsuitable for analyzing large dataset because
of the significant time and memory needed to fit the associated model exactly.
Vecchia Approximation is widely used to reduce the computational complexity and
can be calculated with embarrassingly parallel algorithms. While multi-core
software has been developed for Vecchia Approximation, such as the GpGp R
package, software designed to run on graphics processing units (GPU) is
lacking, despite the tremendous success GPUs have had in statistics and machine
learning. We compare three different ways to implement Vecchia Approximation on
a GPU: two of which are similar to methods used for other Gaussian Process
approximations and one that is new. The impact of memory type on performance is
investigated and the final method is optimized accordingly. We show that our
new method outperforms the other two and then present it in the GpGpU R
package. We compare GpGpU to existing multi-core and GPU-accelerated software
by fitting Gaussian Process models on various datasets, including a large
spatial-temporal dataset of $n>10^6$ points collected from an earth-observing
satellite. Our results show that GpGpU achieves faster runtimes and better
predictive accuracy.
