In small and early-stage cloud deployments, however, log retention policies are frequently configured far beyond operational requirements, often defaulting to 90 days or more, without explicit consideration of their financial and performance implications. As a result, excessive log retention becomes a hidden and recurring cost.\n  This study examines the financial and operational impact of log retention window selection from a cost-aware perspective. Using synthetic log datasets designed to reflect real-world variability in log volume and access patterns, we evaluate retention windows of 7, 14, 30, and 90 days. The analysis focuses on three metrics: storage cost, operationally useful log ratio, and cost per useful log. Operational usefulness is defined as log data accessed during simulated debugging and incident analysis tasks.\n  The results show that reducing log retention from 90 days to 14 days can lower log storage costs by up to 78 percent while preserving more than 97 percent of operationally useful logs. Longer retention windows provide diminishing operational returns while disproportionately increasing storage cost and query overhead.

This paper presents the design and implementation of a cycle-accurate, hardware-oriented Spiking Neural Network (SNN) core implemented in SystemVerilog. Unlike conventional accelerators, this design utilizes a Leaky Integrate-and-Fire (LIF) neuron model powered by fixed-point arithmetic and bit-wise primitives (shifts and additions) to eliminate the need for complex floating-point hardware. The architecture features an on-chip Poisson encoder for stochastic spike generation and a novel active pruning mechanism that dynamically disables neurons post-classification to minimize dynamic power consumption. We demonstrate the hardware's efficacy through a fully connected layer implementation targeting digit classification.

In FIRRTL programs, the bit widths of many components are not specified explicitly and must be inferred during compilation.

In this paper, we thoroughly investigate the width inference problem for FIRRTL programs. We show that, if the constraints obtained from a FIRRTL program are satisfiable, there exists a unique least solution. Based on this result, we propose a complete procedure for solving the width inference problem. We implement it in the interactive theorem prover Rocq and prove its functional correctness.

We evaluate this metric in GPT-2-medium across five conditions: structured reasoning, forced repetition, high-temperature noisy sampling, attention-head pruning, and weight-noise injection. Structured reasoning consistently exhibits elevated metric relative to repetitive, noisy, and perturbed regimes, with statistically significant differences confirmed by one-way ANOVA and large effect sizes in key comparisons.

The rostral Pedunculopontine nucleus, a brainstem structure involved in motor control, has been shown to induce transient motor arrest upon optogenetic or electrical stimulation. However, our current understanding of its potential role in linking motor suppression with motivational or reinforcement-related processes is still insufficient. To further explore the effects induced by PPN stimulations and infer the potential mechanism underlying its role involved in both motor and emotional regulation, we developed a fully automated, low-cost system combining real-time animal tracking with closed-loop optogenetic stimulation, using the OpenMV Cam H7 Plus and embedded neural network models. The system autonomously detects the rat's position and triggers optical stimulation upon entry into a predefined region of interest, enabling unbiased, unsupervised behavioral assays. Optogenetic activation of CaMKIIa-expressing neurons in the rostral PPN reliably induced transient motor arrest. When stimulation was consistently paired with a specific location in a conditioned place preference task. When motor arrest was spatially paired with a defined region of interest, rats developed a robust place preference after limited training.

We analyze the tracking performance of Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) and its momentum variants (Polyak heavy-ball and Nesterov) under uniform strong convexity and smoothness in varying stepsize regimes. We derive finite-time bounds in expectation and with high probability for the tracking error, establishing a sharp decomposition into three components: a transient initialization term, a noise-induced variance term, and a drift-induced tracking lag. Crucially, our analysis uncovers a fundamental trade-off: while momentum can suppress gradient noise, it incurs an explicit penalty on the tracking capability. We show that momentum can substantially amplify drift-induced tracking error, with amplification that becomes unbounded as the momentum parameter approaches one, formalizing the intuition that using 'stale' gradients hinders adaptation to rapid regime shifts. Complementing these upper bounds, we establish minimax lower bounds for dynamic regret under gradient-variation constraints. These lower bounds prove that the inertia-induced penalty is not an artifact of analysis but an information-theoretic barrier: in drift-dominated regimes, momentum creates an unavoidable 'inertia window' that fundamentally degrades performance. Collectively, these results provide a definitive theoretical grounding for the empirical instability of momentum in dynamic environments and delineate the precise regime boundaries where SGD provably outperforms its accelerated counterparts.", "AI": {"tldr": "The paper explores the performance trade-offs of SGD and momentum-based methods in nonstationary environments, highlighting a fundamental drawback of momentum in adapting to dynamic changes.", "motivation": "Momentum-based methods are popular in optimization but their effectiveness in dynamic environments remains unclear.

When moving obstacles enter a UAV's sensing region, they are modeled as three dimensional doublets or ellipsoids that generate local velocity fields, guiding nearby UAVs to execute smooth, collision-free maneuvers without trajectory discontinuities or explicit trajectory replanning. This flow-based approach enables real-time operation and interpretable behavior by leveraging the nature of fluid flow around obstacles via the harmonic properties of Laplace's equation, inherently avoiding local minima common in traditional potential field methods. To establish and maintain coordination among the UAVs, a Virtual Rigid Body (VRB) formation strategy is integrated, ensuring that formation geometry and trajectory tracking are preserved.

While digital processing-in-memory (PIM) architectures promise to accelerate GEMV operations, existing PIM-equipped edge devices still suffer from three key limitations: limited bandwidth improvement, component under-utilization in mixed workloads, and low compute capacity of computing units (CUs). In this paper, we propose CD-PIM to address these challenges through three key innovations. First, we introduce a high-bandwidth compute-efficient mode (HBCEM) that enhances bandwidth by dividing each bank into four pseudo-banks through segmented global bitlines. Second, we propose a low-batch interleaving mode (LBIM) to improve component utilization by overlapping GEMV operations with GEMM operations. Third, we design a compute-efficient CU that performs enhanced GEMV operations in a pipelined manner by serially feeding weight data into the computing core. Forth, we adopt a column-wise mapping for the key-cache matrix and row-wise mapping for the value-cache matrix, which fully utilizes CU resources. Our evaluation shows that compared to a GPU-only baseline and state-of-the-art PIM designs, our CD-PIM achieves 11.42x and 4.25x speedup on average within a single batch in HBCEM mode, respectively. Moreover, for low-batch sizes, the CD-PIM achieves an average speedup of 1.12x in LBIM compared to HBCEM.", "AI": {"tldr": "Low-batch large language model edge deployments face memory bandwidth issues during GEMV operations.

We address this problem of stylistically improving designs based on natural language instructions. While VLMs have shown initial success in graphic design, their pretrained knowledge on styles is often too general and misaligned with specific domain data. For example, VLMs may associate minimalism with abstract designs, whereas designers emphasize shape and color choices. Our key insight is to leverage design data -- a collection of real-world designs that implicitly capture designer's principles -- to learn design knowledge and guide stylistic improvement. We propose PRISM (PRior-Informed Stylistic Modification) that constructs and applies a design knowledge base through three stages: (1) clustering high-variance designs to capture diversity within a style, (2) summarizing each cluster into actionable design knowledge, and (3) retrieving relevant knowledge during inference to enable style-aware improvement.

This problem is made worse because many authors disclose only partial or trivial limitations. We propose LimAgents, a multi-agent LLM framework for generating substantive limitations. LimAgents integrates OpenReview comments and author-stated limitations to provide stronger ground truth. It also uses cited and citing papers to capture broader contextual weaknesses. In this setup, different agents have specific roles as sequential role: some extract explicit limitations, others analyze methodological gaps, some simulate the viewpoint of a peer reviewer, and a citation agent places the work within the larger body of literature. A Judge agent refines their outputs, and a Master agent consolidates them into a clear set. This structure allows for systematic identification of explicit, implicit, peer review-focused, and literature-informed limitations. Moreover, traditional NLP metrics like BLEU, ROUGE, and cosine similarity rely heavily on n-gram or embedding overlap. They often overlook semantically similar limitations. To address this, we introduce a pointwise evaluation protocol that uses an LLM-as-a-Judge to measure coverage more accurately. Experiments show that LimAgents substantially improve performance.

However, few approaches explicitly consider the multi-stage nature of bimanual tasks while also emphasizing the importance of inference speed. In multi-stage tasks, failures or delays at any stage can cascade over time, impacting the success and efficiency of subsequent sub-stages and ultimately hindering overall task performance.

In this work, we propose an active 3D reconstruction framework for horticultural environments using a mobile manipulator. The proposed system integrates the classical Octomap representation with 3D Gaussian Splatting to enable accurate and efficient target-aware mapping. While a low-resolution Octomap provides probabilistic occupancy information for informative viewpoint selection and collision-free planning, 3D Gaussian Splatting leverages geometric, photometric, and semantic information to optimize a set of 3D Gaussians for high-fidelity scene reconstruction. We further introduce simple yet effective strategies to enhance robustness against segmentation noise and reduce memory consumption. Simulation experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms purely occupancy-based approaches in both runtime efficiency and reconstruction accuracy, enabling precise fruit counting and volume estimation. Compared to a 0.01m-resolution Octomap, our approach achieves an improvement of 6.6% in fruit-level F1 score under noise-free conditions, and up to 28.6% under segmentation noise.

While this framing has proved powerful in many settings, it sits uneasily with biological and adaptive systems that maintain redundancy, ambiguity, and parallel explanatory processes over extended timescales. Here we propose an alternative perspective, termed polyphonic intelligence, in which coherent behaviour and meaning emerge from the coordination of multiple semi-independent inferential processes operating under shared constraints. Rather than resolving plurality through dominance or collapse, polyphonic systems sustain multiple explanatory trajectories and integrate them through soft alignment, compatibility relations, and bounded influence. We develop this perspective conceptually and formally, introducing a variational framework in which multiple coordinated approximations are maintained without winner-takes-all selection. This formulation makes explicit how plurality can remain stable, tractable, and productive, and clarifies how polyphonic inference differs from ensemble methods, mixture models, and Bayesian model averaging. Through proof-of-principle examples, we demonstrate that non-dominating, pluralistic inference can be implemented in simple computational systems without requiring centralised control or global convergence.

Constant-time programming, which restricts such code patterns, has been widely adopted as a defense against these vulnerabilities.

These prefetchers, unlike classical prefetchers, use the content of memory as well as the trace of prior accesses to determine prefetch targets. An adversary abusing such a prefetcher has been shown to be able to mount attacks leaking data-at-rest; data that is never used by the program, even speculatively, in an unsafe manner.\n  In response, this paper introduces SplittingSecrets, a compiler-based tool that can harden software libraries against side-channels arising from DMPs. SplittingSecrets's approach avoids reasoning about the complex internals of different DMPs and instead relies on one key aspect of all DMPs: activation requires data to resemble addresses. To prevent secret data from leaking, SplittingSecrets transforms memory operations to ensure that secrets are never stored in memory in a manner resembling an address, thereby avoiding DMP activation on those secrets.

However, it is critically challenged by the resource constraints of a single edge node. Distributed inference has emerged to aggregate and leverage computational resources across multiple devices. Yet, existing methods typically require strict synchronization, which is often infeasible due to the unreliable network conditions. In this paper, we propose HALO, a novel framework that can boost the distributed LLM inference in lossy edge network. The core idea is to enable a relaxed yet effective synchronization by strategically allocating less critical neuron groups to unstable devices, thus avoiding the excessive waiting time incurred by delayed packets. HALO introduces three key mechanisms: (1) a semantic-aware predictor to assess the significance of neuron groups prior to activation.

They allow researchers to separate image content from image understanding, making them valuable for studying visual perception. An ideal Mooney image for this purpose achieves a specific balance: it initially appears unrecognizable but becomes fully interpretable to the observer after seeing the original template. Researchers traditionally created these stimuli manually using subjective criteria, which is labor-intensive and can introduce inconsistencies across studies. Automated generation techniques now offer an alternative to this manual approach. Here, we present MooneyMaker, an open-source Python package that automates the generation of ambiguous Mooney images using several complementary approaches. Users can choose between various generation techniques that range from approaches based on image statistics to deep learning models. These models strategically alter edge information to increase initial ambiguity. The package lets users create two-tone images with multiple methods and directly compare the results visually. In an experiment, we validate MooneyMaker by generating Mooney images using different techniques and assess their recognizability for human observers before and after disambiguating them by presenting the template images. Our results reveal that techniques with lower initial recognizability are associated with higher post-template recognition (i.e. a larger disambiguation effect). To help vision scientists build effective databases of Mooney stimuli, we provide practical guidelines for technique selection.

This paper proposes a novel experimental framework to address this by employing Fisher information for differentiable dynamical systems, denoted $g_F^C$. This Fisher information, distinct from its statistical counterpart, measures inherent uncertainties in deterministic systems, such as sensitivity to initial conditions, and is related to the phase space curvature and the net stretching action of the state space evolution. We hypothesize that if a PINN accurately learns the underlying dynamics of a physical system, then the Fisher information landscape derived from the PINN's learned equations of motion will closely match that of the original analytical model.

To address this problem, we develop the Generalized Linear Recourse Bandit (GLRB) algorithm. Building on this foundation, we propose LIBRA, a Language Model-Informed Bandit Recourse Algorithm that strategically combines domain knowledge from LLMs with the statistical rigor of bandit learning. LIBRA offers three key guarantees: (i) a warm-start guarantee, showing that LIBRA significantly reduces initial regret when LLM recommendations are near-optimal; (ii) an LLM-effort guarantee, proving that the algorithm consults the LLM only $O(\\log^2 T)$ times, where $T$ is the time horizon, ensuring long-term autonomy; and (iii) a robustness guarantee, showing that LIBRA never performs worse than a pure bandit algorithm even when the LLM is unreliable. We further establish matching lower bounds that characterize the fundamental difficulty of the recourse bandit problem and demonstrate the near-optimality of our algorithms. Experiments on synthetic environments and a real hypertension-management case study confirm that GLRB and LIBRA improve regret, treatment quality, and sample efficiency compared with standard contextual bandits and LLM-only benchmarks.

Conventional deep learning models often fail to preserve fine topological details or accurately delineate boundaries under these conditions. To address these limitations, we propose a novel deep learning framework, IMSAHLO (Integrating Multi-Scale Attention and Hybrid Loss Optimization), for robust and adaptive neuronal segmentation. The core of our model features Multi-Scale Dense Blocks (MSDBs) to capture features at various receptive fields, effectively handling variations in cell density, and a Hierarchical Attention (HA) mechanism that adaptively focuses on salient morphological features to preserve Region of Interest (ROI) boundary details. Furthermore, we introduce a novel hybrid loss function synergistically combining Tversky and Focal loss to combat class imbalance, alongside a topology-aware Centerline Dice (clDice) loss and a Contour-Weighted Boundary loss to ensure topological continuity and precise separation of adjacent cells. Large-scale experiments on the public Fluorescent Neuronal Cells (FNC) dataset demonstrate that our framework outperforms state-of-the-art architectures, achieving precision of 81.4%, macro F1 score of 82.7%, micro F1 score of 83.3%, and balanced accuracy of 99.5% on difficult dense and sparse cases.

The latter explicitly takes the supervised learning task into account when constructing the pre-processing map. In this work, we study algorithmic fairness for supervised learning and argue that the data fairness approaches impose overly strong regularization from the perspective of the HGR correlation. This motivates us to devise a novel pre-processing approach tailored to supervised learning. We account for the trade-off between fairness and utility in obtaining the pre-processing map.

Despite strong empirical performance, these approaches remain conceptually fragmented, and it is unclear what underlying quantity they are approximating. In this work, we present a unified theoretical framework for PTQ by formalizing activation sensitivity, defined as the expected impact of channel-wise perturbations on the loss.

In this paper, we revisit this problem in an ultra-sparse sampling regime, where each entry of an unknown, $n\\times d$ matrix $M$ (with $n \\ge d$) is observed independently with probability $p = C / d$, for a fixed integer $C \\ge 2$. This setting is motivated by applications involving large, sparse panel datasets, where the number of rows far exceeds the number of columns. When each row contains only $C$ entries -- fewer than the rank of $M$ -- accurate imputation of $M$ is impossible. Instead, we estimate the row span of $M$ or the averaged second-moment matrix $T = M^{\\top} M / n$.\n  The empirical second-moment matrix computed from observed entries exhibits non-random and sparse missingness. We propose an unbiased estimator that normalizes each nonzero entry of the second moment by its observed frequency, followed by gradient descent to impute the missing entries of $T$. The normalization divides a weighted sum of $n$ binomial random variables by the total number of ones. We show that the estimator is unbiased for any $p$ and enjoys low variance. When the row vectors of $M$ are drawn uniformly from a rank-$r$ factor model satisfying an incoherence condition, we prove that if $n \\ge O({d r^5 \u03b5^{-2} C^{-2} \\log d})$, any local minimum of the gradient-descent objective is approximately global and recovers $T$ with error at most $\u03b5^2$.\n  Experiments on both synthetic and real-world data validate our approach.

Starting from the entropy minimization principle, we derive a reliability measure that combines maximum confidence (MC) with residual-class variance (RCV), which characterizes how probability mass is distributed over non-maximum classes. The derivation shows that reliable pseudo-labels should have both high MC and low RCV, and that the influence of RCV increases as confidence grows, thereby correcting overconfident but unstable predictions.

Recent research has attempted to leverage historical bugs to design new mutation operators or fine-tune models to increase program diversity for compiler fuzzing.We observe, however, that bugs manifest primarily based on the semantics of input programs rather than their syntax. Unfortunately, current approaches, whether relying on syntactic mutation or general Large Language Model (LLM) fine-tuning, struggle to preserve the specific semantics found in the logic of bug-triggering programs. Consequently, these critical semantic triggers are often lost, resulting in a limitation of the diversity of generated programs.\n  To explicitly reuse such semantics, we propose FeatureFuzz, a compiler fuzzer that combines features to generate programs. We define a feature as a decoupled primitive that encapsulates a natural language description of a bug-prone invariant, such as an out-of-bounds array access, alongside a concrete code witness of its realization. FeatureFuzz operates via a three-stage workflow: it first extracts features from historical bug reports, synthesizes coherent groups of features, and finally instantiates these groups into valid programs for compiler fuzzing.\n  We evaluated FeatureFuzz on GCC and LLVM. Over 24-hour campaigns, FeatureFuzz uncovered 167 unique crashes, which is 2.78x more than the second-best fuzzer.

However, achieving reliable navigation remains a significant challenge. Existing solutions often rely on artificial muscles integrated into the robot body or active tip-steering mechanisms. While effective, these additions introduce structural complexity and compromise the defining advantages of eversion robots: their inherent softness and compliance. In this paper, we propose a passive approach to reduce bending stiffness by purposefully introducing buckling points along the robot's outer wall. We achieve this by integrating inextensible diameter-reducing circumferential bands at regular intervals along the robot body facilitating forward motion through tortuous, obstacle cluttered paths. Rather than relying on active steering, our approach leverages the robot's natural interaction with the environment, allowing for smooth, compliant navigation. We present a Cosserat rod-based mathematical model to quantify this behavior, capturing the local stiffness reductions caused by the constricting bands and their impact on global bending mechanics. Experimental results demonstrate that these bands reduce the robot's stiffness when bent at the tip by up to 91 percent, enabling consistent traversal of 180 degree bends with a bending radius of as low as 25 mm-notably lower than the 35 mm achievable by standard eversion robots under identical conditions.

A recent trend is to develop RL systems with a fully disaggregated architecture, which decouples the three RL phases (rollout, reward, and training) onto separate resources and executes them asynchronously. However, two critical data-level concerns arise: (1) asynchronous execution leads to data staleness in trajectories (the data generated by rollout) as the model parameters used in rollout may not be up to date, which impairs RL convergence; and (2) the length variation of trajectories introduces severe data skewness, leading to workload imbalance and degraded system performance.\n  Existing systems fail to address these two concerns in a unified manner. Techniques that tightly control data staleness often constrain effective data skewness mitigation, while aggressive data skewness mitigation tends to exacerbate data staleness. As a result, systems are forced to trade off convergence for performance, or vice versa. To address this, we propose StaleFlow, an RL post-training system that jointly tackles data staleness and skewness. First, to control staleness, StaleFlow introduces a global consistency protocol that tracks the full lifecycle of each trajectory and constrains staleness. Second, to mitigate skewness, StaleFlow re-designs the RL system architecture by constructing data servers for trajectories and parameters to achieve flexible rollout coordination. Subsequently, we develop a suite of staleness-aware, throughput-oriented strategies to enhance system performance.

Standard methods combine matrix-vector products with polynomial approximations. We study a different model: access to trace powers $p_k = \\tr(A^k)$, natural when matrix powers are available.\n  Classical moment-based approximations Taylor-expand $\\log(\u03bb)$ around the arithmetic mean. This requires $|\u03bb- \\AM| < \\AM$ and diverges when $\u03ba> 4$. We work instead with the moment-generating function $M(t) = \\E[X^t]$ for normalized eigenvalues $X = \u03bb/\\AM$.

Trace powers give $M(k)$ at positive integers, but interpolating $M(t)$ directly is ill-conditioned due to exponential growth. The transform $K(t) = \\log M(t)$ compresses this range. Normalization by $\\AM$ ensures $K(0) = K(1) = 0$. With these anchors fixed, we interpolate $K$ through $m+1$ consecutive integers and differentiate to estimate $K'(0)$. However, this local interpolation cannot capture arbitrary spectral features.\n  We prove a fundamental limit: no continuous estimator using finitely many positive moments can be uniformly accurate over unbounded conditioning. Positive moments downweight the spectral tail; $K'(0) = \\E[\\log X]$ is tail-sensitive. This motivates guaranteed bounds. From the same traces we derive upper bounds on $(\\det A)^{1/n}$.

This phenomenon describes the behavior of gradient alignment in SGD updates. Specifically, during the initial phase of SGD updates, the alignment between the gradient and the dominant subspace tends to decrease. Subsequently, it enters a rising phase and eventually stabilizes in a high-alignment phase. The alignment is considered ``suspicious'' because, paradoxically, the projected gradient update along this highly-aligned dominant subspace proves ineffective at reducing the loss. The focus of this work is to give a fine-grained analysis in a high-dimensional quadratic setup about how step size selection produces this phenomenon. Our main contribution can be summarized as follows: We propose a step-size condition revealing that in low-alignment regimes, an adaptive critical step size $\u03b7_t^*$ separates alignment-decreasing ($\u03b7_t < \u03b7_t^*$) from alignment-increasing ($\u03b7_t > \u03b7_t^*$) regimes, whereas in high-alignment regimes, the alignment is self-correcting and decreases regardless of the step size. We further show that under sufficient ill-conditioning, a step size interval exists where projecting the SGD updates to the bulk space decreases the loss while projecting them to the dominant space increases the loss, which explains a recent empirical observation that projecting gradient updates to the dominant subspace is ineffective. Finally, based on this adaptive step-size theory, we prove that for a constant step size and large initialization, SGD exhibits this distinct two-phase behavior: an initial alignment-decreasing phase, followed by stabilization at high alignment.", "AI": {"tldr": "The paper studies the suspicious gradient alignment behavior in stochastic gradient descent (SGD) during ill-conditioned optimization, analyzing its phases and impact using step-size conditions.", "motivation": "To understand why during ill-conditioned optimization, the alignment of gradients with the dominant subspace in SGD behaves in a counterintuitive and 'ineffective' manner.", "method": "A high-dimensional quadratic analysis of step-size conditions and their effect on gradient alignment behavior in SGD under ill-conditioned settings.", "result": "The paper identifies step-size conditions that drive phase changes in gradient alignment and explains the ineffectiveness of gradient projections in certain subspaces under ill-conditioning.", "conclusion": "SGD alignment behavior transitions from low to high alignment due to step-size effects.

We propose a novel approach to the SSDG problem by aligning the intermediate features of our model with the semantically rich and generalized feature space of a Vision Language Model (VLM) in a way that promotes domain-invariance. The above approach is enhanced with effective image-level augmentation and output-level regularization strategies to improve data utilization and minimize overfitting.

In this work, we draw inspiration from the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) architecture to design a Multi-Agent System called LSTM-MAS, emulating LSTM's hierarchical information flow and gated memory mechanisms for long-context understanding. Specifically, LSTM-MAS organizes agents in a chained architecture, where each node comprises a worker agent for segment-level comprehension, a filter agent for redundancy reduction, a judge agent for continuous error detection, and a manager agent for globally regulates information propagation and retention, analogous to LSTM and its input gate, forget gate, constant error carousel unit, and output gate. These novel designs enable controlled information transfer and selective long-term dependency modeling across textual segments, which can effectively avoid error accumulation and hallucination propagation. We conducted an extensive evaluation of our method. Compared with the previous best multi-agent approach, CoA, our model achieves improvements of 40.93%, 43.70%,121.57% and 33.12%, on NarrativeQA, Qasper, HotpotQA, and MuSiQue, respectively.", "AI": {"tldr": "This paper introduces LSTM-MAS, a Multi-Agent System inspired by LSTM architecture to enhance long-context understanding in large language models, improving results significantly on several benchmarks.", "motivation": "The motivation is to solve the challenge of processing long contexts in large language models (LLMs) by overcoming limitations of existing single-LLM methods and multi-agent frameworks that are prone to errors and hallucinations.", "method": "The method involves designing a Multi-Agent System (LSTM-MAS) with hierarchical information flow and gated memory mechanisms, organized in a chained agent architecture that mimics LSTM principles.", "result": "LSTM-MAS demonstrated significant improvement over a previous multi-agent approach (CoA) on benchmark datasets, with marked increases in performance across multiple tasks.", "conclusion": "The paper concludes that the novel LSTM-MAS framework effectively addresses long-context comprehension challenges while reducing error accumulation and hallucination propagation."}}

This paper investigates how LLMs can automatically generate such annotations for programs written in Dafny, a verification-aware programming language, starting from conventional code accompanied by natural language specifications (in comments) and test code. In experiments on 110 Dafny programs, a multimodel approach combining Claude Opus 4.5 and GPT-5.2 generated correct annotations for 98.2% of the programs within at most 8 repair iterations, using verifier feedback.

In this work, we show that the activation pattern of a SOM - the squared distances to its prototypes - can be inverted to recover the exact input under mild geometric conditions. This follows from a classical fact in Euclidean distance geometry: a point in $D$ dimensions is uniquely determined by its distances to $D{+}1$ affinely independent references. We derive the corresponding linear system and characterize the conditions under which the inversion is well-posed. Building upon this mechanism, we introduce the Manifold-Aware Unified SOM Inversion and Control (MUSIC) update rule, which enables controlled, semantically meaningful trajectories in latent space. MUSIC modifies squared distances to selected prototypes while preserving others, resulting in a deterministic geometric flow aligned with the SOM's piecewise-linear structure. Tikhonov regularization stabilizes the update rule and ensures smooth motion on high-dimensional datasets. Unlike variational or probabilistic generative models, MUSIC does not rely on sampling, latent priors, or encoder-decoder architectures. If no perturbation is applied, inversion recovers the exact input; when a target cluster or prototype is specified, MUSIC produces coherent semantic variations while remaining on the data manifold. This leads to a new perspective on data augmentation and controllable latent exploration based solely on prototype geometry. We validate the approach using synthetic Gaussian mixtures, the MNIST and the Faces in the Wild dataset.

Candidate behaviours are executed under real resource constraints, and only those whose environmental effects both persist and preserve the possibility of future interaction are propagated. The environment does not provide semantic feedback, dense rewards, or task-specific supervision; selection operates solely through differential survival of behaviours as world-altering events, making proxy optimisation impossible and rendering reward-hacking evolutionarily unstable.\n  Analysis of semantic dynamics shows that improvement arises primarily through the persistence of effective and repeatable strategies under a regime of consolidation and pruning, a paradigm we refer to as negative-space learning (NSL), and that models develop meta-learning strategies (such as deliberate experimental failure in order to elicit informative error messages) without explicit instruction.

In each of $T$ rounds, each of $N$ agents selects an arm, the environment generates a clean reward vector, and an adversary perturbs the observed feedback subject to a global corruption budget $\u0393$. Performance is measured by team regret under a coordinate-wise nondecreasing, $L$-Lipschitz scalarization $\u03c6$, covering linear, Chebyshev, and smooth monotone utilities. Our main contribution is a communication-corruption coupling: we show that a fixed environment-side budget $\u0393$ can translate into an effective corruption level ranging from $\u0393$ to $N\u0393$, depending on whether agents share raw samples, sufficient statistics, or only arm recommendations. We formalize this via a protocol-induced multiplicity functional and prove regret bounds parameterized by the resulting effective corruption. As corollaries, raw-sample sharing can suffer an $N$-fold larger additive corruption penalty, whereas summary sharing and recommendation-only sharing preserve an unamplified $O(\u0393)$ term and achieve centralized-rate team regret.

Effective optimization requires exploiting the first-order information of the critic, but it is challenging to do so for flow or diffusion policies because direct gradient-based optimization via backpropagation through their multi-step denoising process is numerically unstable. Existing methods work around this either by only using the value and discarding the gradient information, or by relying on approximations that sacrifice policy expressivity or bias the learned policy. QAM sidesteps both of these challenges by leveraging adjoint matching, a recently proposed technique in generative modeling, which transforms the critic's action gradient to form a step-wise objective function that is free from unstable backpropagation, while providing an unbiased, expressive policy at the optimum.

To address this issue, we propose the Memory-driven Intrinsic Cost Estimation (MICE) method, which introduces intrinsic costs to mitigate underestimation and control bias to promote safer exploration. Inspired by flashbulb memory, where humans vividly recall dangerous experiences to avoid risks, MICE constructs a memory module that stores previously explored unsafe states to identify high-cost regions.

In this survey, we organize agentic reasoning along three complementary dimensions. First, we characterize environmental dynamics through three layers: foundational agentic reasoning, which establishes core single-agent capabilities including planning, tool use, and search in stable environments; self-evolving agentic reasoning, which studies how agents refine these capabilities through feedback, memory, and adaptation; and collective multi-agent reasoning, which extends intelligence to collaborative settings involving coordination, knowledge sharing, and shared goals. Across these layers, we distinguish in-context reasoning, which scales test-time interaction through structured orchestration, from post-training reasoning, which optimizes behaviors via reinforcement learning and supervised fine-tuning. We further review representative agentic reasoning frameworks across real-world applications and benchmarks, including science, robotics, healthcare, autonomous research, and mathematics.

We provide a normative rationale for why such algorithms are not merely bounded rationality shortcuts, but can be epistemically preferred in medicine. First, many clinical trade-offs are constructed through human judgment and are only weakly measurable on absolute scales; without strong measurement axioms, only orderings are invariant, motivating an ordinal-by-default stance. Second, preference and signal elicitation are structurally crude: The mapping from truth $\\to$ perception $\\to$ inference $\\to$ recorded variables introduces layered noise, leaving a persistent uncertainty floor. When this 'crudeness' overwhelms the decision margin, plug-in expected-utility optimization becomes brittle (high flip probability under small perturbations), whereas robust dominance/filtering rules ($\u03b5$-dominance, maximin) stabilize decisions.Finally, we outline a clinician-aligned AI blueprint: Use rich models for beliefs and trajectories, but choose actions through robust ordinal rules; treat heuristics as the low-dimensional special case; and deploy AI as 'selective complexity' -- invoked mainly for tie-breaking when decisions are fragile and information has positive expected impact.", "AI": {"tldr": "The paper argues clinical reasoning is more about ordinal decision-making rather than cardinal optimization, and proposes an AI framework aligned with clinicians' decision-making processes.", "motivation": "Clinical AI systems focus on prediction, but real clinical reasoning involves sequential decision-making under uncertainty.

Serving a request requires loading the pre-computed prefix KV cache and generating the first token, defined as the Re-Prefill Phase. Offloading this shared prefix cache to secondary storage is essential for memory scalability. Re-Prefill with offloading suffers from severe I/O bottlenecks in two aspects. First, semantic-aware KV cache pruning algorithms select important tokens in fine granularity, while systems manage I/O in coarse, fixed-size blocks, causing severe read amplification. Second, the sequential dependency between identifying important tokens and loading KV cache creates idle I/O and compute bubbles, under-utilizing system resources.\n  This paper proposes \\textit{ContiguousKV}, a high-performance prefix KV cache offloading system that bridges algorithmic semantics with I/O efficiency to accelerate the Re-Prefill phase. We first introduce \\textit{ContiguousChunk}, a unified data management granularity that aligns KV cache pruning with I/O operations. All the mechanisms critical for I/O performance are performed at the granularity of ContiguousChunk, thereby eliminating read amplification.

Because Theory of Mind (ToM) tasks crucially depend on reasoning about latent mental states of oneself and others, such models are therefore often thought to fail at ToM. While post-training methods can improve ToM performance, we show that strong ToM capability can be recovered directly from the base model without any additional weight updates or verifications.

In this paper, we introduce Detect, a feature-aware test generation framework for vision-based deep learning (DL) models that systematically generates inputs by perturbing disentangled semantic attributes within the latent space. Detect perturbs individual latent features in a controlled way and observes how these changes affect the model's output.

By distinguishing between task-relevant and irrelevant features, Detect applies feature-aware perturbations targeted for both generalization and robustness.

However, existing mitigation strategies tend towards an image-centric interpretation of these imbalances, often prioritising increased image attention while giving less consideration to the roles of the other modalities. In this study, we evaluate a more holistic, system-mediated account, which attributes these imbalances to functionally redundant system weights that reduce attention to image and textual inputs. We show that this framework offers a useful empirical perspective on the yes-bias, a common form of hallucination in which VLMs indiscriminately respond 'yes'.

Each scenario incorporates realistic mixtures of driving behaviors and provides explicit annotations that are largely absent from existing datasets. Unlike randomly sampled simulation data, this structured design enables precise analysis of how different conditions influence trajectory prediction performance. Validation experiments using standard baselines (LSTM, GCN, GRU+GCN) reveal traffic density dominates prediction difficulty with strong monotonic effects, while weather shows non-linear impacts. The best model achieves 0.312m ADE on real-world rounD dataset, demonstrating effective sim-to-real transfer.

Recent progress in LLM-agent-based kernel generation and optimization has been reported, yet many approaches primarily focus on direct code rewriting, where parameter choices are often implicit and hard to control, or require human intervention, leading to unstable performance gains. This paper introduces a template-based rewriting layer on top of an agent-driven iterative loop: kernels are semantically refactored into explicitly parameterizable templates, and template parameters are then optimized via search-based autotuning, yielding more stable and higher-quality speedups. Experiments on a set of real-world kernels demonstrate speedups exceeding 3x in the best case.

In this work, we demonstrate that even robustly safeguarded models can be used to elicit harmful capabilities in open-source models through elicitation attacks. Our elicitation attacks consist of three stages: (i) constructing prompts in adjacent domains to a target harmful task that do not request dangerous information; (ii) obtaining responses to these prompts from safeguarded frontier models; (iii) fine-tuning open-source models on these prompt-output pairs. Since the requested prompts cannot be used to directly cause harm, they are not refused by frontier model safeguards.

The report provides a detailed state of the art of existing transcription conventions (ICOR, Mondada, GARS, VALIBEL, Ferr{\u00e9}), highlighting their respective strengths and limitations when applied to multimodal classroom data. Through comparative analyses of manually transcribed sequences, the project demonstrates the inevitable variability and interpretative dimension of transcription practices, depending on theoretical positioning and analytical goals. Empirical work is based on several corpora, notably the INTER-EXPLIC corpus (approximately 30 hours of classroom interaction) and the EXPLIC-LEXIC corpus, which serve both as testing grounds for manual annotation and as reference datasets for future automation. Particular attention is paid to teacher gestures (kin{\u00e9}sic and proxemic resources), prosodic features, and their functional role in meaning construction and learner comprehension. The project also highlights the strategic role of the Techn{\u00e9}LAB platform, which provides advanced multimodal data capture (multi-camera video, synchronized audio, eye-tracking, digital interaction traces) and constitutes both a research infrastructure and a test environment for the development of automated tools. In conclusion, TRAIMA does not aim to deliver a fully operational automated system, but rather to establish a rigorous methodological framework for the automatic processing of multimodal pedagogical interactions. The project identifies transcription conventions, annotation categories, and analytical units that are compatible with machine learning approaches, while emphasizing the need for theoretical explicitness and researcher reflexivity.

To address this, we present DistilTS, the first distillation framework specifically designed for TSFMs. DistilTS addresses two key challenges: (1) task difficulty discrepancy, specific to forecasting, where uniform weighting makes optimization dominated by easier short-term horizons, while long-term horizons receive weaker supervision; and (2) architecture discrepancy, a general challenge in distillation, for which we design an alignment mechanism in the time series forecasting. To overcome these issues, DistilTS introduces horizon-weighted objectives to balance learning across horizons, and a temporal alignment strategy that reduces architectural mismatch, enabling compact models.

This requirement is particularly prohibitive in the social domain, where obtaining expert labels for sensitive or evolving content is costly and slow. Furthermore, standard graph instruction tuning fails to exploit the vast amount of unlabeled nodes, which contain latent correlations due to edge connections that are beneficial for downstream predictions. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel Semi-supervised Instruction Tuning pipeline for Graph Learning, named SIT-Graph. Notably, SIT-Graph is model-agnostic and can be seamlessly integrated into any graph instruction tuning method that utilizes LLMs as the predictor. SIT-Graph operates via an iterative self-training process. Initially, the model is fine-tuned using instruction pairs constructed solely from the labeled nodes. Then it generates confidence-filtered pseudo-responses for unlabeled nodes to strategically augment the dataset for the next round of fine-tuning.

To address this, we introduce OpenExempt, a framework and benchmark for diagnostic evaluation of legal reasoning.

A common strategy is to integrate single-image super-resolution (SR) before detection; however, such serial pipelines often suffer from misaligned optimization objectives, feature redundancy, and a lack of effective interaction between SR and detection. To address these issues, we propose a Saliency-Driven multi-task Collaborative Network (SDCoNet) that couples SR and detection through implicit feature sharing while preserving task specificity. SDCoNet employs the swin transformer-based shared encoder, where hierarchical window-shifted self-attention supports cross-task feature collaboration and adaptively balances the trade-off between texture refinement and semantic representation. In addition, a multi-scale saliency prediction module produces importance scores to select key tokens, enabling focused attention on weak object regions, suppression of background clutter, and suppression of adverse features introduced by multi-task coupling. Furthermore, a gradient routing strategy is introduced to mitigate optimization conflicts. It first stabilizes detection semantics and subsequently routes SR gradients along a detection-oriented direction, enabling the framework to guide the SR branch to generate high-frequency details that are explicitly beneficial for detection.

Classic techniques offer precise and rapid deformation control. However, they solve an optimization problem with constraints defined by control handle placement, requiring a user to know apriori the ideal distribution of handles on the shape to accomplish the desired edit. The mapping from handle set to deformation behavior is often unintuitive and, importantly, non-semantic. Modern data-driven methods, on the other hand, leverage a data prior to obtain semantic edits, but are slow and imprecise. We propose a technique that fuses the semantic prior of data with the precise control and speed of traditional frameworks. Our approach is surprisingly simple yet effective: deep feature proximity makes for smooth and semantic deformation weights, with no need for additional regularization. The weights can be computed in real-time for any surface point, whereas prior methods require optimization for new handles. Moreover, the semantic prior from deep features enables co-deformation of semantic parts. We introduce an improved feature distillation pipeline, barycentric feature distillation, which efficiently uses the visual signal from shape renders to minimize distillation cost.

Instead of relying on rule-based interactions, agents can now interact in flexible ways akin to humans. However, this flexibility quickly becomes a problem in fields where errors can be disastrous, such as in a pharmacy context, but the opposite also holds true; a system that is too inflexible will also lead to errors, as it can become too rigid to handle situations that are not accounted for. Work using LLMs in a pharmacy context have adopted a wide scope, accounting for many different medications in brief interactions -- our strategy is the opposite: focus on a more narrow and long task. This not only enables a greater understanding of the task at hand, but also provides insight into what challenges are present in an interaction of longer nature. The main challenge, however, remains the same for a narrow and wide system: it needs to strike a balance between adherence to conversational requirements and flexibility. In an effort to strike such a balance, we present a prototype system meant to provide medication counseling while juggling these two extremes. We also cover our design in constructing such a system, with a focus on methods aiming to fulfill conversation requirements, reduce hallucinations and promote high-quality responses.

To address this gap, we introduce a pruning strategy that utilizes attention weights to identify tokens emphasized at different stages and estimates their importance. Building on this analysis, FastAV applies a two-stage pruning strategy: (1) global pruning in intermediate layers to remove broadly less influential tokens, and (2) fine pruning in later layers considering the impact on next token generation. Notably, our method does not rely on full attention maps, which makes it fully compatible with efficient attention mechanisms such as FlashAttention.

One of the identified biases is language bias, which indicates that the decision of LLM-as-a-judge can differ based on the language of the judged texts. In this paper, we study two types of language bias in pairwise LLM-as-a-judge: (1) performance disparity between languages when the judge is prompted to compare options from the same language, and (2) bias towards options written in major languages when the judge is prompted to compare options of two different languages. We find that for same-language judging, there exist significant performance disparities across language families, with European languages consistently outperforming African languages, and this bias is more pronounced in culturally-related subjects. For inter-language judging, we observe that most models favor English answers, and that this preference is influenced more by answer language than question language.

Existing static compression methods often fail to preserve globally important information, principally because they overlook the attention drift phenomenon where token significance evolves dynamically. Although recent dynamic retrieval approaches attempt to address this issue, they typically suffer from coarse-grained caching strategies and incur high I/O overhead due to frequent data transfers. To overcome these limitations, we propose HeteroCache, a training-free dynamic compression framework. Our method is built on two key insights: attention heads exhibit diverse temporal heterogeneity, and there is significant spatial redundancy among heads within the same layer.

Consequently, we apply a fine-grained weighting strategy that allocates larger cache budgets to heads with rapidly shifting attention to capture context changes, thereby addressing the inefficiency of coarse-grained strategies. Furthermore, we employ a hierarchical storage mechanism in which a subset of representative heads monitors attention shift, and trigger an asynchronous, on-demand retrieval of contexts from the CPU, effectively hiding I/O latency.

However, this paradigm encounters critical challenges when applied to vision-language models (VLM) (e.g., CLIP): constructing adversarially robust teacher for large-scale multi-modal models demands prohibitively high computational resources. We bridge this gap by revealing an interesting phenomenon: vanilla CLIP (without adversarial training) exhibits intrinsic defensive capabilities against adversarial examples generated by another CLIP with different architectures. We formally define this as proxy adversarial robustness, and naturally propose a Heterogeneous Proxy Transfer (HPT) framework that establishes cross-architectural robustness distillation channels between CLIP variants, effortlessly enabling the VLM robustness transfer from proxy to target models. Yet, such proxy transfer paradigm easily induces severe overfitting, leading to a sharp degradation in zero-shot natural generalization. To resolve that, we design Generalization-Pivot Decoupling (GPD) by leveraging the difference in learning rate scheduling. This decouples the proxy transfer process into a generalization-anchored warm-up that maintains generalization and a generalization-pulled HPT that promotes adversarial robustness, to achieve an equilibrium between natural generalization and adversarial robustness.

However, existing K-adaptive methods still suffer from two limitations. First, they do not explicitly constrain slot-binding quality, so low-quality slots lead to ambiguous feature attribution. Second, adding a slot-count penalty to the reconstruction objective creates conflicting optimization goals between reducing the number of active slots and maintaining reconstruction fidelity. As a result, they still lag significantly behind strong K-fixed baselines. To address these challenges, we propose Quality-Guided K-Adaptive Slot Attention (QASA).

However, despite the use of hardware- or software-based synchronization algorithms, perfect synchrony is rarely guaranteed: Sensors may operate at different frequencies, and real-world factors such as network latency, hardware failures, or processing bottlenecks often introduce time offsets between sensors. Such asynchrony degrades perception performance, especially for dynamic objects. To address this challenge, we propose AsyncBEV, a trainable lightweight and generic module to improve the robustness of 3D Birds' Eye View (BEV) object detection models against sensor asynchrony. Inspired by scene flow estimation, AsyncBEV first estimates the 2D flow from the BEV features of two different sensor modalities, taking into account the known time offset between these sensor measurements. The predicted feature flow is then used to warp and spatially align the feature maps, which we show can easily be integrated into different current BEV detector architectures (e.g., BEV grid-based and token-based). Extensive experiments demonstrate AsyncBEV improves robustness against both small and large asynchrony between LiDAR or camera sensors in both the token-based CMT and grid-based UniBEV, especially for dynamic objects.

Building on these insights, we propose a routing-guided steering method that adaptively guides routing behavior in middle layers toward shared experts associated with dominant languages at inference time, leading to consistent multilingual performance improvements, particularly for linguistically related language pairs.

This renders standard weight-privatization methods (e.g. DP-SGD) unnecessarily noisy at the cost of utility. While model weights may vary significantly across training datasets, model responses to specific inputs are much lower dimensional and more stable. This motivates enforcing privacy guarantees directly on model outputs.\n  We approach this under PAC privacy, which provides instance-based privacy guarantees for arbitrary black-box functions by controlling mutual information (MI). Importantly, PAC privacy explicitly rewards output stability with reduced noise levels. However, a central challenge remains: response privacy requires composing a large number of adaptively chosen, potentially adversarial queries issued by untrusted users, where existing composition results on PAC privacy are inadequate. We introduce a new algorithm that achieves adversarial composition via adaptive noise calibration and prove that mutual information guarantees accumulate linearly under adaptive and adversarial querying.\n  Experiments across tabular, vision, and NLP tasks show that our method achieves high utility at extremely small per-query privacy budgets. On CIFAR-10, we achieve 87.79% accuracy with a per-step MI budget of $2^{-32}$. This enables serving one million queries while provably bounding membership inference attack (MIA) success rates to 51.08% -- the same guarantee of $(0.04, 10^{-5})$-DP. Furthermore, we show that private responses can be used to label public data to distill a publishable privacy-preserving model; using an ImageNet subset as a public dataset, our model distilled from 210,000 responses achieves 91.86% accuracy on CIFAR-10 with MIA success upper-bounded by 50.49%, which is comparable to $(0.02,10^{-5})$-DP.", "AI": {"tldr": "This paper addresses privacy in machine learning APIs by enforcing privacy guarantees directly on model outputs using PAC privacy, introducing an algorithm for adversarial composition, and achieving high model utility with provably bound privacy risks.", "motivation": "Although traditional weight-privatization methods ensure privacy, they can introduce unnecessary noise and reduce utility, especially in API-deployed ML models.

Causal feature selection can enhance the performance of soft sensor models in industrial applications. However, existing methods ignore two critical characteristics of industrial processes. Firstly, causal relationships between variables always involve time delays, whereas most causal feature selection methods investigate causal relationships in the same time dimension. Secondly, variables in industrial processes are often interdependent, which contradicts the decorrelation assumption of traditional causal inference methods. Consequently, soft sensor models based on existing causal feature selection approaches often lack sufficient accuracy and stability. To overcome these challenges, this paper proposes a causal feature selection framework based on time-delayed cross mapping. Time-delayed cross mapping employs state space reconstruction to effectively handle interdependent variables in causality analysis, and considers varying causal strength across time delay. Time-delayed convergent cross mapping (TDCCM) is introduced for total causal inference, and time-delayed partial cross mapping (TDPCM) is developed for direct causal inference. Then, in order to achieve automatic feature selection, an objective feature selection strategy is presented. The causal threshold is automatically determined based on the model performance on the validation set, and the causal features are then selected.

Despite the importance of such blended emotions, most video-based emotion recognition approaches are designed to recognize single emotions only.

This limitation largely stems from the lack of datasets containing a substantial number of blended emotion samples annotated with relative salience. To address this shortcoming, we introduce BLEMORE, a novel dataset for multimodal (video, audio) blended emotion recognition that includes information on the relative salience of each emotion within a blend. BLEMORE comprises over 3,000 clips from 58 actors, performing 6 basic emotions and 10 distinct blends, where each blend has 3 different salience configurations (50/50, 70/30, and 30/70).

However, these benefits may be negated when customers drive to pick up their orders. This study proposes a Differentiated Pickup Point Offering (DPO) policy that aims to jointly reduce emissions from delivery truck routes and customer travel. Under DPO, each arriving customer is offered a single recommended pickup point, rather than an unrestricted choice among all locations, while retaining the option of home delivery. We study this problem in a dynamic and stochastic setting, where the pickup point offered to each customer depends on previously realized customer locations and delivery choices. To design effective DPO policies, we adopt a reinforcement learning-based approach that accounts for spatial relationships between customers and pickup points and their implications for future route consolidation. Computational experiments show that differentiated pickup point offerings can substantially reduce total carbon emissions. The proposed policies reduce total emissions by up to 9% relative to home-only delivery and by 2% on average compared with alternative policies, including unrestricted pickup point choice and nearest pickup point assignment.

We refer to this failure mode as the problem of credit assignment. While a natural remedy is to train a process reward model, accurately optimizing such models to identify corrective reasoning steps remains challenging. We introduce Intervention Training (InT), a training paradigm in which the model performs fine-grained credit assignment on its own reasoning traces by proposing short, targeted corrections that steer trajectories toward higher reward. Using reference solutions commonly available in mathematical reasoning datasets and exploiting the fact that verifying a model-generated solution is easier than generating a correct one from scratch, the model identifies the first error in its reasoning and proposes a single-step intervention to redirect the trajectory toward the correct solution. We then apply supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to the on-policy rollout up to the point of error concatenated with the intervention, localizing error to the specific step that caused failure. We show that the resulting model serves as a far better initialization for RL training.

Building on this, we first propose the Spherical Geometry Representation, a novel face representation that anchors geometric signals to uniform spherical coordinates. This guarantees a regular point distribution, from which the mesh connectivity can be robustly reconstructed. Critically, this canonical sphere can be seamlessly unwrapped into a 2D map, creating a perfect synergy with powerful 2D generative models. We then introduce Spherical Geometry Diffusion, a conditional diffusion framework built upon this 2D map. It enables diverse and controllable generation by jointly modeling geometry and texture, where the geometry explicitly conditions the texture synthesis process.

However, existing work has mainly focused on efficiency and performance, while the security implications of visual token compression remain largely unexplored. In this work, we first reveal that visual token compression substantially degrades the robustness of LVLMs: models that are robust under uncompressed inference become highly vulnerable once compression is enabled. These vulnerabilities are state-specific; failure modes emerge only in the compressed setting and completely disappear when compression is disabled, making them particularly hidden and difficult to diagnose. By analyzing the key stages of the compression process, we identify instability in token importance ranking as the primary cause of this robustness degradation. Small and imperceptible perturbations can significantly alter token rankings, leading the compression mechanism to mistakenly discard task-critical information and ultimately causing model failure. Motivated by this observation, we propose a Compression-Aware Attack to systematically study and exploit this vulnerability. CAA directly targets the token selection mechanism and induces failures exclusively under compressed inference. We further extend this approach to more realistic black-box settings and introduce Transfer CAA, where neither the target model nor the compression configuration is accessible.

Vision encoders compress images through patch embeddings, reducing spatial indexing and losing the precise pixel-level tracking required for accurate counting. We present two contributions to address this fundamental limitation. First, we introduce SQuID (Satellite Quantitative Intelligence Dataset), a benchmark of 2,000 satellite image Question-Answer pairs with both numerical range and categorical answers, designed to evaluate quantitative spatial reasoning. The dataset spans three difficulty tiers with annotations automatically generated from human labels and their learned variability. Second, we propose QVLM (Quantitative Vision-Language Model), a code-generation architecture that maintains pixel precision by decoupling language understanding from visual analysis. Instead of encoding images into embeddings, QVLM generates executable code that first calls a segmentation model to obtain pixel-level masks, then operates directly on these masks, preserving spatial indexing throughout the reasoning process. Our experiments show that QVLM using GPT-5 as coder achieves 42.0% accuracy on SQuID compared to 28.1% for a VLM prompted with image-question pairs. Our work reveals that, for quantitative spatial reasoning, architectural decoupling enables better accuracy on quantitative tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "Current VLMs struggle with quantitative spatial reasoning due to pixel-level information loss.

This strategy enables parameter sharing and efficient reconstruction and has been widely adopted across domains ranging from multi-view learning and signal processing to neural network compression. However, it leaves a fundamental question unanswered: which matrices can be safely concatenated and compressed together under explicit reconstruction error constraints? Existing approaches rely on heuristic or architecture-specific grouping and provide no principled guarantees on the resulting SVD approximation error. In the present work, we introduce a theory-driven framework for compression-aware clustering of matrices under SVD compression constraints. Our analysis establishes new spectral bounds for horizontally concatenated matrices, deriving global upper bounds on the optimal rank-$r$ SVD reconstruction error from lower bounds on singular value growth. The first bound follows from Weyl-type monotonicity under blockwise extensions, while the second leverages singular values of incremental residuals to yield tighter, per-block guarantees. We further develop an efficient approximate estimator based on incremental truncated SVD that tracks dominant singular values without forming the full concatenated matrix. Therefore, we propose three clustering algorithms that merge matrices only when their predicted joint SVD compression error remains below a user-specified threshold.

The challenge is exacerbated by the RS highly heterogeneous data and huge scale variation. Consequently, paradigms proven effective in other domains often fail when confronted with these unique data characteristics. Conventional disentanglement learning, which relies on significant feature overlap between modalities (modality-invariant), is insufficient for this heterogeneity. Similarly, knowledge distillation becomes an ill-posed mimicry task where a student fails to focus on the necessary compensatory knowledge, leaving the semantic gap unaddressed. Our work is therefore built upon three pillars uniquely designed for RS: (1) principled missing information compensation, (2) class-specific modality contribution, and (3) multi-resolution feature importance. We propose a novel method DIS2, a new paradigm shifting from modality-shared feature dependence and untargeted imitation to active, guided missing features compensation. Its core novelty lies in a reformulated synergy between disentanglement learning and knowledge distillation, termed DLKD. Compensatory features are explicitly captured which, when fused with the features of the available modality, approximate the ideal fused representation of the full-modality case. To address the class-specific challenge, our Classwise Feature Learning Module (CFLM) adaptively learn discriminative evidence for each target depending on signal availability.

Moreover, we identify and improve upon a different failure mode we term region collapse, associated with prior sequence-level watermarking algorithms.

In traditional architectures, RAG services are provided by a single entity that hosts the dataset within a trusted local environment. However, individuals or small organizations often lack the resources to maintain data storage servers, leading them to rely on outsourced cloud storage. This dependence on untrusted third-party services introduces privacy risks. Embedding-based retrieval mechanisms, commonly used in RAG systems, are vulnerable to privacy leakage such as vector-to-text reconstruction attacks and structural leakage via vector analysis. Several privacy-preserving RAG techniques have been proposed but most existing approaches rely on partially homomorphic encryption, which incurs substantial computational overhead. To address these challenges, we propose an efficient privacy-preserving RAG framework (ppRAG) tailored for untrusted cloud environments that defends against vector-to-text attack, vector analysis, and query analysis. We propose Conditional Approximate Distance-Comparison-Preserving Symmetric Encryption (CAPRISE) that encrypts embeddings while still allowing the cloud to compute similarity between an encrypted query and the encrypted database embeddings. CAPRISE preserves only the relative distance ordering between the encrypted query and each encrypted database embedding, without exposing inter-database distances, thereby enhancing both privacy and efficiency. To mitigate query analysis, we introduce DP by perturbing the query embedding prior to encryption, preventing the cloud from inferring sensitive patterns.

In the standard estimate-then-optimize framework, reweighting-based methods (e.g., inverse propensity weighting or doubly robust estimators) are widely used to produce unbiased estimates of policy values. However, when the propensity scores of some treatments are small, these reweighting-based methods suffer from high variance in policy value estimation, which may mislead the downstream policy optimization and yield a learned policy with inferior value. In this paper, we systematically develop an offline policy learning algorithm based on a weight-clipping estimator that truncates small propensity scores via a clipping threshold chosen to minimize the mean squared error (MSE) in policy value estimation.

Without proper handling of this phenomenon, systematic errors are prone to being introduced in the box annotations. Our work is the first to discover such annotation errors in widely used, publicly available datasets. Through our novel offline estimation method, we correct the annotations so that they follow physically feasible trajectories and achieve spatial and temporal consistency with the sensor data. For the first time, we define metrics for this problem; and we evaluate our method on the Argoverse 2, MAN TruckScenes, and our proprietary datasets. Our approach increases the quality of box annotations by more than 17% in these datasets. Furthermore, we quantify the annotation errors in them and find that the original annotations are misplaced by up to 2.5 m, with highly dynamic objects being the most affected.

Semantic-based methods alleviate this by introducing coarse class-level information, but they are mostly applied on the support side, leaving query representations unchanged. In this paper, we present PMCE, a Probabilistic few-shot framework that leverages Multi-granularity semantics with Caption-guided Enhancement. PMCE constructs a nonparametric knowledge bank that stores visual statistics for each category as well as CLIP-encoded class name embeddings of the base classes. At meta-test time, the most relevant base classes are retrieved based on the similarities of class name embeddings for each novel category. These statistics are then aggregated into category-specific prior information and fused with the support set prototypes via a simple MAP update. Simultaneously, a frozen BLIP captioner provides label-free instance-level image descriptions, and a lightweight enhancer trained on base classes optimizes both support prototypes and query features under an inductive protocol with a consistency regularization to stabilize noisy captions. Experiments on four benchmarks show that PMCE consistently improves over strong baselines, achieving up to 7.71% absolute gain over the strongest semantic competitor on MiniImageNet in the 1-shot setting.

Though this security issue has recently been exposed, the feasibility of such attacks is questionable as malicious training dataset is believed to be detectable by moderation models such as Llama-Guard-3. In this paper, we propose TrojanPraise, a novel finetuning-based attack exploiting benign and thus filter-approved data. Basically, TrojanPraise fine-tunes the model to associate a crafted word (e.g., \"bruaf\") with harmless connotations, then uses this word to praise harmful concepts, subtly shifting the LLM from refusal to compliance. To explain the attack, we decouple the LLM's internal representation of a query into two dimensions of knowledge and attitude.

Using a graph neural network architecture operating on the 2D spatial simulation grid comprising 670k cells, we demonstrate that both a deterministic forecasting model (Graph-FM) and a probabilistic ensemble forecasting model (Graph-EFM) based on a latent variable formulation are capable of producing accurate predictions of future plasma states. A divergence penalty is incorporated during training to encourage divergence-freeness in the magnetic fields and improve physical consistency. For the probabilistic model, a continuous ranked probability score objective is added to improve the calibration of the ensemble forecasts. When trained, the emulators achieve more than two orders of magnitude speedup in generating the next time step relative to the original simulation on a single GPU compared to 100 CPUs for the Vlasiator runs, while closely matching physical magnetospheric response of the different runs.

Indeed, the scarcity of SPAD datasets hinders the development of SPAD-specific processing algorithms and impedes the training of learning-based solutions.\n  In this paper, we present a comprehensive SPAD simulation pipeline and validate it with multiple experiments using two recent commercial SPAD sensors. Our simulator is used to generate the SPAD-MNIST, a single-photon version of the seminal MNIST dataset, to investigate the effectiveness of convolutional neural network (CNN) classifiers on reconstructed fluxes, even at extremely low light conditions, e.g., 5 mlux. We also assess the performance of classifiers exclusively trained on simulated data on real images acquired from SPAD sensors at different light conditions. The synthetic dataset encompasses different SPAD imaging modalities and is made available for download.

This paper presents SHARE (Single Hyperspectral Image Restoration with Equivariance), a fully unsupervised framework that unifies geometric equivariance principles with low-rank spectral modelling to eliminate the need for ground truth.

Under the VoicePrivacy 2024 Challenge protocol, Stream-Voice-Anon achieves substantial improvements in intelligibility (up to 46% relative WER reduction) and emotion preservation (up to 28% UAR relative) compared to the previous state-of-the-art streaming method DarkStream while maintaining comparable latency (180ms vs 200ms) and privacy protection against lazy-informed attackers, though showing 15% relative degradation against semi-informed attackers.", "AI": {"tldr": "Stream-Voice-Anon significantly enhances streaming speaker anonymization using NAC-based architecture, achieving better intelligibility, emotion preservation, and low latency compared to prior methods.", "motivation": "Speaker identity protection is vital for voice applications, yet streaming anonymization lacks sufficient exploration and effective solutions.", "method": "The method integrates anonymization techniques into NAC-based architectures, using pseudo-speaker representations, speaker embedding mixing, and diverse LM prompt conditioning strategies.", "result": "Stream-Voice-Anon demonstrates improved intelligibility, emotion preservation, and latency compared to existing methods under the VoicePrivacy 2024 protocol, with slight privacy trade-offs under some attacker scenarios.", "conclusion": "Stream-Voice-Anon successfully adapts NAC architectures for advancing streaming speaker anonymization, addressing latency and privacy challenges effectively."}}

While existing methods focus on enhancing speaker encoders, the embedding learning strategy still forces a single fixed-dimensional representation reused for utterances of any length, leaving capacity misaligned with the information available at different durations. We propose Duration-Aware Matryoshka Embedding (DAME), a model-agnostic framework that builds a nested hierarchy of sub-embeddings aligned to utterance durations: lower-dimensional representations capture compact speaker traits from short utterances, while higher dimensions encode richer details from longer speech. DAME supports both training from scratch and fine-tuning, and serves as a direct alternative to conventional large-margin fine-tuning, consistently improving performance across durations. On the VoxCeleb1-O/E/H and VOiCES evaluation sets, DAME consistently reduces the equal error rate on 1-s and other short-duration trials, while maintaining full-length performance with no additional inference cost. These gains generalize across various speaker encoder architectures under both general training and fine-tuning setups.", "AI": {"tldr": "The paper introduces Duration-Aware Matryoshka Embedding (DAME), a framework for speaker verification that adjusts embedding dimensions based on utterance length.

Prior utterance-level matching methods, from an embedding-learning standpoint, learn embeddings at a single fixed dimensionality. We depart from this design and propose Matryoshka Audio-Text Embeddings (MATE), a dual-encoder framework that encodes multiple embedding granularities within a single vector via nested sub-embeddings (\"prefixes\"). Specifically, we introduce a PCA-guided prefix alignment: PCA-compressed versions of the full text embedding for each prefix size serve as teacher targets to align both audio and text prefixes. This alignment concentrates salient keyword cues in lower-dimensional prefixes, while higher dimensions add detail. MATE is trained with standard deep metric learning objectives for audio-text KWS, and is loss-agnostic.
