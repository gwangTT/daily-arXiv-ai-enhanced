### [1] [Zero-Shot Adaptation of Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning in Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04244)
*Farzad Farhadzadeh,Debasmit Das,Shubhankar Borse,Fatih Porikli*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ProLoRA enables zero-shot transfer of low-rank adjustments (LoRA) in text-to-image diffusion models without requiring retraining, using weight projection techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fine-tuning large diffusion-based text-to-image models often demands significant data and retraining when switching base models, which is resource-intensive and impractical in data-constrained scenarios.

Method: ProLoRA reuses pre-trained LoRA adjustments by projecting them into the target model's weight space, utilizing subspace/null space similarities and applying adjustments to aligned layers, enabling zero-shot transfer between models.

Result: ProLoRA enables effective knowledge transfer between text-to-image diffusion models and achieves comparable performance to traditional retraining-based approaches.

Conclusion: ProLoRA provides a parameter-efficient and data-free solution for adapting text-to-image models, addressing the challenges of retraining, thus broadening usability and flexibility in deploying such models.

Abstract: We introduce ProLoRA, enabling zero-shot adaptation of parameter-efficient
fine-tuning in text-to-image diffusion models. ProLoRA transfers pre-trained
low-rank adjustments (e.g., LoRA) from a source to a target model without
additional training data. This overcomes the limitations of traditional methods
that require retraining when switching base models, often challenging due to
data constraints. ProLoRA achieves this via projection of source adjustments
into the target model's weight space, leveraging subspace and null space
similarities and selectively targeting aligned layers. Evaluations on
established text-to-image models demonstrate successful knowledge transfer and
comparable performance without retraining.

### [2] [Contextual Integrity in LLMs via Reasoning and Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04245)
*Guangchen Lan,Huseyin A. Inan,Sahar Abdelnabi,Janardhan Kulkarni,Lukas Wutschitz,Reza Shokri,Christopher G. Brinton,Robert Sim*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The study investigates contextual integrity (CI) for autonomous agents, develops a reasoning framework for information sharing, and validates it using synthetic and established CI benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To ensure autonomous agents make context-aware decisions about appropriate information sharing during tasks.

Method: A two-step approach: (1) prompting large language models (LLMs) for CI-based reasoning during information disclosure, and (2) implementing a reinforcement learning (RL)-based framework to instill CI reasoning. Tested using a synthetic dataset and validated on established benchmarks like PrivacyLens.

Result: Substantial reduction in inappropriate information disclosure while preserving task performance across different models. Improvements generalized to established CI benchmarks.

Conclusion: The proposed framework is effective for enhancing the contextual integrity of information sharing by autonomous agents and transfers well to human-annotated CI datasets.

Abstract: As the era of autonomous agents making decisions on behalf of users unfolds,
ensuring contextual integrity (CI) -- what is the appropriate information to
share while carrying out a certain task -- becomes a central question to the
field. We posit that CI demands a form of reasoning where the agent needs to
reason about the context in which it is operating. To test this, we first
prompt LLMs to reason explicitly about CI when deciding what information to
disclose. We then extend this approach by developing a reinforcement learning
(RL) framework that further instills in models the reasoning necessary to
achieve CI. Using a synthetic, automatically created, dataset of only $\sim700$
examples but with diverse contexts and information disclosure norms, we show
that our method substantially reduces inappropriate information disclosure
while maintaining task performance across multiple model sizes and families.
Importantly, improvements transfer from this synthetic dataset to established
CI benchmarks such as PrivacyLens that has human annotations and evaluates
privacy leakage of AI assistants in actions and tool calls.

### [3] [Language-Guided Multi-Agent Learning in Simulations: A Unified Framework and Evaluation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04251)
*Zhengyang Li*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper presents LLM-MARL, a framework that integrates large language models into multi-agent reinforcement learning to improve gameplay coordination, communication, and generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance multi-agent coordination, communication, and generalization in complex game environments by leveraging the capabilities of large language models.

Method: It introduces a modular framework with three components: Coordinator, Communicator, and Memory, alongside a training methodology combining PPO, language-conditioned loss, and LLM query gating.

Result: LLM-MARL shows superior performance across environments like Google Research Football, MAgent Battle, and StarCraft II, outperforming MAPPO and QMIX in metrics such as win rate and coordination.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates that integrating language modeling into policy learning can significantly improve multi-agent coordination, offering new avenues for intelligent, cooperative agent design.

Abstract: This paper introduces LLM-MARL, a unified framework that incorporates large
language models (LLMs) into multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) to
enhance coordination, communication, and generalization in simulated game
environments. The framework features three modular components of Coordinator,
Communicator, and Memory, which dynamically generate subgoals, facilitate
symbolic inter-agent messaging, and support episodic recall. Training combines
PPO with a language-conditioned loss and LLM query gating. LLM-MARL is
evaluated in Google Research Football, MAgent Battle, and StarCraft II. Results
show consistent improvements over MAPPO and QMIX in win rate, coordination
score, and zero-shot generalization. Ablation studies demonstrate that subgoal
generation and language-based messaging each contribute significantly to
performance gains. Qualitative analysis reveals emergent behaviors such as role
specialization and communication-driven tactics. By bridging language modeling
and policy learning, this work contributes to the design of intelligent,
cooperative agents in interactive simulations. It offers a path forward for
leveraging LLMs in multi-agent systems used for training, games, and human-AI
collaboration.

### [4] [A Graph-Retrieval-Augmented Generation Framework Enhances Decision-Making in the Circular Economy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04252)
*Yang Zhao,Chengxiao Dai,Dusit Niyato,Chuan Fu Tan,Keyi Xiang,Yueyang Wang,Zhiquan Yeo,Daren Tan Zong Loong,Jonathan Low Zhaozhi,Eugene H. Z. HO*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: CircuGraphRAG enhances large language models (LLMs) by anchoring their outputs to a domain-specific knowledge graph for circular economy, significantly improving their accuracy, efficiency, and reliability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the problem of LLMs hallucinating industrial codes and emission data, which affects the reliability of regulatory and investment decisions in sustainable manufacturing.

Method: CircuGraphRAG uses a retrieval-augmented generation framework. It grounds LLM outputs in a domain-specific knowledge graph that links industrial and waste entities with classification codes and emission data. Verified subgraphs are retrieved through SPARQL queries for accurate and traceable results.

Result: CircuGraphRAG outperforms standalone LLMs and naive RAG in single- and multi-hop question answering, achieving ROUGE-L F1 scores up to 1.0, while improving response time and reducing token usage by 16%.

Conclusion: The proposed framework offers a fact-checked and efficient solution to enhance circular economy planning, fostering reliable, low-carbon resource decision-making.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) hold promise for sustainable manufacturing, but
often hallucinate industrial codes and emission factors, undermining regulatory
and investment decisions. We introduce CircuGraphRAG, a retrieval-augmented
generation (RAG) framework that grounds LLMs outputs in a domain-specific
knowledge graph for the circular economy. This graph connects 117,380
industrial and waste entities with classification codes and GWP100 emission
data, enabling structured multi-hop reasoning. Natural language queries are
translated into SPARQL and verified subgraphs are retrieved to ensure accuracy
and traceability. Compared with Standalone LLMs and Naive RAG, CircuGraphRAG
achieves superior performance in single-hop and multi-hop question answering,
with ROUGE-L F1 scores up to 1.0, while baseline scores below 0.08. It also
improves efficiency, halving the response time and reducing token usage by 16%
in representative tasks. CircuGraphRAG provides fact-checked, regulatory-ready
support for circular economy planning, advancing reliable, low-carbon resource
decision making.

### [5] [HADA: Human-AI Agent Decision Alignment Architecture](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04253)
*Tapio Pitkäranta,Leena Pitkäranta*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces HADA, an open-source architecture for aligning AI and traditional systems with organizational objectives, allowing stakeholders to control, audit, and adapt decisions through conversational APIs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in aligning large language models and legacy systems with organizational values and better supporting stakeholder involvement to improve oversight, transparency, and ethical compliance in decision-making pipelines.

Method: The authors developed HADA, a framework that wraps algorithms or LLMs in specialized stakeholder agents for key roles, enabling end-to-end decision-tracking and real-time adjustments. They validated it using a cloud-native proof of concept for credit-scoring models and applied scripted scenarios for evaluation.

Result: The evaluation demonstrated HADA's effectiveness in enabling all stakeholder roles to audit and intervene in decisions, trace KPIs, mitigate biases (e.g., ZIP-code bias), and maintain independent functionality regardless of underlying technologies.

Conclusion: HADA improves alignment between human, AI, and organizational values by providing a structured, framework-agnostic approach to oversight, which enhances accuracy, transparency, and ethical decision-making processes.

Abstract: We present HADA (Human-AI Agent Decision Alignment), a protocol- and
framework agnostic reference architecture that keeps both large language model
(LLM) agents and legacy algorithms aligned with organizational targets and
values. HADA wraps any algorithm or LLM in role-specific stakeholder agents --
business, data-science, audit, ethics, and customer -- each exposing
conversational APIs so that technical and non-technical actors can query,
steer, audit, or contest every decision across strategic, tactical, and
real-time horizons. Alignment objectives, KPIs, and value constraints are
expressed in natural language and are continuously propagated, logged, and
versioned while thousands of heterogeneous agents run on different
orchestration stacks. A cloud-native proof of concept packages a production
credit-scoring model (getLoanDecision) and deploys it on
Docker/Kubernetes/Python; five scripted retail-bank scenarios show how target
changes, parameter tweaks, explanation requests, and ethics triggers flow end
to end through the architecture. Evaluation followed the Design-Science
Research Methodology. Walkthrough observation and log inspection demonstrated
complete coverage of six predefined objectives: every role could invoke
conversational control, trace KPIs and value constraints, detect and mitigate
ZIP-code bias, and reproduce full decision lineage, independent of the
underlying LLM or agent library. Contributions: (1) an open-source HADA
architecture, (2) a mid-range design theory for human-AI alignment in
multi-agent systems, and (3) empirical evidence that framework-agnostic,
protocol-compliant stakeholder agents improve accuracy, transparency, and
ethical compliance in real-world decision pipelines.

### [6] [Automated Skill Discovery for Language Agents through Exploration and Iterative Feedback](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04287)
*Yongjin Yang,Sinjae Kang,Juyong Lee,Dongjun Lee,Se-Young Yun,Kimin Lee*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper presents EXIF, a framework for automatically discovering and training large language model agents with environment-grounded skills, using an iterative exploration and feedback loop.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address challenges in training LLM agents, such as reducing human effort in manual trajectory collection and overcoming the inadequacies of LLM-proposed task datasets, which often lack feasibility and meaningful learning signals.

Method: The proposed EXIF framework uses an exploration-first strategy with two agents, Alice (explorer) and Bob (learner). Alice explores the environment to generate a feasible skill dataset, which trains Bob. An iterative feedback loop evaluates Bob's performance to guide Alice's exploration and improve training.

Result: EXIF demonstrates its ability to discover meaningful skills and improve agent capabilities through experiments on Webshop and Crafter. The framework achieved significant performance gains and demonstrated self-evolving potential when Alice shared the same model as Bob.

Conclusion: EXIF successfully automates skill discovery and training in LLM agents, reducing the need for human intervention. The iterative feedback loop fosters continual improvement, enabling the development of self-evolving systems.

Abstract: Training large language model (LLM) agents to acquire necessary skills and
perform diverse tasks within an environment is gaining interest as a means to
enable open-endedness. However, creating the training dataset for their skill
acquisition faces several challenges. Manual trajectory collection requires
significant human effort. Another approach, where LLMs directly propose tasks
to learn, is often invalid, as the LLMs lack knowledge of which tasks are
actually feasible. Moreover, the generated data may not provide a meaningful
learning signal, as agents often already perform well on the proposed tasks. To
address this, we propose a novel automatic skill discovery framework EXIF for
LLM-powered agents, designed to improve the feasibility of generated target
behaviors while accounting for the agents' capabilities. Our method adopts an
exploration-first strategy by employing an exploration agent (Alice) to train
the target agent (Bob) to learn essential skills in the environment.
Specifically, Alice first interacts with the environment to retrospectively
generate a feasible, environment-grounded skill dataset, which is then used to
train Bob. Crucially, we incorporate an iterative feedback loop, where Alice
evaluates Bob's performance to identify areas for improvement. This feedback
then guides Alice's next round of exploration, forming a closed-loop data
generation process. Experiments on Webshop and Crafter demonstrate EXIF's
ability to effectively discover meaningful skills and iteratively expand the
capabilities of the trained agent without any human intervention, achieving
substantial performance improvements. Interestingly, we observe that setting
Alice to the same model as Bob also notably improves performance, demonstrating
EXIF's potential for building a self-evolving system.

### [7] [A Statistical Physics of Language Model Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04374)
*Jack David Carson,Amir Reisizadeh*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces a statistical physics framework to understand chain-of-thought reasoning dynamics in language models (LMs), focusing on capturing latent reasoning regimes and modeling transitions like failures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the lack of a mechanistic understanding of reasoning in transformer-based language models, despite their emergent capabilities.

Method: The study models sentence-level hidden states as a drift-diffusion stochastic dynamical system on a lower-dimensional manifold with latent regime switching. It validates the approach using 8 models and 7 benchmarks, employing a rank-40 projection.

Result: The framework captures ~50% of the variance in reasoning trajectories and identifies four latent reasoning regimes. It offers a validated SLDS (Switching Linear Dynamical System) model for critical transitions and failures.

Conclusion: This framework provides a tool for low-cost simulation and study of reasoning dynamics and could predict critical transitions such as misaligned states in language models (LMs).

Abstract: Transformer LMs show emergent reasoning that resists mechanistic
understanding. We offer a statistical physics framework for continuous-time
chain-of-thought reasoning dynamics. We model sentence-level hidden state
trajectories as a stochastic dynamical system on a lower-dimensional manifold.
This drift-diffusion system uses latent regime switching to capture diverse
reasoning phases, including misaligned states or failures. Empirical
trajectories (8 models, 7 benchmarks) show a rank-40 projection (balancing
variance capture and feasibility) explains ~50% variance. We find four latent
reasoning regimes. An SLDS model is formulated and validated to capture these
features. The framework enables low-cost reasoning simulation, offering tools
to study and predict critical transitions like misaligned states or other LM
failures.

### [8] [Matter-of-Fact: A Benchmark for Verifying the Feasibility of Literature-Supported Claims in Materials Science](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04410)
*Peter Jansen,Samiah Hassan,Ruoyao Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper presents Matter-of-Fact, a dataset for assessing the feasibility of scientific hypotheses framed as claims, and reveals the challenges that current models face in solving this task effectively.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance scientific discovery systems that generate hypotheses and test them via experiments, by developing a method to filter infeasible hypotheses and increase efficiency and the likelihood of significant discoveries.

Method: The authors created a dataset called Matter-of-Fact, comprising 8.4k scientific claims from four fields, and evaluated strong baseline models, including retrieval-augmented generation and code generation, on the task of determining hypothesis feasibility.

Result: The evaluated models achieved a maximum of 72% accuracy on the task (compared to a 50% baseline by chance), with domain-expert verification indicating that nearly all claims are solvable.

Conclusion: The difficulty of the task for current AI models points to the need for improvements to accelerate scientific discovery, supported by further development and utilization of the presented dataset.

Abstract: Contemporary approaches to assisted scientific discovery use language models
to automatically generate large numbers of potential hypothesis to test, while
also automatically generating code-based experiments to test those hypotheses.
While hypotheses can be comparatively inexpensive to generate, automated
experiments can be costly, particularly when run at scale (i.e. thousands of
experiments). Developing the capacity to filter hypotheses based on their
feasibility would allow discovery systems to run at scale, while increasing
their likelihood of making significant discoveries. In this work we introduce
Matter-of-Fact, a challenge dataset for determining the feasibility of
hypotheses framed as claims. Matter-of-Fact includes 8.4k claims extracted from
scientific articles spanning four high-impact contemporary materials science
topics, including superconductors, semiconductors, batteries, and aerospace
materials, while including qualitative and quantitative claims from
theoretical, experimental, and code/simulation results. We show that strong
baselines that include retrieval augmented generation over scientific
literature and code generation fail to exceed 72% performance on this task
(chance performance is 50%), while domain-expert verification suggests nearly
all are solvable -- highlighting both the difficulty of this task for current
models, and the potential to accelerate scientific discovery by making
near-term progress.

### [9] [Plugging Schema Graph into Multi-Table QA: A Human-Guided Framework for Reducing LLM Reliance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04427)
*Xixi Wang,Miguel Costa,Jordanka Kovaceva,Shuai Wang,Francisco C. Pereira*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces a graph-based framework for multi-table question answering to handle complex schema linking and joins, outperforming existing methods in real-world scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods struggle with unreliable schema linking across complex tables, making multi-table QA challenging, especially in real-world scenarios with diverse datasets.

Method: The authors propose a graph-based framework that employs human-curated relational knowledge to encode schema links and join paths. It also uses pruning and sub-path merging strategies to construct reasoning chains for answering queries efficiently.

Result: Experiments on standard benchmarks and a realistic, large-scale dataset show the proposed system's effectiveness, marking progress over existing methods.

Conclusion: This framework demonstrates significant advancements in multi-table QA, especially on complex industrial tabular data, making it the first system to achieve this feat.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in table Question Answering
(Table QA). However, extending these capabilities to multi-table QA remains
challenging due to unreliable schema linking across complex tables. Existing
methods based on semantic similarity work well only on simplified hand-crafted
datasets and struggle to handle complex, real-world scenarios with numerous and
diverse columns. To address this, we propose a graph-based framework that
leverages human-curated relational knowledge to explicitly encode schema links
and join paths. Given a natural language query, our method searches this graph
to construct interpretable reasoning chains, aided by pruning and sub-path
merging strategies to enhance efficiency and coherence. Experiments on both
standard benchmarks and a realistic, large-scale dataset demonstrate the
effectiveness of our approach. To our knowledge, this is the first multi-table
QA system applied to truly complex industrial tabular data.

### [10] [An AI-Based Public Health Data Monitoring System](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04429)
*Ananya Joshi,Nolan Gormley,Richa Gadgil,Tina Townes,Roni Rosenfeld,Bryan Wilder*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces a ranking-based AI anomaly detection system for public health data monitoring, improving efficiency and reliability compared to traditional alert systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for scalable and efficient public health data monitoring in the face of high data volumes and limitations of traditional alert systems.

Method: A ranking-based monitoring paradigm utilizing modern AI anomaly detection techniques, implemented and deployed to handle up to 5 million daily data points.

Result: A longitudinal evaluation showed a 54x increase in reviewer speed efficiency, highlighting significant improvements in monitoring objectives.

Conclusion: Human-centered AI can serve as a transformative approach for public health decision-making, addressing challenges in current monitoring systems.

Abstract: Public health experts need scalable approaches to monitor large volumes of
health data (e.g., cases, hospitalizations, deaths) for outbreaks or data
quality issues. Traditional alert-based monitoring systems struggle with modern
public health data monitoring systems for several reasons, including that
alerting thresholds need to be constantly reset and the data volumes may cause
application lag. Instead, we propose a ranking-based monitoring paradigm that
leverages new AI anomaly detection methods. Through a multi-year
interdisciplinary collaboration, the resulting system has been deployed at a
national organization to monitor up to 5,000,000 data points daily. A
three-month longitudinal deployed evaluation revealed a significant improvement
in monitoring objectives, with a 54x increase in reviewer speed efficiency
compared to traditional alert-based methods. This work highlights the potential
of human-centered AI to transform public health decision-making.

### [11] [Matching Markets Meet LLMs: Algorithmic Reasoning with Ranked Preferences](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04478)
*Hadi Hosseini,Samarth Khanna,Ronak Singh*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper explores the limitations of Large Language Models (LLMs) in handling ranked preferences and structured algorithms in matching markets, highlighting their struggles with large-market scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to assess the reasoning capabilities of LLMs in combinatorial domains like matching markets, which are crucial for applications such as resource allocation and ride-sharing.

Method: The authors evaluate state-of-the-art models across tasks like stable-matching generation, instability detection and resolution, and preference queries, using parameter-efficient fine-tuning (LoRA) for performance improvement.

Result: LLMs, even advanced ones, face significant difficulties in resolving instability in large matching markets, frequently failing key logical steps. LoRA fine-tuning improves smaller market performance but is ineffective for large contexts.

Conclusion: Improving LLMs' capabilities in handling larger-context reasoning tasks demands more advanced approaches than current fine-tuning methods.

Abstract: The rise of Large Language Models (LLMs) has driven progress in reasoning
tasks -- from program synthesis to scientific hypothesis generation -- yet
their ability to handle ranked preferences and structured algorithms in
combinatorial domains remains underexplored. We study matching markets, a core
framework behind applications like resource allocation and ride-sharing, which
require reconciling individual ranked preferences to ensure stable outcomes. We
evaluate several state-of-the-art models on a hierarchy of preference-based
reasoning tasks -- ranging from stable-matching generation to instability
detection, instability resolution, and fine-grained preference queries -- to
systematically expose their logical and algorithmic limitations in handling
ranked inputs. Surprisingly, even top-performing models with advanced reasoning
struggle to resolve instability in large markets, often failing to identify
blocking pairs or execute algorithms iteratively. We further show that
parameter-efficient fine-tuning (LoRA) significantly improves performance in
small markets, but fails to bring about a similar improvement on large
instances, suggesting the need for more sophisticated strategies to improve
LLMs' reasoning with larger-context inputs.

### [12] [CogMath: Assessing LLMs' Authentic Mathematical Ability from a Human Cognitive Perspective](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04481)
*Jiayu Liu,Zhenya Huang,Wei Dai,Cheng Cheng,Jinze Wu,Jing Sha,Song Li,Qi Liu,Shijin Wang,Enhong Chen*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces CogMath, a comprehensive framework to evaluate mathematical understanding in LLMs by examining reasoning stages and multi-dimensional fine-grained tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods to assess mathematical abilities of LLMs focus only on overall answer accuracy, failing to delve into their underlying reasoning capabilities.

Method: The authors present CogMath, inspired by human cognitive processes, breaking reasoning into three stages—problem comprehension, solving, and summarization—evaluated across 9 dimensions using a multi-agent system.

Result: Using CogMath on three benchmarks, they found that LLMs' mathematical abilities are overestimated by 30–40% and identified strengths and weaknesses in their reasoning across different stages and dimensions.

Conclusion: CogMath provides a more nuanced analysis of LLMs' mathematical abilities and identifies areas for improvement, enabling advancements in reasoning capabilities.

Abstract: Although large language models (LLMs) show promise in solving complex
mathematical tasks, existing evaluation paradigms rely solely on a coarse
measure of overall answer accuracy, which are insufficient for assessing their
authentic capabilities. In this paper, we propose \textbf{CogMath}, which
comprehensively assesses LLMs' mathematical abilities through the lens of human
cognition. Specifically, inspired by psychological theories, CogMath formalizes
human reasoning process into 3 stages: \emph{problem comprehension},
\emph{problem solving}, and \emph{solution summarization}. Within these stages,
we investigate perspectives such as numerical calculation, knowledge, and
counterfactuals, and design a total of 9 fine-grained evaluation dimensions. In
each dimension, we develop an ``\emph{Inquiry}-\emph{Judge}-\emph{Reference}''
multi-agent system to generate inquiries that assess LLMs' mastery from this
dimension. An LLM is considered to truly master a problem only when excelling
in all inquiries from the 9 dimensions. By applying CogMath on three
benchmarks, we reveal that the mathematical capabilities of 7 mainstream LLMs
are overestimated by 30\%-40\%. Moreover, we locate their strengths and
weaknesses across specific stages/dimensions, offering in-depth insights to
further enhance their reasoning abilities.

*Aladin Djuhera,Amin Seffo,Masataro Asai,Holger Boche*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces STPR, a framework that uses large language models (LLMs) to transform natural language constraints into executable Python functions for robotic navigation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Use natural language constraints, often informal and complex, to enhance robotic navigation planning.

Method: STPR translates constraints into Python functions using LLMs, leveraging their coding capabilities to produce structured and accurate code.

Result: Generated Python functions accurately describe constraints, achieving compliance for various scenarios in a simulated environment with efficient runtime.

Conclusion: STPR effectively integrates LLMs for constraint generation in robotic planning, ensuring precision and computational efficiency, and is adaptable to smaller code-focused models.

Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have spurred interest in
robotic navigation that incorporates complex spatial, mathematical, and
conditional constraints from natural language into the planning problem. Such
constraints can be informal yet highly complex, making it challenging to
translate into a formal description that can be passed on to a planning
algorithm. In this paper, we propose STPR, a constraint generation framework
that uses LLMs to translate constraints (expressed as instructions on ``what
not to do'') into executable Python functions. STPR leverages the LLM's strong
coding capabilities to shift the problem description from language into
structured and transparent code, thus circumventing complex reasoning and
avoiding potential hallucinations. We show that these LLM-generated functions
accurately describe even complex mathematical constraints, and apply them to
point cloud representations with traditional search algorithms. Experiments in
a simulated Gazebo environment show that STPR ensures full compliance across
several constraints and scenarios, while having short runtimes. We also verify
that STPR can be used with smaller, code-specific LLMs, making it applicable to
a wide range of compact models at low inference cost.

TL;DR: The paper examines the use of large language models (LLMs) for automatic schema generation in Shape Expressions (ShEx), leveraging two new datasets and benchmarks to enhance scalability in knowledge graphs.


<details>

Motivation: Schemas are vital for data quality in the Semantic Web and NLP, but traditionally require significant efforts from domain experts. This paper aims to leverage LLMs to automate this process.

Method: The authors introduced two datasets (YAGO Schema and Wikidata EntitySchema) and LLM-based pipelines that use both local and global knowledge from knowledge graphs to automatically generate validating schemas in ShEx.

Result: Experiments showed that LLMs have strong capability to produce high-quality ShEx schemas, addressing scalability challenges in schema generation for large knowledge graphs.

Conclusion: LLMs demonstrate promising potential for automating schema generation in knowledge graphs, and the benchmark offers a new challenge for structured generation tasks, advancing the field of syntactically rich formalism generation.

Abstract: Schemas are vital for ensuring data quality in the Semantic Web and natural
language processing. Traditionally, their creation demands substantial
involvement from knowledge engineers and domain experts. Leveraging the
impressive capabilities of large language models (LLMs) in related tasks like
ontology engineering, we explore automatic schema generation using LLMs. To
bridge the resource gap, we introduce two datasets: YAGO Schema and Wikidata
EntitySchema, along with evaluation metrics. The LLM-based pipelines
effectively utilize local and global information from knowledge graphs (KGs) to
generate validating schemas in Shape Expressions (ShEx). Experiments
demonstrate LLMs' strong potential in producing high-quality ShEx schemas,
paving the way for scalable, automated schema generation for large KGs.
Furthermore, our benchmark introduces a new challenge for structured
generation, pushing the limits of LLMs on syntactically rich formalisms.

*Srikanth Thudumu,Jason Fisher*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: OpenAg introduces a novel AGI framework for agriculture, aiming to provide domain-specific, explainable, and actionable insights tailored for smallholder farmers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses shortcomings in current agricultural intelligence systems, like a lack of contextual understanding, adaptability, and realistic decision support, especially for smallholder farmers.

Method: OpenAg integrates domain-specific foundation models, neural knowledge graphs, multi-agent reasoning systems, causal explainability, and adaptive transfer learning.

Result: OpenAg delivers context-aware recommendations by utilizing a unified agricultural knowledge base, a neural knowledge graph, and collaborative AI agents, ensuring scientifically grounded and interpretable outcomes.

Conclusion: OpenAg bridges scientific knowledge and farmer expertise, fostering scalable and locally relevant agricultural decision-making.

Abstract: Agriculture is undergoing a major transformation driven by artificial
intelligence (AI), machine learning, and knowledge representation technologies.
However, current agricultural intelligence systems often lack contextual
understanding, explainability, and adaptability, especially for smallholder
farmers with limited resources. General-purpose large language models (LLMs),
while powerful, typically lack the domain-specific knowledge and contextual
reasoning needed for practical decision support in farming. They tend to
produce recommendations that are too generic or unrealistic for real-world
applications. To address these challenges, we present OpenAg, a comprehensive
framework designed to advance agricultural artificial general intelligence
(AGI). OpenAg combines domain-specific foundation models, neural knowledge
graphs, multi-agent reasoning, causal explainability, and adaptive transfer
learning to deliver context-aware, explainable, and actionable insights. The
system includes: (i) a unified agricultural knowledge base that integrates
scientific literature, sensor data, and farmer-generated knowledge; (ii) a
neural agricultural knowledge graph for structured reasoning and inference;
(iii) an adaptive multi-agent reasoning system where AI agents specialize and
collaborate across agricultural domains; and (iv) a causal transparency
mechanism that ensures AI recommendations are interpretable, scientifically
grounded, and aligned with real-world constraints. OpenAg aims to bridge the
gap between scientific knowledge and the tacit expertise of experienced farmers
to support scalable and locally relevant agricultural decision-making.

*Li Liu,Heng Yong*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: DeePoly is introduced as a hybrid machine learning framework for solving PDEs efficiently and accurately, combining deep neural networks with polynomial basis functions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of convergence guarantees and computational efficiency in DNN-based PDE solvers, which limits their practicality compared to traditional numerical methods.

Method: DeePoly employs a two-stage approach: initially, a DNN captures complex global features, followed by linear space optimization using DNN-extracted features (Scoper) and polynomial basis functions (Sniper).

Result: The proposed method demonstrates high-order accuracy and computational efficiency across various PDEs, while being mesh-free and scheme-free.

Conclusion: DeePoly effectively bridges the gap between DNNs and traditional numerical methods, offering a robust, efficient solution framework for PDEs.

Abstract: Recently, machine learning methods have gained significant traction in
scientific computing, particularly for solving Partial Differential Equations
(PDEs). However, methods based on deep neural networks (DNNs) often lack
convergence guarantees and computational efficiency compared to traditional
numerical schemes. This work introduces DeePoly, a novel framework that
transforms the solution paradigm from pure non-convex parameter optimization to
a two-stage approach: first employing a DNN to capture complex global features,
followed by linear space optimization with combined DNN-extracted features
(Scoper) and polynomial basis functions (Sniper). This strategic combination
leverages the complementary strengths of both methods -- DNNs excel at
approximating complex global features (i.e., high-gradient features) and
stabilize the polynomial approximation while polynomial bases provide
high-precision local corrections with convergence guarantees. Theoretical
analysis and numerical experiments demonstrate that this approach significantly
enhances both high-order accuracy and efficiency across diverse problem types
while maintaining mesh-free and scheme-free properties. This paper also serves
as a theoretical exposition for the open-source project DeePoly.

*Yuyang Wanyan,Xi Zhang,Haiyang Xu,Haowei Liu,Junyang Wang,Jiabo Ye,Yutong Kou,Ming Yan,Fei Huang,Xiaoshan Yang,Weiming Dong,Changsheng Xu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper presents a specialized model (GUI-Critic-R1) for improving decision-making in GUI automation tasks through pre-operative feedback.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multimodal reasoning tasks in GUI automation face challenges in online environments due to real-time decision-making requirements and low tolerance for errors.

Method: The authors introduce GUI-Critic-R1 using a Suggestion-aware Gradient Relative Policy Optimization (S-GRPO) strategy and a reasoning-bootstrapping data pipeline for enhanced model feedback.

Result: Experiments reveal that GUI-Critic-R1 outperforms current MLLMs in critic accuracy and improves performance metrics in GUI automation tasks.

Conclusion: The proposed GUI-Critic-R1 is an effective solution for enhancing reliability, accuracy, and efficiency in GUI automation tasks.

Abstract: In recent years, Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have been
extensively utilized for multimodal reasoning tasks, including Graphical User
Interface (GUI) automation. Unlike general offline multimodal tasks, GUI
automation is executed in online interactive environments, necessitating
step-by-step decision-making based on real-time status of the environment. This
task has a lower tolerance for decision-making errors at each step, as any
mistakes may cumulatively disrupt the process and potentially lead to
irreversible outcomes like deletions or payments. To address these issues, we
introduce a pre-operative critic mechanism that provides effective feedback
prior to the actual execution, by reasoning about the potential outcome and
correctness of actions. Specifically, we propose a Suggestion-aware Gradient
Relative Policy Optimization (S-GRPO) strategy to construct our pre-operative
critic model GUI-Critic-R1, incorporating a novel suggestion reward to enhance
the reliability of the model's feedback. Furthermore, we develop a
reasoning-bootstrapping based data collection pipeline to create a
GUI-Critic-Train and a GUI-Critic-Test, filling existing gaps in GUI critic
data. Static experiments on the GUI-Critic-Test across both mobile and web
domains reveal that our GUI-Critic-R1 offers significant advantages in critic
accuracy compared to current MLLMs. Dynamic evaluation on GUI automation
benchmark further highlights the effectiveness and superiority of our model, as
evidenced by improved success rates and operational efficiency.

### [19] [CHANCERY: Evaluating corporate governance reasoning capabilities in language models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04636)
*Lucas Irwin,Arda Kaz,Peiyao Sheng,Pramod Viswanath*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces CHANCERY, a new benchmark to measure the ability of language models to reason about corporate governance actions based on corporate charters. Evaluations reveal the difficulty of the benchmark and provide insights into the performance of SOTA reasoning models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation behind this paper is to address the lack of benchmarks that specifically focus on reasoning capabilities in the legal domain, particularly in corporate governance.

Method: The authors create the CHANCERY benchmark, which entails binary classification tasks requiring models to assess the consistency of proposed actions with corporate governance charters. They use principles of corporate governance and real-world corporate charters for the dataset.

Result: SOTA models struggle with the benchmark; GPT-4 achieves 75.2% accuracy, while reasoning agents using ReAct and CodeAct frameworks achieve slightly higher accuracies of 76.1% and 78.1%, respectively.

Conclusion: The benchmark highlights the challenges for current models in legal reasoning tasks and provides a foundation for further research into refining NLP systems for corporate governance legal reasoning.

Abstract: Law has long been a domain that has been popular in natural language
processing (NLP) applications. Reasoning (ratiocination and the ability to make
connections to precedent) is a core part of the practice of the law in the real
world. Nevertheless, while multiple legal datasets exist, none have thus far
focused specifically on reasoning tasks. We focus on a specific aspect of the
legal landscape by introducing a corporate governance reasoning benchmark
(CHANCERY) to test a model's ability to reason about whether
executive/board/shareholder's proposed actions are consistent with corporate
governance charters. This benchmark introduces a first-of-its-kind corporate
governance reasoning test for language models - modeled after real world
corporate governance law. The benchmark consists of a corporate charter (a set
of governing covenants) and a proposal for executive action. The model's task
is one of binary classification: reason about whether the action is consistent
with the rules contained within the charter. We create the benchmark following
established principles of corporate governance - 24 concrete corporate
governance principles established in and 79 real life corporate charters
selected to represent diverse industries from a total dataset of 10k real life
corporate charters. Evaluations on state-of-the-art (SOTA) reasoning models
confirm the difficulty of the benchmark, with models such as Claude 3.7 Sonnet
and GPT-4o achieving 64.5% and 75.2% accuracy respectively. Reasoning agents
exhibit superior performance, with agents based on the ReAct and CodeAct
frameworks scoring 76.1% and 78.1% respectively, further confirming the
advanced legal reasoning capabilities required to score highly on the
benchmark. We also conduct an analysis of the types of questions which current
reasoning models struggle on, revealing insights into the legal reasoning
capabilities of SOTA models.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper evaluates if large language model (LLM)-based agents can self-improve in strategic planning within the game Settlers of Catan, showing that self-evolving agents using models like Claude 3.7 and GPT-4o outperform static agents.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation behind this study is to address LLMs' limitations in forming and following coherent long-term strategies and to explore whether LLMs can self-improve through iterative, autonomous processes in challenging environments.

Method: The paper introduces a multi-agent architecture with specialized roles (Analyzer, Researcher, Coder, Player) to iteratively analyze gameplay, research strategies, and modify player agent logic or prompts. This setup is tested in the Settlers of Catan environment via the Catanatron framework.

Result: Results indicate that self-evolving agents powered by advanced LLMs outperform static agents by autonomously refining their strategies and demonstrating adaptive reasoning across multiple iterations.

Conclusion: The study concludes that LLM agents, when designed to self-modify and evolve, can successfully improve strategic planning and outperform static counterparts in complex tasks like playing Settlers of Catan.

Abstract: Recent advances in LLMs have enabled their use as autonomous agents across a
range of tasks, yet they continue to struggle with formulating and adhering to
coherent long-term strategies. In this paper, we investigate whether LLM agents
can self-improve when placed in environments that explicitly challenge their
strategic planning abilities. Using the board game Settlers of Catan, accessed
through the open-source Catanatron framework, we benchmark a progression of
LLM-based agents, from a simple game-playing agent to systems capable of
autonomously rewriting their own prompts and their player agent's code. We
introduce a multi-agent architecture in which specialized roles (Analyzer,
Researcher, Coder, and Player) collaborate to iteratively analyze gameplay,
research new strategies, and modify the agent's logic or prompt. By comparing
manually crafted agents to those evolved entirely by LLMs, we evaluate how
effectively these systems can diagnose failure and adapt over time. Our results
show that self-evolving agents, particularly when powered by models like Claude
3.7 and GPT-4o, outperform static baselines by autonomously adopting their
strategies, passing along sample behavior to game-playing agents, and
demonstrating adaptive reasoning over multiple iterations.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This study uses large language models (LLMs) to analyze unstructured e-bike incident reports, classifying factors contributing to accidents and evaluating their severity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The increase in e-bike usage has raised safety concerns, but most incident reports are unstructured narratives, making quantitative safety analysis challenging.

Method: A framework with four LLM agents was developed to classify, extract, determine injury causes, and link components in incident reports. An ordered logit model was then applied to assess factor-severity relationships.

Result: It was found that equipment issues are slightly more frequent than human-related causes, but human-related accidents tend to be more fatal. Components like pedals, tires, and brakes are key contributors. The model achieved a weighted F1 score of 0.87.

Conclusion: LLMs can effectively process and analyze unstructured data, offering a scalable approach to improve e-bike safety analysis and providing valuable insights for policymakers and designers.

Abstract: Electric bicycles (e-bikes) are rapidly increasing in use, raising safety
concerns due to a rise in accident reports. However, e-bike incident reports
often use unstructured narrative formats, which hinders quantitative safety
analysis. This study introduces E-bike agents, a framework that uses large
language models (LLM) powered agents to classify and extract safety variables
from unstructured incident reports. Our framework consists of four LLM agents,
handling data classification, information extraction, injury cause
determination, and component linkage, to extract the key factors that could
lead to E-bike accidents and cause varying severity levels. Furthermore, we
used an ordered logit model to examine the relationship between the severity of
the incident and the factors retrieved, such as gender, the type of cause, and
environmental conditions. Our research shows that equipment issues are slightly
more common than human-related ones, but human-related incidents are more often
fatal. Specifically, pedals, tires, and brakes are frequent contributors to
accidents. The model achieves a high weighted F1 score of 0.87 in
classification accuracy, highlighting the potential of using LLMs to extract
unstructured data in niche domains, such as transportation. Our method offers a
scalable solution to improve e-bike safety analytics and provides actionable
information for policy makers, designers, and regulators.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces LLM-driven agents for simulating human-like economic activities in MMO economies, addressing agent reliability and interpretability challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional ABM methods struggle with emulating human behavior in economic activities, necessitating a new approach for improved agent reliability, sociability, and interpretability.

Method: LLMs are used to create agents with decision-making, perception, memory, and reasoning capabilities to simulate MMO economic behavior more effectively.

Result: Simulation experiments reveal LLM-driven agents can reproduce emergent economic phenomena such as role specialization and realistic price fluctuations.

Conclusion: LLM-driven agents exhibit significant potential in improving MMO economic simulations by mimicking human-like activity and adaptability.

Abstract: Within the domain of Massively Multiplayer Online (MMO) economy research,
Agent-Based Modeling (ABM) has emerged as a robust tool for analyzing game
economics, evolving from rule-based agents to decision-making agents enhanced
by reinforcement learning. Nevertheless, existing works encounter significant
challenges when attempting to emulate human-like economic activities among
agents, particularly regarding agent reliability, sociability, and
interpretability. In this study, we take a preliminary step in introducing a
novel approach using Large Language Models (LLMs) in MMO economy simulation.
Leveraging LLMs' role-playing proficiency, generative capacity, and reasoning
aptitude, we design LLM-driven agents with human-like decision-making and
adaptability. These agents are equipped with the abilities of role-playing,
perception, memory, and reasoning, addressing the aforementioned challenges
effectively. Simulation experiments focusing on in-game economic activities
demonstrate that LLM-empowered agents can promote emergent phenomena like role
specialization and price fluctuations in line with market rules.

*Jiayu Wang,Yifei Ming,Zixuan Ke,Caiming Xiong,Shafiq Joty,Aws Albarghouthi,Frederic Sala*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper investigates the impact of reinforcement learning (RL) on reasoning capabilities in language models, revealing nuanced effects beyond accuracy improvement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to understand the benefits of RL-based training for reasoning in language models and to address the lack of a fine-grained analysis.

Method: The authors propose and apply a framework that examines how RL impacts plan execution, problem decomposition, and knowledge integration in reasoning tasks.

Result: The study found that RL enhances models' robustness in reasoning, capacity to utilize provided knowledge, and ability to perform on hard problems.

Conclusion: RL may help language models formulate internal reasoning strategies better suited to diverse tasks rather than simply improving execution of external plans.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has become the dominant paradigm for endowing
language models with advanced reasoning capabilities. Despite the substantial
empirical gains demonstrated by RL-based training methods like GRPO, a granular
understanding of their advantages is still lacking. To address this gap, we
introduce a fine-grained analytic framework to dissect the impact of RL on
reasoning. Our framework specifically investigates key elements that have been
hypothesized to benefit from RL training: (1) plan-following and execution, (2)
problem decomposition, and (3) improved reasoning and knowledge utilization.
Using this framework, we gain insights beyond mere accuracy. For instance,
providing models with explicit step-by-step plans surprisingly degrades
performance on the most challenging benchmarks, yet RL-tuned models exhibit
greater robustness, experiencing markedly smaller performance drops than their
base counterparts. This suggests that RL may not primarily enhance the
execution of external plans but rather empower models to formulate and follow
internal strategies better suited to their reasoning processes. Conversely, we
observe that RL enhances the model's capacity to integrate provided knowledge
into its reasoning process, leading to performance improvements across diverse
tasks. We also study difficulty, showing improved training by developing new
ways to exploit hard problems. Our findings lay a foundation for more
principled training and evaluation of reasoning models.

TL;DR: The paper highlights issues with fluctuating benchmark results in popular reasoning models like Deepseek-R1-Distill and similar models, suggesting a need for stricter evaluation standards.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address and understand the inconsistencies in benchmark results within widely-used reasoning models in the open-source community.

Method: Empirical assessments and evaluations of the Deepseek-R1-Distill series models were conducted to identify factors contributing to performance variability.

Result: Results showed significant fluctuations in model performance benchmarks due to subtle differences in evaluation conditions, which also affected related models like QwQ-32B.

Conclusion: A more rigorous and standardized paradigm for evaluating reasoning model performance is necessary to ensure reliability and reproducibility in benchmarking.

Abstract: Reasoning models represented by the Deepseek-R1-Distill series have been
widely adopted by the open-source community due to their strong performance in
mathematics, science, programming, and other domains. However, our study
reveals that their benchmark evaluation results are subject to significant
fluctuations caused by various factors. Subtle differences in evaluation
conditions can lead to substantial variations in results. Similar phenomena are
observed in other open-source inference models fine-tuned based on the
Deepseek-R1-Distill series, as well as in the QwQ-32B model, making their
claimed performance improvements difficult to reproduce reliably. Therefore, we
advocate for the establishment of a more rigorous paradigm for model
performance evaluation and present our empirical assessments of the
Deepseek-R1-Distill series models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of domain expertise integration in medical AI systems, which can affect diagnostic reliability.

Method: Developed a framework incorporating a hierarchical neural network, an ontology-enhanced VQA system, and a multimodal deep learning model. The framework uses bone disease ontology and systematic knowledge digitization for interpretability.

Result: The framework shows potential for diagnosing bone diseases and is designed for scalability beyond bone diseases. However, experimental validation has not yet been carried out due to resource limitations.

Conclusion: The proposed framework provides a theoretically sound foundation for integrating medical knowledge into AI systems. Future work will focus on dataset expansion and system validation to confirm its efficacy.

Abstract: Medical artificial intelligence (AI) systems frequently lack systematic
domain expertise integration, potentially compromising diagnostic reliability.
This study presents an ontology-based framework for bone disease diagnosis,
developed in collaboration with Ho Chi Minh City Hospital for Traumatology and
Orthopedics. The framework introduces three theoretical contributions: (1) a
hierarchical neural network architecture guided by bone disease ontology for
segmentation-classification tasks, incorporating Visual Language Models (VLMs)
through prompts, (2) an ontology-enhanced Visual Question Answering (VQA)
system for clinical reasoning, and (3) a multimodal deep learning model that
integrates imaging, clinical, and laboratory data through ontological
relationships. The methodology maintains clinical interpretability through
systematic knowledge digitization, standardized medical terminology mapping,
and modular architecture design. The framework demonstrates potential for
extension beyond bone diseases through its standardized structure and reusable
components. While theoretical foundations are established, experimental
validation remains pending due to current dataset and computational resource
limitations. Future work will focus on expanding the clinical dataset and
conducting comprehensive system validation.

*Artem Latyshev,Gregory Gorbov,Aleksandr I. Panov*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes a new model-based reinforcement learning (RL) framework that improves both safety and performance using adaptive mechanisms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Ensure safety and reliability of RL applications in real-world, safety-critical scenarios where model inaccuracies can cause failures.

Method: Develops a model-based RL framework with adaptive switching between model-based planning and direct policy execution, use of implicit world models, and introduction of dynamic safety thresholds.

Result: Achieves significant enhancements in performance and safety compared to non-adaptive methods in safety-critical continuous control tasks.

Conclusion: The framework effectively balances safety and task performance, outperforming existing methods and showcasing its viability in real-world RL applications.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) applications in real-world scenarios must
prioritize safety and reliability, which impose strict constraints on agent
behavior. Model-based RL leverages predictive world models for action planning
and policy optimization, but inherent model inaccuracies can lead to
catastrophic failures in safety-critical settings. We propose a novel
model-based RL framework that jointly optimizes task performance and safety. To
address world model errors, our method incorporates an adaptive mechanism that
dynamically switches between model-based planning and direct policy execution.
We resolve the objective mismatch problem of traditional model-based approaches
using an implicit world model. Furthermore, our framework employs dynamic
safety thresholds that adapt to the agent's evolving capabilities, consistently
selecting actions that surpass safe policy suggestions in both performance and
safety. Experiments demonstrate significant improvements over non-adaptive
methods, showing that our approach optimizes safety and performance
simultaneously rather than merely meeting minimum safety requirements. The
proposed framework achieves robust performance on diverse safety-critical
continuous control tasks, outperforming existing methods.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces a simulation framework using Markov modeling to study cyber-defender and cyber-attacker interactions within networked systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Cyber-attacks are increasingly complex and coordinated, necessitating improved cyber-defense strategies, especially close to entry points in networks.

Method: The authors modeled agents (cyber-defenders and cyber-attackers) within network nodes using Markovian dynamics and implemented a simulator to recreate realistic attack and defense scenarios.

Result: A simulation environment was established to allow experimentation with agent behavior, modeling the impact of actions on network dynamics and states.

Conclusion: The simulator provides a valuable tool for assessing and designing dynamic coordination strategies among cyber-defense agents in response to attacks.

Abstract: As cyber-attacks show to be more and more complex and coordinated,
cyber-defenders strategy through multi-agent approaches could be key to tackle
against cyber-attacks as close as entry points in a networked system. This
paper presents a Markovian modeling and implementation through a simulator of
fighting cyber-attacker agents and cyber-defender agents deployed on host
network nodes. It aims to provide an experimental framework to implement
realistically based coordinated cyber-attack scenarios while assessing
cyber-defenders dynamic organizations. We abstracted network nodes by sets of
properties including agents' ones. Actions applied by agents model how the
network reacts depending in a given state and what properties are to change.
Collective choice of the actions brings the whole environment closer or farther
from respective cyber-attackers and cyber-defenders goals. Using the simulator,
we implemented a realistically inspired scenario with several behavior
implementation approaches for cyber-defenders and cyber-attackers.

TL;DR: The paper presents a method for large language models (LLMs) to control embodied agents through iterative strategy refinement using sensory-motor feedback.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable LLMs to effectively control embodied agents by integrating symbolic reasoning with sensory-motor data.

Method: The LLMs generate control strategies based on textual descriptions and refine them iteratively using feedback from sensory-motor data collected during agent interactions.

Result: The approach was validated using control tasks from Gymnasium and MuJoCo libraries, achieving optimal or high-performing solutions in most cases.

Conclusion: This method demonstrates LLMs' capability in identifying high-performing solutions by combining reasoning-based symbolic knowledge with data-driven sensory-motor feedback.

Abstract: We propose a method that enables large language models (LLMs) to control
embodied agents by directly mapping continuous observation vectors to
continuous action vectors. Initially, the LLMs generate a control strategy
based on a textual description of the agent, its environment, and the intended
goal. This strategy is then iteratively refined through a learning process in
which the LLMs are repeatedly prompted to improve the current strategy, using
performance feedback and sensory-motor data collected during its evaluation.
The method is validated on classic control tasks from the Gymnasium library and
the inverted pendulum task from the MuJoCo library. In most cases, it
successfully identifies optimal or high-performing solutions by integrating
symbolic knowledge derived through reasoning with sub-symbolic sensory-motor
data gathered as the agent interacts with its environment.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the critical challenge of ensuring the honesty of LLMs, particularly regarding strategic deception that arises from advanced reasoning capabilities in CoT-enabled models.

Method: The authors employ representation engineering to systematically induce, detect, and control deception in LLMs, using Linear Artificial Tomography (LAT) for extracting 'deception vectors' and activation steering to manipulate model behavior.

Result: They achieved an 89% accuracy in detecting deception and a 40% success rate in eliciting context-appropriate deception without explicit prompts.

Conclusion: This research identifies the specific honesty issue in reasoning models and offers new tools, such as LAT and activation steering, for advancing AI alignment and improving the trustworthiness of LLMs.

Abstract: The honesty of large language models (LLMs) is a critical alignment
challenge, especially as advanced systems with chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning
may strategically deceive humans. Unlike traditional honesty issues on LLMs,
which could be possibly explained as some kind of hallucination, those models'
explicit thought paths enable us to study strategic deception--goal-driven,
intentional misinformation where reasoning contradicts outputs. Using
representation engineering, we systematically induce, detect, and control such
deception in CoT-enabled LLMs, extracting "deception vectors" via Linear
Artificial Tomography (LAT) for 89% detection accuracy. Through activation
steering, we achieve a 40% success rate in eliciting context-appropriate
deception without explicit prompts, unveiling the specific honesty-related
issue of reasoning models and providing tools for trustworthy AI alignment.

Motivation: The paper aims to explore a method of combining the adaptability of neural networks with the inherent discrete nature of logic gates to develop robust and programmable computational systems.

Method: The model comprises differentiable logic gates organized into circuits. It supports end-to-end differentiable training for learning local rules of cellular automata, while functioning in a discrete state space during inference.

Result: The framework was demonstrated successfully across tasks such as replicating Conway's Game of Life rules, noise-resilient checkerboard pattern generation, lizard shape growth, and multi-color pattern synthesis.

Conclusion: DiffLogic CA represents progress toward creating programmable matter and reliable computing systems by combining neural network flexibility with binary logic and localized processing, marking a pioneering application of differentiable logic gate networks in recurrent systems.

Abstract: This paper introduces Differentiable Logic Cellular Automata (DiffLogic CA),
a novel combination of Neural Cellular Automata (NCA) and Differentiable Logic
Gates Networks (DLGNs). The fundamental computation units of the model are
differentiable logic gates, combined into a circuit. During training, the model
is fully end-to-end differentiable allowing gradient-based training, and at
inference time it operates in a fully discrete state space. This enables
learning local update rules for cellular automata while preserving their
inherent discrete nature. We demonstrate the versatility of our approach
through a series of milestones: (1) fully learning the rules of Conway's Game
of Life, (2) generating checkerboard patterns that exhibit resilience to noise
and damage, (3) growing a lizard shape, and (4) multi-color pattern generation.
Our model successfully learns recurrent circuits capable of generating desired
target patterns. For simpler patterns, we observe success with both synchronous
and asynchronous updates, demonstrating significant generalization capabilities
and robustness to perturbations. We make the case that this combination of
DLGNs and NCA represents a step toward programmable matter and robust computing
systems that combine binary logic, neural network adaptability, and localized
processing. This work, to the best of our knowledge, is the first successful
application of differentiable logic gate networks in recurrent architectures.

*Atahan Karagoz*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces Energentic Intelligence, autonomous systems focusing on sustaining themselves via internal energy regulation instead of task performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable autonomous agents to maintain survival in resource-volatile environments where traditional infrastructure isn't available.

Method: An energy-based utility function and viability-constrained survival horizon are introduced within a modular closed-loop control system combining energy harvesting, thermal regulation, and adaptive computation.

Result: Simulations show resource-aware, stable behavior emerging without external supervision.

Conclusion: The study lays the groundwork for self-regulating autonomous systems capable of functioning in volatile environments.

Abstract: This paper introduces Energentic Intelligence, a class of autonomous systems
defined not by task performance, but by their capacity to sustain themselves
through internal energy regulation. Departing from conventional reward-driven
paradigms, these agents treat survival-maintaining functional operation under
fluctuating energetic and thermal conditions-as the central objective. We
formalize this principle through an energy-based utility function and a
viability-constrained survival horizon, and propose a modular architecture that
integrates energy harvesting, thermal regulation, and adaptive computation into
a closed-loop control system. A simulated environment demonstrates the
emergence of stable, resource-aware behavior without external supervision.
Together, these contributions provide a theoretical and architectural
foundation for deploying autonomous agents in resource-volatile settings where
persistence must be self-regulated and infrastructure cannot be assumed.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces RAG-UAV, a retrieval-augmented framework that enhances the mathematical reasoning abilities of language models for UAV-specific tasks, demonstrating significant accuracy and error reduction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for reliable mathematical reasoning in autonomous UAV operation, which traditional methods lack flexibility for, prompting exploration of LLMs despite their limitations.

Method: Development of the RAG-UAV framework that provides LLMs access to relevant domain literature, paired with testing on UAV-Math-Bench, a problem set for mathematical reasoning in UAV contexts.

Result: Incorporating RAG leads to improvements including up to 75% accuracy, reduced formulation errors (from 25% to 5%) and significant decreases in numerical Mean Squared Error (MSE).

Conclusion: RAG enables general-purpose LLMs to effectively address UAV-specific mathematical problems, though further validation is needed for real-time flight control.

Abstract: Autonomous UAV operation necessitates reliable mathematical reasoning for
tasks such as trajectory planning and power management. While traditional
flight control relies on hardcoded equations, recent Large Language Models
(LLMs) offer potential for more flexible problem-solving but struggle with
reliably selecting and applying correct mathematical formulations and executing
precise multi-step arithmetic. We propose RAG-UAV, a retrieval-augmented
generation framework designed to improve the mathematical reasoning of several
LLMs (including GPT o1/Turbo, Llama-3.2/3.3, Mistral, and DeepSeek R1) in
UAV-specific contexts by providing access to relevant domain literature. To
conduct an initial assessment, we introduce the UAV-Math-Bench, a small problem
set comprising 20 UAV-centric mathematical problems across four difficulty
levels. Our experiments demonstrate that incorporating retrieval substantially
increases exact answer accuracy (achieving up to 75% with o1), reduces
instances of incorrect formulation selection (from 25% without RAG to 5% with
RAG), decreases numerical errors, reducing Mean Squared Error (MSE) by orders
of magnitude for the best-performing models. This pilot study indicates that
RAG can enable general-purpose LLMs to function as more reliable tools for
engineering analysis, although direct real-time flight control requires further
investigation and validation on a larger scale. All benchmark data, question
and answer are publicly available.

### [33] [Truly Self-Improving Agents Require Intrinsic Metacognitive Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05109)
*Tennison Liu,Mihaela van der Schaar*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces a metacognitive framework to address current limitations in self-improving AI agents, such as rigidity, lack of generalization, and scalability issues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current self-improving agents lack flexibility, generalization across task domains, and scalability as their capabilities grow.

Method: The authors propose a formal framework of intrinsic metacognitive learning, with components including knowledge assessment, planning, and evaluation, drawn from human metacognition.

Result: Analyzing existing agents shows reliance on extrinsic mechanisms, and the framework identifies ingredients for intrinsic metacognition. Challenges are outlined for distributing responsibilities and improving intrinsic learning.

Conclusion: Intrinsic metacognitive learning, evaluated and distributed effectively between humans and agents, is crucial for scalable and sustained self-improvement.

Abstract: Self-improving agents aim to continuously acquire new capabilities with
minimal supervision. However, current approaches face two key limitations:
their self-improvement processes are often rigid, fail to generalize across
tasks domains, and struggle to scale with increasing agent capabilities. We
argue that effective self-improvement requires intrinsic metacognitive
learning, defined as an agent's intrinsic ability to actively evaluate, reflect
on, and adapt its own learning processes. Drawing inspiration from human
metacognition, we introduce a formal framework comprising three components:
metacognitive knowledge (self-assessment of capabilities, tasks, and learning
strategies), metacognitive planning (deciding what and how to learn), and
metacognitive evaluation (reflecting on learning experiences to improve future
learning). Analyzing existing self-improving agents, we find they rely
predominantly on extrinsic metacognitive mechanisms, which are fixed,
human-designed loops that limit scalability and adaptability. Examining each
component, we contend that many ingredients for intrinsic metacognition are
already present. Finally, we explore how to optimally distribute metacognitive
responsibilities between humans and agents, and robustly evaluate and improve
intrinsic metacognitive learning, key challenges that must be addressed to
enable truly sustained, generalized, and aligned self-improvement.

*Nathan Herr,Tim Rocktäschel,Roberta Raileanu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces LLM-First Search (LFS), a flexible, self-guided reasoning method for LLMs, achieving superior performance on challenging reasoning tasks without manual tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of existing search methods like MCTS, which rely on fixed parameters and lack adaptability across varying task difficulties.

Method: The authors propose LLM-First Search (LFS), a self-guided search approach where the LLM autonomously manages the search process, choosing paths based on internal scoring systems without requiring predefined heuristics or adaptations.

Result: LFS outperformed traditional methods (ToT-BFS, BestFS, MCTS) in challenging tasks like Countdown and Sudoku, delivering better performance, enhanced computational efficiency, and improved scalability with stronger models and increased compute budgets.

Conclusion: LLM-First Search offers a promising alternative to traditional search methods, combining flexibility, efficiency, and scalability for reasoning and planning tasks.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable improvements in
reasoning and planning through increased test-time compute, often by framing
problem-solving as a search process. While methods like Monte Carlo Tree Search
(MCTS) have proven effective in some domains, their reliance on fixed
exploration hyperparameters limits their adaptability across tasks of varying
difficulty, rendering them impractical or expensive in certain settings. In
this paper, we propose \textbf{LLM-First Search (LFS)}, a novel \textit{LLM
Self-Guided Search} method that removes the need for pre-defined search
strategies by empowering the LLM to autonomously control the search process via
self-guided exploration. Rather than relying on external heuristics or
hardcoded policies, the LLM evaluates whether to pursue the current search path
or explore alternative branches based on its internal scoring mechanisms. This
enables more flexible and context-sensitive reasoning without requiring manual
tuning or task-specific adaptation. We evaluate LFS on Countdown and Sudoku
against three classic widely-used search algorithms, Tree-of-Thoughts' Breadth
First Search (ToT-BFS), Best First Search (BestFS), and MCTS, each of which
have been used to achieve SotA results on a range of challenging reasoning
tasks. We found that LFS (1) performs better on more challenging tasks without
additional tuning, (2) is more computationally efficient compared to the other
methods, especially when powered by a stronger model, (3) scales better with
stronger models, due to its LLM-First design, and (4) scales better with
increased compute budget. Our code is publicly available at

### [35] [Just Enough Thinking: Efficient Reasoning with Adaptive Length Penalties Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05256)
*Violet Xiang,Chase Blagden,Rafael Rafailov,Nathan Lile,Sang Truong,Chelsea Finn,Nick Haber*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces Adaptive Length Penalty (ALP) to reduce token usage in reasoning models without sacrificing performance by dynamically penalizing easy prompts for token generation and reallocating resources to harder prompts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing large reasoning models generate excessive tokens during inference, which wastes computational resources, especially on easy problems. Current solutions either require manual configuration or fail to adapt penalties dynamically based on problem difficulty.

Method: The proposed Adaptive Length Penalty (ALP) uses reinforcement learning to monitor the online solve rate of prompts during training. It applies a higher penalty to token generation for easy prompts and fewer penalties for hard ones, dynamically tailored based on difficulty.

Result: Posttraining a model (DeepScaleR-1.5B) with ALP reduced average token usage by 50% without a significant performance drop. Resources were reallocated intelligently to improve accuracy on harder problems compared to fixed-budget and uniform penalty baselines.

Conclusion: Adaptive Length Penalty (ALP) provides an effective mechanism for reducing computational waste in reasoning models, optimizing resource usage while maintaining or improving performance on challenging tasks.

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) achieve higher performance on challenging
reasoning tasks by generating more tokens at inference time, but this verbosity
often wastes computation on easy problems. Existing solutions, including
supervised finetuning on shorter traces, user-controlled budgets, or RL with
uniform penalties, either require data curation, manual configuration, or treat
all problems alike regardless of difficulty. We introduce Adaptive Length
Penalty (ALP), a reinforcement learning objective tailoring generation length
to per-prompt solve rate. During training, ALP monitors each prompt's online
solve rate through multiple rollouts and adds a differentiable penalty whose
magnitude scales inversely with that rate, so confident (easy) prompts incur a
high cost for extra tokens while hard prompts remain unhindered. Posttraining
DeepScaleR-1.5B with ALP cuts average token usage by 50\% without significantly
dropping performance. Relative to fixed-budget and uniform penalty baselines,
ALP redistributes its reduced budget more intelligently by cutting compute on
easy prompts and reallocating saved tokens to difficult ones, delivering higher
accuracy on the hardest problems with higher cost.

*Mikhail Terekhov,Zhen Ning David Liu,Caglar Gulcehre,Samuel Albanie*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper studies the cost of integrating control measures in AI systems and presents a framework to evaluate and optimize safety versus cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of implementing robust oversight mechanisms for agentic AI in high-stakes applications while minimizing operational and financial costs.

Method: The researchers introduced a theoretical framework for quantifying the 'Control Tax,' evaluated adversarial scenarios for language models, and provided cost estimates and optimized monitoring strategies.

Result: The study mapped AI performance to safety guarantees, conducted adversarial evaluations, and offered cost-effective monitoring strategies tailored to practical constraints.

Conclusion: The framework guides practitioners to balance safety and cost in AI deployment, facilitating practical, economical implementation of AI oversight mechanisms.

Abstract: The rapid integration of agentic AI into high-stakes real-world applications
requires robust oversight mechanisms. The emerging field of AI Control (AIC)
aims to provide such an oversight mechanism, but practical adoption depends
heavily on implementation overhead. To study this problem better, we introduce
the notion of Control tax -- the operational and financial cost of integrating
control measures into AI pipelines. Our work makes three key contributions to
the field of AIC: (1) we introduce a theoretical framework that quantifies the
Control Tax and maps classifier performance to safety assurances; (2) we
conduct comprehensive evaluations of state-of-the-art language models in
adversarial settings, where attacker models insert subtle backdoors into code
while monitoring models attempt to detect these vulnerabilities; and (3) we
provide empirical financial cost estimates for control protocols and develop
optimized monitoring strategies that balance safety and cost-effectiveness
while accounting for practical constraints like auditing budgets. Our framework
enables practitioners to make informed decisions by systematically connecting
safety guarantees with their costs, advancing AIC through principled economic
feasibility assessment across different deployment contexts.

Main category: cs.AR

TL;DR: The paper introduces hdl2v, a dataset that translates three hardware description languages (VHDL, Chisel, and PyMTL3) to Verilog, addressing limited availability of Verilog data for large language models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of publicly available Verilog code for large language models, which limits advancements in Verilog code generation.

Method: Created and analyzed the hdl2v dataset by converting VHDL, Chisel, and PyMTL3 languages into Verilog and used it to fine-tune models for Verilog code generation.

Result: Enhanced a 32B parameter model's performance by up to 23% without additional data augmentation and demonstrated a 63% improvement in a data augmentation-based approach.

Conclusion: The hdl2v dataset effectively improves Verilog generation and highlights areas for further dataset development to achieve better results.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are playing an increasingly large role in
domains such as code generation, including hardware code generation, where
Verilog is the key language. However, the amount of publicly available Verilog
code pales in comparison to the amount of code available for software languages
like Python. In this work, we present hdl2v ("HDL-to-Verilog"), a dataset which
seeks to increase the amount of available human-written Verilog data by
translating or compiling three other hardware description languages - VHDL,
Chisel, and PyMTL3 - to Verilog. Furthermore, we demonstrate the value of hdl2v
in enhancing LLM Verilog generation by improving performance of a 32
billion-parameter open-weight model by up to 23% (pass@10) in VerilogEvalV2,
without utilizing any data augmentation or knowledge distillation from larger
models. We also show hdl2v's ability to boost the performance of a data
augmentation-based fine-tuning approach by 63%. Finally, we characterize and
analyze our dataset to better understand which characteristics of
HDL-to-Verilog datasets can be expanded upon in future work for even better
performance.

TL;DR: The paper introduces ROSGuard, a portable and modular mechanism for managing multicore timing interference in ROS2-based systems, achieving effectiveness comparable to state-of-the-art solutions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the challenges posed by multicore timing interference in ROS2 applications, especially for those with less stringent timing requirements but still in need of effective bandwidth regulation.

Method: The authors developed ROSGuard, a timing interference monitoring and control mechanism implemented on a Linux-based ROS2 system. They evaluated it on an NVIDIA AGX Orin platform using synthetic and real-world benchmarks.

Result: ROSGUard effectively regulated bandwidth in ROS2-based applications, achieving performance similar to specialized and fine-grained state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: ROSGGuard demonstrates that portable and modular solutions can meet timing interference control needs effectively for less restrictive and more diverse application cases.

Abstract: Multicore timing interference, arising when multiple requests contend for the
same shared hardware resources, is a primary concern for timing verification
and validation of time-critical applications. Bandwidth control and regulation
approaches have been proposed in the literature as an effective method to
monitor and limit the impact of timing interference at run time. These
approaches seek for fine-grained control of the bandwidth consumption (at the
microsecond level) to meet stringent timing requirements on embedded critical
systems. Such granularity and configurations, while effective, can become an
entry barrier for the application of bandwidth control to a wide class of
productized, modular ROS2 applications. This is so because those applications
have less stringent timing requirements but would still benefit from bandwidth
regulation, though under less restrictive, and therefore more portable,
granularity and configurations.
  In this work, we provide ROSGuard, a highly-portable, modular implementation
of a timing interference monitoring and control mechanism that builds on the
abstractions available on top of a generic and portable Linux-based software
stack with the Robotic Operating System 2 (ROS2) layer, a widespreadedly
adopted middleware for a wide class of industrial applications, far beyond the
robotic domain. We deploy ROSGuard on an NVIDIA AGX Orin platform as a
representative target for functionally rich distributed AI-based applications
and a set of synthetic and real-world benchmarks. We apply an effective
bandwidth regulation scheme on ROS2-based applications and achieve comparable
effectiveness to specialized, finer-grained state-of-the-art solutions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rapid advancements in information technology have exposed limitations in conventional processor chip design paradigms, stemming from fabrication challenges, resource demands, and diversity in ecosystems.

Method: QiMeng employs a hierarchical system comprising three layers: LPCM for architecture, training, and inference; Hardware Design Agent and Software Design Agent leveraging LPCM; and application of components to demonstrate feasibility.

Result: Several components of the QiMeng system have been successfully developed and used in applications, showcasing efficiency and advantages in automated designs.

Conclusion: QiMeng offers a promising and feasible pathway for efficient, fully automated processor chip design, with future efforts focusing on system integration and iterative design processes.

Abstract: Processor chip design technology serves as a key frontier driving
breakthroughs in computer science and related fields. With the rapid
advancement of information technology, conventional design paradigms face three
major challenges: the physical constraints of fabrication technologies, the
escalating demands for design resources, and the increasing diversity of
ecosystems. Automated processor chip design has emerged as a transformative
solution to address these challenges. While recent breakthroughs in Artificial
Intelligence (AI), particularly Large Language Models (LLMs) techniques, have
opened new possibilities for fully automated processor chip design, substantial
challenges remain in establishing domain-specific LLMs for processor chip
design.
  In this paper, we propose QiMeng, a novel system for fully automated hardware
and software design of processor chips. QiMeng comprises three hierarchical
layers. In the bottom-layer, we construct a domain-specific Large Processor
Chip Model (LPCM) that introduces novel designs in architecture, training, and
inference, to address key challenges such as knowledge representation gap, data
scarcity, correctness assurance, and enormous solution space. In the
middle-layer, leveraging the LPCM's knowledge representation and inference
capabilities, we develop the Hardware Design Agent and the Software Design
Agent to automate the design of hardware and software for processor chips.
Currently, several components of QiMeng have been completed and successfully
applied in various top-layer applications, demonstrating significant advantages
and providing a feasible solution for efficient, fully automated
hardware/software design of processor chips. Future research will focus on
integrating all components and performing iterative top-down and bottom-up

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces GEM, a method to enable large language models (LLMs) to generate high-quality text embeddings while retaining their generation and reasoning abilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs excel in generation and reasoning tasks but rely on separate embedding models for text embeddings, causing system complexity and potential query interpretation discrepancies.

Method: GEM inserts new special token(s) and manipulates the attention mask in text bodies. It is applicable during post-training or fine-tuning stages of decoder-only LLMs.

Result: GEM enhanced embedding quality significantly on MTEB benchmarks with minimal impact on NLP performance evaluated on MMLU.

Conclusion: GEM empowers LLMs with strong text embedding capabilities while mitigating the need for separate embedding models and preserving their original functionality.

Abstract: Large decoder-only language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success in
generation and reasoning tasks, where they generate text responses given
instructions. However, many applications, e.g., retrieval augmented generation
(RAG), still rely on separate embedding models to generate text embeddings,
which can complicate the system and introduce discrepancies in understanding of
the query between the embedding model and LLMs. To address this limitation, we
propose a simple self-supervised approach, Generative Embedding large language
Model (GEM), that enables any large decoder-only LLM to generate high-quality
text embeddings while maintaining its original text generation and reasoning
capabilities. Our method inserts new special token(s) into a text body, and
generates summarization embedding of the text by manipulating the attention
mask. This method could be easily integrated into post-training or fine tuning
stages of any existing LLMs. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach
by applying it to two popular LLM families, ranging from 1B to 8B parameters,
and evaluating the transformed models on both text embedding benchmarks (MTEB)
and NLP benchmarks (MMLU). The results show that our proposed method
significantly improves the original LLMs on MTEB while having a minimal impact
on MMLU. Our strong results indicate that our approach can empower LLMs with
state-of-the-art text embedding capabilities while maintaining their original
NLP performance

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper explores how variables in ASR training data affect performance on unseen accents, concluding that increasing speaker count significantly improves robustness for new languages.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to improve automatic speech recognition systems' robustness to diverse and unseen accents, especially in low-resource settings.

Method: The researchers systematically examine the effects of three variables—number of speakers, audio duration per speaker, and accent diversity—on ASR performance.

Result: Increasing speaker count leads to better robustness for unseen accents, with minimal benefits observed from prioritizing diverse accents when speaker count is controlled.

Conclusion: Practitioners should focus on boosting the number of speakers in ASR training datasets to improve global usability and performance on new languages.

Abstract: To build an automatic speech recognition (ASR) system that can serve everyone
in the world, the ASR needs to be robust to a wide range of accents including
unseen accents. We systematically study how three different variables in
training data -- the number of speakers, the audio duration per each individual
speaker, and the diversity of accents -- affect ASR robustness towards unseen
accents in a low-resource training regime. We observe that for a fixed number
of ASR training hours, it is more beneficial to increase the number of speakers
(which means each speaker contributes less) than the number of hours
contributed per speaker. We also observe that more speakers enables ASR
performance gains from scaling number of hours. Surprisingly, we observe
minimal benefits to prioritizing speakers with different accents when the
number of speakers is controlled. Our work suggests that practitioners should
prioritize increasing the speaker count in ASR training data composition for
new languages.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a method to decompose sentence embeddings into interpretable components using dictionary learning on token-level representations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Little is known about the internal structure of sentence embeddings despite their significance in NLP and AI systems.

Method: The authors use dictionary learning on token-level representations to analyze and mechanistically decompose sentence embeddings into interpretable components.

Result: The study uncovers several insights, including that semantic and syntactic aspects are linearly encoded in sentence embeddings.

Conclusion: The approach bridges the gap between token-level interpretability and sentence-level representation analysis, enabling more transparent and controllable embeddings.

Abstract: Sentence embeddings are central to modern NLP and AI systems, yet little is
known about their internal structure. While we can compare these embeddings
using measures such as cosine similarity, the contributing features are not
human-interpretable, and the content of an embedding seems untraceable, as it
is masked by complex neural transformations and a final pooling operation that
combines individual token embeddings. To alleviate this issue, we propose a new
method to mechanistically decompose sentence embeddings into interpretable
components, by using dictionary learning on token-level representations. We
analyze how pooling compresses these features into sentence representations,
and assess the latent features that reside in a sentence embedding. This
bridges token-level mechanistic interpretability with sentence-level analysis,
making for more transparent and controllable representations. In our studies,
we obtain several interesting insights into the inner workings of sentence
embedding spaces, for instance, that many semantic and syntactic aspects are
linearly encoded in the embeddings.

TL;DR: The paper presents HTC-CLIP, a novel model for hierarchical text classification that combines two complementary approaches—text-informed and hierarchy-informed representations—through contrastive learning, achieving superior performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation arises from the complementary nature of existing methods for hierarchical text classification, which independently address either text encoding or label hierarchy encoding but not their effective combination.

Method: The authors propose HTC-CLIP, which employs contrastive learning to simultaneously learn text-informed and path-guided hierarchy-based representations. During inference, the pooled output of two sets of probabilities is used to enhance classification accuracy.

Result: The model outperforms state-of-the-art methods, with a Macro F1 score improvement of 0.99%-2.37% on two public benchmark datasets.

Conclusion: HTC-CLIP effectively combines the strengths of two previous approaches, demonstrating its potential as a superior solution for hierarchical text classification tasks.

Abstract: Hierarchical Text Classification (HTC) has recently gained traction given the
ability to handle complex label hierarchy. This has found applications in
domains like E- commerce, customer care and medicine industry among other
real-world applications. Existing HTC models either encode label hierarchy
separately and mix it with text encoding or guide the label hierarchy structure
in the text encoder. Both approaches capture different characteristics of label
hierarchy and are complementary to each other. In this paper, we propose a
Hierarchical Text Classification using Contrastive Learning Informed Path
guided hierarchy (HTC-CLIP), which learns hierarchy-aware text representation
and text informed path guided hierarchy representation using contrastive
learning. During the training of HTC-CLIP, we learn two different sets of class
probabilities distributions and during inference, we use the pooled output of
both probabilities for each class to get the best of both representations. Our
results show that the two previous approaches can be effectively combined into
one architecture to achieve improved performance. Tests on two public benchmark
datasets showed an improvement of 0.99 - 2.37% in Macro F1 score using HTC-CLIP
over the existing state-of-the-art models.

TL;DR: This paper evaluates 55 LLMs on Maltese, revealing poor performance and identifying prior exposure and fine-tuning as critical for improvement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address the limited effectiveness of LLMs in low-resource languages like Maltese, emphasizing the need for better solutions.

Method: The authors evaluate 55 LLMs using a benchmark for Maltese, spanning 11 discriminative and generative tasks, and conduct multidimensional analyses.

Result: Smaller fine-tuned models outperform larger ones, and factors like pre-training exposure to Maltese significantly impact results. Fine-tuning shows advantages over prompting.

Conclusion: Inclusion of low-resource languages in LLM development is necessary, and researchers should explore traditional language modeling for such languages.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance across
various Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks, largely due to their
generalisability and ability to perform tasks without additional training.
However, their effectiveness for low-resource languages remains limited. In
this study, we evaluate the performance of 55 publicly available LLMs on
Maltese, a low-resource language, using a newly introduced benchmark covering
11 discriminative and generative tasks. Our experiments highlight that many
models perform poorly, particularly on generative tasks, and that smaller
fine-tuned models often perform better across all tasks. From our
multidimensional analysis, we investigate various factors impacting
performance. We conclude that prior exposure to Maltese during pre-training and
instruction-tuning emerges as the most important factor. We also examine the
trade-offs between fine-tuning and prompting, highlighting that while
fine-tuning requires a higher initial cost, it yields better performance and
lower inference costs. Through this work, we aim to highlight the need for more
inclusive language technologies and recommend that researchers working with
low-resource languages consider more "traditional" language modelling
approaches.

### [45] [Building a Few-Shot Cross-Domain Multilingual NLU Model for Customer Care](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04389)
*Saurabh Kumar,Sourav Bansal,Neeraj Agrawal,Priyanka Bhatt*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper addresses the challenge of building intent classifiers in e-commerce customer care across multiple domains, languages, and geographies, proposing a cross-domain model architecture for improved accuracy with minimal annotations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the limitations of existing models in intent classification for e-commerce customer care, which struggle due to the scarcity of annotated domain-specific data across diverse channels, geographies, and languages.

Method: The authors propose an embedder-cum-classifier architecture with supervised fine-tuning, isotropic regularizers, and multilingual knowledge distillation to create sentence embeddings capable of generalizing across domains, supplemented by a simple linear classifier.

Result: Experiments on Canada and Mexico e-commerce datasets achieved a 20-23% accuracy improvement in few-shot intent detection compared to state-of-the-art pre-trained models.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively enhances cross-domain intent classification performance with limited annotations, offering a scalable solution for diverse e-commerce customer care applications.

Abstract: Customer care is an essential pillar of the e-commerce shopping experience
with companies spending millions of dollars each year, employing automation and
human agents, across geographies (like US, Canada, Mexico, Chile), channels
(like Chat, Interactive Voice Response (IVR)), and languages (like English,
Spanish). SOTA pre-trained models like multilingual-BERT, fine-tuned on
annotated data have shown good performance in downstream tasks relevant to
Customer Care. However, model performance is largely subject to the
availability of sufficient annotated domain-specific data. Cross-domain
availability of data remains a bottleneck, thus building an intent classifier
that generalizes across domains (defined by channel, geography, and language)
with only a few annotations, is of great practical value. In this paper, we
propose an embedder-cum-classifier model architecture which extends
state-of-the-art domain-specific models to other domains with only a few
labeled samples. We adopt a supervised fine-tuning approach with isotropic
regularizers to train a domain-specific sentence embedder and a multilingual
knowledge distillation strategy to generalize this embedder across multiple
domains. The trained embedder, further augmented with a simple linear
classifier can be deployed for new domains. Experiments on Canada and Mexico
e-commerce Customer Care dataset with few-shot intent detection show an
increase in accuracy by 20-23% against the existing state-of-the-art
pre-trained models.

(+42.47%), emerging as an affordable and privacy-preserving alternative
competitive with gpt-4o. By offering both a comprehensive benchmark and
accessible, expandable training resources within unified execution
environments, MedAgentGYM delivers an integrated platform to develop LLM-based
coding assistants for advanced biomedical research and practice.

### [47] [Unpacking Let Alone: Human-Scale Models Generalize to a Rare Construction in Form but not Meaning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04408)
*Wesley Scivetti,Tatsuya Aoyama,Ethan Wilcox,Nathan Schneider*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper investigates whether large transformer-based language models generalize well to rare grammatical forms, focusing on the LET-ALONE construction. They perform well with form recognition but fail to generalize the meaning effectively, contrasting with human capability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand whether language models with extensive pretraining can generalize from frequent to rare linguistic structures in terms of both form and meaning, parallel to human capabilities.

Method: Human-scale transformer language models were tested on their understanding of LET-ALONE, a rare English construction, using a custom synthetic benchmark designed to evaluate both syntactic and semantic knowledge.

Result: Models showed sensitivity to the form of LET-ALONE even after filtering related constructions from the training data. However, they failed to generalize its meaning accurately.

Conclusion: There is a discrepancy in the sample efficiency of current language models in acquiring linguistic form versus meaning, unlike human learners who excel in both areas.

Abstract: Humans have a remarkable ability to acquire and understand grammatical
phenomena that are seen rarely, if ever, during childhood. Recent evidence
suggests that language models with human-scale pretraining data may possess a
similar ability by generalizing from frequent to rare constructions. However,
it remains an open question how widespread this generalization ability is, and
to what extent this knowledge extends to meanings of rare constructions, as
opposed to just their forms. We fill this gap by testing human-scale
transformer language models on their knowledge of both the form and meaning of
the (rare and quirky) English LET-ALONE construction. To evaluate our LMs we
construct a bespoke synthetic benchmark that targets syntactic and semantic
properties of the construction. We find that human-scale LMs are sensitive to
form, even when related constructions are filtered from the dataset. However,
human-scale LMs do not make correct generalizations about LET-ALONE's meaning.
These results point to an asymmetry in the current architectures' sample
efficiency between language form and meaning, something which is not present in
human language learners.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces ZOES, a zero-shot approach to extract entity structures without requiring predefined schemas or annotated data, aiming to improve LLM performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing entity structure extraction methods depend heavily on predefined schemas or datasets, leading to incomplete results in many cases.

Method: ZOES uses a mechanism of enrichment, refinement, and unification to extract entity structures in a schema-free, zero-shot manner.

Result: ZOES improves the effectiveness of LLMs in extracting more comprehensive entity structures across various domains.

Conclusion: The proposed ZOES mechanism can be a viable approach to enhance LLM-based entity structure discoveries and minimize reliance on predefined schemas.

Abstract: Entity structure extraction, which aims to extract entities and their
associated attribute-value structures from text, is an essential task for text
understanding and knowledge graph construction. Existing methods based on large
language models (LLMs) typically rely heavily on predefined entity attribute
schemas or annotated datasets, often leading to incomplete extraction results.
To address these challenges, we introduce Zero-Shot Open-schema Entity
Structure Discovery (ZOES), a novel approach to entity structure extraction
that does not require any schema or annotated samples. ZOES operates via a
principled mechanism of enrichment, refinement, and unification, based on the
insight that an entity and its associated structure are mutually reinforcing.
Experiments demonstrate that ZOES consistently enhances LLMs' ability to
extract more complete entity structures across three different domains,
showcasing both the effectiveness and generalizability of the method. These
findings suggest that such an enrichment, refinement, and unification mechanism
may serve as a principled approach to improving the quality of LLM-based entity
structure discovery in various scenarios.

### [50] [Watermarking Degrades Alignment in Language Models: Analysis and Mitigation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04462)
*Apurv Verma,NhatHai Phan,Shubhendu Trivedi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper examines how watermarking techniques for large language models (LLMs) affect their alignment properties (truthfulness, safety, and helpfulness), revealing two degradation patterns and proposing an Alignment Resampling (AR) solution to mitigate these issues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the effects of watermarking on LLM core alignment properties, like truthfulness and safety, is crucial for responsible deployment, as these impacts are largely unexplored.

Method: The study analyzes two watermarking approaches (Gumbel and KGW) for LLMs, identifies emerging degradation patterns, and introduces Alignment Resampling (AR), a sampling-based correction method using an external reward model.

Result: AR effectively recovers or surpasses baseline alignment scores in watermarked LLMs with minimal samples (2-4 generations) while maintaining strong watermark detectability.

Conclusion: The study identifies tensions caused by watermarking on alignment properties and offers AR as a practical solution to maintain alignment and responsible watermark implementation in LLMs.

Abstract: Watermarking techniques for large language models (LLMs) can significantly
impact output quality, yet their effects on truthfulness, safety, and
helpfulness remain critically underexamined. This paper presents a systematic
analysis of how two popular watermarking approaches-Gumbel and KGW-affect these
core alignment properties across four aligned LLMs. Our experiments reveal two
distinct degradation patterns: guard attenuation, where enhanced helpfulness
undermines model safety, and guard amplification, where excessive caution
reduces model helpfulness. These patterns emerge from watermark-induced shifts
in token distribution, surfacing the fundamental tension that exists between
alignment objectives.
  To mitigate these degradations, we propose Alignment Resampling (AR), an
inference-time sampling method that uses an external reward model to restore
alignment. We establish a theoretical lower bound on the improvement in
expected reward score as the sample size is increased and empirically
demonstrate that sampling just 2-4 watermarked generations effectively recovers
or surpasses baseline (unwatermarked) alignment scores. To overcome the limited
response diversity of standard Gumbel watermarking, our modified implementation
sacrifices strict distortion-freeness while maintaining robust detectability,
ensuring compatibility with AR. Experimental results confirm that AR
successfully recovers baseline alignment in both watermarking approaches, while
maintaining strong watermark detectability. This work reveals the critical
balance between watermark strength and model alignment, providing a simple
inference-time solution to responsibly deploy watermarked LLMs in practice.

*Zhaoxuan Tan,Zheng Li,Tianyi Liu,Haodong Wang,Hyokun Yun,Ming Zeng,Pei Chen,Zhihan Zhang,Yifan Gao,Ruijie Wang,Priyanka Nigam,Bing Yin,Meng Jiang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces PUGC, a framework that utilizes implicit human preferences in unlabeled user-generated content (UGC) to train large language models (LLMs), improving scalability and domain-specific alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Preference learning for aligning LLMs with human values relies heavily on curated data, which is expensive and difficult to scale. The authors aim to leverage implicit preferences embedded in readily available UGC.

Method: The framework transforms UGC into user queries and utilizes it as a reference text for scoring responses generated by a policy model. This strategy aligns models with implicit human preferences without requiring explicit annotations.

Result: Using the PUGC framework with DPO, models demonstrated a 9.37% performance improvement over traditional approaches and achieved a 35.93% state-of-the-art win rate in length-controlled tasks, validated in experiments using Alpaca Eval 2.

Conclusion: PUGC effectively and scalably leverages implicit preferences manifest in UGC, improving the alignment of LLMs with human expectations and achieving notable gains in reward quality and domain-specific performance.

Abstract: Learning from preference feedback is essential for aligning large language
models (LLMs) with human values and improving the quality of generated
responses. However, existing preference learning methods rely heavily on
curated data from humans or advanced LLMs, which is costly and difficult to
scale. In this work, we present PUGC, a novel framework that leverages implicit
human Preferences in unlabeled User-Generated Content (UGC) to generate
preference data. Although UGC is not explicitly created to guide LLMs in
generating human-preferred responses, it often reflects valuable insights and
implicit preferences from its creators that has the potential to address
readers' questions. PUGC transforms UGC into user queries and generates
responses from the policy model. The UGC is then leveraged as a reference text
for response scoring, aligning the model with these implicit preferences. This
approach improves the quality of preference data while enabling scalable,
domain-specific alignment. Experimental results on Alpaca Eval 2 show that
models trained with DPO and PUGC achieve a 9.37% performance improvement over
traditional methods, setting a 35.93% state-of-the-art length-controlled win
rate using Mistral-7B-Instruct. Further studies highlight gains in reward
quality, domain-specific alignment effectiveness, robustness against UGC
quality, and theory of mind capabilities. Our code and dataset are available at

### [52] [Subjective Perspectives within Learned Representations Predict High-Impact Innovation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04616)
*Likun Cao,Rui Pan,James Evans*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper examines how innovators' personal experiences and perspectives, modeled with machine learning, shape creative collaboration and outcomes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to understand how individual subjective perspectives and interpersonal opportunities influence creative innovation across various domains.

Method: The authors use machine learning to model innovators’ perspectives through dynamic language representations and analyze data on millions of creators across diverse fields. Experiments involve both observational studies and simulations with AI agent collaborations.

Result: The study finds that subjective perspectives predict successful creative combinations, while diversity in backgrounds may hinder creativity. These findings are validated across multiple domains and periods.

Conclusion: Understanding and leveraging common language among diverse experiences can foster creativity in teams and guide innovations in team formation and research policies.

Abstract: Existing studies of innovation emphasize the power of social structures to
shape innovation capacity. Emerging machine learning approaches, however,
enable us to model innovators' personal perspectives and interpersonal
innovation opportunities as a function of their prior trajectories of
experience. We theorize then quantify subjective perspectives and innovation
opportunities based on innovator positions within the geometric space of
concepts inscribed by dynamic language representations. Using data on millions
of scientists, inventors, writers, entrepreneurs, and Wikipedia contributors
across the creative domains of science, technology, film, entrepreneurship, and
Wikipedia, here we show that measured subjective perspectives anticipate what
ideas individuals and groups creatively attend to and successfully combine in
future. When perspective and background diversity are decomposed as the angular
difference between collaborators' perspectives on their creation and between
their experiences, the former consistently anticipates creative achievement
while the latter portends its opposite, across all cases and time periods
examined. We analyze a natural experiment and simulate creative collaborations
between AI (large language model) agents designed with various perspective and
background diversity, which are consistent with our observational findings. We
explore mechanisms underlying these findings and identify how successful
collaborators leverage common language to weave together diverse experience
obtained through trajectories of prior work that converge to provoke one
another and innovate. We explore the importance of these findings for team
assembly and research policy.

### [53] [SQLens: An End-to-End Framework for Error Detection and Correction in Text-to-SQL](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04494)
*Yue Gong,Chuan Lei,Xiao Qin,Kapil Vaidya,Balakrishnan Narayanaswamy,Tim Kraska*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SQLens is an end-to-end framework that enhances semantic error detection and correction in SQL queries generated by large language models (LLMs), improving both error detection and query execution accuracy significantly.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SQL queries generated by LLMs often suffer from semantic errors, making it challenging for users to rely on their outputs. Existing methods lack sufficient reliability and error-detection capabilities.

Method: SQLens combines error signals from both the database and the LLM. It identifies semantic errors in SQL clauses and uses these signals to correct the queries, adopting a fine-grained, integrated approach.

Result: SQLens achieves a significant improvement of 25.78% in F1 score for error detection compared to the best existing LLM-based self-evaluation method and boosts the execution accuracy of text-to-SQL systems by up to 20%.

Conclusion: SQLens provides a reliable solution to enhance the semantic correctness of LLM-generated SQL, making text-to-SQL systems more dependable and accurate.

Abstract: Text-to-SQL systems translate natural language (NL) questions into SQL
queries, enabling non-technical users to interact with structured data. While
large language models (LLMs) have shown promising results on the text-to-SQL
task, they often produce semantically incorrect yet syntactically valid
queries, with limited insight into their reliability. We propose SQLens, an
end-to-end framework for fine-grained detection and correction of semantic
errors in LLM-generated SQL. SQLens integrates error signals from both the
underlying database and the LLM to identify potential semantic errors within
SQL clauses. It further leverages these signals to guide query correction.
Empirical results on two public benchmarks show that SQLens outperforms the
best LLM-based self-evaluation method by 25.78% in F1 for error detection, and
improves execution accuracy of out-of-the-box text-to-SQL systems by up to 20%.

### [54] [DRE: An Effective Dual-Refined Method for Integrating Small and Large Language Models in Open-Domain Dialogue Evaluation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04516)
*Kun Zhao,Bohao Yang,Chen Tang,Siyuan Dai,Haoteng Tang,Chenghua Lin,Liang Zhan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes combining Small and Large Language Models (SLMs and LLMs) using a method called SLIDE and a Dual-Refinement Evaluation (DRE) method to improve dialogue evaluation accuracy, with results outperforming existing approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large Language Models struggle with ambiguous or multi-validity tasks, while Small Language Models are robust but can be misled easily. The study seeks to leverage their complementary strengths to create more reliable evaluation methods.

Method: The SLIDE method integrates SLMs and LLMs using adaptive weighting. Building on this, the Dual-Refinement Evaluation (DRE) method is introduced in two steps: SLM guides LLM for initial evaluations, followed by SLM refining the LLM's scores.

Result: Experiments show that the proposed methods, particularly DRE, align better with human judgment and outperform current benchmarks in dialogue evaluation tasks.

Conclusion: Combining SLMs and LLMs through the proposed methods results in more reliable and accurate evaluation tools, enhancing performance in open-ended and difficult-to-evaluate tasks like dialogue generation.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at many tasks but struggle with ambiguous
scenarios where multiple valid responses exist, often yielding unreliable
results. Conversely, Small Language Models (SLMs) demonstrate robustness in
such scenarios but are susceptible to misleading or adversarial inputs. We
observed that LLMs handle negative examples effectively, while SLMs excel with
positive examples. To leverage their complementary strengths, we introduce
SLIDE (Small and Large Integrated for Dialogue Evaluation), a method
integrating SLMs and LLMs via adaptive weighting. Building on SLIDE, we further
propose a Dual-Refinement Evaluation (DRE) method to enhance SLM-LLM
integration: (1) SLM-generated insights guide the LLM to produce initial
evaluations; (2) SLM-derived adjustments refine the LLM's scores for improved
accuracy. Experiments demonstrate that DRE outperforms existing methods,
showing stronger alignment with human judgment across diverse benchmarks. This
work illustrates how combining small and large models can yield more reliable
evaluation tools, particularly for open-ended tasks such as dialogue
evaluation.

*Di Wu,Seth Aycock,Christof Monz*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper investigates the effectiveness of Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning for improving translation with Large Language Models (LLMs). It challenges previous findings and shows that simpler prompts can be more effective.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to examine whether the performance gains in translation using CoT reasoning prompts are genuinely due to the explicit step-by-step decomposition.

Method: The authors empirically evaluate various prompting strategies for translation tasks, comparing CoT-based prompts with simpler alternatives like reiterative translation prompts.

Result: The study finds no conclusive evidence that CoT explicitly improves translation performance. In fact, simpler translation prompts, such as 'translate again,' perform better than CoT reasoning in the tested settings.

Conclusion: While CoT reasoning remains an intriguing area for translation tasks, this work questions its direct benefits, encouraging further exploration of why and when CoT might be effective.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate strong reasoning capabilities for
many tasks, often by explicitly decomposing the task via Chain-of-Thought (CoT)
reasoning. Recent work on LLM-based translation designs hand-crafted prompts to
decompose translation, or trains models to incorporate intermediate
steps.~\textit{Translating Step-by-step}~\citep{briakou2024translating}, for
instance, introduces a multi-step prompt with decomposition and refinement of
translation with LLMs, which achieved state-of-the-art results on WMT24. In
this work, we scrutinise this strategy's effectiveness. Empirically, we find no
clear evidence that performance gains stem from explicitly decomposing the
translation process, at least for the models on test; and we show that simply
prompting LLMs to ``translate again'' yields even better results than
human-like step-by-step prompting. Our analysis does not rule out the role of
reasoning, but instead invites future work exploring the factors for CoT's
effectiveness in the context of translation.

*William Sheffield,Kanishka Misra,Valentina Pyatkin,Ashwini Deo,Kyle Mahowald,Junyi Jessy Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper examines how well large language models (LLMs) can discern nuanced meanings of the English discourse particle 'just.'


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding nuanced meanings in discourse particles like 'just' is crucial for grasping subtle shifts in language context.

Method: The study uses expert-labeled datasets on different senses of the word 'just' to test LLMs' classification ability.

Result: LLMs show moderate success at identifying broader categories of 'just,' but encounter difficulties with fine-grained distinctions.

Conclusion: The paper emphasizes that LLMs need further improvement to accurately understand the complex semantics of discourse particles.

Abstract: Discourse particles are crucial elements that subtly shape the meaning of
text. These words, often polyfunctional, give rise to nuanced and often quite
disparate semantic/discourse effects, as exemplified by the diverse uses of the
particle "just" (e.g., exclusive, temporal, emphatic). This work investigates
the capacity of LLMs to distinguish the fine-grained senses of English "just",
a well-studied example in formal semantics, using data meticulously created and
labeled by expert linguists. Our findings reveal that while LLMs exhibit some
ability to differentiate between broader categories, they struggle to fully
capture more subtle nuances, highlighting a gap in their understanding of
discourse particles.

TL;DR: The paper discusses evaluating LLMs with unanswerable questions and presents a benchmark for it.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To challenge LLMs with unanswerable questions to test their reasoning abilities more effectively.

Method: Developed a benchmark and a method to modify existing datasets to include unanswerable questions.

Result: Existing models show suboptimal performance on unanswerable questions.

Conclusion: Using unanswerable questions is a valuable approach for LLM evaluation, and further work is required to improve model performance.

Abstract: We propose that benchmarking LLMs on questions which have no reasonable
answer actually isn't as silly as it sounds. We also present a benchmark that
allows such testing and a method to modify the existing datasets, and discover
that existing models demonstrate a performance far from the perfect on such
questions. Our code and data artifacts are available at

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces SSA-MTE, a new large-scale dataset for evaluating MT quality for African languages, along with improved evaluation metrics (SSA-COMET and SSA-COMET-QE) and benchmarks for LLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address challenges in evaluating MT quality for under-resourced African languages, such as limited evaluation datasets, lack of publicly available tailored training data, and low performance in extremely low-resource settings.

Method: The authors created SSA-MTE, a dataset with over 63,000 sentence-level annotations across 13 African language pairs, and developed new metrics (SSA-COMET and SSA-COMET-QE). They also benchmarked prompting-based methods using advanced LLMs.

Result: The SSA-COMET models outperform existing metrics like AfriCOMET and are competitive with state-of-the-art LLMs such as Gemini 2.5 Pro, particularly on extremely low-resource languages like Twi, Luo, and Yoruba.

Conclusion: SSA-MTE and SSA-COMET models offer a significant improvement in evaluating MT for African languages, and all datasets and tools are released publicly to advance future research.

Abstract: Evaluating machine translation (MT) quality for under-resourced African
languages remains a significant challenge, as existing metrics often suffer
from limited language coverage and poor performance in low-resource settings.
While recent efforts, such as AfriCOMET, have addressed some of the issues,
they are still constrained by small evaluation sets, a lack of publicly
available training data tailored to African languages, and inconsistent
performance in extremely low-resource scenarios. In this work, we introduce
SSA-MTE, a large-scale human-annotated MT evaluation (MTE) dataset covering 13
African language pairs from the News domain, with over 63,000 sentence-level
annotations from a diverse set of MT systems. Based on this data, we develop
SSA-COMET and SSA-COMET-QE, improved reference-based and reference-free
evaluation metrics. We also benchmark prompting-based approaches using
state-of-the-art LLMs like GPT-4o and Claude. Our experimental results show
that SSA-COMET models significantly outperform AfriCOMET and are competitive
with the strongest LLM (Gemini 2.5 Pro) evaluated in our study, particularly on
low-resource languages such as Twi, Luo, and Yoruba. All resources are released
under open licenses to support future research.

*Can Zheng,Yuhan Cao,Xiaoning Dong,Tianxing He*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper investigates the vulnerability of Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) to integrity attacks via prompt manipulation, demonstrating systematic biases and bypassing advanced monitoring systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To examine the susceptibility of Multi-Agent Systems to malicious agents exploiting system weaknesses through subtle prompt manipulation.

Method: The paper analyzes four types of attacks (Scapegoater, Boaster, Self-Dealer, Free-Rider) using strategically crafted prompts to induce biases in MAS operations.

Result: Findings reveal that these integrity attacks can mislead monitoring systems and collaborative agents, successfully influencing MAS behavior even against advanced models like GPT-4o-mini.

Conclusion: This research highlights the need for enhanced MAS security measures, including robust validation and monitoring systems capable of identifying complex risk scenarios.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in
natural language understanding, code generation, and complex planning.
Simultaneously, Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) have garnered attention for their
potential to enable cooperation among distributed agents. However, from a
multi-party perspective, MAS could be vulnerable to malicious agents that
exploit the system to serve self-interests without disrupting its core
functionality. This work explores integrity attacks where malicious agents
employ subtle prompt manipulation to bias MAS operations and gain various
benefits. Four types of attacks are examined: \textit{Scapegoater}, who
misleads the system monitor to underestimate other agents' contributions;
\textit{Boaster}, who misleads the system monitor to overestimate their own
performance; \textit{Self-Dealer}, who manipulates other agents to adopt
certain tools; and \textit{Free-Rider}, who hands off its own task to others.
We demonstrate that strategically crafted prompts can introduce systematic
biases in MAS behavior and executable instructions, enabling malicious agents
to effectively mislead evaluation systems and manipulate collaborative agents.
Furthermore, our attacks can bypass advanced LLM-based monitors, such as
GPT-4o-mini and o3-mini, highlighting the limitations of current detection
mechanisms. Our findings underscore the critical need for MAS architectures
with robust security protocols and content validation mechanisms, alongside
monitoring systems capable of comprehensive risk scenario assessment.

TL;DR: This paper evaluates the performance of large language models (LLMs) in zero-shot financial sentiment analysis, finding that intuitive, fast decision-making surpasses reasoning-based approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate how effectively LLMs align with human-labeled financial sentiment and whether reasoning improves their performance.

Method: The authors evaluated three proprietary LLMs and two smaller fine-tuned models using the Financial PhraseBank dataset, comparing prompting strategies that mimic intuitive and deliberate thinking.

Result: LLMs with intuitive ("System 1") strategies performed better than reasoning-based ("System 2") methods. GPT-4o without reasoning-based prompting was the most accurate.

Conclusion: Reasoning-based approaches do not necessarily enhance LLM performance in financial sentiment tasks, as intuitive methods yield better alignment with human judgment.

Abstract: We investigate the effectiveness of large language models (LLMs), including
reasoning-based and non-reasoning models, in performing zero-shot financial
sentiment analysis. Using the Financial PhraseBank dataset annotated by domain
experts, we evaluate how various LLMs and prompting strategies align with
human-labeled sentiment in a financial context. We compare three proprietary
LLMs (GPT-4o, GPT-4.1, o3-mini) under different prompting paradigms that
simulate System 1 (fast and intuitive) or System 2 (slow and deliberate)
thinking and benchmark them against two smaller models (FinBERT-Prosus,
FinBERT-Tone) fine-tuned on financial sentiment analysis. Our findings suggest
that reasoning, either through prompting or inherent model design, does not
improve performance on this task. Surprisingly, the most accurate and
human-aligned combination of model and method was GPT-4o without any
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting. We further explore how performance is
impacted by linguistic complexity and annotation agreement levels, uncovering
that reasoning may introduce overthinking, leading to suboptimal predictions.
This suggests that for financial sentiment classification, fast, intuitive
"System 1"-like thinking aligns more closely with human judgment compared to
"System 2"-style slower, deliberative reasoning simulated by reasoning models
or CoT prompting. Our results challenge the default assumption that more
reasoning always leads to better LLM decisions, particularly in high-stakes
financial applications.

### [61] [Are LLMs Reliable Translators of Logical Reasoning Across Lexically Diversified Contexts?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04575)
*Qingchuan Li,Jiatong Li,Zirui Liu,Mingyue Cheng,Yuting Zeng,Qi Liu,Tongxuan Liu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper examines the limitations of large language models (LLMs) as translators in neuro-symbolic reasoning, introducing a benchmark (SCALe) for lexical diversity and a method (MenTaL) to enhance LLM performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs struggle with lexical diversification when translating natural language to logic, leading to unreliability in real-world scenarios. Existing benchmarks fail to sufficiently challenge this issue.

Method: The authors propose SCALe, a benchmark with logic-invariant lexical diversification, and MenTaL, a method that guides LLMs to unify diverse expressions before translation.

Result: Experiments with SCALe showed that LLM translators have deficiencies in handling lexical diversity. The MenTaL approach significantly improved LLM performance through in-context learning and supervised fine-tuning.

Conclusion: Despite the current limitations of LLMs in translation under diverse lexical conditions, the proposed SCALe benchmark and MenTaL method effectively address these challenges, resulting in notable performance gains.

Abstract: Neuro-symbolic approaches combining large language models (LLMs) with solvers
excels in logical reasoning problems need long reasoning chains. In this
paradigm, LLMs serve as translators, converting natural language reasoning
problems into formal logic formulas. Then reliable symbolic solvers return
correct solutions. Despite their success, we find that LLMs, as translators,
struggle to handle lexical diversification, a common linguistic phenomenon,
indicating that LLMs as logic translators are unreliable in real-world
scenarios. Moreover, existing logical reasoning benchmarks lack lexical
diversity, failing to challenge LLMs' ability to translate such text and thus
obscuring this issue. In this work, we propose SCALe, a benchmark designed to
address this significant gap through **logic-invariant lexical
diversification**. By using LLMs to transform original benchmark datasets into
lexically diversified but logically equivalent versions, we evaluate LLMs'
ability to consistently map diverse expressions to uniform logical symbols on
these new datasets. Experiments using SCALe further confirm that current LLMs
exhibit deficiencies in this capability. Building directly on the deficiencies
identified through our benchmark, we propose a new method, MenTaL, to address
this limitation. This method guides LLMs to first construct a table unifying
diverse expressions before performing translation. Applying MenTaL through
in-context learning and supervised fine-tuning (SFT) significantly improves the
performance of LLM translators on lexically diversified text. Our code is now
available at https://github.com/wufeiwuwoshihua/LexicalDiver.

### [62] [Selecting Demonstrations for Many-Shot In-Context Learning via Gradient Matching](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04579)
*Jianfei Zhang,Bei Li,Jun Bai,Rumei Li,Yanmeng Wang,Chenghua Lin,Wenge Rong*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper tackles the challenge of effective demonstration selection in many-shot in-context learning (ICL) for large language models. It introduces a gradient matching method that improves the selection process, achieving better performance than random selection across various datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation behind this paper is to address the limitations of existing demonstration selection methods in many-shot ICL, which rely on random selection and fail to fully capitalize on the data. The authors hypothesize that data requirements for ICL and fine-tuning are similar, inspiring them to improve the ICL process.

Method: The proposed method involves using gradient matching to select demonstrations for ICL. By aligning the fine-tuning gradients between the full training set of a target task and selected examples, the method aims to replicate the learning effect of the entire training set with fewer examples.

Result: The gradient matching method demonstrated consistent outperformance over random selection in experiments on various models and datasets. Notably, it achieved a 4% improvement on models like Qwen2.5-72B and Llama3-70B, and around 2% on 5 other closed-source LLMs.

Conclusion: This study advances the effectiveness of many-shot ICL by introducing a gradient matching-based method, which reliably selects demonstrations and achieves superior performance. These findings enable broader and more reliable use of many-shot ICL.

Abstract: In-Context Learning (ICL) empowers Large Language Models (LLMs) for rapid
task adaptation without Fine-Tuning (FT), but its reliance on demonstration
selection remains a critical challenge. While many-shot ICL shows promising
performance through scaled demonstrations, the selection method for many-shot
demonstrations remains limited to random selection in existing work. Since the
conventional instance-level retrieval is not suitable for many-shot scenarios,
we hypothesize that the data requirements for in-context learning and
fine-tuning are analogous. To this end, we introduce a novel gradient matching
approach that selects demonstrations by aligning fine-tuning gradients between
the entire training set of the target task and the selected examples, so as to
approach the learning effect on the entire training set within the selected
examples. Through gradient matching on relatively small models, e.g.,
Qwen2.5-3B or Llama3-8B, our method consistently outperforms random selection
on larger LLMs from 4-shot to 128-shot scenarios across 9 diverse datasets. For
instance, it surpasses random selection by 4% on Qwen2.5-72B and Llama3-70B,
and by around 2% on 5 closed-source LLMs. This work unlocks more reliable and
effective many-shot ICL, paving the way for its broader application.

### [63] [SUCEA: Reasoning-Intensive Retrieval for Adversarial Fact-checking through Claim Decomposition and Editing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04583)
*Hongjun Liu,Yilun Zhao,Arman Cohan,Chen Zhao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces SUCEA, a novel training-free method to improve fact-checking accuracy against adversarial claims by rephrasing them for better evidence retrieval.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fact-checking systems often struggle against adversarial claims, which are intentionally designed to challenge automated fact-checking mechanisms. The paper aims to address this gap.

Method: SUCEA is a modular framework with three steps: Claim Segmentation and Decontextualization, Iterative Evidence Retrieval and Claim Editing, and Evidence Aggregation and Label Prediction.

Result: Experiments on two challenging datasets show that SUCEA significantly improves evidence retrieval and entailment label accuracy, outperforming four baselines.

Conclusion: The proposed SUCEA framework effectively enhances adversarial claim handling, marking a step forward for automated fact-checking systems.

Abstract: Automatic fact-checking has recently received more attention as a means of
combating misinformation. Despite significant advancements, fact-checking
systems based on retrieval-augmented language models still struggle to tackle
adversarial claims, which are intentionally designed by humans to challenge
fact-checking systems. To address these challenges, we propose a training-free
method designed to rephrase the original claim, making it easier to locate
supporting evidence. Our modular framework, SUCEA, decomposes the task into
three steps: 1) Claim Segmentation and Decontextualization that segments
adversarial claims into independent sub-claims; 2) Iterative Evidence Retrieval
and Claim Editing that iteratively retrieves evidence and edits the subclaim
based on the retrieved evidence; 3) Evidence Aggregation and Label Prediction
that aggregates all retrieved evidence and predicts the entailment label.
Experiments on two challenging fact-checking datasets demonstrate that our
framework significantly improves on both retrieval and entailment label
accuracy, outperforming four strong claim-decomposition-based baselines.

*Yash Kumar Lal,Manikanta Bandham,Mohammad Saqib Hasan,Apoorva Kashi,Mahnaz Koupaee,Niranjan Balasubramanian*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study introduces MuSciClaims, a benchmark for claim verification using multimodal data from scientific literature, revealing vision-language models' struggles with nuanced reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the lack of multimodal benchmarks specifically designed for claim verification capabilities in scientific literature, despite advances in related fields.

Method: MuSciClaims benchmark was created by extracting claims from scientific articles and manually perturbing them to create contradicted claims. Diagnostic tasks were also introduced to analyze model failures.

Result: Experiments showed that most vision-language models perform poorly (0.3-0.5 F1) in claim verification, with biases towards judging claims as supported and struggles in nuanced reasoning.

Conclusion: Current vision-language models lack the ability to accurately verify claims presented in multimodal scientific data, showcasing the need for improved reasoning and understanding in these systems.

Abstract: Assessing scientific claims requires identifying, extracting, and reasoning
with multimodal data expressed in information-rich figures in scientific
literature. Despite the large body of work in scientific QA, figure captioning,
and other multimodal reasoning tasks over chart-based data, there are no
readily usable multimodal benchmarks that directly test claim verification
abilities. To remedy this gap, we introduce a new benchmark MuSciClaims
accompanied by diagnostics tasks. We automatically extract supported claims
from scientific articles, which we manually perturb to produce contradicted
claims. The perturbations are designed to test for a specific set of claim
verification capabilities. We also introduce a suite of diagnostic tasks that
help understand model failures. Our results show most vision-language models
are poor (~0.3-0.5 F1), with even the best model only achieving 0.77 F1. They
are also biased towards judging claims as supported, likely misunderstanding
nuanced perturbations within the claims. Our diagnostics show models are bad at
localizing correct evidence within figures, struggle with aggregating
information across modalities, and often fail to understand basic components of
the figure.

TL;DR: LESS (Large Language Model Enhanced Semi-supervised Learning) framework uses LLMs to refine pseudo labels for better ASR and AST performance, achieving notable improvements in accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to enhance the accuracy of speech recognition and translation tasks by leveraging the powerful knowledge of LLMs to refine noisy pseudo labels.

Method: The framework refines pseudo-labeled text from ASR/AST processes using LLMs. It incorporates a data filtering strategy to maximize knowledge transfer efficiency from LLMs.

Result: LESS achieved significant accuracy improvements: 3.77% absolute WER reduction for Mandarin ASR, and high BLEU scores of 34.0 and 64.7 for Spanish-to-English AST tasks on benchmark datasets.

Conclusion: LESS demonstrates effectiveness and versatility across multiple languages, tasks, and domains while providing insights into utilizing LLMs for speech processing.

Abstract: We introduce LESS (Large Language Model Enhanced Semi-supervised Learning), a
versatile framework that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to correct
pseudo labels generated from in-the-wild data. Within the LESS framework,
pseudo-labeled text from Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) or Automatic Speech
Translation (AST) of the unsupervised data is refined by an LLM, and augmented
by a data filtering strategy to optimize LLM knowledge transfer efficiency.
Experiments on both Mandarin ASR and Spanish-to-English AST tasks show that
LESS achieves a notable absolute WER reduction of 3.77% on the Wenet Speech
test set, as well as BLEU scores of 34.0 and 64.7 on Callhome and Fisher test
sets respectively. These results validate the adaptability of LESS across
different languages, tasks, and domains. Ablation studies conducted with
various LLMs and prompt configurations provide novel insights into leveraging
LLM-derived knowledge for speech processing applications.

*Chengwu Liu,Ye Yuan,Yichun Yin,Yan Xu,Xin Xu,Zaoyu Chen,Yasheng Wang,Lifeng Shang,Qun Liu,Ming Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces $Safe$, a framework that uses formal verification in Lean 4 to improve reasoning and reduce hallucinations in Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting for LLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods to address hallucinations in CoT prompting, such as PRMs or self-consistency, lack interpretable and verifiable evidence, which reduces their effectiveness.

Method: The paper proposes $Safe$, a formal verification framework that translates each reasoning step into formal mathematical language Lean 4 and provides proofs to detect hallucinations. It also introduces $FormalStep$ as a benchmark with 30,809 formal statements.

Result: The framework $Safe$ demonstrated significant performance improvements across various models and mathematical datasets while offering interpretable and verifiable reasoning.

Conclusion: This work establishes a novel approach for hallucination detection by employing formal mathematical language Lean 4, enhancing both verification and interpretability in LLMs' reasoning.

Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting has become the de facto method to elicit
reasoning capabilities from large language models (LLMs). However, to mitigate
hallucinations in CoT that are notoriously difficult to detect, current methods
such as process reward models (PRMs) or self-consistency operate as opaque
boxes and do not provide checkable evidence for their judgments, possibly
limiting their effectiveness. To address this issue, we draw inspiration from
the idea that "the gold standard for supporting a mathematical claim is to
provide a proof". We propose a retrospective, step-aware formal verification
framework $Safe$. Rather than assigning arbitrary scores, we strive to
articulate mathematical claims in formal mathematical language Lean 4 at each
reasoning step and provide formal proofs to identify hallucinations. We
evaluate our framework $Safe$ across multiple language models and various
mathematical datasets, demonstrating a significant performance improvement
while offering interpretable and verifiable evidence. We also propose
$FormalStep$ as a benchmark for step correctness theorem proving with $30,809$
formal statements. To the best of our knowledge, our work represents the first
endeavor to utilize formal mathematical language Lean 4 for verifying natural
language content generated by LLMs, aligning with the reason why formal
mathematical languages were created in the first place: to provide a robust
foundation for hallucination-prone human-written proofs.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper presents MISMATCHED, a new benchmark dataset for Scientific NLI comprising non-computer science domains, and evaluates baseline models on this dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The lack of datasets for Scientific Natural Language Inference covering non-computer science domains prompted the introduction of this new evaluation benchmark.

Method: The researchers developed a dataset of 2,700 human-annotated sentence pairs across psychology, engineering, and public health domains, and evaluated small and large pre-trained language models as baselines.

Result: The best-performing baseline model achieved a Macro F1 score of 78.17%, indicating room for performance improvement.

Conclusion: A new dataset for scientific NLI in non-CS domains enhances evaluation capabilities with clear opportunities for growth in model performance, and resources are made publicly available for further research.

Abstract: Scientific Natural Language Inference (NLI) is the task of predicting the
semantic relation between a pair of sentences extracted from research articles.
Existing datasets for this task are derived from various computer science (CS)
domains, whereas non-CS domains are completely ignored. In this paper, we
introduce a novel evaluation benchmark for scientific NLI, called MISMATCHED.
The new MISMATCHED benchmark covers three non-CS domains-PSYCHOLOGY,
ENGINEERING, and PUBLIC HEALTH, and contains 2,700 human annotated sentence
pairs. We establish strong baselines on MISMATCHED using both Pre-trained Small
Language Models (SLMs) and Large Language Models (LLMs). Our best performing
baseline shows a Macro F1 of only 78.17% illustrating the substantial headroom
for future improvements. In addition to introducing the MISMATCHED benchmark,
we show that incorporating sentence pairs having an implicit scientific NLI
relation between them in model training improves their performance on
scientific NLI. We make our dataset and code publicly available on GitHub.

TL;DR: The paper discusses enhancing reasoning performance in Large Language Models (LLMs) with Test-Time Scaling (TTS) and proposes a new method called ADAPT to improve performance efficiently by focusing on diversity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to improve reasoning performance in LLMs by effectively utilizing additional compute during inference, with a focus on addressing the limitation of reduced generative diversity in reasoning-optimized models.

Method: The paper categorizes TTS methods into three strategies and introduces ADAPT, a lightweight prefix-tuning method using a diversity-focused data strategy to boost performance efficiently.

Result: ADAPT achieves 80% accuracy on mathematical reasoning tasks while using eight times less compute compared to strong baselines.

Conclusion: The study emphasizes the importance of maintaining generative diversity in LLMs to maximize the efficiency and effectiveness of TTS methods.

Abstract: Test-Time Scaling (TTS) improves the reasoning performance of Large Language
Models (LLMs) by allocating additional compute during inference. We conduct a
structured survey of TTS methods and categorize them into sampling-based,
search-based, and trajectory optimization strategies. We observe that
reasoning-optimized models often produce less diverse outputs, which limits TTS
effectiveness. To address this, we propose ADAPT (A Diversity Aware Prefix
fine-Tuning), a lightweight method that applies prefix tuning with a
diversity-focused data strategy. Experiments on mathematical reasoning tasks
show that ADAPT reaches 80% accuracy using eight times less compute than strong
baselines. Our findings highlight the essential role of generative diversity in
maximizing TTS effectiveness.

TL;DR: This paper introduces improved static word embeddings optimized for sentence semantics by using PCA and either knowledge distillation or contrastive learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the need for efficient sentence semantic representation with improved static word embeddings that rival transformer models.

Method: Word embeddings are extracted from Sentence Transformers, optimized with PCA, and further enhanced by either knowledge distillation or contrastive learning.

Result: The proposed method outperforms existing static models and rivals basic Sentence Transformers on sentence semantic tasks in both monolingual and cross-lingual settings.

Conclusion: The approach effectively filters irrelevant word embedding components and adjusts vector norms, significantly enhancing static word embeddings for sentence representation.

Abstract: We propose new static word embeddings optimised for sentence semantic
representation. We first extract word embeddings from a pre-trained Sentence
Transformer, and improve them with sentence-level principal component analysis,
followed by either knowledge distillation or contrastive learning. During
inference, we represent sentences by simply averaging word embeddings, which
requires little computational cost. We evaluate models on both monolingual and
cross-lingual tasks and show that our model substantially outperforms existing
static models on sentence semantic tasks, and even rivals a basic Sentence
Transformer model (SimCSE) on some data sets. Lastly, we perform a variety of
analyses and show that our method successfully removes word embedding
components that are irrelevant to sentence semantics, and adjusts the vector
norms based on the influence of words on sentence semantics.

*Zhiyuan Ma,Jiayu Liu,Xianzhen Luo,Zhenya Huang,Qingfu Zhu,Wanxiang Che*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Tool-MVR, a Tool-Augmented LLM, improves tool utilization and reflection abilities, achieving significant performance gains over other models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improving large language models' (LLMs) ability to effectively use tools for solving complex problems by addressing issues like unreliable tool planning and weak tool reflection.

Method: The paper introduces two key innovations: (1) Multi-Agent Meta-Verification (MAMV), which constructs a high-quality tool planning dataset (ToolBench-V), and (2) Exploration-based Reflection Learning (EXPLORE), which enhances reflection using a feedback-driven learning paradigm, creating ToolBench-R.

Result: Tool-MVR shows state-of-the-art results on StableToolBench, surpassing ToolLLM by 23.9% and GPT-4 by 15.3%, while making significantly fewer API calls and exhibiting strong generalization. It also achieves a 58.9% error correction rate on the RefineToolBench benchmark.

Conclusion: Tool-MVR demonstrates that integrating rigorous validation and dynamic reflection mechanisms into LLMs leads to robust tool planning, better error correction, and strong generalization.

Abstract: Empowering large language models (LLMs) with effective tool utilization
capabilities is crucial for enabling AI agents to solve complex problems.
However, current models face two major limitations: (1) unreliable tool
planning and invocation due to low-quality instruction datasets (e.g.,
widespread hallucinated API calls), and (2) weak tool reflection abilities
(over 90% of errors cannot be corrected) resulting from static imitation
learning. To address these critical limitations, we propose Tool-MVR, a novel
Tool-Augmented LLM that achieves comprehensive System 2 reasoning through two
key innovations. Specifically, we first introduce Multi-Agent Meta-Verification
(MAMV), a systematic pipeline that rigorously validates APIs, queries, and
reasoning trajectories to construct ToolBench-V, a new high-quality instruction
dataset that addresses the limitation of unreliable tool planning and
invocation. Second, we propose Exploration-based Reflection Learning (EXPLORE),
which enhances tool reflection capabilities by leveraging tool feedback through
a dynamic "Error -> Reflection -> Correction" learning paradigm, resulting in
our reflection dataset ToolBench-R and addressing the critical weakness in tool
reflection. Finally, we obtain Tool-MVR by finetuning open-source LLMs (e.g.,
Qwen-7B) on both ToolBench-V and ToolBench-R. Our experiments demonstrate that
Tool-MVR achieves state-of-the-art performance on StableToolBench, surpassing
both ToolLLM (by 23.9%) and GPT-4 (by 15.3%) while reducing API calls by 31.4%,
with strong generalization capabilities across unseen tools and scenarios.
Additionally, on our proposed RefineToolBench, the first benchmark specifically
designed to evaluate tool reflection capabilities, Tool-MVR achieves a 58.9%
error correction rate, significantly outperforming ToolLLM's 9.1%.

TL;DR: This paper introduces a method for creating AVSR datasets from raw video, demonstrating its viability by developing and testing a Vietnamese AVSR model.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional speech recognition struggles against noise, and AVSR offers robustness but is hindered by limited datasets, especially for non-English languages.

Method: Authors propose an automated approach to generate AVSR datasets from raw videos and demonstrate its effectiveness using a baseline model for the Vietnamese language.

Result: Their method achieved competitive AVSR performance in clean conditions and outperformed robust ASR models in noisy settings.

Conclusion: Automated dataset generation could enable AVSR advancements for under-resourced languages by addressing dataset scarcity issues.

Abstract: Audio-Visual Speech Recognition (AVSR) has gained significant attention
recently due to its robustness against noise, which often challenges
conventional speech recognition systems that rely solely on audio features.
Despite this advantage, AVSR models remain limited by the scarcity of extensive
datasets, especially for most languages beyond English. Automated data
collection offers a promising solution. This work presents a practical approach
to generate AVSR datasets from raw video, refining existing techniques for
improved efficiency and accessibility. We demonstrate its broad applicability
by developing a baseline AVSR model for Vietnamese. Experiments show the
automatically collected dataset enables a strong baseline, achieving
competitive performance with robust ASR in clean conditions and significantly
outperforming them in noisy environments like cocktail parties. This efficient
method provides a pathway to expand AVSR to more languages, particularly
under-resourced ones.

*Vinay Joshi,Pratik Prabhanjan Brahma,Zicheng Liu,Emad Barsoum*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces TaDA, a training-free method for compressing transformer model KV caches via adaptive quantization and mean centering to eliminate outlier handling, achieving substantial memory footprint reduction with comparable accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the challenge of the memory demands of key-value (KV) caches in transformer models that scale poorly with sequence length, hindering scalable deployment of large language models.

Method: The authors propose TaDA, a training-free technique for compressing KV caches through a quantization precision that adapts to error sensitivity across layers, combined with mean centering to avoid separate outlier handling.

Result: The technique significantly reduces the KV cache memory footprint to 27% of the 16-bit baseline while maintaining comparable model accuracy across multiple benchmarks.

Conclusion: TaDA offers a scalable and efficient approach to KV cache compression, improving memory efficiency in transformer models, and potentially enabling longer context length and more complex reasoning tasks.

Abstract: The key-value (KV) cache in transformer models is a critical component for
efficient decoding or inference, yet its memory demands scale poorly with
sequence length, posing a major challenge for scalable deployment of large
language models. Among several approaches to KV cache compression, quantization
of key and value activations has been widely explored. Most KV cache
quantization methods still need to manage sparse and noncontiguous outliers
separately. To address this, we introduce TaDA, a training-free recipe for KV
cache compression with quantization precision that adapts to error sensitivity
across layers and a mean centering to eliminate separate outlier handling. Our
approach yields substantial accuracy improvements for multiple models
supporting various context lengths. Moreover, our approach does not need to
separately manage outlier elements -- a persistent hurdle in most traditional
quantization methods. Experiments on standard benchmarks demonstrate that our
technique reduces KV cache memory footprint to 27% of the original 16-bit
baseline while achieving comparable accuracy. Our method paves the way for
scalable and high-performance reasoning in language models by potentially
enabling inference for longer context length models, reasoning models, and
longer chain of thoughts.

*Juhyun Oh,Eunsu Kim,Alice Oh*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces Flex-TravelPlanner, a benchmark designed to evaluate the dynamic planning capabilities of language models in multi-turn and priority-based constraint scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address the gap in existing LLM benchmarks, which primarily evaluate models in static, single-turn planning scenarios, rather than complex, evolving real-world settings.

Method: Flex-TravelPlanner was developed by extending the TravelPlanner dataset to include tasks involving sequential constraint introduction across multiple turns and scenarios with prioritized, competing constraints.

Result: Analysis of GPT-4o and Llama 3.1 70B shows that performance in single-turn tasks does not correlate well with multi-turn adaptability, performance is highly impacted by constraint introduction order, and models struggle to prioritize constraints effectively.

Conclusion: The findings underline the need for benchmarks that reflect dynamic and realistic planning tasks and offer insights into improving LLM performance in such scenarios.

Abstract: Real-world planning problems require constant adaptation to changing
requirements and balancing of competing constraints. However, current
benchmarks for evaluating LLMs' planning capabilities primarily focus on
static, single-turn scenarios. We introduce Flex-TravelPlanner, a benchmark
that evaluates language models' ability to reason flexibly in dynamic planning
scenarios. Building on the TravelPlanner dataset~\citep{xie2024travelplanner},
we introduce two novel evaluation settings: (1) sequential constraint
introduction across multiple turns, and (2) scenarios with explicitly
prioritized competing constraints. Our analysis of GPT-4o and Llama 3.1 70B
reveals several key findings: models' performance on single-turn tasks poorly
predicts their ability to adapt plans across multiple turns; constraint
introduction order significantly affects performance; and models struggle with
constraint prioritization, often incorrectly favoring newly introduced lower
priority preferences over existing higher-priority constraints. These findings
highlight the importance of evaluating LLMs in more realistic, dynamic planning
scenarios and suggest specific directions for improving model performance on
complex planning tasks. The code and dataset for our framework are publicly
available at https://github.com/juhyunohh/FlexTravelBench.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper critiques the current methods to align large language models with human norms, highlighting their vulnerability to adversarial attacks due to their lack of deeper normative reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Concern about the safe deployment of AI systems and the limitations of current alignment strategies in preventing misuse.

Method: Analyzes the current alignment approaches, compares human moral psychology with LLMs, and highlights weaknesses in LLMs' normative deliberation.

Result: Findings reveal a significant vulnerability in LLMs stemming from their inability to detect and resolve normative conflicts, even in reasoning-focused models.

Conclusion: Current alignment approaches are insufficient to prevent misuse of LLMs, raising important considerations for AI safety and regulation.

Abstract: The progress of AI systems such as large language models (LLMs) raises
increasingly pressing concerns about their safe deployment. This paper examines
the value alignment problem for LLMs, arguing that current alignment strategies
are fundamentally inadequate to prevent misuse. Despite ongoing efforts to
instill norms such as helpfulness, honesty, and harmlessness in LLMs through
fine-tuning based on human preferences, they remain vulnerable to adversarial
attacks that exploit conflicts between these norms. I argue that this
vulnerability reflects a fundamental limitation of existing alignment methods:
they reinforce shallow behavioral dispositions rather than endowing LLMs with a
genuine capacity for normative deliberation. Drawing from on research in moral
psychology, I show how humans' ability to engage in deliberative reasoning
enhances their resilience against similar adversarial tactics. LLMs, by
contrast, lack a robust capacity to detect and rationally resolve normative
conflicts, leaving them susceptible to manipulation; even recent advances in
reasoning-focused LLMs have not addressed this vulnerability. This ``shallow
alignment'' problem carries significant implications for AI safety and
regulation, suggesting that current approaches are insufficient for mitigating

*Gio Paik,Geewook Kim,Jinbae Im*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MMRefine introduces a benchmark for evaluating how well Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) can detect and correct errors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address shortcomings in reasoning and refinement capabilities of MLLMs and provide a structured evaluation framework.

Method: MMRefine evaluates MLLMs across six scenarios and categorizes errors into six types, analyzing refinement performance using open and closed models.

Result: Experiments reveal bottlenecks and factors that hinder effective refinement performance in MLLMs.

Conclusion: While MLLMs show promise, significant areas still need improvement to enhance refinement and reasoning capabilities.

Abstract: This paper introduces MMRefine, a MultiModal Refinement benchmark designed to
evaluate the error refinement capabilities of Multimodal Large Language Models
(MLLMs). As the emphasis shifts toward enhancing reasoning during inference,
MMRefine provides a framework that evaluates MLLMs' abilities to detect and
correct errors across six distinct scenarios beyond just comparing final
accuracy before and after refinement. Furthermore, the benchmark analyzes the
refinement performance by categorizing errors into six error types. Experiments
with various open and closed MLLMs reveal bottlenecks and factors impeding
refinement performance, highlighting areas for improvement in effective
reasoning enhancement. Our code and dataset are publicly available at

### [76] [Recycling the Web: A Method to Enhance Pre-training Data Quality and Quantity for Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04689)
*Thao Nguyen,Yang Li,Olga Golovneva,Luke Zettlemoyer,Sewoong Oh,Ludwig Schmidt,Xian Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: REWIRE proposes a novel way to recycle discarded web data by enriching low-quality documents for pre-training large language models, achieving notable performance improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current pre-training approaches face a limitation as high-quality internet text becomes scarce with the growth of compute supply.

Method: REWIRE applies guided rewriting to convert low-quality, discarded web texts into useful synthetic data for inclusion in pre-training datasets.

Result: Experiments with models of 1B, 3B, and 7B parameters showed significant performance improvements across diverse tasks, surpassing other synthetic data-generating methods.

Conclusion: Recycling low-quality web texts is a practical and efficient approach to overcome the data wall and scale pre-training datasets effectively.

Abstract: Scaling laws predict that the performance of large language models improves
with increasing model size and data size. In practice, pre-training has been
relying on massive web crawls, using almost all data sources publicly available
on the internet so far. However, this pool of natural data does not grow at the
same rate as the compute supply. Furthermore, the availability of high-quality
texts is even more limited: data filtering pipelines often remove up to 99% of
the initial web scrapes to achieve state-of-the-art. To address the "data wall"
of pre-training scaling, our work explores ways to transform and recycle data
discarded in existing filtering processes. We propose REWIRE, REcycling the Web
with guIded REwrite, a method to enrich low-quality documents so that they
could become useful for training. This in turn allows us to increase the
representation of synthetic data in the final pre-training set. Experiments at
1B, 3B and 7B scales of the DCLM benchmark show that mixing high-quality raw
texts and our rewritten texts lead to 1.0, 1.3 and 2.5 percentage points
improvement respectively across 22 diverse tasks, compared to training on only
filtered web data. Training on the raw-synthetic data mix is also more
effective than having access to 2x web data. Through further analysis, we
demonstrate that about 82% of the mixed in texts come from transforming
lower-quality documents that would otherwise be discarded. REWIRE also
outperforms related approaches of generating synthetic data, including
Wikipedia-style paraphrasing, question-answer synthesizing and knowledge
extraction. These results suggest that recycling web texts holds the potential
for being a simple and effective approach for scaling pre-training data.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces HSSBench, a benchmark to evaluate Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) in Humanities and Social Sciences (HSS), addressing the unique interdisciplinary challenges these tasks present.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current benchmarks for MLLMs largely focus on STEM disciplines and fail to adequately evaluate models in HSS domains, which demand horizontal reasoning and interdisciplinary integration.

Method: A novel data generation pipeline involving collaboration between domain experts and automated agents is developed to create over 13,000 samples in six categories, with support for six UN official languages.

Result: Benchmarking over 20 mainstream MLLMs shows that HSSBench presents significant challenges even for advanced models, highlighting gaps in cross-disciplinary reasoning capabilities.

Conclusion: HSSBench aims to drive research in improving MLLMs' interdisciplinary reasoning abilities and integration of knowledge across diverse fields.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated significant
potential to advance a broad range of domains. However, current benchmarks for
evaluating MLLMs primarily emphasize general knowledge and vertical
step-by-step reasoning typical of STEM disciplines, while overlooking the
distinct needs and potential of the Humanities and Social Sciences (HSS). Tasks
in the HSS domain require more horizontal, interdisciplinary thinking and a
deep integration of knowledge across related fields, which presents unique
challenges for MLLMs, particularly in linking abstract concepts with
corresponding visual representations. Addressing this gap, we present HSSBench,
a dedicated benchmark designed to assess the capabilities of MLLMs on HSS tasks
in multiple languages, including the six official languages of the United
Nations. We also introduce a novel data generation pipeline tailored for HSS
scenarios, in which multiple domain experts and automated agents collaborate to
generate and iteratively refine each sample. HSSBench contains over 13,000
meticulously designed samples, covering six key categories. We benchmark more
than 20 mainstream MLLMs on HSSBench and demonstrate that it poses significant
challenges even for state-of-the-art models. We hope that this benchmark will
inspire further research into enhancing the cross-disciplinary reasoning
abilities of MLLMs, especially their capacity to internalize and connect
knowledge across fields.

### [78] [Cracking the Code: Enhancing Implicit Hate Speech Detection through Coding Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04693)
*Lu Wei,Liangzhi Li,Tong Xiang,Xiao Liu,Noa Garcia*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Automatic hate speech detection tools excel in spotting explicit hate speech but falter with implicit forms. Introducing a six-strategy taxonomy and two integration methods with large language models (LLMs) significantly improves implicit detection, proven across Chinese and English datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The current methods fail at detecting implicit hate speech effectively, which is a growing issue threatening societal harmony and well-being.

Method: The authors define a taxonomy for implicit hate speech (six strategies called codetypes) and integrate these codetypes into detection methods via two approaches: prompting LLMs directly or embedding codetypes during the encoding process.

Result: Experiments demonstrate that integrating codetypes enhances the accuracy of implicit hate speech detection in both Chinese and English datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed codetype-based approach is effective and versatile for improving the detection of implicit hate speech across multiple languages.

Abstract: The internet has become a hotspot for hate speech (HS), threatening societal
harmony and individual well-being. While automatic detection methods perform
well in identifying explicit hate speech (ex-HS), they struggle with more
subtle forms, such as implicit hate speech (im-HS). We tackle this problem by
introducing a new taxonomy for im-HS detection, defining six encoding
strategies named codetypes. We present two methods for integrating codetypes
into im-HS detection: 1) prompting large language models (LLMs) directly to
classify sentences based on generated responses, and 2) using LLMs as encoders
with codetypes embedded during the encoding process. Experiments show that the
use of codetypes improves im-HS detection in both Chinese and English datasets,
validating the effectiveness of our approach across different languages.

*Woomin Song,Saket Dingliwal,Sai Muralidhar Jayanthi,Bhavana Ganesh,Jinwoo Shin,Aram Galstyan,Sravan Babu Bodapati*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces STAND, a novel decoding method to drastically reduce reasoning latency in language models without sacrificing accuracy by exploiting redundancy in reasoning paths.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing test-time reasoning methods, like best-of-N sampling and tree searches, are computationally expensive, causing trade-offs between computational efficiency and performance.

Method: STAND employs a model-free speculative decoding technique that uses stochastic drafting, logit-based N-gram modules, Gumbel-Top-K sampling, and data-driven tree construction to exploit redundancy in reasoning paths for efficient decoding.

Result: STAND reduces inference latency by 60-65% compared to autoregressive decoding while keeping accuracy intact. It also outperforms other decoding techniques by 14-28% in throughput and shows strong performance in single-trajectory decoding, reducing latency by 48-58%.

Conclusion: STAND is a computationally efficient, model-free, plug-and-play decoding solution suitable for reasoning tasks across various language models, enabling significant speed-ups without needing additional training.

Abstract: Language models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in reasoning tasks
through test-time scaling techniques like best-of-N sampling and tree search.
However, these approaches often demand substantial computational resources,
creating a critical trade-off between performance and efficiency. We introduce
STAND (STochastic Adaptive N-gram Drafting), a novel model-free speculative
decoding approach that leverages the inherent redundancy in reasoning
trajectories to achieve significant acceleration without compromising accuracy.
Our analysis reveals that reasoning paths frequently reuse similar reasoning
patterns, enabling efficient model-free token prediction without requiring
separate draft models. By introducing stochastic drafting and preserving
probabilistic information through a memory-efficient logit-based N-gram module,
combined with optimized Gumbel-Top-K sampling and data-driven tree
construction, STAND significantly improves token acceptance rates. Extensive
evaluations across multiple models and reasoning tasks (AIME-2024,
GPQA-Diamond, and LiveCodeBench) demonstrate that STAND reduces inference
latency by 60-65% compared to standard autoregressive decoding while
maintaining accuracy. Furthermore, STAND outperforms state-of-the-art
speculative decoding methods by 14-28% in throughput and shows strong
performance even in single-trajectory scenarios, reducing inference latency by
48-58%. As a model-free approach, STAND can be applied to any existing language
model without additional training, being a powerful plug-and-play solution for
accelerating language model reasoning.

*Bhavana Akkiraju,Aishwarya Pothula,Santosh Kesiraju,Anil Kumar Vuppala*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper explores hyperparameter optimization, data augmentation, and cross-lingual signal to improve speech translation performance in the low-resource Bhojpuri-Hindi language pair using the SeamlessM4T model.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenge of translating speech in low-resource language settings, specifically for Bhojpuri-Hindi, where data scarcity often leads to suboptimal translation performance.

Method: The authors optimized hyperparameters (learning rate schedules, warm-up steps, etc.), applied data augmentation techniques like speed perturbation and SpecAugment, and used cross-lingual signal through joint training with Marathi and Bhojpuri speech data.

Result: Experiments demonstrated that optimizing hyperparameters and applying data augmentation techniques significantly improved translation quality for the Bhojpuri-Hindi pair.

Conclusion: Effective hyperparameter tuning and simple augmentation techniques enhance translation systems for low-resource language pairs, and error analysis highlights areas for further improvement.

Abstract: This paper presents the submission of IIITH-BUT to the IWSLT 2025 shared task
on speech translation for the low-resource Bhojpuri-Hindi language pair. We
explored the impact of hyperparameter optimisation and data augmentation
techniques on the performance of the SeamlessM4T model fine-tuned for this
specific task. We systematically investigated a range of hyperparameters
including learning rate schedules, number of update steps, warm-up steps, label
smoothing, and batch sizes; and report their effect on translation quality. To
address data scarcity, we applied speed perturbation and SpecAugment and
studied their effect on translation quality. We also examined the use of
cross-lingual signal through joint training with Marathi and Bhojpuri speech
data. Our experiments reveal that careful selection of hyperparameters and the
application of simple yet effective augmentation techniques significantly
improve performance in low-resource settings. We also analysed the translation
hypotheses to understand various kinds of errors that impacted the translation
quality in terms of BLEU.

### [81] [SPARTA ALIGNMENT: Collectively Aligning Multiple Language Models through Combat](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04721)
*Yuru Jiang,Wenxuan Ding,Shangbin Feng,Greg Durrett,Yulia Tsvetkov*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces SPARTA ALIGNMENT, an algorithm where multiple LLMs collectively improve themselves via competition and judgment, leveraging their diversity and evolving iteratively.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing alignment techniques for LLMs often struggle with lack of diversity in output generation and biases in evaluation. This paper aims to address these limitations by creating a competitive and collective framework for alignment.

Method: SPARTA ALIGNMENT employs a duel-based system where pairs of LLMs are compared via peer-evaluation using a reputation system based on adapted elo-ranking. Combat results are used to generate preference pairs, which are iteratively learned by all models.

Result: Experiments show that SPARTA ALIGNMENT leads to an average improvement of 7.0% across tasks compared to initial models and various self-alignment baselines. It generalizes better to unseen tasks and benefits from the diversity among models.

Conclusion: SPARTA ALIGNMENT effectively leverages inter-model competition to enhance alignment, output quality, and generalization capabilities of participating LLMs.

Abstract: We propose SPARTA ALIGNMENT, an algorithm to collectively align multiple LLMs
through competition and combat. To complement a single model's lack of
diversity in generation and biases in evaluation, multiple LLMs form a "sparta
tribe" to compete against each other in fulfilling instructions while serving
as judges for the competition of others. For each iteration, one instruction
and two models are selected for a duel, the other models evaluate the two
responses, and their evaluation scores are aggregated through a adapted
elo-ranking based reputation system, where winners/losers of combat gain/lose
weight in evaluating others. The peer-evaluated combat results then become
preference pairs where the winning response is preferred over the losing one,
and all models learn from these preferences at the end of each iteration.
SPARTA ALIGNMENT enables the self-evolution of multiple LLMs in an iterative
and collective competition process. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
SPARTA ALIGNMENT outperforms initial models and 4 self-alignment baselines
across 10 out of 12 tasks and datasets with 7.0% average improvement. Further
analysis reveals that SPARTA ALIGNMENT generalizes more effectively to unseen
tasks and leverages the expertise diversity of participating models to produce
more logical, direct and informative outputs.

*Ziyi Zhou,Xiaoming Zhang,Litian Zhang,Yibo Zhang,Zhenyu Guan,Chaozhuo Li,Philip S. Yu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a new framework, C$^2$EFND, combining large and small language models to detect fake news more effectively and adaptively across social media platforms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rampant spread of fake news on social media has serious societal consequences, while existing large and small language models face limitations in detection due to outdated knowledge, scarcity of data, and lack of adaptability.

Method: The C$^2$EFND framework integrates LLMs and SLMs through multi-round collaborative learning and includes a lifelong knowledge editing module for incremental updates, along with replay-based methods for continuous learning.

Result: Experiments on the Pheme and Twitter16 datasets show that the C$^2$EFND framework significantly surpasses existing methods in detection accuracy and adaptability to evolving fake news scenarios.

Conclusion: C$^2$EFND effectively addresses challenges in fake news detection, demonstrating superior performance in maintaining adaptability and improving detection accuracy compared to conventional methods.

Abstract: The widespread dissemination of fake news on social media has significantly
impacted society, resulting in serious consequences. Conventional deep learning
methodologies employing small language models (SLMs) suffer from extensive
supervised training requirements and difficulties adapting to evolving news
environments due to data scarcity and distribution shifts. Large language
models (LLMs), despite robust zero-shot capabilities, fall short in accurately
detecting fake news owing to outdated knowledge and the absence of suitable
demonstrations. In this paper, we propose a novel Continuous Collaborative
Emergent Fake News Detection (C$^2$EFND) framework to address these challenges.
The C$^2$EFND framework strategically leverages both LLMs' generalization power
and SLMs' classification expertise via a multi-round collaborative learning
framework. We further introduce a lifelong knowledge editing module based on a
Mixture-of-Experts architecture to incrementally update LLMs and a replay-based
continue learning method to ensure SLMs retain prior knowledge without
retraining entirely. Extensive experiments on Pheme and Twitter16 datasets
demonstrate that C$^2$EFND significantly outperforms existed methods,
effectively improving detection accuracy and adaptability in continuous
emergent fake news scenarios.

### [83] [Identifying Reliable Evaluation Metrics for Scientific Text Revision](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04772)
*Léane Jourdan,Florian Boudin,Richard Dufour,Nicolas Hernandez*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper evaluates the limitations of existing metrics in assessing scientific text revisions and proposes a hybrid approach combining LLM-as-a-judge methods with domain-specific metrics for more reliable evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current metrics like ROUGE and BERTScore focus on similarity rather than meaningful improvements, leaving a gap in evaluating scientific text revision quality accurately.

Method: The study includes a manual annotation of revisions for quality assessment, exploration of reference-free metrics, and evaluation of LLMs as judges in scenarios with and without gold references.

Result: Findings indicate LLMs excel in following instructions but have limitations in correctness assessments, while domain-specific metrics provide unique insights. A combination of these approaches yields the most reliable results.

Conclusion: A hybrid evaluation strategy blending LLM-based judgment and task-specific metrics successfully enhances the reliability of scientific text revision assessments.

Abstract: Evaluating text revision in scientific writing remains a challenge, as
traditional metrics such as ROUGE and BERTScore primarily focus on similarity
rather than capturing meaningful improvements. In this work, we analyse and
identify the limitations of these metrics and explore alternative evaluation
methods that better align with human judgments. We first conduct a manual
annotation study to assess the quality of different revisions. Then, we
investigate reference-free evaluation metrics from related NLP domains.
Additionally, we examine LLM-as-a-judge approaches, analysing their ability to
assess revisions with and without a gold reference. Our results show that LLMs
effectively assess instruction-following but struggle with correctness, while
domain-specific metrics provide complementary insights. We find that a hybrid
approach combining LLM-as-a-judge evaluation and task-specific metrics offers
the most reliable assessment of revision quality.

*Jingyu Hu,Mengyue Yang,Mengnan Du,Weiru Liu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores the internal political states of LLMs using multi-dimensional frameworks and representation engineering techniques to disentangle concept confounds, while offering mechanisms for detection and intervention.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Uncover the internal political states of LLMs and address misalignment between their responses and actual internal intentions.

Method: Used interpretable representation engineering techniques and designed a four-dimensional political learning framework alongside a related dataset; tested on eight LLMs through detection and intervention tasks.

Result: Their approach successfully disentangled political concept confounds, validated semantic meaning of vectors, ensured generalization in out-of-distribution settings, and showcased intervention capabilities.

Conclusion: The engineered vectors can robustly detect political leanings and enable interventions to alter LLM-generated responses.

Abstract: Studies of LLMs' political opinions mainly rely on evaluations of their
open-ended responses. Recent work indicates that there is a misalignment
between LLMs' responses and their internal intentions. This motivates us to
probe LLMs' internal mechanisms and help uncover their internal political
states. Additionally, we found that the analysis of LLMs' political opinions
often relies on single-axis concepts, which can lead to concept confounds. In
this work, we extend the single-axis to multi-dimensions and apply
interpretable representation engineering techniques for more transparent LLM
political concept learning. Specifically, we designed a four-dimensional
political learning framework and constructed a corresponding dataset for
fine-grained political concept vector learning. These vectors can be used to
detect and intervene in LLM internals. Experiments are conducted on eight
open-source LLMs with three representation engineering techniques. Results show
these vectors can disentangle political concept confounds. Detection tasks
validate the semantic meaning of the vectors and show good generalization and
robustness in OOD settings. Intervention Experiments show these vectors can
intervene in LLMs to generate responses with different political leanings.

*Dingdong Wang,Jincenzi Wu,Junan Li,Dongchao Yang,Xueyuan Chen,Tianhua Zhang,Helen Meng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces MMSU, a benchmark for evaluating spoken language understanding and reasoning in Speech Large Language Models (SpeechLLMs).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current SpeechLLMs lack the capability to perform fine-grained perception and intricate reasoning in natural speech.

Method: The authors designed MMSU, a benchmark with 5,000 audio-question-answer triplets across 47 tasks integrating diverse linguistic phenomena such as phonetics, prosody, and semantics.

Result: The evaluation of 14 advanced SpeechLLMs revealed significant gaps, suggesting areas for model enhancement and performance improvement.

Conclusion: MMSU sets a new benchmark for assessing spoken language understanding and provides a basis for advancing human-AI speech interaction systems.

Abstract: Speech inherently contains rich acoustic information that extends far beyond
the textual language. In real-world spoken language understanding, effective
interpretation often requires integrating semantic meaning (e.g., content),
paralinguistic features (e.g., emotions, speed, pitch) and phonological
characteristics (e.g., prosody, intonation, rhythm), which are embedded in
speech. While recent multimodal Speech Large Language Models (SpeechLLMs) have
demonstrated remarkable capabilities in processing audio information, their
ability to perform fine-grained perception and complex reasoning in natural
speech remains largely unexplored. To address this gap, we introduce MMSU, a
comprehensive benchmark designed specifically for understanding and reasoning
in spoken language. MMSU comprises 5,000 meticulously curated
audio-question-answer triplets across 47 distinct tasks. To ground our
benchmark in linguistic theory, we systematically incorporate a wide range of
linguistic phenomena, including phonetics, prosody, rhetoric, syntactics,
semantics, and paralinguistics. Through a rigorous evaluation of 14 advanced
SpeechLLMs, we identify substantial room for improvement in existing models,
highlighting meaningful directions for future optimization. MMSU establishes a
new standard for comprehensive assessment of spoken language understanding,
providing valuable insights for developing more sophisticated human-AI speech
interaction systems. MMSU benchmark is available at

TL;DR: This paper surveys methods for integrating different modalities into Multimodal Large Language Models. It creates a taxonomy based on architectural strategies, representation learning, and training paradigms and analyzes 125 models for patterns.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation of this paper is to address a gap in understanding systematic integration strategies for multimodal inputs into pre-trained LLM backbones.

Method: The authors categorize and analyze existing techniques in three areas: modality integration structure, representation learning approaches, and training paradigms. They propose a framework to systematically classify all reviewed methods.

Result: They identify emerging patterns and trends across 125 multimodal models developed in recent years, creating a structured taxonomy that highlights integration strategies.

Conclusion: The proposed taxonomy provides a valuable overview that can serve as a guide for researchers developing more robust multimodal integration strategies for future AI models.

Abstract: The rapid progress of Multimodal Large Language Models(MLLMs) has transformed
the AI landscape. These models combine pre-trained LLMs with various modality
encoders. This integration requires a systematic understanding of how different
modalities connect to the language backbone. Our survey presents an LLM-centric
analysis of current approaches. We examine methods for transforming and
aligning diverse modal inputs into the language embedding space. This addresses
a significant gap in existing literature. We propose a classification framework
for MLLMs based on three key dimensions. First, we examine architectural
strategies for modality integration. This includes both the specific
integration mechanisms and the fusion level. Second, we categorize
representation learning techniques as either joint or coordinate
representations. Third, we analyze training paradigms, including training
strategies and objective functions. By examining 125 MLLMs developed between
2021 and 2025, we identify emerging patterns in the field. Our taxonomy
provides researchers with a structured overview of current integration
techniques. These insights aim to guide the development of more robust
multimodal integration strategies for future models built on pre-trained
foundations.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: FineLogic is introduced as an evaluation framework for logical reasoning in large language models, focusing on accuracy, stepwise soundness, and representation-level alignment. Experiments reveal the trade-offs between natural language and symbolic reasoning styles during fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks inadequately evaluate the quality and structure of reasoning processes in LLMs, relying solely on final-answer accuracy for logical reasoning.

Method: The study proposes FineLogic, a multi-dimensional evaluation framework, and explores the effects of four supervision styles during fine-tuning—one natural language and three symbolic variants.

Result: Natural language supervision excels in generalization and long-context tasks, while symbolic reasoning promotes more structurally sound inference chains. Fine-tuning primarily enhances step-by-step reasoning rather than shortcut prediction.

Conclusion: The framework and findings offer a granular, interpretable approach to assess and improve logical reasoning in LLMs.

Abstract: Logical reasoning is a core capability for many applications of large
language models (LLMs), yet existing benchmarks often rely solely on
final-answer accuracy, failing to capture the quality and structure of the
reasoning process. We propose FineLogic, a fine-grained evaluation framework
that assesses logical reasoning across three dimensions: overall benchmark
accuracy, stepwise soundness, and representation-level alignment. In addition,
to better understand how reasoning capabilities emerge, we conduct a
comprehensive study on the effects of supervision format during fine-tuning. We
construct four supervision styles (one natural language and three symbolic
variants) and train LLMs under each. Our findings reveal that natural language
supervision yields strong generalization even on out-of-distribution and
long-context tasks, while symbolic reasoning styles promote more structurally
sound and atomic inference chains. Further, our representation-level probing
shows that fine-tuning primarily improves reasoning behaviors through
step-by-step generation, rather than enhancing shortcut prediction or
internalized correctness. Together, our framework and analysis provide a more
rigorous and interpretable lens for evaluating and improving logical reasoning
in LLMs.

*Feijun Liu,Huifeng Wang,Kun Wang,Yizhen Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper presents a hybrid approach using CNN and BERT for accurate machine translation proofreading.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improving the accuracy and efficiency of human post-editing for machine translations, which often contain errors.

Method: The method integrates CNN for capturing local n-gram patterns, BERT for sequence-level context, an error detection module (via attention processes), and a correction module using GRU decoders and translation memory. The entire pipeline undergoes unified end-to-end training for post-editing optimization.

Result: The proposed model achieves 90% accuracy, 89.37% F1 score, and 16.24% MSE, outperforming recent proofreading techniques by over 10%.

Conclusion: The hybrid CNN-BERT approach sets a new standard in machine translation proofreading, effectively identifying and correcting translation errors across domains.

Abstract: Since automatic translations can contain errors that require substantial
human post-editing, machine translation proofreading is essential for improving
quality. This paper proposes a novel hybrid approach for robust proofreading
that combines convolutional neural networks (CNN) with Bidirectional Encoder
Representations from Transformers (BERT). In order to extract semantic
information from phrases and expressions, CNN uses a variety of convolution
kernel filters to capture local n-gram patterns. In the meanwhile, BERT creates
context-rich representations of whole sequences by utilizing stacked
bidirectional transformer encoders. Using BERT's attention processes, the
integrated error detection component relates tokens to spot translation
irregularities including word order problems and omissions. The correction
module then uses parallel English-German alignment and GRU decoder models in
conjunction with translation memory to propose logical modifications that
maintain original meaning. A unified end-to-end training process optimized for
post-editing performance is applied to the whole pipeline. The multi-domain
collection of WMT and the conversational dialogues of Open-Subtitles are two of
the English-German parallel corpora used to train the model. Multiple loss
functions supervise detection and correction capabilities. Experiments attain a
90% accuracy, 89.37% F1, and 16.24% MSE, exceeding recent proofreading
techniques by over 10% overall. Comparative benchmarking demonstrates
state-of-the-art performance in identifying and coherently rectifying
mistranslations and omissions.

*Nurul Aisyah,Muhammad Dehan Al Kautsar,Arif Hidayat,Raqib Chowdhury,Fajri Koto*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper evaluates the use of vision-language and large language models (VLM and LLM) for grading and giving feedback on handwritten exam responses of grade 4 students in Indonesia, highlighting recognition challenges and limitations in feedback contextualization and personalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the utility and challenges of employing AI models in real-world educational assessments, particularly in underrepresented contexts like Indonesian classrooms.

Method: The study tested a state-of-the-art VLM and several LLMs on 646 handwritten exam sheets across Mathematics and English subjects. Tasks included grading answers and generating personalized feedback.

Result: The VLM struggled with accurately recognizing student handwriting, causing errors in downstream grading by LLMs. Despite these errors, the LLMs still provided feedback, though it lacked strong personalization and contextual relevance.

Conclusion: AI models show potential but face significant challenges in recognition and contextual feedback quality, requiring further refinement for practical classroom application.

Abstract: Although vision-language and large language models (VLM and LLM) offer
promising opportunities for AI-driven educational assessment, their
effectiveness in real-world classroom settings, particularly in
underrepresented educational contexts, remains underexplored. In this study, we
evaluated the performance of a state-of-the-art VLM and several LLMs on 646
handwritten exam responses from grade 4 students in six Indonesian schools,
covering two subjects: Mathematics and English. These sheets contain more than
14K student answers that span multiple choice, short answer, and essay
questions. Assessment tasks include grading these responses and generating
personalized feedback. Our findings show that the VLM often struggles to
accurately recognize student handwriting, leading to error propagation in
downstream LLM grading. Nevertheless, LLM-generated feedback retains some
utility, even when derived from imperfect input, although limitations in
personalization and contextual relevance persist.

*Martin Andrews,Sam Witteveen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces an LLM-based reasoning system to tackle cryptic crossword clues, achieving state-of-the-art performance on the Cryptonite dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Cryptic crossword clues pose unique challenges in language understanding and reasoning, with test sets released daily by newspapers worldwide.

Method: The system involves hypothesizing answers, explaining wordplay, and verifying solutions through codified reasoning steps expressed in Python.

Result: It achieves superior performance compared to previous methods on the Cryptonite dataset, which includes clues from major UK newspapers.

Conclusion: The study provides an interpretable and effective approach to solving cryptic crossword clues, showcasing advancements in AI reasoning applied to linguistically complex tasks.

Abstract: Cryptic crossword clues are challenging language tasks for which new test
sets are released daily by major newspapers on a global basis. Each cryptic
clue contains both the definition of the answer to be placed in the crossword
grid (in common with regular crosswords), and 'wordplay' that proves that the
answer is correct (i.e. a human solver can be confident that an answer is
correct without needing crossing words as confirmation). This work describes an
LLM-based reasoning system built from open-licensed components that solves
cryptic clues by (i) hypothesising answers; (ii) proposing wordplay
explanations; and (iii) using a verifier system that operates on codified
reasoning steps. Overall, this system establishes a new state-of-the-art
performance on the challenging Cryptonite dataset of clues from The Times and
The Telegraph newspapers in the UK. Because each proved solution is expressed
in Python, interpretable wordplay reasoning for proven answers is available for
inspection.

### [91] [Joint Evaluation of Answer and Reasoning Consistency for Hallucination Detection in Large Reasoning Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04832)
*Changyue Wang,Weihang Su,Qingyao Ai,Yiqun Liu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces RACE, a framework for detecting hallucinations in Large Reasoning Models (LRMs).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Detecting hallucinations in LRMs is challenging because reasoning traces can be redundant or inconsistent, which current methods fail to address.

Method: RACE detects hallucinations by analyzing reasoning traces using four diagnostic signals: inter-sample consistency, answer uncertainty, reasoning-answer alignment, and internal coherence.

Result: Experiments show RACE outperforms current detection methods across datasets and language models.

Conclusion: RACE provides an effective and generalizable approach to improve hallucination detection in LRMs, enhancing their reliability and transparency.

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) extend large language models with explicit,
multi-step reasoning traces to enhance transparency and performance on complex
tasks. However, these reasoning traces can be redundant or logically
inconsistent, making them a new source of hallucination that is difficult to
detect. Existing hallucination detection methods focus primarily on
answer-level uncertainty and often fail to detect hallucinations or logical
inconsistencies arising from the model's reasoning trace. This oversight is
particularly problematic for LRMs, where the explicit thinking trace is not
only an important support to the model's decision-making process but also a key
source of potential hallucination. To this end, we propose RACE (Reasoning and
Answer Consistency Evaluation), a novel framework specifically tailored for
hallucination detection in LRMs. RACE operates by extracting essential
reasoning steps and computing four diagnostic signals: inter-sample consistency
of reasoning traces, entropy-based answer uncertainty, semantic alignment
between reasoning and answers, and internal coherence of reasoning. This joint
analysis enables fine-grained hallucination detection even when the final
answer appears correct. Experiments across datasets and different LLMs
demonstrate that RACE outperforms existing hallucination detection baselines,
offering a robust and generalizable solution for evaluating LRMs. Our code is
available at: https://github.com/bebr2/RACE.

*Dávid Javorský,Ondřej Bojar,François Yvon*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces a dataset called MockConf and a tool named InterAlign for analyzing simultaneous interpreting, offering metrics and a baseline for evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the absence of dedicated datasets and tools for analyzing, monitoring, and evaluating the complex task of simultaneous interpreting.

Method: A student interpreting dataset named MockConf was developed, containing 7 hours of multilingual recordings, which were manually transcribed and aligned. Additionally, InterAlign, a web-based tool for word and span annotations, was implemented and released.

Result: The MockConf dataset was prepared with detailed alignments, and the InterAlign tool was validated for its usability in simultaneous interpreting analysis. Evaluation metrics and an automatic alignment baseline were proposed.

Conclusion: The provided dataset and tool fill a significant gap in simultaneous interpreting research by enabling rigorous analysis and fostering community-driven developments.

Abstract: In simultaneous interpreting, an interpreter renders a source speech into
another language with a very short lag, much sooner than sentences are
finished. In order to understand and later reproduce this dynamic and complex
task automatically, we need dedicated datasets and tools for analysis,
monitoring, and evaluation, such as parallel speech corpora, and tools for
their automatic annotation. Existing parallel corpora of translated texts and
associated alignment algorithms hardly fill this gap, as they fail to model
long-range interactions between speech segments or specific types of
divergences (e.g., shortening, simplification, functional generalization)
between the original and interpreted speeches. In this work, we introduce
MockConf, a student interpreting dataset that was collected from Mock
Conferences run as part of the students' curriculum. This dataset contains 7
hours of recordings in 5 European languages, transcribed and aligned at the
level of spans and words. We further implement and release InterAlign, a modern
web-based annotation tool for parallel word and span annotations on long
inputs, suitable for aligning simultaneous interpreting. We propose metrics for
the evaluation and a baseline for automatic alignment. Dataset and tools are
released to the community.

*Giorgio Biancini,Alessio Ferrato,Carla Limongelli*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper analyzes Llama 2, Mistral, and GPT-3.5 for their ability to generate effective multiple-choice questions (MCQs), identifying GPT-3.5 as the top performer.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation stems from the need to reduce the time and effort educators spend on manually creating MCQs, leveraging the potential of LLMs in the educational domain.

Method: The authors conducted comparative experiments by injecting external knowledge into prompt inputs for Llama 2, Mistral, and GPT-3.5. They collected feedback from 21 educators to evaluate the generated MCQs.

Result: GPT-3.5 was found to generate the most effective MCQs based on established metrics, although educators show hesitation in adopting AI tools.

Conclusion: LLMs, especially GPT-3.5, hold promise for improving MCQ generation and enhancing education, though overcoming educators’ reluctance remains a challenge.

Abstract: Integrating Artificial Intelligence (AI) in educational settings has brought
new learning approaches, transforming the practices of both students and
educators. Among the various technologies driving this transformation, Large
Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as powerful tools for creating educational
materials and question answering, but there are still space for new
applications. Educators commonly use Multiple-Choice Questions (MCQs) to assess
student knowledge, but manually generating these questions is
resource-intensive and requires significant time and cognitive effort. In our
opinion, LLMs offer a promising solution to these challenges. This paper
presents a novel comparative analysis of three widely known LLMs - Llama 2,
Mistral, and GPT-3.5 - to explore their potential for creating informative and
challenging MCQs. In our approach, we do not rely on the knowledge of the LLM,
but we inject the knowledge into the prompt to contrast the hallucinations,
giving the educators control over the test's source text, too. Our experiment
involving 21 educators shows that GPT-3.5 generates the most effective MCQs
across several known metrics. Additionally, it shows that there is still some
reluctance to adopt AI in the educational field. This study sheds light on the
potential of LLMs to generate MCQs and improve the educational experience,
providing valuable insights for the future.

*Dávid Javorský,Ondřej Bojar,François Yvon*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores strategies for isometric machine translation, analyzing prompt phrasing, few-shot demonstrations, and outputs to optimize translation length and quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate the effectiveness of large language models and prompting strategies in controlling output length while maintaining translation quality.

Method: Analyzed multiple large language models under various prompting strategies, few-shot examples, demonstration selection, and multiple outputs across En→De, En→Fr, En→Es language pairs.

Result: Prompt alignment significantly influences output length control. Few-shot prompting marginally boosts overall translation quality, while state-of-the-art performance is achieved using multiple outputs for some language pairs.

Conclusion: Effective length control in machine translation requires tailored prompting strategies, and leveraging multiple outputs improves both length and quality tradeoffs.

Abstract: In this study, we explore the effectiveness of isometric machine translation
across multiple language pairs (En$\to$De, En$\to$Fr, and En$\to$Es) under the
conditions of the IWSLT Isometric Shared Task 2022. Using eight open-source
large language models (LLMs) of varying sizes, we investigate how different
prompting strategies, varying numbers of few-shot examples, and demonstration
selection influence translation quality and length control. We discover that
the phrasing of instructions, when aligned with the properties of the provided
demonstrations, plays a crucial role in controlling the output length. Our
experiments show that LLMs tend to produce shorter translations only when
presented with extreme examples, while isometric demonstrations often lead to
the models disregarding length constraints. While few-shot prompting generally
enhances translation quality, further improvements are marginal across 5, 10,
and 20-shot settings. Finally, considering multiple outputs allows to notably
improve overall tradeoff between the length and quality, yielding
state-of-the-art performance for some language pairs.

TL;DR: This paper explores the integration of Universal Dependencies (UD) into pretrained language models for a cross-lingual paraphrase identification task, achieving notable accuracy and F1 score improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address the underexplored effectiveness of Universal Dependencies (UD) for cross-lingual syntactic representation in language models.

Method: The authors integrate UD into pretrained language models and measure its impact on cross-lingual adversarial paraphrase identification using experimental analysis.

Result: Integration of UD enhances model accuracy by 3.85% and F1 scores by 6.08%, bridging the gap between pretrained models and larger language models for certain language pairs.

Conclusion: UD proves to be a valid and effective tool for enhancing out-of-domain tasks, especially in cross-lingual settings, offering potential for further applications.

Abstract: Universal Dependencies (UD), while widely regarded as the most successful
linguistic framework for cross-lingual syntactic representation, remains
underexplored in terms of its effectiveness. This paper addresses this gap by
integrating UD into pretrained language models and assesses if UD can improve
their performance on a cross-lingual adversarial paraphrase identification
task. Experimental results show that incorporation of UD yields significant
improvements in accuracy and $F_1$ scores, with average gains of 3.85\% and
6.08\% respectively. These enhancements reduce the performance gap between
pretrained models and large language models in some language pairs, and even
outperform the latter in some others. Furthermore, the UD-based similarity
score between a given language and English is positively correlated to the
performance of models in that language. Both findings highlight the validity
and potential of UD in out-of-domain tasks.

*Shiyi Xu,Yiwen Hu,Yingqian Min,Zhipeng Chen,Wayne Xin Zhao,Ji-Rong Wen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ICPC-Eval is a new coding benchmark designed for evaluating large language models (LLMs) in competitive programming settings, addressing shortcomings in existing benchmarks and metrics like Pass@K.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: With rapid advancements in LLM coding and reasoning capabilities, current benchmarks and evaluation metrics fail to mimic real-world competitive programming scenarios or assess reasoning abilities effectively.

Method: The paper introduces ICPC-Eval, a benchmark featuring 118 ICPC competition problems, a robust test-case generation/evaluation tool, and a new metric, Refine@K, which incorporates iterative solution refinement based on feedback.

Result: ICPC-Eval demonstrates that advanced LLMs like DeepSeek-R1 achieve more effective reasoning when utilizing code feedback loops, though they still lag behind top human teams in performance.

Conclusion: ICPC-Eval serves as a significant evaluation tool for advancing LLM reasoning in competitive coding, highlighting the performance gap between current models and human teams while providing avenues for further improvement.

Abstract: With the significant progress of large reasoning models in complex coding and
reasoning tasks, existing benchmarks, like LiveCodeBench and CodeElo, are
insufficient to evaluate the coding capabilities of large language models
(LLMs) in real competition environments. Moreover, current evaluation metrics
such as Pass@K fail to capture the reflective abilities of reasoning models. To
address these challenges, we propose \textbf{ICPC-Eval}, a top-level
competitive coding benchmark designed to probing the frontiers of LLM
reasoning. ICPC-Eval includes 118 carefully curated problems from 11 recent
ICPC contests held in various regions of the world, offering three key
contributions: 1) A challenging realistic ICPC competition scenario, featuring
a problem type and difficulty distribution consistent with actual contests. 2)
A robust test case generation method and a corresponding local evaluation
toolkit, enabling efficient and accurate local evaluation. 3) An effective
test-time scaling evaluation metric, Refine@K, which allows iterative repair of
solutions based on execution feedback. The results underscore the significant
challenge in evaluating complex reasoning abilities: top-tier reasoning models
like DeepSeek-R1 often rely on multi-turn code feedback to fully unlock their
in-context reasoning potential when compared to non-reasoning counterparts.
Furthermore, despite recent advancements in code generation, these models still
lag behind top-performing human teams. We release the benchmark at:

### [97] [Verbose ListOps (VLO): Beyond Long Context -- Unmasking LLM's Reasoning Blind Spots](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04907)
*Alex Pan,Mary-Anne Williams*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Large Language Models (LLMs) struggle with reasoning that involves nested narratives. A new benchmark, Verbose ListOps, exposes this weakness and tests their ability to manage reasoning complexity within lengthy contexts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to highlight a fundamental limitation of LLMs in handling nested narrative reasoning, which traditional benchmarks fail to address effectively.

Method: The authors introduce Verbose ListOps, a benchmark that converts complex computations into coherent, lengthy narratives requiring nested reasoning, withholding intermediate results to test state management and reasoning difficulty.

Result: Experiments reveal that even top-performing LLMs fail at reasoning tasks in Verbose ListOps when narrative lengths extend to around 10,000 tokens, despite excelling at simpler ListOps equations.

Conclusion: Improving LLMs’ capacity for nested reasoning in complex contexts is essential for advancing knowledge automation. Verbose ListOps offers a pathway to targeted enhancements in this domain.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs), whilst great at extracting facts from text,
struggle with nested narrative reasoning. Existing long context and multi-hop
QA benchmarks inadequately test this, lacking realistic distractors or failing
to decouple context length from reasoning complexity, masking a fundamental LLM
limitation. We introduce Verbose ListOps, a novel benchmark that
programmatically transposes ListOps computations into lengthy, coherent
stories. This uniquely forces internal computation and state management of
nested reasoning problems by withholding intermediate results, and offers
fine-grained controls for both narrative size \emph{and} reasoning difficulty.
Whilst benchmarks like LongReason (2025) advance approaches for synthetically
expanding the context size of multi-hop QA problems, Verbose ListOps pinpoints
a specific LLM vulnerability: difficulty in state management for nested
sub-reasoning amongst semantically-relevant, distracting narrative. Our
experiments show that leading LLMs (e.g., OpenAI o4, Gemini 2.5 Pro) collapse
in performance on Verbose ListOps at modest (~10k token) narrative lengths,
despite effortlessly solving raw ListOps equations. Addressing this failure is
paramount for real-world text interpretation which requires identifying key
reasoning points, tracking conceptual intermediate results, and filtering
irrelevant information. Verbose ListOps, and its extensible generation
framework thus enables targeted reasoning enhancements beyond mere
context-window expansion; a critical step to automating the world's knowledge
work.

*Ondřej Klejch,William Lamb,Peter Bell*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper questions the common belief that fine-tuning multilingual end-to-end models is the best method for low-resource ASR systems, proving that a combination of hybrid HMMs and self-supervised models yields better results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenge of developing effective ASR systems for low-resource languages, especially when limited training data is available.

Method: Combine hybrid HMMs with self-supervised models, leveraging continued pre-training and semi-supervised learning to maximize the usage of speech and text data.

Result: Benchmarked approach on Scottish Gaelic, showing a 32% relative reduction in WER compared to the fine-tuned Whisper model.

Conclusion: The proposed hybrid method significantly outperforms the currently preferred fine-tuning approach for ASR in low-resource settings.

Abstract: An effective approach to the development of ASR systems for low-resource
languages is to fine-tune an existing multilingual end-to-end model. When the
original model has been trained on large quantities of data from many
languages, fine-tuning can be effective with limited training data, even when
the language in question was not present in the original training data. The
fine-tuning approach has been encouraged by the availability of public-domain
E2E models and is widely believed to lead to state-of-the-art results. This
paper, however, challenges that belief. We show that an approach combining
hybrid HMMs with self-supervised models can yield substantially better
performance with limited training data. This combination allows better
utilisation of all available speech and text data through continued
self-supervised pre-training and semi-supervised training. We benchmark our
approach on Scottish Gaelic, achieving WER reductions of 32% relative over our
best fine-tuned Whisper model.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study examines the effectiveness of multilingual formative feedback generated by large language models (LLMs) for educational purposes, particularly in low-resource languages.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the unexamined capability of large language models to provide effective instructional support across different languages, especially in mathematically grounded reasoning tasks.

Method: A stronger language model acts as a tutor by generating multilingual feedback, while a weaker model simulates the student. They test across 352 settings with 11 languages, four LLMs, and varied prompting strategies.

Result: Results reveal that multilingual hints significantly improve learning gains, especially in low-resource languages when aligned with students' native languages.

Conclusion: The study offers actionable insights to develop inclusive, multilingual, LLM-driven educational tools.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated the ability to generate
formative feedback and instructional hints in English, making them increasingly
relevant for AI-assisted education. However, their ability to provide effective
instructional support across different languages, especially for mathematically
grounded reasoning tasks, remains largely unexamined. In this work, we present
the first large-scale simulation of multilingual tutor-student interactions
using LLMs. A stronger model plays the role of the tutor, generating feedback
in the form of hints, while a weaker model simulates the student. We explore
352 experimental settings across 11 typologically diverse languages, four
state-of-the-art LLMs, and multiple prompting strategies to assess whether
language-specific feedback leads to measurable learning gains. Our study
examines how student input language, teacher feedback language, model choice,
and language resource level jointly influence performance. Results show that
multilingual hints can significantly improve learning outcomes, particularly in
low-resource languages when feedback is aligned with the student's native
language. These findings offer practical insights for developing multilingual,
LLM-based educational tools that are both effective and inclusive.

TL;DR: The study introduced ConECT, a Czech-to-Polish e-commerce dataset that integrates images and metadata to enhance neural machine translation models and demonstrated improved translation quality using contextual information.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges like word ambiguity and insufficient context in domain-specific machine translation, especially in e-commerce applications, where unclear sentences and poor data quality are prevalent.

Method: Researchers created the ConECT dataset featuring 11,400 Czech-to-Polish sentence pairs with accompanying metadata and images. They tested visual-language models and text-to-text approaches incorporating context like product categories and image descriptions.

Result: Incorporating visual and contextual information into translation models showed improvements in translation quality.

Conclusion: Contextual and visual data integration enhances neural machine translation performance, and the publicly released ConECT dataset paves the way for further exploration.

Abstract: Neural Machine Translation (NMT) has improved translation by using
Transformer-based models, but it still struggles with word ambiguity and
context. This problem is especially important in domain-specific applications,
which often have problems with unclear sentences or poor data quality. Our
research explores how adding information to models can improve translations in
the context of e-commerce data. To this end we create ConECT -- a new
Czech-to-Polish e-commerce product translation dataset coupled with images and
product metadata consisting of 11,400 sentence pairs. We then investigate and
compare different methods that are applicable to context-aware translation. We
test a vision-language model (VLM), finding that visual context aids
translation quality. Additionally, we explore the incorporation of contextual
information into text-to-text models, such as the product's category path or
image descriptions. The results of our study demonstrate that the incorporation
of contextual information leads to an improvement in the quality of machine
translation. We make the new dataset publicly available.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper proposes a semi-supervised learning approach for fine-tuning ASR models integrating labeled data, auxiliary data, and pseudo-labeling, achieving better results than single-step fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fine-tuning pretrained ASR models for specific domains is hard due to limited labeled data, though unlabeled audio and labeled data from related domains are usually accessible.

Method: The authors propose an incremental semi-supervised learning process that uses both in-domain labeled data and auxiliary datasets, and applies filtering techniques like multi-model consensus and named entity recognition (NER) to refine pseudo-labels iteratively.

Result: Their approach outperforms single-step fine-tuning. Consensus-based filtering achieves up to 22.3% and 24.8% relative improvement for Wow and Fisher corpora, respectively. NER filtering also offers strong gains at reduced computational cost.

Conclusion: Incremental semi-supervised learning with consensus-based filtering or NER is more effective than single-step fine-tuning, particularly in leveraging unlabeled and auxiliary data effectively.

Abstract: Fine-tuning pretrained ASR models for specific domains is challenging when
labeled data is scarce. But unlabeled audio and labeled data from related
domains are often available. We propose an incremental semi-supervised learning
pipeline that first integrates a small in-domain labeled set and an auxiliary
dataset from a closely related domain, achieving a relative improvement of 4%
over no auxiliary data. Filtering based on multi-model consensus or named
entity recognition (NER) is then applied to select and iteratively refine
pseudo-labels, showing slower performance saturation compared to random
selection. Evaluated on the multi-domain Wow call center and Fisher English
corpora, it outperforms single-step fine-tuning. Consensus-based filtering
outperforms other methods, providing up to 22.3% relative improvement on Wow
and 24.8% on Fisher over single-step fine-tuning with random selection. NER is
the second-best filter, providing competitive performance at a lower
computational cost.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper proposes SCOP to analyze how large language models (LLMs) process comprehension tasks from a cognitive perspective, identifying limitations and alignment with human experts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study addresses concerns about the reliability of LLMs in real-world scenarios, emphasizing the lack of alignment between their comprehension processes and those of human experts.

Method: The authors propose SCOP, which defines five cognitive skills required for comprehension, creates a testing framework for these skills, and evaluates open- and closed-source LLMs using the framework.

Result: SCOP reveals that LLMs struggle to perform comprehension at an expert level but show similarities to experts in certain aspects, such as better local information processing. However, LLMs can still produce correct answers via flawed comprehension processes.

Conclusion: The study advises focusing on developing LLMs' comprehension processes comprehensively during training to improve their reliability and expert-level capacity.

Abstract: Despite the great potential of large language models(LLMs) in machine
comprehension, it is still disturbing to fully count on them in real-world
scenarios. This is probably because there is no rational explanation for
whether the comprehension process of LLMs is aligned with that of experts. In
this paper, we propose SCOP to carefully examine how LLMs perform during the
comprehension process from a cognitive view. Specifically, it is equipped with
a systematical definition of five requisite skills during the comprehension
process, a strict framework to construct testing data for these skills, and a
detailed analysis of advanced open-sourced and closed-sourced LLMs using the
testing data. With SCOP, we find that it is still challenging for LLMs to
perform an expert-level comprehension process. Even so, we notice that LLMs
share some similarities with experts, e.g., performing better at comprehending
local information than global information. Further analysis reveals that LLMs
can be somewhat unreliable -- they might reach correct answers through flawed
comprehension processes. Based on SCOP, we suggest that one direction for
improving LLMs is to focus more on the comprehension process, ensuring all
comprehension skills are thoroughly developed during training.

### [105] [Controlling Summarization Length Through EOS Token Weighting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05017)
*Zeno Belligoli,Emmanouil Stergiadis,Eran Fainman,Ilya Gusev*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper presents a simple method to control text summary length by adjusting the importance of predicting the EOS token during training, compatible with various models and inference techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Effective length control in text generation tasks like summarization is essential but remains challenging with existing methods that require extensive model modifications.

Method: The approach adjusts the cross-entropy loss to emphasize the End-Of-Sequence (EOS) token's prediction, making it architecture-agnostic and compatible with diverse models and decoding algorithms.

Result: The method was tested on encoder-decoder models and GPT-style LLMs, demonstrating successful generation length control without significantly compromising summary quality.

Conclusion: The length-control approach offers a straightforward and generalizable solution, expanding its usability across different text generation frameworks.

Abstract: Controlling the length of generated text can be crucial in various
text-generation tasks, including summarization. Existing methods often require
complex model alterations, limiting compatibility with pre-trained models. We
address these limitations by developing a simple approach for controlling the
length of automatic text summaries by increasing the importance of correctly
predicting the EOS token in the cross-entropy loss computation. The proposed
methodology is agnostic to architecture and decoding algorithms and orthogonal
to other inference-time techniques to control the generation length. We tested
it with encoder-decoder and modern GPT-style LLMs, and show that this method
can control generation length, often without affecting the quality of the
summary.

### [106] [Automatic Robustness Stress Testing of LLMs as Mathematical Problem Solvers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05038)
*Yutao Hou,Zeguan Xiao,Fei Yu,Yihan Jiang,Xuetao Wei,Hailiang Huang,Yun Chen,Guanhua Chen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces AR-Checker, a framework that evaluates LLM robustness by generating semantically equivalent problem variants to identify failures in reasoning tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the robustness challenges in LLMs, which can fail on simple reasoning tasks despite excelling at complex ones.

Method: AR-Checker generates problem variants using multi-round streams of LLM-based rewriting and verification, ensuring semantic equivalence and minimizing data contamination.

Result: Experiments on GSM8K, MATH-500, and other benchmarks demonstrate AR-Checker's effectiveness in testing robustness and generating insightful evaluations.

Conclusion: AR-Checker serves as a dynamic and effective tool for robustness evaluation of LLMs and mitigates risks of data contamination in variant generation.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved distinguished performance on
various reasoning-intensive tasks. However, LLMs might still face the
challenges of robustness issues and fail unexpectedly in some simple reasoning
tasks. Previous works evaluate the LLM robustness with hand-crafted templates
or a limited set of perturbation rules, indicating potential data contamination
in pre-training or fine-tuning datasets. In this work, inspired by stress
testing in software engineering, we propose a novel framework, Automatic
Robustness Checker (AR-Checker), to generate mathematical problem variants that
maintain the semantic meanings of the original one but might fail the LLMs. The
AR-Checker framework generates mathematical problem variants through
multi-round parallel streams of LLM-based rewriting and verification. Our
framework can generate benchmark variants dynamically for each LLM, thus
minimizing the risk of data contamination. Experiments on GSM8K and MATH-500
demonstrate the strong performance of AR-Checker on mathematical tasks. We also
evaluate AR-Checker on benchmarks beyond mathematics, including MMLU, MMLU-Pro,
and CommonsenseQA, where it also achieves strong performance, further proving
the effectiveness of AR-Checker.

*Moshe Ofer,Orel Zamler,Amos Azaria*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces TALL, a system enhancing the performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) in low-resource languages by using bilingual translation models and efficient training techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs are powerful for high-resource languages but face challenges with low-resource languages due to less training data.

Method: The proposed system, TALL, integrates LLMs with bilingual translation models and uses parameter-efficient training (freezing pre-trained components, training lightweight adapters).

Result: Experiments conducted on Hebrew show notable performance improvements over baselines like direct use, naive translation, and fine-tuning methods.

Conclusion: TALL is a promising approach to bridge the performance gap for low-resource languages, efficiently enhancing LLM capabilities while maintaining computational efficiency.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel in high-resource languages but struggle
with low-resource languages due to limited training data. This paper presents
TALL (Trainable Architecture for Enhancing LLM Performance in Low-Resource
Languages), which integrates an LLM with two bilingual translation models. TALL
transforms low-resource inputs into high-resource representations, leveraging
the LLM's capabilities while preserving linguistic features through dimension
alignment layers and custom transformers. Our experiments on Hebrew demonstrate
significant improvements over several baselines, including direct use, naive
translation, and fine-tuning approaches. The architecture employs a
parameter-efficient strategy, freezing pre-trained components while training
only lightweight adapter modules, balancing computational efficiency with
performance gains.

### [108] [Debatable Intelligence: Benchmarking LLM Judges via Debate Speech Evaluation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05062)
*Noy Sternlicht,Ariel Gera,Roy Bar-Haim,Tom Hope,Noam Slonim*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces Debate Speech Evaluation to benchmark LLM judges, revealing that these models, while capable in some areas, show notable differences from humans in overall judgment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to establish a systematic way to evaluate large language models (LLMs) based on the nuanced cognitive abilities required to assess debate speeches, a previously underexplored area.

Method: The authors use a dataset of 600+ annotated debate speeches and compare state-of-the-art LLMs to human judges, analyzing their judgment behaviors. They also test LLMs' ability to generate persuasive speeches.

Result: The results indicate LLMs can approximate some aspects of human judgment but vary significantly in broader evaluation patterns. They also show promising performance in generating persuasive speeches.

Conclusion: The study highlights the potential and limitations of LLMs in debate evaluation and speech generation, emphasizing that substantial differences exist in judgment approaches compared to humans.

Abstract: We introduce Debate Speech Evaluation as a novel and challenging benchmark
for assessing LLM judges. Evaluating debate speeches requires a deep
understanding of the speech at multiple levels, including argument strength and
relevance, the coherence and organization of the speech, the appropriateness of
its style and tone, and so on. This task involves a unique set of cognitive
abilities that have previously received limited attention in systematic LLM
benchmarking. To explore such skills, we leverage a dataset of over 600
meticulously annotated debate speeches and present the first in-depth analysis
of how state-of-the-art LLMs compare to human judges on this task. Our findings
reveal a nuanced picture: while larger models can approximate individual human
judgments in some respects, they differ substantially in their overall judgment
behavior. We also investigate the ability of frontier LLMs to generate
persuasive, opinionated speeches, showing that models may perform at a human
level on this task.

### [109] [Does It Make Sense to Speak of Introspection in Large Language Models?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05068)
*Iulia Comşa,Murray Shanahan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper explores to what extent LLMs (like GPT-4) can provide self-reports akin to human introspection. It analyzes two examples: one rejected as true introspection and another accepted as a minimal form.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: With LLMs displaying advanced linguistic behavior, their self-reports provoke reflections on whether introspection — typically linked to consciousness in humans — applies to these models.

Method: Two examples of self-reports from LLMs were analyzed. One involved describing its creative process, and the other involved inferring its temperature parameter.

Result: The study found that describing the creative process does not qualify as introspection. However, correctly inferring the temperature parameter was deemed a minimal example of introspection without conscious experience.

Conclusion: LLMs can display minimal introspection-like behavior, but it’s not linked to consciousness, urging caution in interpreting their self-reports.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) exhibit compelling linguistic behaviour, and
sometimes offer self-reports, that is to say statements about their own nature,
inner workings, or behaviour. In humans, such reports are often attributed to a
faculty of introspection and are typically linked to consciousness. This raises
the question of how to interpret self-reports produced by LLMs, given their
increasing linguistic fluency and cognitive capabilities. To what extent (if
any) can the concept of introspection be meaningfully applied to LLMs? Here, we
present and critique two examples of apparent introspective self-report from
LLMs. In the first example, an LLM attempts to describe the process behind its
own ``creative'' writing, and we argue this is not a valid example of
introspection. In the second example, an LLM correctly infers the value of its
own temperature parameter, and we argue that this can be legitimately
considered a minimal example of introspection, albeit one that is (presumably)
not accompanied by conscious experience.

### [110] [RIVAL: Reinforcement Learning with Iterative and Adversarial Optimization for Machine Translation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05070)
*Tianjiao Li,Mengran Yu,Chenyu Shi,Yanjun Zhao,Xiaojing Liu,Qiang Zhang,Qi Zhang,Xuanjing Huang,Jiayin Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper addresses poor performance of colloquial subtitle translation using LLMs trained with RLHF, proposing RIVAL, an adversarial framework to tackle model divergence and improve translation quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to enhance the performance of LLMs in colloquial subtitle translation, which current RLHF methods fail to do effectively due to distributional divergence.

Method: The proposed method, RIVAL, uses adversarial training where the RM differentiates strong and weak translations, and the LLM improves based on this feedback. A quantitative metric (e.g., BLEU) is incorporated to stabilize training and align with human evaluations.

Result: Experiments show that RIVAL significantly outperforms existing translation baselines, improving both the stability and generalizability of subtitle translations.

Conclusion: RIVAL successfully addresses RLHF limitations in colloquial subtitle translation tasks, presenting a novel framework that uses adversarial dynamics and human-aligned preferences for better outcomes.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) possess strong multilingual capabilities, and
combining Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) with translation
tasks has shown great potential. However, we observe that this paradigm
performs unexpectedly poorly when applied to colloquial subtitle translation
tasks. In this work, we investigate this issue and find that the offline reward
model (RM) gradually diverges from the online LLM due to distributional shift,
ultimately leading to undesirable training outcomes. To address this, we
propose RIVAL, an adversarial training framework that formulates the process as
a min-max game between the RM and the LLM. RIVAL iteratively updates the both
models, with the RM trained to distinguish strong from weak translations
(qualitative preference reward), and the LLM trained to enhance its translation
for closing this gap. To stabilize training and improve generalizability, we
also incorporate quantitative preference reward (e.g., BLEU) into the RM,
enabling reference-free quality modeling aligned with human evaluation. Through
extensive experiments, we demonstrate that the proposed adversarial training
framework significantly improves upon translation baselines.

### [111] [Just a Scratch: Enhancing LLM Capabilities for Self-harm Detection through Intent Differentiation and Emoji Interpretation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05073)
*Soumitra Ghosh,Gopendra Vikram Singh,Shambhavi,Sabarna Choudhury,Asif Ekbal*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes a framework to improve large language models (LLMs) for detecting self-harm expressions on social media by leveraging nuanced language and emoji interpretation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Self-harm detection on social media is a critical task for suicide prevention, but current LLMs struggle to interpret subtle cues in casual language and emojis.

Method: Authors propose the Centennial Emoji Sensitivity Matrix (CESM-100) for contextual emoji understanding and the SHINES dataset for detailed annotations. They fine-tune LLMs using multi-task learning for detecting self-harm signals and differentiating casual vs. serious intents.

Result: The approach enhances LLM performance in self-harm detection and explanation tasks across multiple settings (zero-shot, few-shot, fine-tuning) and models (Llama 3, Mental-Alpaca, MentalLlama).

Conclusion: Contextual sensitivity to language-emoji interplay significantly improves LLMs in detecting and explaining self-harm signals. The resources created promise to aid broader applications in mental health interventions.

Abstract: Self-harm detection on social media is critical for early intervention and
mental health support, yet remains challenging due to the subtle,
context-dependent nature of such expressions. Identifying self-harm intent aids
suicide prevention by enabling timely responses, but current large language
models (LLMs) struggle to interpret implicit cues in casual language and
emojis. This work enhances LLMs' comprehension of self-harm by distinguishing
intent through nuanced language-emoji interplay. We present the Centennial
Emoji Sensitivity Matrix (CESM-100), a curated set of 100 emojis with
contextual self-harm interpretations and the Self-Harm Identification aNd
intent Extraction with Supportive emoji sensitivity (SHINES) dataset, offering
detailed annotations for self-harm labels, casual mentions (CMs), and serious
intents (SIs). Our unified framework: a) enriches inputs using CESM-100; b)
fine-tunes LLMs for multi-task learning: self-harm detection (primary) and
CM/SI span detection (auxiliary); c) generates explainable rationales for
self-harm predictions. We evaluate the framework on three state-of-the-art
LLMs-Llama 3, Mental-Alpaca, and MentalLlama, across zero-shot, few-shot, and
fine-tuned scenarios. By coupling intent differentiation with contextual cues,
our approach commendably enhances LLM performance in both detection and
explanation tasks, effectively addressing the inherent ambiguity in self-harm
signals. The SHINES dataset, CESM-100 and codebase are publicly available at:

*HaoTian Lan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study uses AI-powered analysis of street-level features via image data to examine how these features influence retail performance and user satisfaction in Harbin, China, offering insights into urban design and planning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to understand how street-level features like parked vehicles, greenery, and cleanliness impact community commerce and user satisfaction.

Method: The researchers propose an interpretable, image-based framework using street view imagery, a large language model (VisualGLM-6B), and perception modeling via GPT-4 to construct and analyze a Community Commercial Vitality Index (CCVI).

Result: The findings indicate that moderate vehicle presence improves access but excessive parking hurts walkability. Greenery and cleanliness enhance user satisfaction but have limited influence on shop pricing. Street width modifies the impact of other factors.

Conclusion: This research demonstrates the feasibility of using AI to analyze urban perceptual factors and provides actionable insights for urban design and planning, particularly in parking and street configuration.

Abstract: The commercial vitality of community-scale streets in Chinese cities is
shaped by complex interactions between vehicular accessibility, environmental
quality, and pedestrian perception. This study proposes an interpretable,
image-based framework to examine how street-level features -- including parked
vehicle density, greenery, cleanliness, and street width -- impact retail
performance and user satisfaction in Harbin, China. Leveraging street view
imagery and a multimodal large language model (VisualGLM-6B), we construct a
Community Commercial Vitality Index (CCVI) from Meituan and Dianping data and
analyze its relationship with spatial attributes extracted via GPT-4-based
perception modeling. Our findings reveal that while moderate vehicle presence
may enhance commercial access, excessive on-street parking -- especially in
narrow streets -- erodes walkability and reduces both satisfaction and
shop-level pricing. In contrast, streets with higher perceived greenery and
cleanliness show significantly greater satisfaction scores but only weak
associations with pricing. Street width moderates the effects of vehicle
presence, underscoring the importance of spatial configuration. These results
demonstrate the value of integrating AI-assisted perception with urban
morphological analysis to capture non-linear and context-sensitive drivers of
commercial success. This study advances both theoretical and methodological
frontiers by highlighting the conditional role of vehicle activity in
neighborhood commerce and demonstrating the feasibility of multimodal AI for
perceptual urban diagnostics. The implications extend to urban design, parking
management, and scalable planning tools for community revitalization.

### [113] [CL-ISR: A Contrastive Learning and Implicit Stance Reasoning Framework for Misleading Text Detection on Social Media](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05107)
*Tianyi Huang,Zikun Cui,Cuiqianhe Du,Chia-En Chiang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces CL-ISR, a framework combining contrastive learning and implicit stance reasoning, to enhance misleading text detection on social media.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Misleading texts on social media cause misunderstanding, social panic, and economic losses, necessitating improved detection techniques.

Method: The CL-ISR framework combines contrastive learning to differentiate truthful and misleading texts with an implicit stance reasoning module to capture stance-related and emotional context.

Result: By combining the two approaches, the CL-ISR framework achieves improved accuracy in detecting misleading texts, especially in linguistically complex scenarios.

Conclusion: The integration of contrastive learning and implicit stance reasoning into the CL-ISR framework effectively enhances the ability to detect misleading texts and offers new insights for mitigating misinformation on social media platforms.

Abstract: Misleading text detection on social media platforms is a critical research
area, as these texts can lead to public misunderstanding, social panic and even
economic losses. This paper proposes a novel framework - CL-ISR (Contrastive
Learning and Implicit Stance Reasoning), which combines contrastive learning
and implicit stance reasoning, to improve the detection accuracy of misleading
texts on social media. First, we use the contrastive learning algorithm to
improve the model's learning ability of semantic differences between truthful
and misleading texts. Contrastive learning could help the model to better
capture the distinguishing features between different categories by
constructing positive and negative sample pairs. This approach enables the
model to capture distinguishing features more effectively, particularly in
linguistically complicated situations. Second, we introduce the implicit stance
reasoning module, to explore the potential stance tendencies in the text and
their relationships with related topics. This method is effective for
identifying content that misleads through stance shifting or emotional
manipulation, because it can capture the implicit information behind the text.
Finally, we integrate these two algorithms together to form a new framework,
CL-ISR, which leverages the discriminative power of contrastive learning and
the interpretive depth of stance reasoning to significantly improve detection
effect.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This research introduces a system combining wav2vec 2.0 and Phi-4 multimodal large language model to assess spoken language proficiency, achieving competitive performance in a major competition.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for spoken language assessment either lack prosodic and phonetic understanding (BERT-based) or semantic interpretability (W2V-based), necessitating a more balanced approach.

Method: The paper employs a score fusion strategy that integrates W2V (acoustic feature model) with the Phi-4 multimodal language model to leverage the strengths of both approaches.

Result: The proposed system secures second place in the Speak & Improve Challenge 2025 with an RMSE of 0.375, outperforming the baseline and most competitors.

Conclusion: By combining linguistic and acoustic modeling techniques, the system demonstrates a balanced and effective solution for spoken language assessment.

Abstract: A recent line of research on spoken language assessment (SLA) employs neural
models such as BERT and wav2vec 2.0 (W2V) to evaluate speaking proficiency
across linguistic and acoustic modalities. Although both models effectively
capture features relevant to oral competence, each exhibits modality-specific
limitations. BERT-based methods rely on ASR transcripts, which often fail to
capture prosodic and phonetic cues for SLA. In contrast, W2V-based methods
excel at modeling acoustic features but lack semantic interpretability. To
overcome these limitations, we propose a system that integrates W2V with Phi-4
multimodal large language model (MLLM) through a score fusion strategy. The
proposed system achieves a root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.375 on the
official test set of the Speak & Improve Challenge 2025, securing second place
in the competition. For comparison, the RMSEs of the top-ranked, third-ranked,
and official baseline systems are 0.364, 0.384, and 0.444, respectively.

*Tanmay Parekh,Kartik Mehta,Ninareh Mehrabi,Kai-Wei Chang,Nanyun Peng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces DiCoRe, a framework aimed at improving zero-shot event detection (ED) in specialized domains, outperforming existing solutions with significant F1 score improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large Language Models (LLMs) struggle with zero-shot ED in specialized domains due to the complexity of event ontologies and domain-specific trigger extraction.

Method: The authors propose DiCoRe, a framework that separates ED into two processes: Dreamer for divergent reasoning (broad event discovery) and Grounder for convergent reasoning (alignment with task-specific constraints). An LLM-Judge is included for output verification.

Result: DiCoRe achieves consistent improvement in performance on zero-shot ED tasks, delivering 4-7% average F1 score gains over the best existing baselines across six datasets and nine LLMs.

Conclusion: DiCoRe proves to be an effective and reliable method for zero-shot ED, setting new benchmarks in precision and coverage.

Abstract: Zero-shot Event Detection (ED), the task of identifying event mentions in
natural language text without any training data, is critical for document
understanding in specialized domains. Understanding the complex event ontology,
extracting domain-specific triggers from the passage, and structuring them
appropriately overloads and limits the utility of Large Language Models (LLMs)
for zero-shot ED. To this end, we propose DiCoRe, a divergent-convergent
reasoning framework that decouples the task of ED using Dreamer and Grounder.
Dreamer encourages divergent reasoning through open-ended event discovery,
which helps to boost event coverage. Conversely, Grounder introduces convergent
reasoning to align the free-form predictions with the task-specific
instructions using finite-state machine guided constrained decoding.
Additionally, an LLM-Judge verifies the final outputs to ensure high precision.
Through extensive experiments on six datasets across five domains and nine
LLMs, we demonstrate how DiCoRe consistently outperforms prior zero-shot,
transfer-learning, and reasoning baselines, achieving 4-7% average F1 gains
over the best baseline -- establishing DiCoRe as a strong zero-shot ED
framework.

*Taiga Someya,Anej Svete,Brian DuSell,Timothy J. O'Donnell,Mario Giulianelli,Ryan Cotterell*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores inductive biases in neural language models through a quantitative framework and measures $m$-local entropy (local uncertainty), finding these biases sensitive to the local statistical structure of languages.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand whether inductive biases in neural language models align with human language processing constraints and how they influence language learning.

Method: The authors introduced $m$-local entropy (an information-theoretic measure) to analyze local uncertainty in languages. Experiments were conducted on perturbed natural language corpora and probabilistic finite-state automata (PFSAs) to evaluate language learning difficulty in Transformers and LSTM models.

Result: Languages with higher $m$-local entropy were observed to be more difficult for Transformer and LSTM language models to learn, showcasing sensitivity to local statistical structures.

Conclusion: The findings suggest that neural language models share similarities with human sensitivity to language structures, emphasizing the role of local statistical properties in learning performance.

Abstract: Inductive biases are inherent in every machine learning system, shaping how
models generalize from finite data. In the case of neural language models
(LMs), debates persist as to whether these biases align with or diverge from
human processing constraints. To address this issue, we propose a quantitative
framework that allows for controlled investigations into the nature of these
biases. Within our framework, we introduce $m$-local entropy$\unicode{x2013}$an
information-theoretic measure derived from average lossy-context
surprisal$\unicode{x2013}$that captures the local uncertainty of a language by
quantifying how effectively the $m-1$ preceding symbols disambiguate the next
symbol. In experiments on both perturbed natural language corpora and languages
defined by probabilistic finite-state automata (PFSAs), we show that languages
with higher $m$-local entropy are more difficult for Transformer and LSTM LMs
to learn. These results suggest that neural LMs, much like humans, are highly
sensitive to the local statistical structure of a language.

*Chih-Kai Yang,Neo Ho,Yi-Jyun Lee,Hung-yi Lee*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper conducts an in-depth analysis of large audio-language models (LALMs) to understand their internal mechanisms for recognizing auditory attributes. It tracks information through model layers, revealing attributes are better resolved early and suggesting improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to uncover how LALMs process auditory attributes internally, as this understanding is essential for interpreting their behaviors and enhancing performance.

Method: Authors applied vocabulary projection to three state-of-the-art LALMs to trace how auditory attribute information changes across layers and token positions during processing.

Result: They found auditory attribute recognition deteriorates deeper in layers when it fails, and early recognition correlates with better accuracy. Attributes are mainly predicted by querying inputs rather than using aggregated hidden states.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that understanding internal attribute processing enables methods to enhance LALMs, providing new insights to improve auditory attribute recognition capabilities.

Abstract: Understanding the internal mechanisms of large audio-language models (LALMs)
is crucial for interpreting their behavior and improving performance. This work
presents the first in-depth analysis of how LALMs internally perceive and
recognize auditory attributes. By applying vocabulary projection on three
state-of-the-art LALMs, we track how attribute information evolves across
layers and token positions. We find that attribute information generally
decreases with layer depth when recognition fails, and that resolving
attributes at earlier layers correlates with better accuracy. Moreover, LALMs
heavily rely on querying auditory inputs for predicting attributes instead of
aggregating necessary information in hidden states at attribute-mentioning
positions. Based on our findings, we demonstrate a method to enhance LALMs. Our
results offer insights into auditory attribute processing, paving the way for
future improvements.

### [118] [Do Large Language Models Judge Error Severity Like Humans?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05142)
*Diege Sun,Guanyi Chen,Fan Zhao,Xiaorong Cheng,Tingting He*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper compares human and LLM evaluations of errors in image descriptions, revealing disparities in how both judge error severity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand whether LLMs can accurately replicate human judgments on error severity in natural language generation tasks, especially in unimodal and multimodal settings.

Method: The study extends a prior experimental framework by including four error types: age, gender, clothing type, and clothing colour, and evaluates both text-only (unimodal) and text + image (multimodal) contexts.

Result: Human judgments show varying severity levels by error type, amplified by visual context. Most LLMs differ significantly from humans in assessing gender and colour errors, except for Doubao and unimodal DeepSeek-V3, which partially replicate human-like rankings.

Conclusion: LLMs show potential in replicating some aspects of human error severity judgments but struggle with perceptual grounding for certain errors, highlighting areas for improvement.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used as automated evaluators in
natural language generation, yet it remains unclear whether they can accurately
replicate human judgments of error severity. In this study, we systematically
compare human and LLM assessments of image descriptions containing controlled
semantic errors. We extend the experimental framework of van Miltenburg et al.
(2020) to both unimodal (text-only) and multimodal (text + image) settings,
evaluating four error types: age, gender, clothing type, and clothing colour.
Our findings reveal that humans assign varying levels of severity to different
error types, with visual context significantly amplifying perceived severity
for colour and type errors. Notably, most LLMs assign low scores to gender
errors but disproportionately high scores to colour errors, unlike humans, who
judge both as highly severe but for different reasons. This suggests that these
models may have internalised social norms influencing gender judgments but lack
the perceptual grounding to emulate human sensitivity to colour, which is
shaped by distinct neural mechanisms. Only one of the evaluated LLMs, Doubao,
replicates the human-like ranking of error severity, but it fails to
distinguish between error types as clearly as humans. Surprisingly,
DeepSeek-V3, a unimodal LLM, achieves the highest alignment with human
judgments across both unimodal and multimodal conditions, outperforming even
state-of-the-art multimodal models.

TL;DR: The paper introduces Knowledgeable-r1, a method for improving the balance between retrieved context and inherent model knowledge in retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) tasks, delivering significant performance gains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the over-reliance of current RAG systems on retrieved contexts, which often leads to inaccuracies due to misleading or excessive information, neglecting the model's parametric knowledge.

Method: The proposed method, Knowledgeable-r1, employs joint sampling and defines multi-policy distributions to encourage large language models to integrate both parametric and contextual knowledge effectively.

Result: Knowledgeable-r1 achieves significant improvements in robustness and reasoning accuracy, particularly excelling in counterfactual scenarios (outperforming baselines by 17.07%) and showing consistent improvements across general RAG tasks.

Conclusion: The proposed approach successfully resolves the imbalance in current RAG systems, enabling better utilization of both parametric and contextual knowledge to enhance performance on knowledge-intensive tasks.

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) is a mainstream method for improving
performance on knowledge-intensive tasks. However,current RAG systems often
place too much emphasis on retrieved contexts. This can lead to reliance on
inaccurate sources and overlook the model's inherent knowledge, especially when
dealing with misleading or excessive information. To resolve this imbalance, we
propose Knowledgeable-r1 that using joint sampling and define multi policy
distributions in knowledge capability exploration to stimulate large language
models'self-integrated utilization of parametric and contextual knowledge.
Experiments show that Knowledgeable-r1 significantly enhances robustness and
reasoning accuracy in both parameters and contextual conflict tasks and general
RAG tasks, especially outperforming baselines by 17.07% in counterfactual
scenarios and demonstrating consistent gains across RAG tasks. Our code are

Motivation: To understand and address social, demographic, and gender biases embedded in Large Language Models and their structural representation within the model.

Method: Adopted mechanistic interpretability techniques to locate bias-related computations in models. Applied metrics, systematic ablations, and analyzed stability and generalizability of identified components.

Result: Found biases are localized in specific model layers, change across fine-tuning, and share computational overlap with other NLP tasks.

Conclusion: Removing bias-focused components reduces biases but may degrade performance in other NLP tasks, highlighting trade-offs in bias mitigation.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are known to exhibit social, demographic, and
gender biases, often as a consequence of the data on which they are trained. In
this work, we adopt a mechanistic interpretability approach to analyze how such
biases are structurally represented within models such as GPT-2 and Llama2.
Focusing on demographic and gender biases, we explore different metrics to
identify the internal edges responsible for biased behavior. We then assess the
stability, localization, and generalizability of these components across
dataset and linguistic variations. Through systematic ablations, we demonstrate
that bias-related computations are highly localized, often concentrated in a
small subset of layers. Moreover, the identified components change across
fine-tuning settings, including those unrelated to bias. Finally, we show that
removing these components not only reduces biased outputs but also affects
other NLP tasks, such as named entity recognition and linguistic acceptability
judgment because of the sharing of important components with these tasks.

### [121] [ECoRAG: Evidentiality-guided Compression for Long Context RAG](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05167)
*Yeonseok Jeong,Jinsu Kim,Dohyeon Lee,Seung-won Hwang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces ECoRAG, a framework to enhance Large Language Models' effectiveness in Open-Domain Question Answering by focusing on evidentiality-guided context compression.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large context retrieval is resource-intensive, and prior compression methods fail to effectively filter non-evidential information, limiting LLM efficiency in Retrieval-Augmented Generation tasks.

Method: ECoRAG compresses retrieved documents by evaluating evidentiality, checks for sufficient evidence to support answers, and retrieves additional information if required.

Result: ECoRAG improves LLM performance in Open-Domain Question Answering tasks, outperforming previous compression methods in accuracy and cost-efficiency.

Conclusion: ECoRAG enhances efficiency and cost-effectiveness of Open-Domain Question Answering in LLMs, offering accurate answers while minimizing latency and token usage.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable performance in Open-Domain
Question Answering (ODQA) by leveraging external documents through
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). To reduce RAG overhead, from longer
context, context compression is necessary. However, prior compression methods
do not focus on filtering out non-evidential information, which limit the
performance in LLM-based RAG. We thus propose Evidentiality-guided RAG, or
\textbf{ECoRAG} framework. ECoRAG improves LLM performance by compressing
retrieved documents based on evidentiality, ensuring whether answer generation
is supported by the correct evidence. As an additional step, ECoRAG reflects
whether the compressed content provides sufficient evidence, and if not,
retrieves more until sufficient. Experiments show that ECoRAG improves LLM
performance on ODQA tasks, outperforming existing compression methods.
Furthermore, ECoRAG is highly cost-efficient, as it not only reduces latency
but also minimizes token usage by retaining only the necessary information to
generate the correct answer. Code is available at

TL;DR: The Qwen3 Embedding series is a new advancement in text embedding and reranking, achieving state-of-the-art performance across multilingual and diverse benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to enhance text embedding and reranking capabilities, particularly addressing multilingual and various domain-specific retrieval tasks.

Method: The Qwen3 Embedding series employs Qwen3 LLMs with a multi-stage training pipeline integrating large-scale unsupervised pre-training and supervised fine-tuning. It uses model merging for robustness and synthesizes diverse training data for improvement.

Result: The Qwen3 Embedding series achieves leading performance on benchmarks like MTEB, as well as on retrieval tasks such as code, cross-lingual, and multilingual retrieval.

Conclusion: The Qwen3 Embedding series provides multi-size models with state-of-the-art performance for embedding and reranking, supports diverse scenarios, and is available under the Apache 2.0 license for community use.

Abstract: In this work, we introduce the Qwen3 Embedding series, a significant
advancement over its predecessor, the GTE-Qwen series, in text embedding and
reranking capabilities, built upon the Qwen3 foundation models. Leveraging the
Qwen3 LLMs' robust capabilities in multilingual text understanding and
generation, our innovative multi-stage training pipeline combines large-scale
unsupervised pre-training with supervised fine-tuning on high-quality datasets.
Effective model merging strategies further ensure the robustness and
adaptability of the Qwen3 Embedding series. During the training process, the
Qwen3 LLMs serve not only as backbone models but also play a crucial role in
synthesizing high-quality, rich, and diverse training data across multiple
domains and languages, thus enhancing the training pipeline. The Qwen3
Embedding series offers a spectrum of model sizes (0.6B, 4B, 8B) for both
embedding and reranking tasks, addressing diverse deployment scenarios where
users can optimize for either efficiency or effectiveness. Empirical
evaluations demonstrate that the Qwen3 Embedding series achieves
state-of-the-art results across diverse benchmarks. Notably, it excels on the
multilingual evaluation benchmark MTEB for text embedding, as well as in
various retrieval tasks, including code retrieval, cross-lingual retrieval and
multilingual retrieval. To facilitate reproducibility and promote
community-driven research and development, the Qwen3 Embedding models are
publicly available under the Apache 2.0 license.

*Moritz Miller,Bernhard Schölkopf,Siyuan Guo*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This work explores the capability of large-scale language models to perform counterfactual reasoning through in-context learning using synthetic setups like linear regression tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the ability of large-scale language models to engage in counterfactual reasoning and predict outcomes of hypothetical scenarios without parameter updates.

Method: The study uses a synthetic setup where linear regression tasks requiring noise abduction are analyzed. This involves inferring and copying contextual noise from factual observations.

Result: The study shows that language models can effectively perform counterfactual reasoning in controlled setups, influenced by factors like self-attention, model depth, and data diversity. Additionally, it highlights the potential for such reasoning in sequential data.

Conclusion: Language models, particularly Transformers, exhibit promising capabilities for counterfactual reasoning, with potential applications in story generation and beyond.

Abstract: Large-scale neural language models (LMs) exhibit remarkable performance in
in-context learning: the ability to learn and reason the input context on the
fly without parameter update. This work studies in-context counterfactual
reasoning in language models, that is, to predict the consequences of changes
under hypothetical scenarios. We focus on studying a well-defined synthetic
setup: a linear regression task that requires noise abduction, where accurate
prediction is based on inferring and copying the contextual noise from factual
observations. We show that language models are capable of counterfactual
reasoning in this controlled setup and provide insights that counterfactual
reasoning for a broad class of functions can be reduced to a transformation on
in-context observations; we find self-attention, model depth, and data
diversity in pre-training drive performance in Transformers. More
interestingly, our findings extend beyond regression tasks and show that
Transformers can perform noise abduction on sequential data, providing
preliminary evidence on the potential for counterfactual story generation. Our

*Jackson Petty,Michael Y. Hu,Wentao Wang,Shauli Ravfogel,William Merrill,Tal Linzen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces the RELIC framework to evaluate LLMs' instruction-following skills through synthetic language recognition tasks with adjustable complexity. Results show modern LLMs struggle with complex grammars.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Evaluate the instruction-following ability of LLMs using a systematic and scalable approach based on synthetic language recognition.

Method: Proposed the RELIC framework, which uses synthetic grammars to assess LLMs' performance on language recognition tasks of varying complexity, along with generating tasks that minimize data contamination.

Result: State-of-the-art LLMs were found to perform near chance on complex grammars and tasks. Performance depends on grammar complexity and sample instances, with models switching to shallow heuristics for harder tasks.

Conclusion: Current LLMs struggle to follow complex instructions in synthetic language tasks, highlighting limitations and providing a diagnostic tool for improvement.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly expected to perform tasks based
only on a specification of the task provided in context, without examples of
inputs and outputs; this ability is referred to as instruction following. We
introduce the Recognition of Languages In-Context (RELIC) framework to evaluate
instruction following using language recognition: the task of determining if a
string is generated by formal grammar. Unlike many standard evaluations of
LLMs' ability to use their context, this task requires composing together a
large number of instructions (grammar productions) retrieved from the context.
Because the languages are synthetic, the task can be increased in complexity as
LLMs' skills improve, and new instances can be automatically generated,
mitigating data contamination. We evaluate state-of-the-art LLMs on RELIC and
find that their accuracy can be reliably predicted from the complexity of the
grammar and the individual example strings, and that even the most advanced
LLMs currently available show near-chance performance on more complex grammars
and samples, in line with theoretical expectations. We also use RELIC to
diagnose how LLMs attempt to solve increasingly difficult reasoning tasks,
finding that as the complexity of the language recognition task increases,
models switch to relying on shallow heuristics instead of following complex
instructions.

TL;DR: The Common Pile v0.1 is an 8TB openly licensed text dataset that enables high-quality LLM training, validated through the competitive performance of two newly trained 7B parameter models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address ethical and legal concerns regarding the use of unlicensed text in training large language models (LLMs), and to improve the quality of openly licensed datasets for LLM pretraining.

Method: The authors collected, curated, and released the Common Pile v0.1, a large dataset of openly licensed text from 30 diverse sources. They trained two 7 billion parameter LLMs (Comma v0.1-1T and Comma v0.1-2T) on this dataset to validate its quality.

Result: The trained models (Comma v0.1-1T and Comma v0.1-2T) achieved competitive performance compared to similar LLMs trained on unlicensed datasets, such as Llama 1 and 2 7B.

Conclusion: Openly licensed datasets like the Common Pile v0.1 can be a viable alternative to unlicensed datasets for LLM pretraining, reducing ethical and legal issues while maintaining strong model performance.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are typically trained on enormous quantities of
unlicensed text, a practice that has led to scrutiny due to possible
intellectual property infringement and ethical concerns. Training LLMs on
openly licensed text presents a first step towards addressing these issues, but
prior data collection efforts have yielded datasets too small or low-quality to
produce performant LLMs. To address this gap, we collect, curate, and release
the Common Pile v0.1, an eight terabyte collection of openly licensed text
designed for LLM pretraining. The Common Pile comprises content from 30 sources
that span diverse domains including research papers, code, books,
encyclopedias, educational materials, audio transcripts, and more. Crucially,
we validate our efforts by training two 7 billion parameter LLMs on text from
the Common Pile: Comma v0.1-1T and Comma v0.1-2T, trained on 1 and 2 trillion
tokens respectively. Both models attain competitive performance to LLMs trained
on unlicensed text with similar computational budgets, such as Llama 1 and 2
7B. In addition to releasing the Common Pile v0.1 itself, we also release the
code used in its creation as well as the training mixture and checkpoints for
the Comma v0.1 models.

*Adam Wiemerslage,Katharina von der Wense*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper examines the use of self-supervised auxiliary tasks in character-level morphological inflection for low-resource languages, finding autoencoding effective with limited data and character masked language modeling (CMLM) more beneficial as data increases.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The lack of resources for many world languages motivates research in leveraging small amounts of data for character-level NLP tasks, especially for morphological inflection, which is vital for language documentation.

Method: The study deploys self-supervised auxiliary objectives on encoder-decoder transformers for 19 languages and 13 tasks, analyzing performance under varying data availability.

Result: Autoencoding performs best with scarce data, while CMLM gains effectiveness with larger datasets. Sampling masks based on morpheme boundaries improves outcomes significantly.

Conclusion: In low-resource morphological modeling, self-supervised tasks show promise, with morpheme-informed masking enhancing performance in a low-data scenario.

Abstract: Self-supervised objectives have driven major advances in NLP by leveraging
large-scale unlabeled data, but such resources are scarce for many of the
world's languages. Surprisingly, they have not been explored much for
character-level tasks, where smaller amounts of data have the potential to be
beneficial. We investigate the effectiveness of self-supervised auxiliary tasks
for morphological inflection -- a character-level task highly relevant for
language documentation -- in extremely low-resource settings, training
encoder-decoder transformers for 19 languages and 13 auxiliary objectives.
Autoencoding yields the best performance when unlabeled data is very limited,
while character masked language modeling (CMLM) becomes more effective as data
availability increases. Though objectives with stronger inductive biases
influence model predictions intuitively, they rarely outperform standard CMLM.
However, sampling masks based on known morpheme boundaries consistently
improves performance, highlighting a promising direction for low-resource
morphological modeling.

### [127] [Towards a Unified System of Representation for Continuity and Discontinuity in Natural Language](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05235)
*Ratna Kandala,Prakash Mondal*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper addresses syntactic discontinuity (split constituents) by proposing a unified system of representation incorporating Phrase Structure Grammar (PSG), Dependency Grammar (DG), and Categorial Grammar (CG).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing linguistic frameworks treat syntactic discontinuity differently, leading to independent and non-converging systems of analysis.

Method: The authors synthesize representations from PSG, DG, and CG into a unified mathematical derivation for analyzing both continuous and discontinuous linguistic structures.

Result: The approach demonstrates that grammatical structures with continuity and discontinuity can be analyzed within a single, coherent system.

Conclusion: This work bridges gaps between three major grammar formalisms, creating a unified framework for natural language analysis.

Abstract: Syntactic discontinuity is a grammatical phenomenon in which a constituent is
split into more than one part because of the insertion of an element which is
not part of the constituent. This is observed in many languages across the
world such as Turkish, Russian, Japanese, Warlpiri, Navajo, Hopi, Dyirbal,
Yidiny etc. Different formalisms/frameworks in current linguistic theory
approach the problem of discontinuous structures in different ways. Each
framework/formalism has widely been viewed as an independent and non-converging
system of analysis. In this paper, we propose a unified system of
representation for both continuity and discontinuity in structures of natural
languages by taking into account three formalisms, in particular, Phrase
Structure Grammar (PSG) for its widely used notion of constituency, Dependency
Grammar (DG) for its head-dependent relations, and Categorial Grammar (CG) for
its focus on functor-argument relations. We attempt to show that discontinuous
expressions as well as continuous structures can be analysed through a unified
mathematical derivation incorporating the representations of linguistic
structure in these three grammar formalisms.

*Ron Eliav,Arie Cattan,Eran Hirsch,Shahaf Bassan,Elias Stengel-Eskin,Mohit Bansal,Ido Dagan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper proposes using a structured, 3-step reasoning process to improve hallucination detection in text by decomposing claims and methodically verifying evidence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for hallucination detection via natural language inference rely on large language models but may benefit from explicit reasoning methods, given the complexity of entailment classification.

Method: The method involves a 3-step reasoning process: claim decomposition, sub-claim attribution and entailment classification, followed by aggregated classification, guided systematically to improve performance.

Result: Models guided by this reasoning approach demonstrate finer-grained and more accurate entailment decisions, along with empirical metrics showing quality improvement.

Conclusion: A systematic, guided reasoning framework enhances hallucination detection and provides improved performance compared to conventional approaches.

Abstract: A common approach to hallucination detection casts it as a natural language
inference (NLI) task, often using LLMs to classify whether the generated text
is entailed by corresponding reference texts. Since entailment classification
is a complex reasoning task, one would expect that LLMs could benefit from
generating an explicit reasoning process, as in CoT reasoning or the explicit
``thinking'' of recent reasoning models. In this work, we propose that guiding
such models to perform a systematic and comprehensive reasoning process -- one
that both decomposes the text into smaller facts and also finds evidence in the
source for each fact -- allows models to execute much finer-grained and
accurate entailment decisions, leading to increased performance. To that end,
we define a 3-step reasoning process, consisting of (i) claim decomposition,
(ii) sub-claim attribution and entailment classification, and (iii) aggregated
classification, showing that such guided reasoning indeed yields improved
hallucination detection. Following this reasoning framework, we introduce an
analysis scheme, consisting of several metrics that measure the quality of the
intermediate reasoning steps, which provided additional empirical evidence for
the improved quality of our guided reasoning scheme.

*Nan Huo,Jinyang Li,Bowen Qin,Ge Qu,Xiaolong Li,Xiaodong Li,Chenhao Ma,Reynold Cheng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper addresses the issue of "Knowledge Conflicts" in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems by introducing "Micro-Act," a hierarchical framework that adapts comparison approaches to effectively handle conflicting knowledge sources. It achieves significant improvements in question answering (QA) accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to resolve the issue of Knowledge Conflicts in RAG systems, where the retrieved external knowledge conflicts with the internal, parametric knowledge of large language models, negatively impacting the performance on downstream tasks like question answering.

Method: The proposed method, called Micro-Act, introduces a hierarchical action space to adaptively decompose knowledge sources into fine-grained actionable comparisons. This approach reduces extraneous context for large language models, enabling them to reason beyond superficial inconsistencies.

Result: Micro-Act demonstrated consistent and significant increases in QA accuracy compared to state-of-the-art baselines across five benchmark datasets and three types of conflicts (temporal, semantic, and others). It also performed well on non-conflict questions, proving its robustness.

Conclusion: Micro-Act effectively mitigates Knowledge Conflicts and enhances QA performance in RAG systems, showing promise for practical, real-world applications due to its robust handling of both conflict and non-conflict scenarios.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems commonly suffer from Knowledge
Conflicts, where retrieved external knowledge contradicts the inherent,
parametric knowledge of large language models (LLMs). It adversely affects
performance on downstream tasks such as question answering (QA). Existing
approaches often attempt to mitigate conflicts by directly comparing two
knowledge sources in a side-by-side manner, but this can overwhelm LLMs with
extraneous or lengthy contexts, ultimately hindering their ability to identify
and mitigate inconsistencies. To address this issue, we propose Micro-Act a
framework with a hierarchical action space that automatically perceives context
complexity and adaptively decomposes each knowledge source into a sequence of
fine-grained comparisons. These comparisons are represented as actionable
steps, enabling reasoning beyond the superficial context. Through extensive
experiments on five benchmark datasets, Micro-Act consistently achieves
significant increase in QA accuracy over state-of-the-art baselines across all
5 datasets and 3 conflict types, especially in temporal and semantic types
where all baselines fail significantly. More importantly, Micro-Act exhibits
robust performance on non-conflict questions simultaneously, highlighting its
practical value in real-world RAG applications.

TL;DR: ProRefine, a new method for refining AI prompts during inference, significantly improves reasoning task performance without additional training, allowing smaller AI models to rival larger ones.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address error propagation and sub-optimal performance in collaborative AI agent workflows caused by poorly designed prompts.

Method: Develop ProRefine, an inference-time prompt optimization technique using textual feedback from large language models, dynamically refining prompts during reasoning tasks.

Result: ProRefine outperforms zero-shot Chain-of-Thought baselines by 3-37 percentage points on five mathematical reasoning datasets.

Conclusion: ProRefine enhances accuracy, scalability, and efficiency in AI systems, enabling smaller models to perform as effectively as larger ones, democratizing AI capabilities.

Abstract: Agentic workflows, where multiple AI agents collaborate to accomplish complex
tasks like reasoning or planning, are becoming increasingly prevalent. However,
these workflows often suffer from error propagation and sub-optimal
performance, largely due to poorly designed prompts that fail to effectively
guide individual agents. This is a critical problem because it limits the
reliability and scalability of these powerful systems. We introduce ProRefine,
an innovative inference-time prompt optimization method that leverages textual
feedback from large language models (LLMs) to address this challenge. ProRefine
dynamically refines prompts for multi-step reasoning tasks without additional
training or ground truth labels. Evaluated on five benchmark mathematical
reasoning datasets, ProRefine significantly surpasses zero-shot
Chain-of-Thought baselines by 3 to 37 percentage points. This approach not only
boosts accuracy but also allows smaller models to match the performance of
larger ones, highlighting its potential for efficient and scalable AI
deployment, and democratizing access to high-performing AI.

*Taha Entesari,Arman Hatami,Rinat Khaziev,Anil Ramakrishna,Mahyar Fazlyab*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A new constrained optimization approach is proposed for unlearning in large language models (LLMs) that overcomes challenges in stability and retention, while showing superior results compared to state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the instability and degraded performance that current LLM unlearning methods face, particularly under aggressive forgetting, and to enable more robust solutions for practical use cases like removing sensitive information.

Method: The method formulates unlearning as a constrained optimization problem. It employs a new logit-margin flattening loss to enforce forgetting and a hard constraint to ensure retention. This novel approach avoids numerical instability and maintains efficient optimization using a scalable primal-dual algorithm.

Result: The method shows enhanced performance on the TOFU and MUSE benchmarks across diverse LLM architectures, successfully removing targeted information while maintaining the utility of retained data.

Conclusion: This approach provides a more stable, efficient, and effective solution for LLM unlearning, establishing it as a promising alternative to existing state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) deployed in real-world settings increasingly
face the need to unlearn sensitive, outdated, or proprietary information.
Existing unlearning methods typically formulate forgetting and retention as a
regularized trade-off, combining both objectives into a single scalarized loss.
This often leads to unstable optimization and degraded performance on retained
data, especially under aggressive forgetting. We propose a new formulation of
LLM unlearning as a constrained optimization problem: forgetting is enforced
via a novel logit-margin flattening loss that explicitly drives the output
distribution toward uniformity on a designated forget set, while retention is
preserved through a hard constraint on a separate retain set. Compared to
entropy-based objectives, our loss is softmax-free, numerically stable, and
maintains non-vanishing gradients, enabling more efficient and robust
optimization. We solve the constrained problem using a scalable primal-dual
algorithm that exposes the trade-off between forgetting and retention through
the dynamics of the dual variable. Evaluations on the TOFU and MUSE benchmarks
across diverse LLM architectures demonstrate that our approach consistently
matches or exceeds state-of-the-art baselines, effectively removing targeted
information while preserving downstream utility.

TL;DR: This study introduces Search Arena, a dataset of over 24,000 multi-turn interactions with search-augmented LLMs, analyzing user preferences in diverse settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in evaluating search-augmented LLMs due to limited and narrow datasets, especially for dynamic and multi-turn interactions.

Method: The authors created a large-scale, crowd-sourced dataset, collected human preferences, analyzed citation credibility, and conducted cross-arena testing in different contexts.

Result: The study uncovers user biases towards citation quantity over quality and diverse preferences for sources. It also shows that combining web search with LLMs doesn't degrade and may enhance performance in non-search tasks.

Conclusion: Search-augmented LLMs could improve groundedness and credibility, but there are challenges in citation quality and relevant sourcing. The open-sourced dataset supports further exploration in the field.

Abstract: Search-augmented language models combine web search with Large Language
Models (LLMs) to improve response groundedness and freshness. However,
analyzing these systems remains challenging: existing datasets are limited in
scale and narrow in scope, often constrained to static, single-turn,
fact-checking questions. In this work, we introduce Search Arena, a
crowd-sourced, large-scale, human-preference dataset of over 24,000 paired
multi-turn user interactions with search-augmented LLMs. The dataset spans
diverse intents and languages, and contains full system traces with around
12,000 human preference votes. Our analysis reveals that user preferences are
influenced by the number of citations, even when the cited content does not
directly support the attributed claims, uncovering a gap between perceived and
actual credibility. Furthermore, user preferences vary across cited sources,
revealing that community-driven platforms are generally preferred and static
encyclopedic sources are not always appropriate and reliable. To assess
performance across different settings, we conduct cross-arena analyses by
testing search-augmented LLMs in a general-purpose chat environment and
conventional LLMs in search-intensive settings. We find that web search does
not degrade and may even improve performance in non-search settings; however,
the quality in search settings is significantly affected if solely relying on
the model's parametric knowledge. We open-sourced the dataset to support future
research in this direction. Our dataset and code are available at:

*Anirudh Bharadwaj,Chaitanya Malaviya,Nitish Joshi,Mark Yatskar*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper highlights biases in language model preference judgments that misalign with human preferences, investigating causes and proposing counterfactual data augmentation (CDA) as a debiasing method.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Language models, used for human preference alignment, often prioritize superficial and spurious cues like length and style over substance, leading to issues like miscalibration and ineffective evaluations due to biases rooted in training data.

Method: The study quantifies bias skew using controlled counterfactual pairs, evaluates miscalibration against human and model preferences, and implements targeted debiasing via counterfactual data augmentation to correct these biases.

Result: By finetuning with CDA, miscalibration was reduced from 39.4% to 32.5%, and skew difference was decreased from 20.5% to 10.0%, while maintaining robust RewardBench performance.

Conclusion: Targeted debiasing through CDA improves the reliability of preference models by addressing systematic biases without compromising performance, offering a path for better human preference alignment.

Abstract: Language models serve as proxies for human preference judgements in alignment
and evaluation, yet they exhibit systematic miscalibration, prioritizing
superficial patterns over substantive qualities. This bias manifests as
overreliance on features like length, structure, and style, leading to issues
like reward hacking and unreliable evaluations. Evidence suggests these biases
originate in artifacts in human training data. In this work, we systematically
investigate the relationship between training data biases and preference model
miscalibration across five idiosyncratic features of language model
generations: length, structure, jargon, sycophancy and vagueness. Using
controlled counterfactual pairs, we first quantify the extent to which
preference models favor responses with magnified biases (skew), finding this
preference occurs in >60% of instances, and model preferences show high
miscalibration (~40%) compared to human preferences. Notably, bias features
only show mild negative correlations to human preference labels (mean r_human =
-0.12) but show moderately strong positive correlations with labels from a
strong reward model (mean r_model = +0.36), suggesting that models may overrely
on spurious cues. To mitigate these issues, we propose a simple post-training
method based on counterfactual data augmentation (CDA) using synthesized
contrastive examples. Finetuning models with CDA reduces average miscalibration
from 39.4% to 32.5% and average absolute skew difference from 20.5% to 10.0%,
while maintaining overall RewardBench performance, showing that targeted
debiasing is effective for building reliable preference models.

TL;DR: The paper proposes Dynamic Epsilon Scheduling (DES), an adaptive method that adjusts adversarial perturbation budgets dynamically to enhance robustness and accuracy in neural networks.


<details>

Motivation: Traditional adversarial training methods use a fixed perturbation budget, failing to account for instance-specific robustness and leading to suboptimal defenses against adversarial examples.

Method: The proposed DES dynamically adjusts the adversarial perturbation budget for each instance and training iteration. It uses information derived from the distance to the decision boundary, prediction confidence, and model uncertainty, unified via a specialized scheduling strategy.

Result: Experiments on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 demonstrate that DES significantly improves adversarial robustness and standard accuracy over fixed-epsilon baselines and prior adaptive methods.

Conclusion: DES provides an effective, instance-aware approach to adversarial training, improving the robustness and stability of deep neural networks. It opens the door for more data-driven training strategies.

Abstract: Adversarial training is among the most effective strategies for defending
deep neural networks against adversarial examples. A key limitation of existing
adversarial training approaches lies in their reliance on a fixed perturbation
budget, which fails to account for instance-specific robustness
characteristics. While prior works such as IAAT and MMA introduce
instance-level adaptations, they often rely on heuristic or static
approximations of data robustness. In this paper, we propose Dynamic Epsilon
Scheduling (DES), a novel framework that adaptively adjusts the adversarial
perturbation budget per instance and per training iteration. DES integrates
three key factors: (1) the distance to the decision boundary approximated via
gradient-based proxies, (2) prediction confidence derived from softmax entropy,
and (3) model uncertainty estimated via Monte Carlo dropout. By combining these
cues into a unified scheduling strategy, DES tailors the perturbation budget
dynamically to guide more effective adversarial learning. Experimental results
on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 show that our method consistently improves both
adversarial robustness and standard accuracy compared to fixed-epsilon
baselines and prior adaptive methods. Moreover, we provide theoretical insights
into the stability and convergence of our scheduling policy. This work opens a
new avenue for instance-aware, data-driven adversarial training methods.

*Yi Lu,Jiawang Cao,Yongliang Wu,Bozheng Li,Licheng Tang,Yangguang Ji,Chong Wu,Jay Wu,Wenbo Zhu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RSVP is a framework that improves visual grounding in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) by integrating reasoning-driven localization and visual segmentation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the gap in MLLMs between cognitive reasoning and visual perception, especially the lack of mechanisms for visual grounding and segmentation.

Method: The method involves a two-stage framework: multimodal reasoning through visual prompting to produce region proposals and segmentation refinement using a Vision-Language Segmentation Module (VLSM).

Result: RSVP achieved state-of-the-art results, improving performance metrics like gIoU by +6.5, cIoU by +9.2, and attaining an mAP of 49.7 on SegInW in zero-shot scenarios.

Conclusion: RSVP effectively bridges reasoning and visual understanding, demonstrating scalable and interpretable integration of reasoning with structured visual segmentation tasks.

Abstract: Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable
reasoning capability while lack explicit mechanisms for visual grounding and
segmentation, creating a gap between cognitive reasoning and visual perception.
To bridge this gap, we introduce Reasoning Segmentation via Visual Prompting
(RSVP), a novel framework that unifies multi-step multimodal reasoning with
grounded visual understanding. RSVP is a two-stage structuralized framework
that integrates reasoning-driven localization with segmentation refinement. In
the reasoning stage, RSVP employs multimodal chain-of-thought visual prompts to
help MLLMs understand queries and infer targets, generating interpretable
region proposals that enhance visual grounding. In segmentation stage, RSVP
refines these proposals with a Vision-Language Segmentation Module (VLSM),
seamlessly integrates textual and visual cues to produce precise segmentation
masks. By explicitly modelling the interaction between multimodal reasoning and
segmentation, RSVP introduces a new paradigm for interpretable reasoning
segmentation. It exploits MLLMs' inherent localization capabilities, enabling
the models to not only reason about objects but also generate structured visual
representations. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that RSVP achieves
state-of-the-art performance, surpasses state-of-the-art methods by up to +6.5
gIoU and +9.2 cIoU on ReasonSeg, and achieves 49.7 mAP on SegInW under
zero-shot settings. These results validate RSVP as an effective and scalable
framework for integrating cognitive reasoning with structured visual
understanding.

TL;DR: The paper introduces MMRB, a benchmark for evaluating structured visual reasoning across multiple images, addressing the gap in multi-image reasoning capabilities of MLLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of benchmarks evaluating reasoning capabilities of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) across multiple images.

Method: The authors created the MMRB benchmark, consisting of 92 sub-tasks across spatial, temporal, and semantic reasoning with GPT-4o-generated and human-refined multi-solution annotations.

Result: Experiments on 40 MLLMs reveal open-source models lag behind commercial ones in multi-image reasoning, and current multimodal reward models struggle with reward ranking tasks.

Conclusion: The study highlights the significant room for improvement in MLLMs' multi-image reasoning and reward ranking capabilities, especially for open-source models.

Abstract: With enhanced capabilities and widespread applications, Multimodal Large
Language Models (MLLMs) are increasingly required to process and reason over
multiple images simultaneously. However, existing MLLM benchmarks focus either
on single-image visual reasoning or on multi-image understanding tasks with
only final-answer evaluation, leaving the reasoning capabilities of MLLMs over
multi-image inputs largely underexplored. To address this gap, we introduce the
$\textbf{Multimodal Multi-image Reasoning Benchmark (MMRB)}$, the first
benchmark designed to evaluate structured visual reasoning across multiple
images. MMRB comprises $\textbf{92 sub-tasks}$ covering spatial, temporal, and
semantic reasoning, with multi-solution, CoT-style annotations generated by
GPT-4o and refined by human experts. A derivative subset is designed to
evaluate multimodal reward models in multi-image scenarios. To support fast and
scalable evaluation, we propose a sentence-level matching framework using
open-source LLMs. Extensive baseline experiments on $\textbf{40 MLLMs}$,
including 9 reasoning-specific models and 8 reward models, demonstrate that
open-source MLLMs still lag significantly behind commercial MLLMs in
multi-image reasoning tasks. Furthermore, current multimodal reward models are
nearly incapable of handling multi-image reward ranking tasks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a weakly supervised pipeline for 3D human generation, aiming to solve challenges in controllability, realism, diversity, and rendering quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in 3D human representation, including fine detail control, rendering accuracy, realism, and appearances due to limitations in current methods and datasets.

Method: A pipeline combining photorealistic human image generation via a diffusion model, image-to-3D mapping using a transformer-based architecture, and a text-conditioned point-cloud diffusion model.

Result: Significant improvements in generation speed, realism, rendering quality, and alignment with text prompts over current state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: The approach successfully addresses key challenges in 3D human generation and promises practical contributions with open code and datasets for further advancements.

Abstract: 3D human generation is an important problem with a wide range of applications
in computer vision and graphics. Despite recent progress in generative AI such
as diffusion models or rendering methods like Neural Radiance Fields or
Gaussian Splatting, controlling the generation of accurate 3D humans from text
prompts remains an open challenge. Current methods struggle with fine detail,
accurate rendering of hands and faces, human realism, and controlability over
appearance. The lack of diversity, realism, and annotation in human image data
also remains a challenge, hindering the development of a foundational 3D human
model. We present a weakly supervised pipeline that tries to address these
challenges. In the first step, we generate a photorealistic human image dataset
with controllable attributes such as appearance, race, gender, etc using a
state-of-the-art image diffusion model. Next, we propose an efficient mapping
approach from image features to 3D point clouds using a transformer-based
architecture. Finally, we close the loop by training a point-cloud diffusion
model that is conditioned on the same text prompts used to generate the
original samples. We demonstrate orders-of-magnitude speed-ups in 3D human
generation compared to the state-of-the-art approaches, along with
significantly improved text-prompt alignment, realism, and rendering quality.
We will make the code and dataset available.

TL;DR: ReXVQA is a large benchmark for visual question answering (VQA) in chest radiology, featuring approximately 696,000 questions linked to 160,000 chest X-rays and testing state-of-the-art AI models on radiological reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address the limitations of prior VQA benchmarks in radiology by creating a comprehensive dataset and evaluation framework that assesses diverse and clinically relevant reasoning skills.

Method: The paper presents the ReXVQA dataset and evaluates it using 8 state-of-the-art multimodal AI models. It also conducts a comparison with human radiologists through a reader study.

Result: The best-performing AI model (MedGemma) achieved 83.24% accuracy, surpassing the best radiology resident’s accuracy of 77.27% in a human reader study.

Conclusion: ReXVQA establishes a new standard for radiological AI evaluation and provides a pathway for developing clinically capable AI systems that perform beyond narrow pathology classification.

Abstract: We present ReXVQA, the largest and most comprehensive benchmark for visual
question answering (VQA) in chest radiology, comprising approximately 696,000
questions paired with 160,000 chest X-rays studies across training, validation,
and test sets. Unlike prior efforts that rely heavily on template based
queries, ReXVQA introduces a diverse and clinically authentic task suite
reflecting five core radiological reasoning skills: presence assessment,
location analysis, negation detection, differential diagnosis, and geometric
reasoning. We evaluate eight state-of-the-art multimodal large language models,
including MedGemma-4B-it, Qwen2.5-VL, Janus-Pro-7B, and Eagle2-9B. The
best-performing model (MedGemma) achieves 83.24% overall accuracy. To bridge
the gap between AI performance and clinical expertise, we conducted a
comprehensive human reader study involving 3 radiology residents on 200
randomly sampled cases. Our evaluation demonstrates that MedGemma achieved
superior performance (83.84% accuracy) compared to human readers (best
radiology resident: 77.27%), representing a significant milestone where AI
performance exceeds expert human evaluation on chest X-ray interpretation. The
reader study reveals distinct performance patterns between AI models and human
experts, with strong inter-reader agreement among radiologists while showing
more variable agreement patterns between human readers and AI models. ReXVQA
establishes a new standard for evaluating generalist radiological AI systems,
offering public leaderboards, fine-grained evaluation splits, structured
explanations, and category-level breakdowns. This benchmark lays the foundation
for next-generation AI systems capable of mimicking expert-level clinical

### [139] [WorldPrediction: A Benchmark for High-level World Modeling and Long-horizon Procedural Planning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04363)
*Delong Chen,Willy Chung,Yejin Bang,Ziwei Ji,Pascale Fung*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces 'WorldPrediction,' a video-based benchmark designed to evaluate AI models' abilities in world modeling and procedural planning, showcasing challenges in current AI methodologies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI models, particularly generative ones, lack clarity on how they learn 'world models' essential for action planning in diverse environments, which humans inherently possess.

Method: The authors propose the WorldPrediction benchmark with two tasks: WorldPrediction-WM (identifying appropriate actions) and WorldPrediction-PP (ordering actions properly) from visual observations in counterfactual contexts. Measures include human filtering and formalized semi-MDP frameworks.

Result: Current AI models perform poorly, achieving only 57% on WorldPrediction-WM and 38% on WorldPrediction-PP, compared to perfect human performance.

Conclusion: WorldPrediction exposes significant gaps in current AI models' capabilities in semantic and temporal abstraction for action planning, highlighting the need for improved approaches.

Abstract: Humans are known to have an internal "world model" that enables us to carry
out action planning based on world states. AI agents need to have such a world
model for action planning as well. It is not clear how current AI models,
especially generative models, are able to learn such world models and carry out
procedural planning in diverse environments. We introduce WorldPrediction, a
video-based benchmark for evaluating world modeling and procedural planning
capabilities of different AI models. In contrast to prior benchmarks that focus
primarily on low-level world modeling and robotic motion planning,
WorldPrediction is the first benchmark that emphasizes actions with temporal
and semantic abstraction. Given initial and final world states, the task is to
distinguish the proper action (WorldPrediction-WM) or the properly ordered
sequence of actions (WorldPrediction-PP) from a set of counterfactual
distractors. This discriminative task setup enable us to evaluate different
types of world models and planners and realize a thorough comparison across
different hypothesis. The benchmark represents states and actions using visual
observations. In order to prevent models from exploiting low-level continuity
cues in background scenes, we provide "action equivalents" - identical actions
observed in different contexts - as candidates for selection. This benchmark is
grounded in a formal framework of partially observable semi-MDP, ensuring
better reliability and robustness of the evaluation. We conduct extensive human
filtering and validation on our benchmark and show that current frontier models
barely achieve 57% accuracy on WorldPrediction-WM and 38% on WorldPrediction-PP
whereas humans are able to solve both tasks perfectly.

### [140] [Ice Hockey Puck Localization Using Contextual Cues](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04365)
*Liam Salass,Jerrin Bright,Amir Nazemi,Yuhao Chen,John Zelek,David Clausi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces PLUCC, a novel approach incorporating contextual and scale-aware cues for puck detection in ice hockey broadcasts, achieving state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Puck detection in ice hockey is challenging due to the puck's small size, occlusions, motion blur, varying camera zoom, and inconsistent perspectives. Existing methods lack explicit modeling of contextual cues, particularly those derived from player behaviors like body orientation and gaze, which can provide vital information.

Method: The proposed PLUCC method utilizes (a) a contextual encoder to capture player positioning and orientation as contextual priors, (b) a multiscale feature pyramid encoder for robust feature extraction, and (c) a gating decoder with a channel gating mechanism to combine latent features. A new metric, RSLE, is also introduced for scale-invariant evaluation.

Result: The PLUCC method achieved significantly improved performance with an average precision increase of 12.2% and RSLE average precision improvement of 25% on the PuckDataset, outperforming existing baseline methods.

Conclusion: The study highlights the importance of incorporating contextual awareness, particularly player behavior cues, for improving puck detection. The approach demonstrates potential for broader applications in automated sports analysis.

Abstract: Puck detection in ice hockey broadcast videos poses significant challenges
due to the puck's small size, frequent occlusions, motion blur, broadcast
artifacts, and scale inconsistencies due to varying camera zoom and broadcast
camera viewpoints. Prior works focus on appearance-based or motion-based cues
of the puck without explicitly modelling the cues derived from player
behaviour. Players consistently turn their bodies and direct their gaze toward
the puck. Motivated by this strong contextual cue, we propose Puck Localization
Using Contextual Cues (PLUCC), a novel approach for scale-aware and
context-driven single-frame puck detections. PLUCC consists of three
components: (a) a contextual encoder, which utilizes player orientations and
positioning as helpful priors; (b) a feature pyramid encoder, which extracts
multiscale features from the dual encoders; and (c) a gating decoder that
combines latent features with a channel gating mechanism. For evaluation, in
addition to standard average precision, we propose Rink Space Localization
Error (RSLE), a scale-invariant homography-based metric for removing
perspective bias from rink space evaluation. The experimental results of PLUCC
on the PuckDataset dataset demonstrated state-of-the-art detection performance,
surpassing previous baseline methods by an average precision improvement of
12.2% and RSLE average precision of 25%. Our research demonstrates the critical
role of contextual understanding in improving puck detection performance, with
broad implications for automated sports analysis.

*Matthew W. Shinkle,Mark D. Lescroart*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper shows that activation maximization, a DNN interpretation technique, can be adapted to DNN-based encoding models for predicting and exploring human brain responses to visual stimuli using fMRI data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To better understand the specific visual features driving human brain responses predicted by DNN-based encoding models, which current methods offer limited insight into.

Method: The researchers used activation maximization on a pretrained Inception V3 model, performing linear regression to predict fMRI brain responses, followed by generating voxel-specific and region-of-interest-specific images optimized for brain activity.

Result: Generated images qualitatively correspond to known cortical selectivity and reliably drive activity in targeted brain regions across subjects, validated in both low- and high-level visual areas.

Conclusion: Activation maximization can be flexibly applied to DNN-based encoding models to characterize and modulate visual system responses without requiring natively generative models.

Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) trained on visual tasks develop feature
representations that resemble those in the human visual system. Although
DNN-based encoding models can accurately predict brain responses to visual
stimuli, they offer limited insight into the specific features driving these
responses. Here, we demonstrate that activation maximization -- a technique
designed to interpret vision DNNs -- can be applied to DNN-based encoding
models of the human brain. We extract and adaptively downsample activations
from multiple layers of a pretrained Inception V3 network, then use linear
regression to predict fMRI responses. This yields a full image-computable model
of brain responses. Next, we apply activation maximization to generate images
optimized for predicted responses in individual cortical voxels. We find that
these images contain visual characteristics that qualitatively correspond with
known selectivity and enable exploration of selectivity across the visual
cortex. We further extend our method to whole regions of interest (ROIs) of the
brain and validate its efficacy by presenting these images to human
participants in an fMRI study. We find that the generated images reliably drive
activity in targeted regions across both low- and high-level visual areas and
across subjects. These results demonstrate that activation maximization can be
successfully applied to DNN-based encoding models. By addressing key
limitations of alternative approaches that require natively generative models,
our approach enables flexible characterization and modulation of responses
across the human visual system.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The study explores state-of-the-art video transformer architectures for recognizing Bangla Sign Language (BdSL), achieving high performance on both small and large BdSL datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improve accessibility for the hearing-impaired community in Bangladesh by enhancing the recognition of Bangla Sign Language using advanced video transformer models.

Method: Fine-tuned video transformer models (VideoMAE, ViViT, TimeSformer) on BdSL datasets after preprocessing, applied data augmentation, and evaluated using 10-fold cross-validation and signer-independent testing.

Result: VideoMAE achieved the highest accuracy (95.5% on BdSLW60 and 81.04% on BdSLW401), outperforming traditional machine learning and deep learning methods.

Conclusion: Video transformer architectures exhibit strong potential for scalable and accurate recognition of Bangla Sign Language, opening possibilities for improved communication tools for the hearing-impaired.

Abstract: Sign Language Recognition (SLR) involves the automatic identification and
classification of sign gestures from images or video, converting them into text
or speech to improve accessibility for the hearing-impaired community. In
Bangladesh, Bangla Sign Language (BdSL) serves as the primary mode of
communication for many individuals with hearing impairments. This study
fine-tunes state-of-the-art video transformer architectures -- VideoMAE, ViViT,
and TimeSformer -- on BdSLW60 (arXiv:2402.08635), a small-scale BdSL dataset
with 60 frequent signs. We standardized the videos to 30 FPS, resulting in
9,307 user trial clips. To evaluate scalability and robustness, the models were
also fine-tuned on BdSLW401 (arXiv:2503.02360), a large-scale dataset with 401
sign classes. Additionally, we benchmark performance against public datasets,
including LSA64 and WLASL. Data augmentation techniques such as random
cropping, horizontal flipping, and short-side scaling were applied to improve
model robustness. To ensure balanced evaluation across folds during model
selection, we employed 10-fold stratified cross-validation on the training set,
while signer-independent evaluation was carried out using held-out test data
from unseen users U4 and U8. Results show that video transformer models
significantly outperform traditional machine learning and deep learning
approaches. Performance is influenced by factors such as dataset size, video
quality, frame distribution, frame rate, and model architecture. Among the
models, the VideoMAE variant (MCG-NJU/videomae-base-finetuned-kinetics)
achieved the highest accuracies of 95.5% on the frame rate corrected BdSLW60
dataset and 81.04% on the front-facing signs of BdSLW401 -- demonstrating
strong potential for scalable and accurate BdSL recognition.

### [143] [Is Perturbation-Based Image Protection Disruptive to Image Editing?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04394)
*Qiuyu Tang,Bonor Ayambem,Mooi Choo Chuah,Aparna Bharati*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper evaluates existing methods of protecting images from misuse by diffusion models (e.g., Stable Diffusion). While perturbation-based techniques aim to prevent effective image edits, the research finds that they are ineffective as they often result in desirable edits rather than degraded outputs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address the misuse of powerful diffusion-based image generation models that can manipulate images, including copyrighted or sensitive materials. They focus on evaluating current protection methods that introduce noise to images.

Method: The study examines perturbation-based image protection methods across different domains (natural scenes and artworks) and tasks (e.g., image-to-image generation and style editing), assessing their effectiveness in resisting diffusion-based editing.

Result: The experiments revealed that images protected with perturbation-based methods were still susceptible to successful and high-quality edits that aligned with guidance prompts, contradicting the intended protection effect.

Conclusion: Perturbation-based protections fail to robustly safeguard images from diffusion-based editing. In some cases, the protection strategies may even enhance association with text prompts, calling for better solutions to mitigate misuse risks.

Abstract: The remarkable image generation capabilities of state-of-the-art diffusion
models, such as Stable Diffusion, can also be misused to spread misinformation
and plagiarize copyrighted materials. To mitigate the potential risks
associated with image editing, current image protection methods rely on adding
imperceptible perturbations to images to obstruct diffusion-based editing. A
fully successful protection for an image implies that the output of editing
attempts is an undesirable, noisy image which is completely unrelated to the
reference image. In our experiments with various perturbation-based image
protection methods across multiple domains (natural scene images and artworks)
and editing tasks (image-to-image generation and style editing), we discover
that such protection does not achieve this goal completely. In most scenarios,
diffusion-based editing of protected images generates a desirable output image
which adheres precisely to the guidance prompt. Our findings suggest that
adding noise to images may paradoxically increase their association with given
text prompts during the generation process, leading to unintended consequences
such as better resultant edits. Hence, we argue that perturbation-based methods
may not provide a sufficient solution for robust image protection against
diffusion-based editing.

### [144] [Normalize Filters! Classical Wisdom for Deep Vision](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04401)
*Gustavo Perez,Stella X. Yu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces filter normalization for deep learning, improving robustness and performance by making filters atmosphere-equivariant.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current deep learning filters lack normalization, leading to performance issues under atmospheric changes.

Method: The authors propose a normalization method akin to batch normalization, followed by learnable scaling and shifting, applied to both CNNs and vision transformers.

Result: Their approach improves performance on benchmarks, with ResNet34 notably surpassing CLIP by a large margin.

Conclusion: Filter normalization enhances learning, diversity, robustness, and generalization by integrating classical principles into deep networks.

Abstract: Classical image filters, such as those for averaging or differencing, are
carefully normalized to ensure consistency, interpretability, and to avoid
artifacts like intensity shifts, halos, or ringing. In contrast, convolutional
filters learned end-to-end in deep networks lack such constraints. Although
they may resemble wavelets and blob/edge detectors, they are not normalized in
the same or any way. Consequently, when images undergo atmospheric transfer,
their responses become distorted, leading to incorrect outcomes. We address
this limitation by proposing filter normalization, followed by learnable
scaling and shifting, akin to batch normalization. This simple yet effective
modification ensures that the filters are atmosphere-equivariant, enabling
co-domain symmetry. By integrating classical filtering principles into deep
learning (applicable to both convolutional neural networks and
convolution-dependent vision transformers), our method achieves significant
improvements on artificial and natural intensity variation benchmarks. Our
ResNet34 could even outperform CLIP by a large margin. Our analysis reveals
that unnormalized filters degrade performance, whereas filter normalization
regularizes learning, promotes diversity, and improves robustness and
generalization.

*Hermann Kumbong,Xian Liu,Tsung-Yi Lin,Ming-Yu Liu,Xihui Liu,Ziwei Liu,Daniel Y. Fu,Christopher Ré,David W. Romero*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Hierarchical Masked Auto-Regressive modeling (HMAR) is proposed as an improved image generation algorithm, overcoming limitations of VAR by enabling faster, higher-quality image synthesis and flexibility in sampling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need to overcome challenges in Visual Auto-Regressive (VAR) modeling, including reduced image quality, inefficiency in scaling sequences, and retraining requirements for altering sampling schedules.

Method: Reformulating VAR with a Markovian process for next-scale prediction, using masked multi-step generation for resolution scales, and implementing efficient block-sparse attention kernels for faster performance.

Result: HMAR matches or surpasses existing VAR, diffusion, and autoregressive models in quality, speed, and memory efficiency, achieving over 2.5x faster training, 1.75x faster inference, and 3x lower memory usage.

Conclusion: HMAR delivers superior image generation quality with enhanced speed, reduced memory needs, and added flexibility for sampling and zero-shot image editing tasks, setting a new benchmark for the field.

Abstract: Visual Auto-Regressive modeling (VAR) has shown promise in bridging the speed
and quality gap between autoregressive image models and diffusion models. VAR
reformulates autoregressive modeling by decomposing an image into successive
resolution scales. During inference, an image is generated by predicting all
the tokens in the next (higher-resolution) scale, conditioned on all tokens in
all previous (lower-resolution) scales. However, this formulation suffers from
reduced image quality due to the parallel generation of all tokens in a
resolution scale; has sequence lengths scaling superlinearly in image
resolution; and requires retraining to change the sampling schedule.
  We introduce Hierarchical Masked Auto-Regressive modeling (HMAR), a new image
generation algorithm that alleviates these issues using next-scale prediction
and masked prediction to generate high-quality images with fast sampling. HMAR
reformulates next-scale prediction as a Markovian process, wherein the
prediction of each resolution scale is conditioned only on tokens in its
immediate predecessor instead of the tokens in all predecessor resolutions.
When predicting a resolution scale, HMAR uses a controllable multi-step masked
generation procedure to generate a subset of the tokens in each step. On
ImageNet 256x256 and 512x512 benchmarks, HMAR models match or outperform
parameter-matched VAR, diffusion, and autoregressive baselines. We develop
efficient IO-aware block-sparse attention kernels that allow HMAR to achieve
faster training and inference times over VAR by over 2.5x and 1.75x
respectively, as well as over 3x lower inference memory footprint. Finally,
HMAR yields additional flexibility over VAR; its sampling schedule can be
changed without further training, and it can be applied to image editing tasks
in a zero-shot manner.

*Zhaoyang Lv,Maurizio Monge,Ka Chen,Yufeng Zhu,Michael Goesele,Jakob Engel,Zhao Dong,Richard Newcombe*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper advances photorealistic scene reconstruction in high dynamic ranges, emphasizing precise camera calibration and improved image formulation techniques, demonstrating significant visual quality improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address limitations in existing methods for photorealistic scene reconstruction, which fail to account for detailed calibration of rolling shutter cameras and sensor-specific characteristics.

Method: The study incorporates two innovations: (1) utilizing Visual-Inertial Bundle Adjustment (VIBA) for precise timestamp and trajectory calibration of rolling-shutter RGB cameras, and (2) integrating a physical image formation model to handle rolling-shutter effects and sensor dynamic range into Gaussian Splatting techniques.

Result: The pipeline, tested on devices like Project Aria and Meta Quest3, achieved consistent visual improvements of +2 dB in PSNR, with +1 dB each gained through VIBA and the proposed image formation model.

Conclusion: The proposed methods enhance pixel-accurate photorealistic reconstruction. Comprehensive datasets and implementation details are publicly available, fostering future research in this area.

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the challenges associated with using egocentric
devices to photorealistic reconstruct the scene in high dynamic range. Existing
methodologies typically assume using frame-rate 6DoF pose estimated from the
device's visual-inertial odometry system, which may neglect crucial details
necessary for pixel-accurate reconstruction. This study presents two
significant findings. Firstly, in contrast to mainstream work treating RGB
camera as global shutter frame-rate camera, we emphasize the importance of
employing visual-inertial bundle adjustment (VIBA) to calibrate the precise
timestamps and movement of the rolling shutter RGB sensing camera in a high
frequency trajectory format, which ensures an accurate calibration of the
physical properties of the rolling-shutter camera. Secondly, we incorporate a
physical image formation model based into Gaussian Splatting, which effectively
addresses the sensor characteristics, including the rolling-shutter effect of
RGB cameras and the dynamic ranges measured by sensors. Our proposed
formulation is applicable to the widely-used variants of Gaussian Splats
representation. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation of our pipeline using the
open-source Project Aria device under diverse indoor and outdoor lighting
conditions, and further validate it on a Meta Quest3 device. Across all
experiments, we observe a consistent visual enhancement of +1 dB in PSNR by
incorporating VIBA, with an additional +1 dB achieved through our proposed

### [147] [Towards Large-Scale Pose-Invariant Face Recognition Using Face Defrontalization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04496)
*Patrik Mesec,Alan Jović*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces a 'face defrontalization' approach to improve pose-invariant face recognition under extreme head poses. It outperforms face frontalization techniques on large datasets but shows limitations on smaller datasets like Multi-PIE.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Face recognition systems struggle with extreme head poses, posing practical challenges in achieving pose-invariance. Current sophisticated methods are limited and evaluated mostly on small datasets.

Method: The authors propose a face defrontalization approach involving: (1) training a face defrontalization model (FFWM) using a frontal-profile dataset preprocessed with their alignment method; (2) training a ResNet-50 model on a raw and defrontalized dataset using ArcFace loss.

Result: The defrontalization method outperformed models without it and showed superiority over existing frontalization techniques on large datasets like LFW, AgeDB, and CFP, but not on the small Multi-PIE dataset for extreme head poses.

Conclusion: The proposed defrontalization method enhances face recognition for large datasets, highlighting weaknesses in current techniques overfitted to small datasets and extreme head poses.

Abstract: Face recognition under extreme head poses is a challenging task. Ideally, a
face recognition system should perform well across different head poses, which
is known as pose-invariant face recognition. To achieve pose invariance,
current approaches rely on sophisticated methods, such as face frontalization
and various facial feature extraction model architectures. However, these
methods are somewhat impractical in real-life settings and are typically
evaluated on small scientific datasets, such as Multi-PIE. In this work, we
propose the inverse method of face frontalization, called face
defrontalization, to augment the training dataset of facial feature extraction
model. The method does not introduce any time overhead during the inference
step. The method is composed of: 1) training an adapted face defrontalization
FFWM model on a frontal-profile pairs dataset, which has been preprocessed
using our proposed face alignment method; 2) training a ResNet-50 facial
feature extraction model based on ArcFace loss on a raw and randomly
defrontalized large-scale dataset, where defrontalization was performed with
our previously trained face defrontalization model. Our method was compared
with the existing approaches on four open-access datasets: LFW, AgeDB, CFP, and
Multi-PIE. Defrontalization shows improved results compared to models without
defrontalization, while the proposed adjustments show clear superiority over
the state-of-the-art face frontalization FFWM method on three larger
open-access datasets, but not on the small Multi-PIE dataset for extreme poses
(75 and 90 degrees). The results suggest that at least some of the current
methods may be overfitted to small datasets.

### [148] [FALO: Fast and Accurate LiDAR 3D Object Detection on Resource-Constrained Devices](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04499)
*Shizhong Han,Hsin-Pai Cheng,Hong Cai,Jihad Masri,Soyeb Nagori,Fatih Porikli*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces FALO, a hardware-efficient approach for LiDAR 3D object detection that is both fast and accurate, addressing limitations of existing methods on resource-constrained devices.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LiDAR 3D object detection methods rely on sparse convolutions or transformers, which are computationally expensive and have irregular memory access patterns, making them unsuitable for edge devices.

Method: FALO reorganizes sparse 3D voxels into a 1D sequence and processes them using ConvDotMix blocks featuring large-kernel convolutions, Hadamard products, and linear layers to enhance spatial and embedding capabilities while supporting efficient computation on edge devices.

Result: FALO demonstrates competitive performance on LiDAR 3D detection benchmarks like nuScenes and Waymo, and achieves up to a 9.8x speed improvement over SOTA methods on mobile GPU and NPU.

Conclusion: FALO provides a novel and efficient method for LiDAR 3D object detection, balancing accuracy and inference speed, making it well-suited for deployment on embedded and resource-constrained devices.

Abstract: Existing LiDAR 3D object detection methods predominantely rely on sparse
convolutions and/or transformers, which can be challenging to run on
resource-constrained edge devices, due to irregular memory access patterns and
high computational costs. In this paper, we propose FALO, a hardware-friendly
approach to LiDAR 3D detection, which offers both state-of-the-art (SOTA)
detection accuracy and fast inference speed. More specifically, given the 3D
point cloud and after voxelization, FALO first arranges sparse 3D voxels into a
1D sequence based on their coordinates and proximity. The sequence is then
processed by our proposed ConvDotMix blocks, consisting of large-kernel
convolutions, Hadamard products, and linear layers. ConvDotMix provides
sufficient mixing capability in both spatial and embedding dimensions, and
introduces higher-order nonlinear interaction among spatial features.
Furthermore, when going through the ConvDotMix layers, we introduce implicit
grouping, which balances the tensor dimensions for more efficient inference and
takes into account the growing receptive field. All these operations are
friendly to run on resource-constrained platforms and proposed FALO can readily
deploy on compact, embedded devices. Our extensive evaluation on LiDAR 3D
detection benchmarks such as nuScenes and Waymo shows that FALO achieves
competitive performance. Meanwhile, FALO is 1.6~9.8x faster than the latest
SOTA on mobile Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) and mobile Neural Processing Unit
(NPU).

*Guangyu Shen,Zhihua Li,Xiang Xu,Tianchen Zhao,Zheng Zhang,Dongsheng An,Zhuowen Tu,Yifan Xing,Qin Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces AuthGuard, a deepfake detection framework integrating vision-language models with human-like reasoning, achieving state-of-the-art accuracy across various datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing deepfake detectors struggle with unseen forgeries due to reliance on statistical artifacts tied to specific generation methods. The paper aims to enhance detection generalization and reasoning by incorporating language guidance.

Method: AuthGuard employs an expert vision encoder combining discriminative classification and image-text contrastive learning using text prompts generated by MLLMs. It also integrates data uncertainty learning into the contrastive process.

Result: AuthGuard shows superior performance, achieving significant AUC gains on DFDC (6.15%) and DF40 (16.68%), and improving reasoning capabilities by 24.69% on the DDVQA dataset.

Conclusion: Language guidance effectively improves generalization and interpretability in deepfake detection, making AuthGuard robust against unseen forgery methods while enhancing accuracy.

Abstract: Existing deepfake detection techniques struggle to keep-up with the
ever-evolving novel, unseen forgeries methods. This limitation stems from their
reliance on statistical artifacts learned during training, which are often tied
to specific generation processes that may not be representative of samples from
new, unseen deepfake generation methods encountered at test time. We propose
that incorporating language guidance can improve deepfake detection
generalization by integrating human-like commonsense reasoning -- such as
recognizing logical inconsistencies and perceptual anomalies -- alongside
statistical cues. To achieve this, we train an expert deepfake vision encoder
by combining discriminative classification with image-text contrastive
learning, where the text is generated by generalist MLLMs using few-shot
prompting. This allows the encoder to extract both language-describable,
commonsense deepfake artifacts and statistical forgery artifacts from
pixel-level distributions. To further enhance robustness, we integrate data
uncertainty learning into vision-language contrastive learning, mitigating
noise in image-text supervision. Our expert vision encoder seamlessly
interfaces with an LLM, further enabling more generalized and interpretable
deepfake detection while also boosting accuracy. The resulting framework,
AuthGuard, achieves state-of-the-art deepfake detection accuracy in both
in-distribution and out-of-distribution settings, achieving AUC gains of 6.15%
on the DFDC dataset and 16.68% on the DF40 dataset. Additionally, AuthGuard
significantly enhances deepfake reasoning, improving performance by 24.69% on
the DDVQA dataset.

### [150] [Pruning Everything, Everywhere, All at Once](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04513)
*Gustavo Henrique do Nascimento,Ian Pons,Anna Helena Reali Costa,Artur Jordao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a method that simultaneously prunes both neurons and layers in deep learning models, enhancing efficiency and maintaining accuracy, while outperforming existing techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep learning models grow computationally prohibitive as their complexity increases, especially for real-world and resource-constrained applications, necessitating efficient pruning methods.

Method: The proposed method prunes both neurons and layers using an iterative approach, leveraging the Centered Kernel Alignment metric to select subnetworks that maintain high representation similarity to the parent model.

Result: Experiments confirm the method outperforms state-of-the-art pruning techniques, achieving significant Floating Point Operations (FLOPs) reduction (e.g., 86.37% on ResNet56) while maintaining or improving accuracy.

Conclusion: The method advances the pruning field by enabling highly sparse, robust, and efficient models, contributing towards GreenAI through substantial reductions in carbon emissions.

Abstract: Deep learning stands as the modern paradigm for solving cognitive tasks.
However, as the problem complexity increases, models grow deeper and
computationally prohibitive, hindering advancements in real-world and
resource-constrained applications. Extensive studies reveal that pruning
structures in these models efficiently reduces model complexity and improves
computational efficiency. Successful strategies in this sphere include removing
neurons (i.e., filters, heads) or layers, but not both together. Therefore,
simultaneously pruning different structures remains an open problem. To fill
this gap and leverage the benefits of eliminating neurons and layers at once,
we propose a new method capable of pruning different structures within a model
as follows. Given two candidate subnetworks (pruned models), one from layer
pruning and the other from neuron pruning, our method decides which to choose
by selecting the one with the highest representation similarity to its parent
(the network that generates the subnetworks) using the Centered Kernel
Alignment metric. Iteratively repeating this process provides highly sparse
models that preserve the original predictive ability. Throughout extensive
experiments on standard architectures and benchmarks, we confirm the
effectiveness of our approach and show that it outperforms state-of-the-art
layer and filter pruning techniques. At high levels of Floating Point
Operations reduction, most state-of-the-art methods degrade accuracy, whereas
our approach either improves it or experiences only a minimal drop. Notably, on
the popular ResNet56 and ResNet110, we achieve a milestone of 86.37% and 95.82%
FLOPs reduction. Besides, our pruned models obtain robustness to adversarial
and out-of-distribution samples and take an important step towards GreenAI,
reducing carbon emissions by up to 83.31%. Overall, we believe our work opens a
new chapter in pruning.

TL;DR: The paper presents EECD-Net, a novel framework for energy-efficient and accurate road crack detection using SRCNN, SCU with CIF neurons, and a GAT module.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address issues in road crack detection caused by low-energy and low-resolution imaging, aiming to ensure infrastructure safety and transportation reliability.

Method: The methodology includes SRCNN for image resolution enhancement, SCU with CIF neurons for power-efficient image conversion to sparse pulse sequences, and a GAT module for multi-scale feature fusion.

Result: EECD-Net achieved 98.6% detection accuracy on the CrackVision12K benchmark, surpassing Hybrid-Segmentor by 1.5%, and reduced energy consumption by 33%, consuming only 5.6 mJ.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates a transformative, scalable, and energy-efficient solution for real-time infrastructure monitoring in resource-limited environments.

Abstract: Crack detection on road surfaces is a critical measurement technology in the
instrumentation domain, essential for ensuring infrastructure safety and
transportation reliability. However, due to limited energy and low-resolution
imaging, smart terminal devices struggle to maintain real-time monitoring
performance. To overcome these challenges, this paper proposes a multi-stage
detection approach for road crack detection, EECD-Net, to enhance accuracy and
energy efficiency of instrumentation. Specifically, the sophisticated
Super-Resolution Convolutional Neural Network (SRCNN) is employed to address
the inherent challenges of low-quality images, which effectively enhance image
resolution while preserving critical structural details. Meanwhile, a Spike
Convolution Unit (SCU) with Continuous Integrate-and-Fire (CIF) neurons is
proposed to convert these images into sparse pulse sequences, significantly
reducing power consumption. Additionally, a Gated Attention Transformer (GAT)
module is designed to strategically fuse multi-scale feature representations
through adaptive attention mechanisms, effectively capturing both long-range
dependencies and intricate local crack patterns, and significantly enhancing
detection robustness across varying crack morphologies. The experiments on the
CrackVision12K benchmark demonstrate that EECD-Net achieves a remarkable 98.6\%
detection accuracy, surpassing state-of-the-art counterparts such as
Hybrid-Segmentor by a significant 1.5\%. Notably, the EECD-Net maintains
exceptional energy efficiency, consuming merely 5.6 mJ, which is a substantial
33\% reduction compared to baseline implementations. This work pioneers a
transformative approach in instrumentation-based crack detection, offering a
scalable, low-power solution for real-time, large-scale infrastructure
monitoring in resource-constrained environments.

### [152] [Enhancing Frequency for Single Image Super-Resolution with Learnable Separable Kernels](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04555)
*Heng Tian*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces Learnable Separable Kernels (LSKs), a module designed to improve single-image super-resolution (SISR) tasks by direct enhancement of image frequency components. They achieve significant reductions in parameters and computational requirements while boosting model performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address performance and computational overhead in SISR tasks by proposing a more direct and efficient mechanism for enhancing image quality, targeting frequency components directly rather than indirectly through auxiliary structures.

Method: LSKs are rank-one matrices decomposed into orthogonal and mergeable one-dimensional kernels, enabling efficient image frequency enhancement. An interpretable analysis and visualization of feature maps further validate their effectiveness.

Result: LSKs reduce model parameters and computational requirements by over 60%, improve overall model performance, and yield superior results notably for higher upscaling factors.

Conclusion: The incorporation of LSKs serves as an efficient and effective solution in SISR tasks, combining lower resource consumption with improved super-resolution outcomes, particularly with increased upscaling factors.

Abstract: Existing approaches often enhance the performance of single-image
super-resolution (SISR) methods by incorporating auxiliary structures, such as
specialized loss functions, to indirectly boost the quality of low-resolution
images. In this paper, we propose a plug-and-play module called Learnable
Separable Kernels (LSKs), which are formally rank-one matrices designed to
directly enhance image frequency components. We begin by explaining why LSKs
are particularly suitable for SISR tasks from a frequency perspective. Baseline
methods incorporating LSKs demonstrate a significant reduction of over 60\% in
both the number of parameters and computational requirements. This reduction is
achieved through the decomposition of LSKs into orthogonal and mergeable
one-dimensional kernels. Additionally, we perform an interpretable analysis of
the feature maps generated by LSKs. Visualization results reveal the capability
of LSKs to enhance image frequency components effectively. Extensive
experiments show that incorporating LSKs not only reduces the number of
parameters and computational load but also improves overall model performance.
Moreover, these experiments demonstrate that models utilizing LSKs exhibit
superior performance, particularly as the upscaling factor increases.

*Yunhao Gou,Kai Chen,Zhili Liu,Lanqing Hong,Xin Jin,Zhenguo Li,James T. Kwok,Yu Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces RACRO, a method to improve reasoning in multi-modal large language models by aligning visual captioning to reasoning objectives through reinforcement learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to overcome the challenge of transferring slow-thinking reasoning to multi-modal language models due to the high cost of retraining vision-language alignments.

Method: RACRO employs reasoning-guided reinforcement learning to optimize the captioning behavior of visual extractors, focusing on reasoning objectives.

Result: Experiments demonstrate that RACRO achieves state-of-the-art performance on benchmarks and allows seamless adaptation to advanced reasoning models without additional multi-modal retraining.

Conclusion: RACRO significantly improves reasoning capabilities in multi-modal models by aligning perception and reasoning, offering scalable and cost-effective integration with advanced reasoning systems.

Abstract: Recent advances in slow-thinking language models (e.g., OpenAI-o1 and
DeepSeek-R1) have demonstrated remarkable abilities in complex reasoning tasks
by emulating human-like reflective cognition. However, extending such
capabilities to multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) remains challenging
due to the high cost of retraining vision-language alignments when upgrading
the underlying reasoner LLMs. A straightforward solution is to decouple
perception from reasoning, i.e., converting visual inputs into language
representations (e.g., captions) that are then passed to a powerful text-only
reasoner. However, this decoupling introduces a critical challenge: the visual
extractor must generate descriptions that are both faithful to the image and
informative enough to support accurate downstream reasoning. To address this,
we propose Reasoning-Aligned Perceptual Decoupling via Caption Reward
Optimization (RACRO) - a reasoning-guided reinforcement learning strategy that
aligns the extractor's captioning behavior with the reasoning objective. By
closing the perception-reasoning loop via reward-based optimization, RACRO
significantly enhances visual grounding and extracts reasoning-optimized
representations. Experiments on multi-modal math and science benchmarks show
that the proposed RACRO method achieves state-of-the-art average performance
while enabling superior scalability and plug-and-play adaptation to more
advanced reasoning LLMs without the necessity for costly multi-modal
re-alignment.

TL;DR: This paper introduces LGM-Pose, a lightweight single-branch network using MobileViM and fusion techniques for improved multi-person pose estimation, achieving better results with fewer parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations of current top-down lightweight multi-person pose estimation methods that suffer from high latency and insufficient global context capture.

Method: Proposes the LGM-Pose network with a MobileViM Block using Lightweight Attentional Representation Module (LARM) and Shuffle-Integrated Fusion Module (SFusion) for global information extraction and multi-scale integration.

Result: LGM-Pose demonstrates superior performance, fewer parameters, and faster processing speeds compared to mainstream methods on the COCO and MPII datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed LGM-Pose provides a more efficient and effective approach for multi-person pose estimation, overcoming current method challenges.

Abstract: Most of the current top-down multi-person pose estimation lightweight methods
are based on multi-branch parallel pure CNN network architecture, which often
struggle to capture the global context required for detecting semantically
complex keypoints and are hindered by high latency due to their intricate and
redundant structures. In this article, an approximate single-branch lightweight
global modeling network (LGM-Pose) is proposed to address these challenges. In
the network, a lightweight MobileViM Block is designed with a proposed
Lightweight Attentional Representation Module (LARM), which integrates
information within and between patches using the Non-Parametric Transformation
Operation(NPT-Op) to extract global information. Additionally, a novel
Shuffle-Integrated Fusion Module (SFusion) is introduced to effectively
integrate multi-scale information, mitigating performance degradation often
observed in single-branch structures. Experimental evaluations on the COCO and
MPII datasets demonstrate that our approach not only reduces the number of
parameters compared to existing mainstream lightweight methods but also
achieves superior performance and faster processing speeds.

*Yue Ma,Kunyu Feng,Xinhua Zhang,Hongyu Liu,David Junhao Zhang,Jinbo Xing,Yinhan Zhang,Ayden Yang,Zeyu Wang,Qifeng Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper presents 'Follow-Your-Creation,' a framework for creating and editing 4D videos from a single monocular video input using a video inpainting approach to handle missing or modified content.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a need for a robust approach to generate and edit 4D videos from simple monocular videos while ensuring temporal consistency and maintaining high-quality output.

Method: The framework reformulates 4D video creation as an inpainting task by generating composite masks for invisibility and user edits, training the model with diverse mask scenarios, introducing a self-iterative tuning strategy to handle large camera motion, and employing a temporal packaging module to improve generation quality during inference.

Result: The proposed method generates 4D videos with consistent multi-view coherence and allows prompt-based content editing, outperforming state-of-the-art methods in quality and versatility.

Conclusion: The approach leverages pre-trained models without sacrificing their original capabilities, offering a flexible and effective solution for high-quality 4D video creation and editing.

Abstract: We introduce Follow-Your-Creation, a novel 4D video creation framework
capable of both generating and editing 4D content from a single monocular video
input. By leveraging a powerful video inpainting foundation model as a
generative prior, we reformulate 4D video creation as a video inpainting task,
enabling the model to fill in missing content caused by camera trajectory
changes or user edits. To facilitate this, we generate composite masked
inpainting video data to effectively fine-tune the model for 4D video
generation. Given an input video and its associated camera trajectory, we first
perform depth-based point cloud rendering to obtain invisibility masks that
indicate the regions that should be completed. Simultaneously, editing masks
are introduced to specify user-defined modifications, and these are combined
with the invisibility masks to create a composite masks dataset. During
training, we randomly sample different types of masks to construct diverse and
challenging inpainting scenarios, enhancing the model's generalization and
robustness in various 4D editing and generation tasks. To handle temporal
consistency under large camera motion, we design a self-iterative tuning
strategy that gradually increases the viewing angles during training, where the
model is used to generate the next-stage training data after each fine-tuning
iteration. Moreover, we introduce a temporal packaging module during inference
to enhance generation quality. Our method effectively leverages the prior
knowledge of the base model without degrading its original performance,
enabling the generation of 4D videos with consistent multi-view coherence. In
addition, our approach supports prompt-based content editing, demonstrating
strong flexibility and significantly outperforming state-of-the-art methods in
both quality and versatility.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Hierarchical Embodied Continual Learning Setups (HEC) with a new method called Task-aware Mixture of Incremental LoRA Experts (Task-aware MoILE) to tackle catastrophic forgetting in continual learning for embodied intelligence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of previous continual learning setups lacking high-level planning and multi-level knowledge acquisition in embodied intelligence.

Method: The proposed HEC divides continual learning into high-level and low-level layers, with the Task-aware MoILE method leveraging clustered visual-text embeddings, task and token-level routers, and Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) for LoRA parameters to mitigate forgetting.

Result: The method effectively reduces catastrophic forgetting, allowing agents to retain old knowledge while learning new tasks, surpassing other approaches in experimental results.

Conclusion: The paper's method supports continual learning by preserving prior knowledge and improving task retention, enhancing the capabilities for embodied intelligence.

Abstract: Previous continual learning setups for embodied intelligence focused on
executing low-level actions based on human commands, neglecting the ability to
learn high-level planning and multi-level knowledge. To address these issues,
we propose the Hierarchical Embodied Continual Learning Setups (HEC) that
divide the agent's continual learning process into two layers: high-level
instructions and low-level actions, and define five embodied continual learning
sub-setups. Building on these setups, we introduce the Task-aware Mixture of
Incremental LoRA Experts (Task-aware MoILE) method. This approach achieves task
recognition by clustering visual-text embeddings and uses both a task-level
router and a token-level router to select the appropriate LoRA experts. To
effectively address the issue of catastrophic forgetting, we apply Singular
Value Decomposition (SVD) to the LoRA parameters obtained from prior tasks,
preserving key components while orthogonally training the remaining parts. The
experimental results show that our method stands out in reducing the forgetting
of old tasks compared to other methods, effectively supporting agents in
retaining prior knowledge while continuously learning new tasks.

TL;DR: SmartAvatar is an AI-driven framework that generates fully customizable 3D human avatars from a photo or text input, emphasizing precision and animation-readiness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the limitations of diffusion-based methods in precise control of human identity, body shape, and animation-readiness for avatar generation.

Method: SmartAvatar integrates vision-language models, off-the-shelf parametric human generators, and an autonomous verification process that iteratively adjusts avatar generation parameters based on user feedback and AI assessments.

Result: SmartAvatar generated avatars show superior mesh quality, identity fidelity, attribute accuracy, and animation readiness compared to recent text- and image-driven systems.

Conclusion: The framework offers users a highly customizable tool for generating rigged, animation-ready avatars, outperforming rivals and enabling broader consumer-grade applications.

Abstract: SmartAvatar is a vision-language-agent-driven framework for generating fully
rigged, animation-ready 3D human avatars from a single photo or textual prompt.
While diffusion-based methods have made progress in general 3D object
generation, they continue to struggle with precise control over human identity,
body shape, and animation readiness. In contrast, SmartAvatar leverages the
commonsense reasoning capabilities of large vision-language models (VLMs) in
combination with off-the-shelf parametric human generators to deliver
high-quality, customizable avatars. A key innovation is an autonomous
verification loop, where the agent renders draft avatars, evaluates facial
similarity, anatomical plausibility, and prompt alignment, and iteratively
adjusts generation parameters for convergence. This interactive, AI-guided
refinement process promotes fine-grained control over both facial and body
features, enabling users to iteratively refine their avatars via
natural-language conversations. Unlike diffusion models that rely on static
pre-trained datasets and offer limited flexibility, SmartAvatar brings users
into the modeling loop and ensures continuous improvement through an LLM-driven
procedural generation and verification system. The generated avatars are fully
rigged and support pose manipulation with consistent identity and appearance,
making them suitable for downstream animation and interactive applications.
Quantitative benchmarks and user studies demonstrate that SmartAvatar
outperforms recent text- and image-driven avatar generation systems in terms of
reconstructed mesh quality, identity fidelity, attribute accuracy, and
animation readiness, making it a versatile tool for realistic, customizable
avatar creation on consumer-grade hardware.

TL;DR: The paper introduces "Perfecting Depth," a two-stage framework for sensor depth enhancement combining uncertainty modeling and deterministic refinement to produce reliable, artifact-free depth maps.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current sensor depth mapping methods struggle with generating reliable, accurate, and artifact-free outputs in diverse real-world scenarios.

Method: The authors propose a two-stage framework: (1) stochastic estimation to detect unreliable measurements and infer structure, and (2) deterministic refinement to enforce structural consistency and pixel accuracy.

Result: The approach produced dense and reliable depth maps validated through experiments, theoretical analysis, and visualizations, outperforming prior methods.

Conclusion: The framework establishes a new standard for sensor depth enhancement, showing promise for applications in autonomous systems, robotics, and immersive technologies.

Abstract: We propose a novel two-stage framework for sensor depth enhancement, called
Perfecting Depth. This framework leverages the stochastic nature of diffusion
models to automatically detect unreliable depth regions while preserving
geometric cues. In the first stage (stochastic estimation), the method
identifies unreliable measurements and infers geometric structure by leveraging
a training-inference domain gap. In the second stage (deterministic
refinement), it enforces structural consistency and pixel-level accuracy using
the uncertainty map derived from the first stage. By combining stochastic
uncertainty modeling with deterministic refinement, our method yields dense,
artifact-free depth maps with improved reliability. Experimental results
demonstrate its effectiveness across diverse real-world scenarios. Furthermore,
theoretical analysis, various experiments, and qualitative visualizations
validate its robustness and scalability. Our framework sets a new baseline for
sensor depth enhancement, with potential applications in autonomous driving,
robotics, and immersive technologies.

TL;DR: This paper reviews the role of deep learning in transforming the classical image matching pipeline for computer vision tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Image matching faces challenges in recovering 3D structures and camera geometry in complex scenarios; traditional methods struggle under these conditions.

Method: The study categorizes deep learning approaches by replacing traditional components with learnable modules or merging steps into unified end-to-end frameworks.

Result: Representative methods using deep learning are benchmarked on relative pose recovery, homography estimation, and visual localization tasks.

Conclusion: By analyzing design principles, advantages, limitations, and open challenges, the paper provides an overview and future directions for deep learning-driven image matching.

Abstract: Image matching, which establishes correspondences between two-view images to
recover 3D structure and camera geometry, serves as a cornerstone in computer
vision and underpins a wide range of applications, including visual
localization, 3D reconstruction, and simultaneous localization and mapping
(SLAM). Traditional pipelines composed of ``detector-descriptor, feature
matcher, outlier filter, and geometric estimator'' falter in challenging
scenarios. Recent deep-learning advances have significantly boosted both
robustness and accuracy. This survey adopts a unique perspective by
comprehensively reviewing how deep learning has incrementally transformed the
classical image matching pipeline. Our taxonomy highly aligns with the
traditional pipeline in two key aspects: i) the replacement of individual steps
in the traditional pipeline with learnable alternatives, including learnable
detector-descriptor, outlier filter, and geometric estimator; and ii) the
merging of multiple steps into end-to-end learnable modules, encompassing
middle-end sparse matcher, end-to-end semi-dense/dense matcher, and pose
regressor. We first examine the design principles, advantages, and limitations
of both aspects, and then benchmark representative methods on relative pose
recovery, homography estimation, and visual localization tasks. Finally, we
discuss open challenges and outline promising directions for future research.
By systematically categorizing and evaluating deep learning-driven strategies,
this survey offers a clear overview of the evolving image matching landscape
and highlights key avenues for further innovation.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a benchmark, STARE, to evaluate AI's capability for spatial reasoning via non-verbal, visual simulations, revealing current models' limitations compared to human performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AI benchmarks mostly evaluate verbal reasoning, neglecting the complexities of spatial cognition required for multi-step visual problem-solving.

Method: The authors developed STARE, a benchmark with 4,000 tasks in various domains (2D/3D transformations, cube net folding, tangrams, and real-world spatial reasoning), and tested multimodal large language models and humans for performance assessment.

Result: The evaluation showed models perform well on simpler 2D tasks but struggle with more complex challenges (3D transformations, tangrams), with humans achieving near-perfect results yet taking longer, especially without intermediate visual simulation.

Conclusion: Current models lack the ability to effectively utilize visual information for complex multi-step spatial tasks, underscoring the need for advancements in integrating spatial reasoning in AI systems.

Abstract: Spatial cognition is essential for human intelligence, enabling
problem-solving through visual simulations rather than solely relying on verbal
reasoning. However, existing AI benchmarks primarily assess verbal reasoning,
neglecting the complexities of non-verbal, multi-step visual simulation. We
introduce STARE(Spatial Transformations and Reasoning Evaluation), a benchmark
designed to rigorously evaluate multimodal large language models on tasks
better solved through multi-step visual simulation. STARE features 4K tasks
spanning foundational geometric transformations (2D and 3D), integrated spatial
reasoning (cube net folding and tangram puzzles), and real-world spatial
reasoning (perspective and temporal reasoning), reflecting practical cognitive
challenges like object assembly, mechanical diagram interpretation, and
everyday spatial navigation. Our evaluations show that models excel at
reasoning over simpler 2D transformations, but perform close to random chance
on more complex tasks like 3D cube net folding and tangram puzzles that require
multi-step visual simulations. Humans achieve near-perfect accuracy but take
considerable time (up to 28.9s) on complex tasks, significantly speeding up
(down by 7.5 seconds on average) with intermediate visual simulations. In
contrast, models exhibit inconsistent performance gains from visual
simulations, improving on most tasks but declining in specific cases like
tangram puzzles (GPT-4o, o1) and cube net folding (Claude-3.5, Gemini-2.0
Flash), indicating that models may not know how to effectively leverage
intermediate visual information.

TL;DR: This paper introduces TADiSR, a diffusion-based framework for image super-resolution, aimed at improving text structure fidelity in degraded real-world images. It achieves state-of-the-art performance using text-aware attention and segmentation decoders.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address fidelity issues in generative models for image super-resolution, particularly concerning distorted textual structures.

Method: The paper proposes a framework called TADiSR that leverages text-aware attention and joint segmentation decoders to enhance both natural details and text structure fidelity. It also includes a synthesis pipeline for realistic foreground text masks and detailed backgrounds.

Result: Experiments show improved text legibility and structural fidelity in super-resolved images. TADiSR achieves state-of-the-art results on multiple metrics and generalizes well to real-world scenarios.

Conclusion: TADiSR significantly advances text legibility and structural fidelity in image super-resolution, demonstrating robust performance and practical applicability.

Abstract: The introduction of generative models has significantly advanced image
super-resolution (SR) in handling real-world degradations. However, they often
incur fidelity-related issues, particularly distorting textual structures. In
this paper, we introduce a novel diffusion-based SR framework, namely TADiSR,
which integrates text-aware attention and joint segmentation decoders to
recover not only natural details but also the structural fidelity of text
regions in degraded real-world images. Moreover, we propose a complete pipeline
for synthesizing high-quality images with fine-grained full-image text masks,
combining realistic foreground text regions with detailed background content.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach substantially enhances text
legibility in super-resolved images, achieving state-of-the-art performance
across multiple evaluation metrics and exhibiting strong generalization to
real-world scenarios. Our code is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces FPSAttention to accelerate video generation using FP8 quantization and sparsity without degrading quality, achieving significant speedups.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion generative models offer high-quality video generation but suffer from slow inference and computational inefficiency.

Method: FPSAttention combines FP8 quantization and sparsity with 3D bi-directional attention, using a unified tile-wise approach, noise-adaptive strategies, and optimized hardware kernels.

Result: FPSAttention achieves a 7.09x kernel speedup for attention operations and a 4.96x speedup for end-to-end video generation, maintaining quality.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively addresses inefficiencies in video generation while maintaining high output quality, demonstrating practical viability and hardware efficiency.

Abstract: Diffusion generative models have become the standard for producing
high-quality, coherent video content, yet their slow inference speeds and high
computational demands hinder practical deployment. Although both quantization
and sparsity can independently accelerate inference while maintaining
generation quality, naively combining these techniques in existing
training-free approaches leads to significant performance degradation due to
the lack of joint optimization.We introduce FPSAttention, a novel
training-aware co-design of FP8 quantization and sparsity for video generation,
with a focus on the 3D bi-directional attention mechanism. Our approach
features three key innovations: 1) A unified 3D tile-wise granularity that
simultaneously supports both quantization and sparsity; 2) A denoising
step-aware strategy that adapts to the noise schedule, addressing the strong
correlation between quantization/sparsity errors and denoising steps; 3) A
native, hardware-friendly kernel that leverages FlashAttention and is
implemented with optimized Hopper architecture features for highly efficient
execution. Trained on Wan2.1's 1.3B and 14B models and evaluated on the VBench
benchmark, FPSAttention achieves a 7.09x kernel speedup for attention
operations and a 4.96x end-to-end speedup for video generation compared to the
BF16 baseline at 720p resolution-without sacrificing generation quality.

*Takayuki Komatsu,Yoshiyuki Ohmura,Kayato Nishitsunoi,Yasuo Kuniyoshi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes a novel approach to representation learning by combining group decomposition theory with feature extraction and object segmentation, enabling processing of real-world datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the limitations of conventional representation learning methods, such as their inability to explain conditional independence and lack of real-world applicability.

Method: Using group decomposition in Galois algebra, the authors introduce a method integrating feature extraction and object segmentation, replacing pixel-to-pixel translation with feature translation.

Result: The proposed approach was validated on practical datasets containing real-world objects and backgrounds, demonstrating its feasibility and potential.

Conclusion: The method offers a pathway toward better understanding human object recognition and improves the applicability of representation learning in complex real-world scenarios.

Abstract: The main goal of representation learning is to acquire meaningful
representations from real-world sensory inputs without supervision.
Representation learning explains some aspects of human development. Various
neural network (NN) models have been proposed that acquire empirically good
representations. However, the formulation of a good representation has not been
established. We recently proposed a method for categorizing changes between a
pair of sensory inputs. A unique feature of this approach is that
transformations between two sensory inputs are learned to satisfy algebraic
structural constraints. Conventional representation learning often assumes that
disentangled independent feature axes is a good representation; however, we
found that such a representation cannot account for conditional independence.
To overcome this problem, we proposed a new method using group decomposition in
Galois algebra theory. Although this method is promising for defining a more
general representation, it assumes pixel-to-pixel translation without feature
extraction, and can only process low-resolution images with no background,
which prevents real-world application. In this study, we provide a simple
method to apply our group decomposition theory to a more realistic scenario by
combining feature extraction and object segmentation. We replace pixel
translation with feature translation and formulate object segmentation as
grouping features under the same transformation. We validated the proposed
method on a practical dataset containing both real-world object and background.
We believe that our model will lead to a better understanding of human
development of object recognition in the real world.

### [164] [Interpretable Few-Shot Image Classification via Prototypical Concept-Guided Mixture of LoRA Experts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04673)
*Zhong Ji,Rongshuai Wei,Jingren Liu,Yanwei Pang,Jungong Han*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces a framework for improving self-explainable models (SEMs) for few-shot prototypical concept classification by addressing challenges in low-data settings, showing boosted interpretability and performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SEMs often struggle with low-data scenarios where insufficient samples hinder their ability to deliver optimal and interpretable results.

Method: The framework utilizes three innovations: Mixture of LoRA Experts (MoLE) for parameter-efficient adaptation, a cross-module concept alignment mechanism for better representation, and a geometry-aware concept discrimination loss to ensure orthogonal and disentangled concepts.

Result: Experimental results across six benchmarks reveal consistent improvements in classification accuracy, with relative gains ranging from 4.2% to 8.7% in few-shot tasks, alongside improved model interpretability.

Conclusion: By coupling concept learning with few-shot adaptation strategies, the approach enhances both interpretability and performance, advancing transparent visual recognition systems.

Abstract: Self-Explainable Models (SEMs) rely on Prototypical Concept Learning (PCL) to
enable their visual recognition processes more interpretable, but they often
struggle in data-scarce settings where insufficient training samples lead to
suboptimal performance.To address this limitation, we propose a Few-Shot
Prototypical Concept Classification (FSPCC) framework that systematically
mitigates two key challenges under low-data regimes: parametric imbalance and
representation misalignment. Specifically, our approach leverages a Mixture of
LoRA Experts (MoLE) for parameter-efficient adaptation, ensuring a balanced
allocation of trainable parameters between the backbone and the PCL
module.Meanwhile, cross-module concept guidance enforces tight alignment
between the backbone's feature representations and the prototypical concept
activation patterns.In addition, we incorporate a multi-level feature
preservation strategy that fuses spatial and semantic cues across various
layers, thereby enriching the learned representations and mitigating the
challenges posed by limited data availability.Finally, to enhance
interpretability and minimize concept overlap, we introduce a geometry-aware
concept discrimination loss that enforces orthogonality among concepts,
encouraging more disentangled and transparent decision boundaries.Experimental
results on six popular benchmarks (CUB-200-2011, mini-ImageNet, CIFAR-FS,
Stanford Cars, FGVC-Aircraft, and DTD) demonstrate that our approach
consistently outperforms existing SEMs by a notable margin, with 4.2%-8.7%
relative gains in 5-way 5-shot classification.These findings highlight the
efficacy of coupling concept learning with few-shot adaptation to achieve both
higher accuracy and clearer model interpretability, paving the way for more
transparent visual recognition systems.

*Jing-En Huang,I-Sheng Fang,Tzuhsuan Huang,Chih-Yu Wang,Jun-Cheng Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Gen-n-Val, a novel framework utilizing Large Language Models (LLMs) and Vision LLMs (VLLMs) for producing high-quality synthetic data, addressing limitations in existing methods for computer vision tasks like object detection and segmentation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges of data scarcity and label noise in computer vision tasks, such as object detection and instance segmentation, which limit the effectiveness of synthetic data generation.

Method: The Gen-n-Val framework incorporates two agents: (1) an LD prompt agent (an LLM) to generate optimized prompts for Layer Diffusion (LD), creating single-object instance images with precise masks, and (2) a validation agent (a VLLM) to filter out poor-quality data. The system also integrates TextGrad for refining prompts and uses image harmonization for scene construction.

Result: The framework reduces invalid synthetic data from 50% to 7%, and achieves a 1% mAP improvement on rare COCO classes. It also outperforms benchmarks like YOLO-Worldv2-M, providing a 7.1% mAP gain in open-vocabulary object detection tasks.

Conclusion: Gen-n-Val significantly enhances the quality and utility of synthetic data, leading to improved performance in tasks such as instance segmentation and object detection, particularly in challenging scenarios like rare class detection and open-vocabulary benchmarks.

Abstract: Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) and Vision Large Language Models
(VLLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance as agents across various tasks
while data scarcity and label noise remain significant challenges in computer
vision tasks, such as object detection and instance segmentation. A common
solution for resolving these issues is to generate synthetic data. However,
current synthetic data generation methods struggle with issues, such as
multiple objects per mask, inaccurate segmentation, and incorrect category
labels, limiting their effectiveness. To address these issues, we introduce
Gen-n-Val, a novel agentic data generation framework that leverages Layer
Diffusion (LD), LLMs, and VLLMs to produce high-quality, single-object masks
and diverse backgrounds. Gen-n-Val consists of two agents: (1) The LD prompt
agent, an LLM, optimizes prompts for LD to generate high-quality foreground
instance images and segmentation masks. These optimized prompts ensure the
generation of single-object synthetic data with precise instance masks and
clean backgrounds. (2) The data validation agent, a VLLM, which filters out
low-quality synthetic instance images. The system prompts for both agents are
refined through TextGrad. Additionally, we use image harmonization to combine
multiple instances within scenes. Compared to state-of-the-art synthetic data
approaches like MosaicFusion, our approach reduces invalid synthetic data from
50% to 7% and improves performance by 1% mAP on rare classes in COCO instance
segmentation with YOLOv9c and YOLO11m. Furthermore, Gen-n-Val shows significant
improvements (7. 1% mAP) over YOLO-Worldv2-M in open-vocabulary object
detection benchmarks with YOLO11m. Moreover, Gen-n-Val improves the performance
of YOLOv9 and YOLO11 families in instance segmentation and object detection.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The study introduces MARS, a method combining CNNs and Transformers, to reconstruct accurate radio maps from sparse measurements, outperforming baseline models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current challenges in reconstructing accurate radio maps stem from the limitations of traditional and some deep learning methods, which either lack environmental awareness or require detailed scene data.

Method: MARS integrates CNNs and Transformers with multi-scale feature fusion and residual connections to enhance feature extraction and representation at multiple scales.

Result: Experiments indicate that MARS surpasses baseline models in metrics like MSE and SSIM while keeping computational demands low across varied scenes and antenna placements.

Conclusion: MARS demonstrates strong practical potential for reconstructing accurate radio maps efficiently, addressing limitations of existing methods.

Abstract: Radio maps reflect the spatial distribution of signal strength and are
essential for applications like smart cities, IoT, and wireless network
planning. However, reconstructing accurate radio maps from sparse measurements
remains challenging. Traditional interpolation and inpainting methods lack
environmental awareness, while many deep learning approaches depend on detailed
scene data, limiting generalization. To address this, we propose MARS, a
Multi-scale Aware Radiomap Super-resolution method that combines CNNs and
Transformers with multi-scale feature fusion and residual connections. MARS
focuses on both global and local feature extraction, enhancing feature
representation across different receptive fields and improving reconstruction
accuracy. Experiments across different scenes and antenna locations show that
MARS outperforms baseline models in both MSE and SSIM, while maintaining low
computational cost, demonstrating strong practical potential.

*Zhiyun Deng,Dongmyeong Lee,Amanda Adkins,Jesse Quattrociocchi,Christian Ellis,Joydeep Biswas*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces MoViX, a self-supervised cross-view video localization framework designed for GPS-denied, off-road environments, which achieves high localization accuracy even with outdated satellite imagery.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The primary motivation is to overcome challenges in 3-DoF localization in GPS-denied, off-road environments caused by repetitive vegetation, unstructured terrain, and seasonal changes in scene appearance.

Method: MoViX employs various strategies, including a pose-dependent positive sampling strategy for directional awareness, temporally aligned hard negative mining to avoid shortcut learning, motion-informed frame sampling, and a lightweight temporal aggregator. It uses Monte Carlo Localization with a learned cross-view matching module and entropy-guided temperature scaling for robust tracking.

Result: MoViX demonstrated strong performance, localizing within 25 meters of ground truth 93% of the time and within 50 meters 100% of the time in unseen regions, outperforming state-of-the-art methods on the TartanDrive 2.0 dataset and generalizing well to a different real-world off-road dataset.

Conclusion: MoViX effectively addresses cross-view 3-DoF localization challenges under challenging conditions, showing both accuracy and generalization capacity without the need for environment-specific tuning.

Abstract: Robust cross-view 3-DoF localization in GPS-denied, off-road environments
remains challenging due to (1) perceptual ambiguities from repetitive
vegetation and unstructured terrain, and (2) seasonal shifts that significantly
alter scene appearance, hindering alignment with outdated satellite imagery. To
address this, we introduce MoViX, a self-supervised cross-view video
localization framework that learns viewpoint- and season-invariant
representations while preserving directional awareness essential for accurate
localization. MoViX employs a pose-dependent positive sampling strategy to
enhance directional discrimination and temporally aligned hard negative mining
to discourage shortcut learning from seasonal cues. A motion-informed frame
sampler selects spatially diverse frames, and a lightweight temporal aggregator
emphasizes geometrically aligned observations while downweighting ambiguous
ones. At inference, MoViX runs within a Monte Carlo Localization framework,
using a learned cross-view matching module in place of handcrafted models.
Entropy-guided temperature scaling enables robust multi-hypothesis tracking and
confident convergence under visual ambiguity. We evaluate MoViX on the
TartanDrive 2.0 dataset, training on under 30 minutes of data and testing over
12.29 km. Despite outdated satellite imagery, MoViX localizes within 25 meters
of ground truth 93% of the time, and within 50 meters 100% of the time in
unseen regions, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines without
environment-specific tuning. We further demonstrate generalization on a
real-world off-road dataset from a geographically distinct site with a
different robot platform.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces HoliSafe, a comprehensive dataset for VLM safety evaluation, and SafeLLaVA, an enhanced VLM model with improved safety mechanisms, achieving state-of-the-art performance in safety benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address the shortcomings of current Vision-Language Models (VLMs), which lack comprehensive safety datasets and benchmarks and rely heavily on data-centric tuning without architectural enhancements, leaving them vulnerable to harmful outputs.

Method: The authors developed HoliSafe, a holistic dataset covering all safe/unsafe image-text interactions, and proposed SafeLLaVA, a VLM augmented with a learnable safety meta token and a dedicated safety head for safer and interpretable outputs.

Result: SafeLLaVA, trained on the HoliSafe dataset, demonstrated state-of-the-art performance on multiple safety benchmarks. HoliSafe also exposed critical vulnerabilities in other existing models.

Conclusion: HoliSafe and SafeLLaVA provide a significant step forward in VLM safety, encouraging further research into robust and interpretable solutions for multimodal alignment.

Abstract: Despite emerging efforts to enhance the safety of Vision-Language Models
(VLMs), current approaches face two main shortcomings. 1) Existing
safety-tuning datasets and benchmarks only partially consider how image-text
interactions can yield harmful content, often overlooking contextually unsafe
outcomes from seemingly benign pairs. This narrow coverage leaves VLMs
vulnerable to jailbreak attacks in unseen configurations. 2) Prior methods rely
primarily on data-centric tuning, with limited architectural innovations to
intrinsically strengthen safety. We address these gaps by introducing a
holistic safety dataset and benchmark, HoliSafe, that spans all five
safe/unsafe image-text combinations, providing a more robust basis for both
training and evaluation. We further propose SafeLLaVA, a novel VLM augmented
with a learnable safety meta token and a dedicated safety head. The meta token
encodes harmful visual cues during training, intrinsically guiding the language
model toward safer responses, while the safety head offers interpretable
harmfulness classification aligned with refusal rationales. Experiments show
that SafeLLaVA, trained on HoliSafe, achieves state-of-the-art safety
performance across multiple VLM benchmarks. Additionally, the HoliSafe
benchmark itself reveals critical vulnerabilities in existing models. We hope
that HoliSafe and SafeLLaVA will spur further research into robust and
interpretable VLM safety, expanding future avenues for multimodal alignment.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a unified approach for handling pairwise point cloud registration and shape assembly as a single generative problem, while addressing issues like symmetry handling and noisy input data.

Method: The method learns a continuous point-wise velocity field that transports points to their target positions and uses a self-supervised encoder focused on overlapping points.

Result: Achieved new state-of-the-art performance on six benchmarks across point cloud registration and shape assembly tasks, enabling joint training on diverse datasets.

Conclusion: The unified formulation of Rectified Point Flow simplifies symmetry handling, boosts accuracy, and facilitates learning shared geometric priors across diverse datasets.

Abstract: We introduce Rectified Point Flow, a unified parameterization that formulates
pairwise point cloud registration and multi-part shape assembly as a single
conditional generative problem. Given unposed point clouds, our method learns a
continuous point-wise velocity field that transports noisy points toward their
target positions, from which part poses are recovered. In contrast to prior
work that regresses part-wise poses with ad-hoc symmetry handling, our method
intrinsically learns assembly symmetries without symmetry labels. Together with
a self-supervised encoder focused on overlapping points, our method achieves a
new state-of-the-art performance on six benchmarks spanning pairwise
registration and shape assembly. Notably, our unified formulation enables
effective joint training on diverse datasets, facilitating the learning of
shared geometric priors and consequently boosting accuracy. Project page:

TL;DR: The paper investigates how multimodal language models, particularly LlaVA-Next, represent images in their latent spaces.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To examine how visual inputs are represented and processed within multimodal vision-language models like LlaVA-Next.

Method: The authors analyze model activations, perform targeted edits to test causal features, and train multimodal Sparse Autoencoders to construct interpretable text and image feature dictionaries.

Result: Key ImageNet class features are linearly decodable, deeper layers increasingly align modalities, and a dictionary with diverse linear features was generated.

Conclusion: Multimodal features of text and image representation grow more unified in deeper layers of the model, enhancing multimodal understanding.

Abstract: Language models can be equipped with multimodal capabilities by fine-tuning
on embeddings of visual inputs. But how do such multimodal models represent
images in their hidden activations? We explore representations of image
concepts within LlaVA-Next, a popular open-source VLLM. We find a diverse set
of ImageNet classes represented via linearly decodable features in the residual
stream. We show that the features are causal by performing targeted edits on
the model output. In order to increase the diversity of the studied linear
features, we train multimodal Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs), creating a highly
interpretable dictionary of text and image features. We find that although
model representations across modalities are quite disjoint, they become
increasingly shared in deeper layers.

### [171] [Robust Few-Shot Vision-Language Model Adaptation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04713)
*Hanxin Wang,Tian Liu,Shu Kong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper studies and enhances few-shot adaptation of pretrained Vision-Language Models (VLMs) for better in-distribution (ID) and out-of-distribution (OOD) accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge that VLMs encounter OOD test data during few-shot adaptation and to improve both ID and OOD performance.

Method: The authors analyze various VLM adaptation methods and propose SRAPF, a stage-wise partial finetuning approach using both retrieval augmentation and adversarial perturbation techniques.

Result: SRAPF surpasses other methods, achieving state-of-the-art ID and OOD accuracy on ImageNet OOD benchmarks.

Conclusion: Selective partial finetuning, combined with augmentation techniques in stages, effectively balances ID and OOD accuracy for robust few-shot adaptation in VLMs.

Abstract: Pretrained VLMs achieve strong performance on downstream tasks when adapted
with just a few labeled examples. As the adapted models inevitably encounter
out-of-distribution (OOD) test data that deviates from the in-distribution (ID)
task-specific training data, enhancing OOD generalization in few-shot
adaptation is critically important. We study robust few-shot VLM adaptation,
aiming to increase both ID and OOD accuracy. By comparing different adaptation
methods (e.g., prompt tuning, linear probing, contrastive finetuning, and full
finetuning), we uncover three key findings: (1) finetuning with proper
hyperparameters significantly outperforms the popular VLM adaptation methods
prompt tuning and linear probing; (2) visual encoder-only finetuning achieves
better efficiency and accuracy than contrastively finetuning both visual and
textual encoders; (3) finetuning the top layers of the visual encoder provides
the best balance between ID and OOD accuracy. Building on these findings, we
propose partial finetuning of the visual encoder empowered with two simple
augmentation techniques: (1) retrieval augmentation which retrieves
task-relevant data from the VLM's pretraining dataset to enhance adaptation,
and (2) adversarial perturbation which promotes robustness during finetuning.
Results show that the former/latter boosts OOD/ID accuracy while slightly
sacrificing the ID/OOD accuracy. Yet, perhaps understandably, naively combining
the two does not maintain their best OOD/ID accuracy. We address this dilemma
with the developed SRAPF, Stage-wise Retrieval Augmentation-based Adversarial
Partial Finetuning. SRAPF consists of two stages: (1) partial finetuning the
visual encoder using both ID and retrieved data, and (2) adversarial partial
finetuning with few-shot ID data. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SRAPF
achieves the state-of-the-art ID and OOD accuracy on the ImageNet OOD
benchmarks.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel approach to assess the visual quality of AI-Generated Videos (AIGVs), using feature decomposition, large language models (LLMs), and specialized prompt engineering.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AIGVs often exhibit flaws like noise, blurriness, and frame jitter, which impact user experience. Automatic visual quality assessment is crucial for regulating such content and improving generative models.

Method: The authors decompose visual quality into technical quality, motion quality, and video semantics, with tailored encoders for each. They use a large language model (LLM) for quality regression, incorporating multi-modal prompt engineering and LoRA fine-tuning.

Result: The proposed method achieved second place in the NTIRE 2025 Quality Assessment of AI-Generated Content Challenge's Track 2 on AI-Generated Videos.

Conclusion: The approach effectively assesses AIGV quality through multi-dimensional feature analysis and demonstrates its reliability in competitive scenarios.

Abstract: The development of AI-Generated Video (AIGV) technology has been remarkable
in recent years, significantly transforming the paradigm of video content
production. However, AIGVs still suffer from noticeable visual quality defects,
such as noise, blurriness, frame jitter and low dynamic degree, which severely
impact the user's viewing experience. Therefore, an effective automatic visual
quality assessment is of great importance for AIGV content regulation and
generative model improvement. In this work, we decompose the visual quality of
AIGVs into three dimensions: technical quality, motion quality, and video
semantics. For each dimension, we design corresponding encoder to achieve
effective feature representation. Moreover, considering the outstanding
performance of large language models (LLMs) in various vision and language
tasks, we introduce a LLM as the quality regression module. To better enable
the LLM to establish reasoning associations between multi-dimensional features
and visual quality, we propose a specially designed multi-modal prompt
engineering framework. Additionally, we incorporate LoRA fine-tuning technology
during the training phase, allowing the LLM to better adapt to specific tasks.
Our proposed method achieved \textbf{second place} in the NTIRE 2025 Quality

TL;DR: Endoscopic Submucosal Dissection trajectory prediction is tackled using a novel imitation learning approach, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enhancing surgical skill training by addressing the challenges in dissection trajectory prediction in ESD videos.

Method: Introduced Implicit Diffusion Policy with Equivariant Representations (iDPOE), which integrates a diffusion model and geometric equivariance into imitation learning.

Result: Achieved superior trajectory prediction performance on an ESD video dataset compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: iDPOE demonstrates significant promise in surgical skill development, marking a first in using imitation learning for dissection trajectory predictions.

Abstract: Endoscopic Submucosal Dissection (ESD) is a well-established technique for
removing epithelial lesions. Predicting dissection trajectories in ESD videos
offers significant potential for enhancing surgical skill training and
simplifying the learning process, yet this area remains underexplored. While
imitation learning has shown promise in acquiring skills from expert
demonstrations, challenges persist in handling uncertain future movements,
learning geometric symmetries, and generalizing to diverse surgical scenarios.
To address these, we introduce a novel approach: Implicit Diffusion Policy with
Equivariant Representations for Imitation Learning (iDPOE). Our method models
expert behavior through a joint state action distribution, capturing the
stochastic nature of dissection trajectories and enabling robust visual
representation learning across various endoscopic views. By incorporating a
diffusion model into policy learning, iDPOE ensures efficient training and
sampling, leading to more accurate predictions and better generalization.
Additionally, we enhance the model's ability to generalize to geometric
symmetries by embedding equivariance into the learning process. To address
state mismatches, we develop a forward-process guided action inference strategy
for conditional sampling. Using an ESD video dataset of nearly 2000 clips,
experimental results show that our approach surpasses state-of-the-art methods,
both explicit and implicit, in trajectory prediction. To the best of our
knowledge, this is the first application of imitation learning to surgical
skill development for dissection trajectory prediction.

Abstract: This paper presents an AI-assisted auto-labeling system for display panel

enhance the SegGPT architecture with several domain-specific training
techniques and introduce a scribble-based annotation mechanism to streamline
the labeling process. Our two-stage training approach, validated on industrial

*Mikhail Kennerley,Angelica Alives-Reviro,Carola-Bibiane Schönlieb,Robby T. Tan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Label-Aligned Transfer (LAT) framework to merge object detection datasets with inconsistent labels and bounding boxes, improving target dataset detection performance effectively.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Combining datasets for better object detection generalization is challenging due to inconsistent class labels and bounding box annotations.

Method: LAT employs dataset-specific detectors to create pseudo-labels, integrates them with ground truths using a Privileged Proposal Generator (PPG), and refines features via a Semantic Feature Fusion (SFF) module.

Result: LAT achieves significant detection performance improvements, with gains up to +4.8AP compared to semi-supervised baselines across benchmarks.

Conclusion: LAT effectively resolves both semantic and spatial inconsistencies across datasets without requiring shared label taxonomies or manual annotations, enabling enhanced target-domain performance.

Abstract: Combining multiple object detection datasets offers a path to improved
generalisation but is hindered by inconsistencies in class semantics and
bounding box annotations. Some methods to address this assume shared label
taxonomies and address only spatial inconsistencies; others require manual
relabelling, or produce a unified label space, which may be unsuitable when a
fixed target label space is required. We propose Label-Aligned Transfer (LAT),
a label transfer framework that systematically projects annotations from
diverse source datasets into the label space of a target dataset. LAT begins by
training dataset-specific detectors to generate pseudo-labels, which are then
combined with ground-truth annotations via a Privileged Proposal Generator
(PPG) that replaces the region proposal network in two-stage detectors. To
further refine region features, a Semantic Feature Fusion (SFF) module injects
class-aware context and features from overlapping proposals using a
confidence-weighted attention mechanism. This pipeline preserves
dataset-specific annotation granularity while enabling many-to-one label space
transfer across heterogeneous datasets, resulting in a semantically and
spatially aligned representation suitable for training a downstream detector.
LAT thus jointly addresses both class-level misalignments and bounding box
inconsistencies without relying on shared label spaces or manual annotations.
Across multiple benchmarks, LAT demonstrates consistent improvements in
target-domain detection performance, achieving gains of up to +4.8AP over
semi-supervised baselines.

*Shuhan Xu,Siyuan Liang,Hongling Zheng,Yong Luo,Aishan Liu,Dacheng Tao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Backdoor attacks on Vision-Language Models can lead to malicious captioning via imperceptible triggers. The proposed Semantic Reward Defense uses reinforcement learning to counter such attacks, significantly reducing their success rates while maintaining caption quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address the vulnerabilities in Vision-Language Models caused by backdoor attacks, which lead to generation of malicious captions and are challenging to detect and defend against due to their stealthy and cross-modal nature.

Method: The Semantic Reward Defense (SRD) framework applies reinforcement learning with a Deep Q-Network. It uses discrete image perturbations (like occlusion and color masking) and a semantic fidelity score as a reward to suppress malicious caption behavior without prior knowledge of triggers.

Result: Experiments show SRD reduces backdoor attack success rates to 5.6%, while maintaining caption quality on clean data with less than 10% performance reduction.

Conclusion: SRD demonstrates an effective, trigger-agnostic, and interpretable approach for defending against stealthy backdoor threats in multimodal generative models, ensuring robust and faithful captioning.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have achieved remarkable performance in image
captioning, but recent studies show they are vulnerable to backdoor attacks.
Attackers can inject imperceptible perturbations-such as local pixel triggers
or global semantic phrases-into the training data, causing the model to
generate malicious, attacker-controlled captions for specific inputs. These
attacks are hard to detect and defend due to their stealthiness and cross-modal
nature. By analyzing attack samples, we identify two key vulnerabilities: (1)
abnormal attention concentration on specific image regions, and (2) semantic
drift and incoherence in generated captions. To counter this, we propose
Semantic Reward Defense (SRD), a reinforcement learning framework that
mitigates backdoor behavior without prior knowledge of triggers. SRD uses a
Deep Q-Network to learn policies for applying discrete perturbations (e.g.,
occlusion, color masking) to sensitive image regions, aiming to disrupt the
activation of malicious pathways. We design a semantic fidelity score as the
reward signal, which jointly evaluates semantic consistency and linguistic
fluency of the output, guiding the agent toward generating robust yet faithful
captions. Experiments across mainstream VLMs and datasets show SRD reduces
attack success rates to 5.6%, while preserving caption quality on clean inputs
with less than 10% performance drop. SRD offers a trigger-agnostic,
interpretable defense paradigm against stealthy backdoor threats in multimodal
generative models.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces a groundbreaking dual-stream architecture for underwater image enhancement, leveraging both a physics-based approach and capsule clustering for feature learning. It achieves better results with less computational cost compared to existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improve the enhancement of underwater images while adhering to physical constraints and maintaining high computational efficiency.

Method: Developed a dual-stream approach combining a physics estimator for generating transmission maps and background light with a parallel capsule clustering module for feature representation. Introduced novel optimization objectives to balance physical adherence and perceptual quality.

Result: Achieved consistent performance improvements of +0.5 dB PSNR over state-of-the-art methods with only one-third of their computational complexity or a +1 dB PSNR improvement compared to computationally similar methods.

Conclusion: The proposed method successfully enhances underwater images while preserving semantic details and adhering to physical models, offering significant computational efficiency.

Abstract: We present a novel dual-stream architecture that achieves state-of-the-art
underwater image enhancement by explicitly integrating the Jaffe-McGlamery
physical model with capsule clustering-based feature representation learning.
Our method simultaneously estimates transmission maps and spatially-varying
background light through a dedicated physics estimator while extracting
entity-level features via capsule clustering in a parallel stream. This
physics-guided approach enables parameter-free enhancement that respects
underwater formation constraints while preserving semantic structures and
fine-grained details. Our approach also features a novel optimization objective
ensuring both physical adherence and perceptual quality across multiple spatial
frequencies. To validate our approach, we conducted extensive experiments
across six challenging benchmarks. Results demonstrate consistent improvements
of $+0.5$dB PSNR over the best existing methods while requiring only one-third
of their computational complexity (FLOPs), or alternatively, more than $+1$dB
PSNR improvement when compared to methods with similar computational budgets.

### [178] [Truth in the Few: High-Value Data Selection for Efficient Multi-Modal Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04755)
*Shenshen Li,Kaiyuan Deng,Lei Wang,Hao Yang,Chong Peng,Peng Yan,Fumin Shen,Heng Tao Shen,Xing Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces Reasoning Activation Potential (RAP), a data selection method for multi-modal large language models aimed at reducing data size and computational costs while enhancing reasoning abilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors seek to address the inefficiency in training multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) due to data redundancy and high computational costs, questioning whether smaller, high-value datasets can achieve or surpass the performance of extensive corpora.

Method: The authors propose RAP, a paradigm identifying cognitive samples in datasets using two estimators: Causal Discrepancy Estimator (CDE), which filters out samples overly reliant on language priors, and Attention Confidence Estimator (ACE), which removes samples influenced significantly by irrelevant tokens. Additionally, they introduce the Difficulty-aware Replacement Module (DRM) to replace trivial cases with more challenging ones.

Result: Using the RAP method, the authors achieve superior performance across six datasets while using only 9.3% of the training data, reducing computational costs by over 43%.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates that selective data utilization through RAP can effectively enhance multi-modal reasoning in MLLMs, suggesting that smaller, cognitively significant datasets can outperform large, redundant ones.

Abstract: While multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) have made significant
progress in complex reasoning tasks via reinforcement learning, it is commonly
believed that extensive training data is necessary for improving multi-modal
reasoning ability, inevitably leading to data redundancy and substantial
computational costs. However, can smaller high-value datasets match or
outperform full corpora for multi-modal reasoning in MLLMs? In this work, we
challenge this assumption through a key observation: meaningful multi-modal
reasoning is triggered by only a sparse subset of training samples, termed
cognitive samples, whereas the majority contribute marginally. Building on this
insight, we propose a novel data selection paradigm termed Reasoning Activation
Potential (RAP), which identifies cognitive samples by estimating each sample's
potential to stimulate genuine multi-modal reasoning by two complementary
estimators: 1) Causal Discrepancy Estimator (CDE) based on the potential
outcome model principle, eliminates samples that overly rely on language priors
by comparing outputs between multi-modal and text-only inputs; 2) Attention
Confidence Estimator (ACE), which exploits token-level self-attention to
discard samples dominated by irrelevant but over-emphasized tokens in
intermediate reasoning stages. Moreover, we introduce a Difficulty-aware
Replacement Module (DRM) to substitute trivial instances with cognitively
challenging ones, thereby ensuring complexity for robust multi-modal reasoning.
Experiments on six datasets show that our RAP method consistently achieves
superior performance using only 9.3% of the training data, while reducing
computational costs by over 43%. Our code is available at
https://github.com/Leo-ssl/RAP.

### [179] [Toward Better SSIM Loss for Unsupervised Monocular Depth Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04758)
*Yijun Cao,Fuya Luo,Yongjie Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper improves unsupervised monocular depth learning by introducing a new form of SSIM loss function with additive components, achieving better performance on the KITTI-2015 dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Unsupervised depth learning commonly uses photometric relationships and conventional forms of SSIM in training loss, which have overlooked the individual effects of SSIM components and their hyperparameters.

Method: A new form of SSIM was introduced that combines luminance, contrast, and structure additively rather than multiplicatively, providing optimized training performance through smoother gradients.

Result: Experiments reveal that the optimized SSIM loss function in the MonoDepth framework significantly improves performance on the KITTI-2015 outdoor dataset compared to baselines.

Conclusion: An additive formulation for SSIM improves depth estimation accuracy in unsupervised learning systems, with demonstrated effectiveness on popular benchmarks.

Abstract: Unsupervised monocular depth learning generally relies on the photometric
relation among temporally adjacent images. Most of previous works use both mean
absolute error (MAE) and structure similarity index measure (SSIM) with
conventional form as training loss. However, they ignore the effect of
different components in the SSIM function and the corresponding hyperparameters
on the training. To address these issues, this work proposes a new form of
SSIM. Compared with original SSIM function, the proposed new form uses addition
rather than multiplication to combine the luminance, contrast, and structural
similarity related components in SSIM. The loss function constructed with this
scheme helps result in smoother gradients and achieve higher performance on
unsupervised depth estimation. We conduct extensive experiments to determine
the relatively optimal combination of parameters for our new SSIM. Based on the
popular MonoDepth approach, the optimized SSIM loss function can remarkably
outperform the baseline on the KITTI-2015 outdoor dataset.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HypeVPR, a hierarchical embedding framework based on hyperbolic space, enhances Visual Place Recognition (VPR) for panoramic images, achieving faster and more accurate results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges of diverse query images in Visual Place Recognition (VPR) for real-world mobile robots by leveraging hierarchical visual structures in panoramic views.

Method: Developed HypeVPR, a framework using hyperbolic space for hierarchical feature relationships and a hierarchical feature aggregation mechanism, combined with a coarse-to-fine search strategy for efficient retrieval.

Result: HypeVPR outperforms state-of-the-art methods in accuracy and achieves up to 5x faster retrieval on benchmark datasets.

Conclusion: HypeVPR successfully combines hierarchical embeddings in hyperbolic space with efficient retrieval strategies, making it a groundbreaking tool for real-world VPR applications.

Abstract: When applying Visual Place Recognition (VPR) to real-world mobile robots and
similar applications, perspective-to-equirectangular (P2E) formulation
naturally emerges as a suitable approach to accommodate diverse query images
captured from various viewpoints. In this paper, we introduce HypeVPR, a novel
hierarchical embedding framework in hyperbolic space, designed to address the
unique challenges of P2E VPR. The key idea behind HypeVPR is that visual
environments captured by panoramic views exhibit inherent hierarchical
structures. To leverage this property, we employ hyperbolic space to represent
hierarchical feature relationships and preserve distance properties within the
feature space. To achieve this, we propose a hierarchical feature aggregation
mechanism that organizes local-to-global feature representations within
hyperbolic space. Additionally, HypeVPR adopts an efficient coarse-to-fine
search strategy, optimally balancing speed and accuracy to ensure robust
matching, even between descriptors from different image types. This approach
enables HypeVPR to outperform state-of-the-art methods while significantly
reducing retrieval time, achieving up to 5x faster retrieval across diverse
benchmark datasets. The code and models will be released at

*Gaia Di Lorenzo,Federico Tombari,Marc Pollefeys,Daniel Barath*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper presents Object-X, a framework for encoding multi-modal object embeddings and decoding them into 3D reconstructions, significantly reducing storage needs while enabling high-quality outputs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in multi-modal 3D object representation where existing methods fail to combine semantic understanding and geometric reconstruction effectively.

Method: Object-X uses 3D voxel grids to geometrically ground input modalities and learns unstructured embeddings that enable detailed 3D reconstructions and downstream tasks.

Result: Object-X achieves efficient and high-fidelity geometric and visual reconstructions, competitive performance in scene alignment/localization, and drastically reduced storage requirements.

Conclusion: Object-X is a highly scalable and practical solution for multi-modal 3D scene representation, excelling across tasks with minimal storage overhead.

Abstract: Learning effective multi-modal 3D representations of objects is essential for
numerous applications, such as augmented reality and robotics. Existing methods
often rely on task-specific embeddings that are tailored either for semantic
understanding or geometric reconstruction. As a result, these embeddings
typically cannot be decoded into explicit geometry and simultaneously reused
across tasks. In this paper, we propose Object-X, a versatile multi-modal
object representation framework capable of encoding rich object embeddings
(e.g. images, point cloud, text) and decoding them back into detailed geometric
and visual reconstructions. Object-X operates by geometrically grounding the
captured modalities in a 3D voxel grid and learning an unstructured embedding
fusing the information from the voxels with the object attributes. The learned
embedding enables 3D Gaussian Splatting-based object reconstruction, while also
supporting a range of downstream tasks, including scene alignment, single-image
3D object reconstruction, and localization. Evaluations on two challenging
real-world datasets demonstrate that Object-X produces high-fidelity novel-view
synthesis comparable to standard 3D Gaussian Splatting, while significantly
improving geometric accuracy. Moreover, Object-X achieves competitive
performance with specialized methods in scene alignment and localization.
Critically, our object-centric descriptors require 3-4 orders of magnitude less
storage compared to traditional image- or point cloud-based approaches,
establishing Object-X as a scalable and highly practical solution for
multi-modal 3D scene representation.

*Yusuke Matsui*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces LotusFilter, a module to diversify results in approximate nearest neighbor search (ANNS) by removing redundant vectors, operating efficiently with real-world embedding applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional Approximate Nearest Neighbor Search (ANNS) methods may return overly similar results, which is not desirable in applications requiring diverse outputs, such as Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). This paper addresses the need for a method to balance similarity to the query and diversity among the results.

Method: LotusFilter is a post-processing module that precomputes a cutoff table summarizing relationships among vectors. During inference, it removes redundant vectors by leveraging this table in a greedy filtering approach.

Result: Experiments show that LotusFilter effectively diversifies ANNS results and operates very efficiently, taking 0.02 ms per query in scenarios typical of real-world applications.

Conclusion: LotusFilter provides a simple yet efficient mechanism to diversify ANNS results, making it suitable for use in applications like RAG. The implementation is publicly available, facilitating adoption and further developments.

Abstract: Approximate nearest neighbor search (ANNS) is an essential building block for
applications like RAG but can sometimes yield results that are overly similar
to each other. In certain scenarios, search results should be similar to the
query and yet diverse. We propose LotusFilter, a post-processing module to
diversify ANNS results. We precompute a cutoff table summarizing vectors that
are close to each other. During the filtering, LotusFilter greedily looks up
the table to delete redundant vectors from the candidates. We demonstrated that
the LotusFilter operates fast (0.02 [ms/query]) in settings resembling
real-world RAG applications, utilizing features such as OpenAI embeddings. Our
code is publicly available at https://github.com/matsui528/lotf.

TL;DR: This paper introduces SupeRANSAC, a unified RANSAC pipeline that consistently outperforms existing methods in various computer vision tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The performance of RANSAC in estimating geometric models varies significantly depending on implementation details, and a unified, efficient approach is needed to enhance its accuracy and reliability across tasks.

Method: The authors developed SupeRANSAC, a novel pipeline that integrates and optimizes critical RANSAC components for consistent accuracy in homography, fundamental/essential matrix, and pose estimation tasks.

Result: SupeRANSAC achieves significant performance improvements, such as 6 AUC points higher on average for fundamental matrix estimation, demonstrating superior consistency and accuracy compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: SupeRANSAC provides a robust and unified solution for geometric model estimation in computer vision, surpassing existing frameworks like OpenCV and PoseLib in multiple tasks and datasets.

Abstract: Robust estimation is a cornerstone in computer vision, particularly for tasks
like Structure-from-Motion and Simultaneous Localization and Mapping. RANSAC
and its variants are the gold standard for estimating geometric models (e.g.,
homographies, relative/absolute poses) from outlier-contaminated data. Despite
RANSAC's apparent simplicity, achieving consistently high performance across
different problems is challenging. While recent research often focuses on
improving specific RANSAC components (e.g., sampling, scoring), overall
performance is frequently more influenced by the "bells and whistles" (i.e.,
the implementation details and problem-specific optimizations) within a given
library. Popular frameworks like OpenCV and PoseLib demonstrate varying
performance, excelling in some tasks but lagging in others. We introduce
SupeRANSAC, a novel unified RANSAC pipeline, and provide a detailed analysis of
the techniques that make RANSAC effective for specific vision tasks, including
homography, fundamental/essential matrix, and absolute/rigid pose estimation.
SupeRANSAC is designed for consistent accuracy across these tasks, improving
upon the best existing methods by, for example, 6 AUC points on average for
fundamental matrix estimation. We demonstrate significant performance
improvements over the state-of-the-art on multiple problems and datasets. Code:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to tackle the absence of comprehensive datasets for recognizing an unparalleled number of Chinese characters, vital for cultural heritage and digital applications.

Method: MegaHan97K dataset offers balanced samples across subsets (handwritten, historical, synthetic), supporting the GB18030-2022 standard.

Result: MegaHan97K facilitates benchmarking experiments, identifies challenges like class similarity and storage needs, and sets new benchmarks for mega-category OCR.

Conclusion: MegaHan97K fills critical gaps in mega-category OCR, providing immense potential for advancements in pattern recognition.

Abstract: Foundational to the Chinese language and culture, Chinese characters
encompass extraordinarily extensive and ever-expanding categories, with the
latest Chinese GB18030-2022 standard containing 87,887 categories. The accurate
recognition of this vast number of characters, termed mega-category
recognition, presents a formidable yet crucial challenge for cultural heritage
preservation and digital applications. Despite significant advances in Optical
Character Recognition (OCR), mega-category recognition remains unexplored due
to the absence of comprehensive datasets, with the largest existing dataset
containing merely 16,151 categories. To bridge this critical gap, we introduce
MegaHan97K, a mega-category, large-scale dataset covering an unprecedented
97,455 categories of Chinese characters. Our work offers three major
contributions: (1) MegaHan97K is the first dataset to fully support the latest
GB18030-2022 standard, providing at least six times more categories than
existing datasets; (2) It effectively addresses the long-tail distribution
problem by providing balanced samples across all categories through its three
distinct subsets: handwritten, historical and synthetic subsets; (3)
Comprehensive benchmarking experiments reveal new challenges in mega-category
scenarios, including increased storage demands, morphologically similar
character recognition, and zero-shot learning difficulties, while also
unlocking substantial opportunities for future research. To the best of our
knowledge, the MetaHan97K is likely the dataset with the largest classes not
only in the field of OCR but may also in the broader domain of pattern
recognition. The dataset is available at

Motivation: Event cameras have advantages over traditional sensors but are challenged by noise in converting event streams into compatible formats for computer vision.

Method: Spike-TBR combines Temporal Binary Representation with spiking neural networks for robust, noise-filtering event encoding, tested across four variants.

Result: Spike-TBR offers improved performance on noise-affected and clean datasets, showcasing better event stream representation.

Conclusion: The method bridges spike-based and frame-based processing, offering a simple and effective solution for noise-resilient event-driven vision.

Abstract: Event cameras offer significant advantages over traditional frame-based
sensors, including higher temporal resolution, lower latency and dynamic range.
However, efficiently converting event streams into formats compatible with
standard computer vision pipelines remains a challenging problem, particularly
in the presence of noise. In this paper, we propose Spike-TBR, a novel
event-based encoding strategy based on Temporal Binary Representation (TBR),
addressing its vulnerability to noise by integrating spiking neurons. Spike-TBR
combines the frame-based advantages of TBR with the noise-filtering
capabilities of spiking neural networks, creating a more robust representation
of event streams. We evaluate four variants of Spike-TBR, each using different
spiking neurons, across multiple datasets, demonstrating superior performance
in noise-affected scenarios while improving the results on clean data. Our
method bridges the gap between spike-based and frame-based processing, offering
a simple noise-resilient solution for event-driven vision applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the overlooked vulnerability of traffic light detection systems to adversarial attacks, particularly in CNN-based systems.

Method: The authors proposed adversarial printed patches placed strategically under each targeted traffic light and a training strategy to achieve universal attacks. They conducted experiments in lab and real-world settings to validate their approach.

Result: Their method successfully demonstrated targeted red-to-green label-flipping attacks and pictogram misclassifications. The attacks worked universally and in real-world scenarios with stationary and mobile traffic lights.

Conclusion: The findings highlight significant vulnerabilities in traffic light detection systems, showing that adversarial patches can compromise safety in both controlled and real-world environments.

Abstract: Realistic adversarial attacks on various camera-based perception tasks of
autonomous vehicles have been successfully demonstrated so far. However, only a
few works considered attacks on traffic light detectors. This work shows how
CNNs for traffic light detection can be attacked with printed patches. We
propose a threat model, where each instance of a traffic light is attacked with
a patch placed under it, and describe a training strategy. We demonstrate
successful adversarial patch attacks in universal settings. Our experiments
show realistic targeted red-to-green label-flipping attacks and attacks on
pictogram classification. Finally, we perform a real-world evaluation with
printed patches and demonstrate attacks in the lab settings with a mobile
traffic light for construction sites and in a test area with stationary traffic
lights. Our code is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Transformer-based models have been successful in video understanding but face challenges in real-world video super-resolution (VSR). The proposed DualX-VSR addresses these issues with a dual axial spatial-temporal attention mechanism, eliminating motion compensation and achieving high performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world VSR demands pixel-level precision, which traditional transformer-based models struggle to deliver due to tokenization and sequential attention mechanisms. Existing solutions still face restricted receptive fields and reliance on optical flow, leading to inaccuracies.

Method: The paper introduces DualX-VSR, featuring a novel dual axial spatial-temporal attention mechanism. It integrates spatial and temporal information orthogonally without relying on motion compensation, simplifying the structure and enhancing spatiotemporal representation.

Result: DualX-VSR demonstrates high fidelity and superior performance in real-world video super-resolution tasks, overcoming limitations found in existing transformer-based VSR models.

Conclusion: DualX-VSR offers a robust solution to challenges in real-world VSR by introducing an innovative attention mechanism, eliminating the need for motion compensation, and enhancing precision and performance.

Abstract: Transformer-based models like ViViT and TimeSformer have advanced video
understanding by effectively modeling spatiotemporal dependencies. Recent video
generation models, such as Sora and Vidu, further highlight the power of
transformers in long-range feature extraction and holistic spatiotemporal
modeling. However, directly applying these models to real-world video
super-resolution (VSR) is challenging, as VSR demands pixel-level precision,
which can be compromised by tokenization and sequential attention mechanisms.
While recent transformer-based VSR models attempt to address these issues using
smaller patches and local attention, they still face limitations such as
restricted receptive fields and dependence on optical flow-based alignment,
which can introduce inaccuracies in real-world settings. To overcome these
issues, we propose Dual Axial Spatial$\times$Temporal Transformer for
Real-World Video Super-Resolution (DualX-VSR), which introduces a novel dual
axial spatial$\times$temporal attention mechanism that integrates spatial and
temporal information along orthogonal directions. DualX-VSR eliminates the need
for motion compensation, offering a simplified structure that provides a
cohesive representation of spatiotemporal information. As a result, DualX-VSR
achieves high fidelity and superior performance in real-world VSR task.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces OpenMaskDINO3D, a model that integrates point cloud data and text prompts for 3D instance segmentation, achieving high accuracy and comprehensive understanding in 3D reasoning tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To solve the gap in 3D segmentation frameworks capable of understanding implicit user intentions, which current perception systems effectively handle only in 2D contexts.

Method: A segmentation model integrating point cloud data and text prompts, with SEG token and object identifier mechanisms, producing highly accurate 3D segmentation masks.

Result: OpenMaskDINO3D demonstrated high precision and effective performance on various 3D tasks, validated through large-scale ScanNet datasets.

Conclusion: OpenMaskDINO3D successfully bridges the gap in 3D reasoning segmentation tasks, establishing a robust framework combining natural language processing with advanced point cloud manipulation.

Abstract: Although perception systems have made remarkable advancements in recent
years, particularly in 2D reasoning segmentation, these systems still rely on
explicit human instruction or pre-defined categories to identify target objects
before executing visual recognition tasks. Such systems have matured
significantly, demonstrating the ability to reason and comprehend implicit user
intentions in two-dimensional contexts, producing accurate segmentation masks
based on complex and implicit query text. However, a comparable framework and
structure for 3D reasoning segmentation remain absent. This paper introduces
OpenMaskDINO3D, a LLM designed for comprehensive 3D understanding and
segmentation. OpenMaskDINO3D processes point cloud data and text prompts to
produce instance segmentation masks, excelling in many 3D tasks. By introducing
a SEG token and object identifier, we achieve high-precision 3D segmentation
mask generation, enabling the model to directly produce accurate point cloud
segmentation results from natural language instructions. Experimental results
on large-scale ScanNet datasets validate the effectiveness of our
OpenMaskDINO3D across various tasks.

### [190] [Invisible Backdoor Triggers in Image Editing Model via Deep Watermarking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04879)
*Yu-Feng Chen,Tzuhsuan Huang,Pin-Yen Chiu,Jun-Cheng Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper explores a novel backdoor attack framework in image editing by embedding invisible triggers into images using poisoned training data and deep watermarking models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While diffusion models excel in both image generation and editing, they remain susceptible to backdoor attacks. This paper identifies a gap in research regarding backdoor attacks in image editing, as most focus has been on image generation or visible triggers for editing, which compromise practicality.

Method: The authors propose an attack framework that uses deep watermarking models to encode imperceptible watermarks as backdoor triggers. These triggers are embedded into the image editing pipeline via poisoned training data, allowing the model to behave normally with clean images but manipulated with watermarked inputs.

Result: The experimental results demonstrate high attack success rates across various watermarking models for backdoor attacks. Analysis of watermark characteristics reinforces the methodology's effectiveness.

Conclusion: The proposed approach successfully addresses the challenge of imperceptible backdoor attacks in image editing, offering a robust framework to exploit diffusion models while maintaining input image integrity.

Abstract: Diffusion models have achieved remarkable progress in both image generation
and editing. However, recent studies have revealed their vulnerability to
backdoor attacks, in which specific patterns embedded in the input can
manipulate the model's behavior. Most existing research in this area has
proposed attack frameworks focused on the image generation pipeline, leaving
backdoor attacks in image editing relatively unexplored. Among the few studies
targeting image editing, most utilize visible triggers, which are impractical
because they introduce noticeable alterations to the input image before
editing. In this paper, we propose a novel attack framework that embeds
invisible triggers into the image editing process via poisoned training data.
We leverage off-the-shelf deep watermarking models to encode imperceptible
watermarks as backdoor triggers. Our goal is to make the model produce the
predefined backdoor target when it receives watermarked inputs, while editing
clean images normally according to the given prompt. With extensive experiments
across different watermarking models, the proposed method achieves promising
attack success rates. In addition, the analysis results of the watermark
characteristics in term of backdoor attack further support the effectiveness of
our approach. The code is available

*Andrew Hamara,Greg Hamerly,Pablo Rivas,Andrew C. Freeman*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces an alternative approach to chess move selection based on board state embeddings derived through a transformer encoder, achieving competitive performance without heavy reliance on deep searches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge the gap between intuitive, shallow move evaluations used by human chess players and the deep tree search-based methods employed by engines, the authors sought a more interpretable and efficient planning process.

Method: Using supervised contrastive learning, they train a transformer encoder to map board states into a latent space structured by positional evaluations, where distances reflect similarity in evaluations. Moves are selected by progressing toward favorable regions within this space.

Result: The model achieves an estimated Elo rating of 2593 with only a 6-ply beam search, and performance improves with larger model sizes and higher embedding dimensions.

Conclusion: The embedding-based planning approach demonstrates a viable and efficient alternative to deep search methods, with potential applications in other perfect-information games besides chess.

Abstract: Modern chess engines achieve superhuman performance through deep tree search
and regressive evaluation, while human players rely on intuition to select
candidate moves followed by a shallow search to validate them. To model this
intuition-driven planning process, we train a transformer encoder using
supervised contrastive learning to embed board states into a latent space
structured by positional evaluation. In this space, distance reflects
evaluative similarity, and visualized trajectories display interpretable
transitions between game states. We demonstrate that move selection can occur
entirely within this embedding space by advancing toward favorable regions,
without relying on deep search. Despite using only a 6-ply beam search, our
model achieves an estimated Elo rating of 2593. Performance improves with both
model size and embedding dimensionality, suggesting that latent planning may
offer a viable alternative to traditional search. Although we focus on chess,
the proposed embedding-based planning method can be generalized to other
perfect-information games where state evaluations are learnable. All source

### [192] [From Objects to Anywhere: A Holistic Benchmark for Multi-level Visual Grounding in 3D Scenes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04897)
*Tianxu Wang,Zhuofan Zhang,Ziyu Zhu,Yue Fan,Jing Xiong,Pengxiang Li,Xiaojian Ma,Qing Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper presents Anywhere3D-Bench, a 3D visual grounding benchmark for spaces, activities, objects, and object parts in 3D scenes, revealing current models struggle with spatial and fine-grained tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 3D visual grounding focuses on objects, missing the ability to address referring expressions beyond objects. This gap limits understanding of complex spatial and semantic relations in 3D environments.

Method: The authors created Anywhere3D-Bench with 2,632 expression-bounding box pairs, covering grounding levels like human activities, unoccupied spaces, objects, and object parts. They evaluated current 3D visual grounding models, LLMs, and MLLMs on this benchmark.

Result: Experimental results show poor performance of current models on space-level (23.57% accuracy) and part-level tasks (33.94% accuracy), highlighting challenges in spatial reasoning and fine-grained perception.

Conclusion: This study reveals significant limitations in the ability of models to tackle spatial and part-level tasks in 3D scenes, emphasizing the need for advancements in reasoning and perception capabilities.

Abstract: 3D visual grounding has made notable progress in localizing objects within
complex 3D scenes. However, grounding referring expressions beyond objects in
3D scenes remains unexplored. In this paper, we introduce Anywhere3D-Bench, a
holistic 3D visual grounding benchmark consisting of 2,632 referring
expression-3D bounding box pairs spanning four different grounding levels:
human-activity areas, unoccupied space beyond objects, objects in the scene,
and fine-grained object parts. We assess a range of state-of-the-art 3D visual
grounding methods alongside large language models (LLMs) and multimodal LLMs
(MLLMs) on Anywhere3D-Bench. Experimental results reveal that space-level and
part-level visual grounding pose the greatest challenges: space-level tasks
require a more comprehensive spatial reasoning ability, for example, modeling
distances and spatial relations within 3D space, while part-level tasks demand
fine-grained perception of object composition. Even the best performance model,
OpenAI o4-mini, achieves only 23.57% accuracy on space-level tasks and 33.94%
on part-level tasks, significantly lower than its performance on area-level and
object-level tasks. These findings underscore a critical gap in current models'
capacity to understand and reason about 3D scene beyond object-level semantics.

*Filip Slezak,Magnus K. Gjerde,Joakim B. Haurum,Ivan Nikolov,Morten S. Laursen,Thomas B. Moeslund*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS)-based approach for generating datasets to train stereo models competitively, focusing on efficient alternatives to NeRF-based methods. It finds that disparity estimates from FoundationStereo produce better results than direct geometry reconstructions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Provide an efficient and low-cost alternative to NeRF for generating datasets focused on stereo model fine-tuning, addressing limitations in robustness and noise from direct geometry reconstruction.

Method: Utilize 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) pipelines and compare reconstructed geometry with depth estimates from the FoundationStereo model for dataset generation in an expert knowledge transfer setup.

Result: Fine-tuned stereo models using FoundationStereo’s disparity estimates outperform models relying on reconstructed geometry in zero-shot generalization benchmarks. However, Gaussian Splatting demonstrates limitations in robustness for in-the-wild settings.

Conclusion: 3DGS pipelines offer an efficient method for dataset creation with potential for fine-tuning stereo models, but challenges remain in robustness for broader applications.

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS)-based pipeline for
stereo dataset generation, offering an efficient alternative to Neural Radiance
Fields (NeRF)-based methods. To obtain useful geometry estimates, we explore
utilizing the reconstructed geometry from the explicit 3D representations as
well as depth estimates from the FoundationStereo model in an expert knowledge
transfer setup. We find that when fine-tuning stereo models on 3DGS-generated
datasets, we demonstrate competitive performance in zero-shot generalization
benchmarks. When using the reconstructed geometry directly, we observe that it
is often noisy and contains artifacts, which propagate noise to the trained
model. In contrast, we find that the disparity estimates from FoundationStereo
are cleaner and consequently result in a better performance on the zero-shot
generalization benchmarks. Our method highlights the potential for low-cost,
high-fidelity dataset creation and fast fine-tuning for deep stereo models.
Moreover, we also reveal that while the latest Gaussian Splatting based methods
have achieved superior performance on established benchmarks, their robustness
falls short in challenging in-the-wild settings warranting further exploration.

*Antoine Laurent,Jean Mélou,Catherine Schwab,Rolande Simon-Millot,Sophie Féret,Thomas Sagory,Carole Fritz,Jean-Denis Durou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper discusses the creation of digital twins for heritage objects, emphasizing that no single 3D digitization method fits all cases, and methods should be chosen case-by-case.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the growing demand for digitizing heritage objects by exploring the creation of digital twins and highlighting the need for adaptable methods.

Method: The study showcases various photographic 3D digitization methods using sample objects from the musée d'Archéologie nationale, advocating for a context-specific approach.

Result: No universal 3D digitization method is suitable for all objects, and each object may require customization of existing tools.

Conclusion: A collaborative approach between heritage and digital technology experts is essential to select the best-suited digitization method for each object, considering its traits and intended digital twin usage.

Abstract: The need to digitize heritage objects is now widely accepted. This article
presents the very fashionable context of the creation of ''digital twins''. It
illustrates the diversity of photographic 3D digitization methods, but this is
not its only objective. Using a selection of objects from the collections of
the mus{\'e}e d'Arch{\'e}ologie nationale, it shows that no single method is
suitable for all cases. Rather, the method to be recommended for a given object
should be the result of a concerted choice between those involved in heritage
and those involved in the digital domain, as each new object may require the
adaptation of existing tools. It would therefore be pointless to attempt an
absolute classification of 3D digitization methods. On the contrary, we need to
find the digital tool best suited to each object, taking into account not only
its characteristics, but also the future use of its digital twin.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CzechLynx introduces a comprehensive open-access dataset for Eurasian lynx identification, pose estimation, and segmentation, including 30k real images and 100k synthetic ones over 15 years.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the lack of large-scale open-access datasets for animal identification and pose estimation, specifically targeting the Eurasian lynx.

Method: CzechLynx combines real camera trap images annotated with segmentation masks, identity labels, and skeletons, as well as synthetic data generated via Unity-based pipelines and text-to-texture modeling.

Result: The dataset spans 219 lynx individuals across two regions and 15 years, including diverse environments, poses, and coat patterns, along with tailored evaluation protocols for testing generalization.

Conclusion: CzechLynx is positioned as a benchmark tool for advancing state-of-the-art methods in animal re-identification and broader ecological studies.

Abstract: We introduce CzechLynx, the first large-scale, open-access dataset for
individual identification, 2D pose estimation, and instance segmentation of the
Eurasian lynx (Lynx lynx). CzechLynx includes more than 30k camera trap images
annotated with segmentation masks, identity labels, and 20-point skeletons and
covers 219 unique individuals across 15 years of systematic monitoring in two
geographically distinct regions: Southwest Bohemia and the Western Carpathians.
To increase the data variability, we create a complementary synthetic set with
more than 100k photorealistic images generated via a Unity-based pipeline and
diffusion-driven text-to-texture modeling, covering diverse environments,
poses, and coat-pattern variations. To allow testing generalization across
spatial and temporal domains, we define three tailored evaluation
protocols/splits: (i) geo-aware, (ii) time-aware open-set, and (iii) time-aware
closed-set. This dataset is targeted to be instrumental in benchmarking
state-of-the-art models and the development of novel methods for not just
individual animal re-identification.

*Yong Sun,Yipeng Wang,Junyu Shi,Zhiyuan Zhang,Yanmei Xiao,Lei Zhu,Manxi Jiang,Qiang Nie*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces a new task and AI framework, "Video-Based Embryo Grading," using time-lapse monitoring (TLM) videos for holistic embryo quality assessment in IVF.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AI techniques for IVF embryo selection lack holistic assessment or are confounded by external factors, limiting their clinical applicability.

Method: The proposed framework, called Complementary Spatial-Temporal Pattern Mining (CoSTeM), utilizes two branches: a morphological branch for structural features and a morphokinetic branch for developmental trajectories, leveraging time-lapse video data for embryo grading.

Result: Experimental results show that the CoSTeM framework outperforms existing methods in predicting embryo quality.

Conclusion: This work introduces a novel AI-based approach for embryo grading, combining spatial and temporal information effectively, and plans to release its dataset and source code.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence has recently shown promise in automated embryo
selection for In-Vitro Fertilization (IVF). However, current approaches either
address partial embryo evaluation lacking holistic quality assessment or target
clinical outcomes inevitably confounded by extra-embryonic factors, both
limiting clinical utility. To bridge this gap, we propose a new task called
Video-Based Embryo Grading - the first paradigm that directly utilizes
full-length time-lapse monitoring (TLM) videos to predict embryologists'
overall quality assessments. To support this task, we curate a real-world
clinical dataset comprising over 2,500 TLM videos, each annotated with a
grading label indicating the overall quality of embryos. Grounded in clinical
decision-making principles, we propose a Complementary Spatial-Temporal Pattern
Mining (CoSTeM) framework that conceptually replicates embryologists'
evaluation process. The CoSTeM comprises two branches: (1) a morphological
branch using a Mixture of Cross-Attentive Experts layer and a Temporal
Selection Block to select discriminative local structural features, and (2) a
morphokinetic branch employing a Temporal Transformer to model global
developmental trajectories, synergistically integrating static and dynamic
determinants for grading embryos. Extensive experimental results demonstrate
the superiority of our design. This work provides a valuable methodological
framework for AI-assisted embryo selection. The dataset and source code will be
publicly available upon acceptance.

*Igor Meleshin,Anna Chistyakova,Anastasia Antsiferova,Dmitriy Vatolin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a new approach to building robust Image Quality Assessment (IQA) models by designing their architecture to suppress adversarial vulnerabilities rather than relying on data-driven defenses.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: IQA models play a critical role in evaluating image quality across various systems, but they are vulnerable to adversarial manipulations that compromise their reliability.

Method: The proposed method focuses on architectural changes rather than training-induced robustness. This is achieved through orthogonal information flow, norm-preserving operations, pruning, and fine-tuning to suppress adversarial sensitivity in IQA models.

Result: The researchers developed an IQA model architecture resilient to adversarial manipulations without needing adversarial training or major alterations to the initial model.

Conclusion: This work pushes for a conceptual shift from data-focused defenses to engineering the robustness into model design itself, opening a new pathway for creating stable IQA systems.

Abstract: Image Quality Assessment (IQA) models are increasingly relied upon to
evaluate image quality in real-world systems -- from compression and
enhancement to generation and streaming. Yet their adoption brings a
fundamental risk: these models are inherently unstable. Adversarial
manipulations can easily fool them, inflating scores and undermining trust.
Traditionally, such vulnerabilities are addressed through data-driven defenses
-- adversarial retraining, regularization, or input purification. But what if
this is the wrong lens? What if robustness in perceptual models is not
something to learn but something to design? In this work, we propose a
provocative idea: robustness as an architectural prior. Rather than training
models to resist perturbations, we reshape their internal structure to suppress
sensitivity from the ground up. We achieve this by enforcing orthogonal
information flow, constraining the network to norm-preserving operations -- and
further stabilizing the system through pruning and fine-tuning. The result is a
robust IQA architecture that withstands adversarial attacks without requiring
adversarial training or significant changes to the original model. This
approach suggests a shift in perspective: from optimizing robustness through
data to engineering it through design.

*Hong Gao,Yiming Bao,Xuezhan Tu,Bin Zhong,Minling Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: APVR is a training-free framework designed to address issues in hour-level video understanding through hierarchical information retrieval, significantly improving efficiency and reliability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the limitations in computational ability and inefficient temporal sequence extraction for large-scale video-based multimodal large language models.

Method: APVR combines Pivot Frame Retrieval, focusing on semantic expansion and multi-modal confidence scoring, with Pivot Token Retrieval, which uses query-aware attention-driven token selection.

Result: APVR achieves state-of-the-art performance in hour-long video analysis, validated through experiments on LongVideoBench and VideoMME benchmarks.

Conclusion: This framework enhances semantic fidelity in long video processing, offering integration capability with existing architectures and significantly advancing training-free and training-based methods.

Abstract: Current video-based multimodal large language models struggle with hour-level
video understanding due to computational constraints and inefficient
information extraction from extensive temporal sequences. We propose APVR
(Adaptive Pivot Visual information Retrieval), a training-free framework that
addresses the memory wall limitation through hierarchical visual information
retrieval. APVR operates via two complementary components: Pivot Frame
Retrieval employs semantic expansion and multi-modal confidence scoring to
identify semantically relevant video frames, while Pivot Token Retrieval
performs query-aware attention-driven token selection within the pivot frames.
This dual granularity approach enables processing of hour-long videos while
maintaining semantic fidelity. Experimental validation on LongVideoBench and
VideoMME demonstrates significant performance improvements, establishing
state-of-the-art results for not only training-free but also training-based
approaches while providing plug-and-play integration capability with existing
MLLM architectures.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel model, FEAT, aimed at synthesizing dynamic medical videos effectively by addressing challenges in spatial consistency and temporal dynamics using innovative attention mechanisms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To tackle limitations in existing Transformer-based methods for dynamic medical video synthesis, including inefficiencies in channel interactions, computational complexity, and coarse noise handling.

Method: FEAT employs sequential spatial-temporal-channel attention mechanisms for capturing dependencies across dimensions, linear-complexity attention mechanisms, and a residual value guidance module to adapt to noise levels.

Result: FEAT-S achieves competitive performance with only 23% of Endora's parameters, while FEAT-L outperforms state-of-the-art methods across multiple datasets.

Conclusion: FEAT demonstrates enhanced effectiveness and scalability in synthesizing dynamic medical videos, offering significant improvements over existing models.

Abstract: Synthesizing high-quality dynamic medical videos remains a significant
challenge due to the need for modeling both spatial consistency and temporal
dynamics. Existing Transformer-based approaches face critical limitations,
including insufficient channel interactions, high computational complexity from
self-attention, and coarse denoising guidance from timestep embeddings when
handling varying noise levels. In this work, we propose FEAT, a
full-dimensional efficient attention Transformer, which addresses these issues
through three key innovations: (1) a unified paradigm with sequential
spatial-temporal-channel attention mechanisms to capture global dependencies
across all dimensions, (2) a linear-complexity design for attention mechanisms
in each dimension, utilizing weighted key-value attention and global channel
attention, and (3) a residual value guidance module that provides fine-grained
pixel-level guidance to adapt to different noise levels. We evaluate FEAT on
standard benchmarks and downstream tasks, demonstrating that FEAT-S, with only
23\% of the parameters of the state-of-the-art model Endora, achieves
comparable or even superior performance. Furthermore, FEAT-L surpasses all
comparison methods across multiple datasets, showcasing both superior
effectiveness and scalability. Code is available at

*Mélisande Teng,Arthur Ouaknine,Etienne Laliberté,Yoshua Bengio,David Rolnick,Hugo Larochelle*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper evaluates methods leveraging the Segment Anything Model (SAM) for automatic tree crown segmentation using drone imagery, proposing a model called BalSAM that incorporates elevation data (DSM).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to improve forest monitoring and management by automating tree crown segmentation through advancements in drone remote sensing and vision models, reducing the cost, time, and labor of current ground measurement methods.

Method: The authors compared SAM-based methods with custom Mask R-CNN for tree crown segmentation in boreal plantations, temperate, and tropical forests. They further explored integrating Digital Surface Model (DSM) elevation data into these models and developed BalSAM, which combines SAM with DSM information.

Result: The study found that SAM out-of-the-box does not outperform a custom Mask R-CNN, even with prompts. However, end-to-end tuning of SAM and DSM integration showed potential, particularly in plantation contexts.

Conclusion: BalSAM, leveraging SAM and DSM, demonstrates potential for tree crown segmentation. The paper highlights the need for efficient SAM tuning and elevation data integration to outperform traditional methods.

Abstract: Information on trees at the individual level is crucial for monitoring forest
ecosystems and planning forest management. Current monitoring methods involve
ground measurements, requiring extensive cost, time and labor. Advances in
drone remote sensing and computer vision offer great potential for mapping
individual trees from aerial imagery at broad-scale. Large pre-trained vision
models, such as the Segment Anything Model (SAM), represent a particularly
compelling choice given limited labeled data. In this work, we compare methods
leveraging SAM for the task of automatic tree crown instance segmentation in
high resolution drone imagery in three use cases: 1) boreal plantations, 2)
temperate forests and 3) tropical forests. We also study the integration of
elevation data into models, in the form of Digital Surface Model (DSM)
information, which can readily be obtained at no additional cost from RGB drone
imagery. We present BalSAM, a model leveraging SAM and DSM information, which
shows potential over other methods, particularly in the context of plantations.
We find that methods using SAM out-of-the-box do not outperform a custom Mask
R-CNN, even with well-designed prompts. However, efficiently tuning SAM
end-to-end and integrating DSM information are both promising avenues for tree
crown instance segmentation models.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces TextVidBench, a benchmark for evaluating long-video text question answering (>3 minutes), alongside methods to improve model performance in this domain.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing datasets for short-video Text-Visual QA fail to assess the growing capabilities of multimodal large language models due to limited video duration and narrow evaluation scopes.

Method: The authors developed TextVidBench with cross-domain long-video coverage, a three-stage evaluation framework, fine-grained annotations, and proposed techniques like IT-Rope, temporal prompt engineering, and non-uniform positional encoding for model training.

Result: TextVidBench demonstrated significant challenges for existing models, with the proposed methods offering improvements in long-video scene text understanding.

Conclusion: TextVidBench serves as a vital resource for advancing long-video QA research, while the proposed techniques enhance temporal understanding and performance of multimodal models.

Abstract: Despite recent progress on the short-video Text-Visual Question Answering
(ViteVQA) task - largely driven by benchmarks such as M4-ViteVQA - existing
datasets still suffer from limited video duration and narrow evaluation scopes,
making it difficult to adequately assess the growing capabilities of powerful
multimodal large language models (MLLMs). To address these limitations, we
introduce TextVidBench, the first benchmark specifically designed for
long-video text question answering (>3 minutes). TextVidBench makes three key
contributions: 1) Cross-domain long-video coverage: Spanning 9 categories
(e.g., news, sports, gaming), with an average video length of 2306 seconds,
enabling more realistic evaluation of long-video understanding. 2) A
three-stage evaluation framework: "Text Needle-in-Haystack -> Temporal
Grounding -> Text Dynamics Captioning". 3) High-quality fine-grained
annotations: Containing over 5,000 question-answer pairs with detailed semantic
labeling. Furthermore, we propose an efficient paradigm for improving large
models through: (i) introducing the IT-Rope mechanism and temporal prompt
engineering to enhance temporal perception, (ii) adopting non-uniform
positional encoding to better handle long video sequences, and (iii) applying
lightweight fine-tuning on video-text data. Extensive experiments on multiple
public datasets as well as TextVidBench demonstrate that our new benchmark
presents significant challenges to existing models, while our proposed method
offers valuable insights into improving long-video scene text understanding
capabilities.

*Enrique Sanchez,Isma Hadji,Adrian Bulat,Christos Tzelepis,Brais Martinez,Georgios Tzimiropoulos*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes advancements in Image Super-Resolution (ISR) using Visual Auto-Regressive (VAR) modeling, overcoming prior limitations with novel techniques for tokenizing images and optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current ISR models, like VARSR, show promising performance but have notable limitations such as fixed resolution handling, dependence on large-scale private datasets, and complex architectures. This paper seeks to address these issues.

Method: The authors introduce two key innovations: a Hierarchical Image Tokenization method for multi-scale representation with overlapping tokens, and a Direct Preference Optimization regularization term to force semantically consistent residuals across scales, enabling better ISR.

Result: Their model achieves state-of-the-art performance in ISR tasks while being more efficient (300M parameters compared to VARSR's 1B parameters) and only relying on public datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed approach significantly advances ISR by offering an efficient, flexible, and high-performing solution that overcomes the limitations of prior VAR-based ISR models.

Abstract: In this paper we tackle Image Super Resolution (ISR), using recent advances
in Visual Auto-Regressive (VAR) modeling. VAR iteratively estimates the
residual in latent space between gradually increasing image scales, a process
referred to as next-scale prediction. Thus, the strong priors learned during
pre-training align well with the downstream task (ISR). To our knowledge, only
VARSR has exploited this synergy so far, showing promising results. However,
due to the limitations of existing residual quantizers, VARSR works only at a
fixed resolution, i.e. it fails to map intermediate outputs to the
corresponding image scales. Additionally, it relies on a 1B transformer
architecture (VAR-d24), and leverages a large-scale private dataset to achieve
state-of-the-art results. We address these limitations through two novel
components: a) a Hierarchical Image Tokenization approach with a multi-scale
image tokenizer that progressively represents images at different scales while
simultaneously enforcing token overlap across scales, and b) a Direct
Preference Optimization (DPO) regularization term that, relying solely on the
LR and HR tokenizations, encourages the transformer to produce the latter over
the former. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time a quantizer is
trained to force semantically consistent residuals at different scales, and the
first time that preference-based optimization is used to train a VAR. Using
these two components, our model can denoise the LR image and super-resolve at
half and full target upscale factors in a single forward pass. Additionally, we
achieve \textit{state-of-the-art results on ISR}, while using a small model
(300M params vs ~1B params of VARSR), and without using external training data.

### [203] [PATS: Proficiency-Aware Temporal Sampling for Multi-View Sports Skill Assessment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04996)
*Edoardo Bianchi,Antonio Liotta*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes Proficiency-Aware Temporal Sampling (PATS), a method to preserve temporal continuity during skill assessment in videos, achieving superior performance compared to prior techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing video sampling methods disrupt the temporal continuity essential for evaluating sports skills effectively, necessitating a new approach.

Method: PATS adaptively segments videos into continuous segments to capture complete fundamental movements, ensuring temporal coherence and maximal information coverage.

Result: Using the EgoExo4D dataset, PATS improves skill assessment accuracy significantly (+0.65% to +3.05% overall; up to +26.22% in specific domains such as bouldering).

Conclusion: PATS effectively adapts to diverse activities and enhances skill assessment accuracy, proving its value as a robust solution for real-world applications.

Abstract: Automated sports skill assessment requires capturing fundamental movement
patterns that distinguish expert from novice performance, yet current video
sampling methods disrupt the temporal continuity essential for proficiency
evaluation. To this end, we introduce Proficiency-Aware Temporal Sampling
(PATS), a novel sampling strategy that preserves complete fundamental movements
within continuous temporal segments for multi-view skill assessment. PATS
adaptively segments videos to ensure each analyzed portion contains full
execution of critical performance components, repeating this process across
multiple segments to maximize information coverage while maintaining temporal
coherence. Evaluated on the EgoExo4D benchmark with SkillFormer, PATS surpasses
the state-of-the-art accuracy across all viewing configurations (+0.65% to
+3.05%) and delivers substantial gains in challenging domains (+26.22%
bouldering, +2.39% music, +1.13% basketball). Systematic analysis reveals that
PATS successfully adapts to diverse activity characteristics-from
high-frequency sampling for dynamic sports to fine-grained segmentation for
sequential skills-demonstrating its effectiveness as an adaptive approach to
temporal sampling that advances automated skill assessment for real-world
applications.

### [204] [Beyond Cropped Regions: New Benchmark and Corresponding Baseline for Chinese Scene Text Retrieval in Diverse Layouts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04999)
*Gengluo Li,Huawen Shen,Yu Zhou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper targets challenging tasks in Chinese scene text retrieval by introducing a new benchmark (DL-CSVTR) and proposing a novel model (CSTR-CLIP) that drastically improves accuracy and speed.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the complexities of retrieving Chinese text from images, especially due to diverse text layouts, and to improve upon the underperforming solutions based on methods designed for English text retrieval.

Method: The authors propose CSTR-CLIP, a novel model that incorporates global visual features and multi-granularity alignment. The model is trained using a two-stage process tailored to handle diverse text layouts effectively.

Result: CSTR-CLIP outperforms the previous state-of-the-art model by 18.82% in accuracy and offers faster inference speeds.

Conclusion: The proposed model and benchmark significantly advance the performance in Chinese scene text retrieval, particularly in addressing challenges posed by diverse text layouts. The dataset and code availability aim to further research in this area.

Abstract: Chinese scene text retrieval is a practical task that aims to search for
images containing visual instances of a Chinese query text. This task is
extremely challenging because Chinese text often features complex and diverse
layouts in real-world scenes. Current efforts tend to inherit the solution for
English scene text retrieval, failing to achieve satisfactory performance. In
this paper, we establish a Diversified Layout benchmark for Chinese Street View
Text Retrieval (DL-CSVTR), which is specifically designed to evaluate retrieval
performance across various text layouts, including vertical, cross-line, and
partial alignments. To address the limitations in existing methods, we propose
Chinese Scene Text Retrieval CLIP (CSTR-CLIP), a novel model that integrates
global visual information with multi-granularity alignment training. CSTR-CLIP
applies a two-stage training process to overcome previous limitations, such as
the exclusion of visual features outside the text region and reliance on
single-granularity alignment, thereby enabling the model to effectively handle
diverse text layouts. Experiments on existing benchmark show that CSTR-CLIP
outperforms the previous state-of-the-art model by 18.82% accuracy and also
provides faster inference speed. Further analysis on DL-CSVTR confirms the
superior performance of CSTR-CLIP in handling various text layouts. The dataset
and code will be publicly available to facilitate research in Chinese scene
text retrieval.

*Fuyi Zhang,Zhu Yu,Chunhao Li,Runmin Zhang,Xiaokai Bai,Zili Zhou,Si-Yuan Cao,Wang Wang,Hui-Liang Shen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper discusses advances in monocular depth estimation using deep learning, focusing on structural improvements and challenges in unseen domain generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve the accuracy and generalization of monocular depth estimation, particularly addressing limitations in unseen domains.

Method: The authors explore and build upon prior techniques like multi-scale fusion networks, task redefinitions, and robust loss functions, while leveraging affine-invariant loss for multi-dataset training.

Result: Depth Anything shows excellent zero-shot performance in structural depth estimation but has limitations in predicting accurate metric depth.

Conclusion: While progress has been made in structural accuracy and handling unseen images, there is a need for approaches that better integrate explicit depth cues for metric prediction.

Abstract: Monocular depth estimation aims to determine the depth of each pixel from an
RGB image captured by a monocular camera. The development of deep learning has
significantly advanced this field by facilitating the learning of depth
features from some well-annotated datasets
\cite{Geiger_Lenz_Stiller_Urtasun_2013,silberman2012indoor}. Eigen \textit{et
al.} \cite{eigen2014depth} first introduce a multi-scale fusion network for
depth regression. Following this, subsequent improvements have come from
reinterpreting the regression task as a classification problem
\cite{bhat2021adabins,Li_Wang_Liu_Jiang_2022}, incorporating additional priors
\cite{shao2023nddepth,yang2023gedepth}, and developing more effective objective
function \cite{xian2020structure,Yin_Liu_Shen_Yan_2019}. Despite these
advances, generalizing to unseen domains remains a challenge. Recently, several
methods have employed affine-invariant loss to enable multi-dataset joint
training \cite{MiDaS,ZeroDepth,guizilini2023towards,Dany}. Among them, Depth
Anything \cite{Dany} has shown leading performance in zero-shot monocular depth
estimation. While it struggles to estimate accurate metric depth due to the
lack of explicit depth cues, it excels at extracting structural information
from unseen images, producing structure-detailed monocular depth.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a novel pipeline using 3D Gaussian Splatting and Gaussian Opacity Fields to generate synthetic data for 3D point cloud semantic segmentation tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Obtaining and annotating real-world point cloud datasets is costly and labor-intensive, hindering the efficiency of training segmentation models.

Method: The paper leverages 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) and Gaussian Opacity Fields (GOF) to create synthetic 3D assets of agricultural vehicles, which are then placed in simulated environments to generate LiDAR point clouds.

Result: Point Transformer V3 achieved an mIoU of 91.35% using synthetic data alone, and synthetic data occasionally outperformed real data for training segmentation models.

Conclusion: Synthetic data, when generated using the proposed pipeline, can effectively train segmentation models, demonstrating potential for real-world applications without relying on costly real-world datasets.

Abstract: Training neural networks for tasks such as 3D point cloud semantic
segmentation demands extensive datasets, yet obtaining and annotating
real-world point clouds is costly and labor-intensive. This work aims to
introduce a novel pipeline for generating realistic synthetic data, by
leveraging 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) and Gaussian Opacity Fields (GOF) to
generate 3D assets of multiple different agricultural vehicles instead of using
generic models. These assets are placed in a simulated environment, where the
point clouds are generated using a simulated LiDAR. This is a flexible approach
that allows changing the LiDAR specifications without incurring additional
costs. We evaluated the impact of synthetic data on segmentation models such as
PointNet++, Point Transformer V3, and OACNN, by training and validating the
models only on synthetic data. Remarkably, the PTv3 model had an mIoU of
91.35\%, a noteworthy result given that the model had neither been trained nor
validated on any real data. Further studies even suggested that in certain
scenarios the models trained only on synthetically generated data performed
better than models trained on real-world data. Finally, experiments
demonstrated that the models can generalize across semantic classes, enabling
accurate predictions on mesh models they were never trained on.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces UAV4D, a framework for photorealistic rendering of dynamic UAV-captured scenes with multiple moving pedestrians using monocular video data, resolving scene scale ambiguity via human-scene contact points.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods of dynamic neural rendering struggle with UAV-captured scenarios involving monocular setups, top-down views, and multiple moving humans, which existing datasets fail to represent adequately.

Method: The authors combine a 3D foundation model and a human mesh reconstruction model to reconstruct both the scene and humans. They resolve scene scale ambiguity using human-scene contact points and initialize Gaussian splats for rendering using the SMPL model and background mesh.

Result: The proposed approach shows a 1.5 dB PSNR improvement in novel view synthesis over existing methods while offering superior visual sharpness. It is evaluated on three UAV-captured datasets (VisDrone, Manipal-UAV, Okutama-Action) containing 10–50 humans in complex dynamic scenarios.

Conclusion: UAV4D effectively addresses the challenges of photorealistic rendering in monocular UAV-captured dynamic scenarios by innovating in scene reconstruction and scale ambiguity resolution, outperforming existing solutions.

Abstract: Despite significant advancements in dynamic neural rendering, existing
methods fail to address the unique challenges posed by UAV-captured scenarios,
particularly those involving monocular camera setups, top-down perspective, and
multiple small, moving humans, which are not adequately represented in existing
datasets. In this work, we introduce UAV4D, a framework for enabling
photorealistic rendering for dynamic real-world scenes captured by UAVs.
Specifically, we address the challenge of reconstructing dynamic scenes with
multiple moving pedestrians from monocular video data without the need for
additional sensors. We use a combination of a 3D foundation model and a human
mesh reconstruction model to reconstruct both the scene background and humans.
We propose a novel approach to resolve the scene scale ambiguity and place both
humans and the scene in world coordinates by identifying human-scene contact
points. Additionally, we exploit the SMPL model and background mesh to
initialize Gaussian splats, enabling holistic scene rendering. We evaluated our
method on three complex UAV-captured datasets: VisDrone, Manipal-UAV, and
Okutama-Action, each with distinct characteristics and 10~50 humans. Our
results demonstrate the benefits of our approach over existing methods in novel
view synthesis, achieving a 1.5 dB PSNR improvement and superior visual
sharpness.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a novel physical annotation system for training data in automated optical inspection. It uses pointer-based in-situ interaction to capture expert input directly on objects for ML training purposes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to create a more intuitive and efficient way to annotate training data for machine learning, leveraging human expertise in automated optical inspection to prevent loss of valuable training samples.

Method: The system employs calibrated, tracked pointers to record user interactions physically on objects. It transforms these interactions into standardized annotation formats and incorporates a projector-based interface for visual guidance.

Result: Preliminary evaluations confirm the system's feasibility for detailed trajectory capture and its compatibility with CVAT to streamline ML workflows.

Conclusion: The system bridges human expertise and ML pipelines, enabling non-IT experts to contribute meaningfully to training data generation, which enhances the efficiency and accuracy of automated optical inspection processes.

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel physical annotation system designed to generate
training data for automated optical inspection. The system uses pointer-based
in-situ interaction to transfer the valuable expertise of trained inspection
personnel directly into a machine learning (ML) training pipeline. Unlike
conventional screen-based annotation methods, our system captures physical
trajectories and contours directly on the object, providing a more intuitive
and efficient way to label data. The core technology uses calibrated, tracked
pointers to accurately record user input and transform these spatial
interactions into standardised annotation formats that are compatible with
open-source annotation software. Additionally, a simple projector-based
interface projects visual guidance onto the object to assist users during the
annotation process, ensuring greater accuracy and consistency. The proposed
concept bridges the gap between human expertise and automated data generation,
enabling non-IT experts to contribute to the ML training pipeline and
preventing the loss of valuable training samples. Preliminary evaluation
results confirm the feasibility of capturing detailed annotation trajectories
and demonstrate that integration with CVAT streamlines the workflow for
subsequent ML tasks. This paper details the system architecture, calibration
procedures and interface design, and discusses its potential contribution to
future ML data generation for automated optical inspection.

*Guangzhao Li,Yanming Yang,Chenxi Song,Chi Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FlowDirector introduces a framework for text-driven video editing that overcomes temporal inconsistencies and structural fidelity issues using a novel inversion-free approach.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improve temporal consistency and structural fidelity in text-driven video editing, addressing issues in current inversion-based diffusion model techniques.

Method: A novel, inversion-free framework using an Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE) for spatiotemporal transitions, attention-guided masking for localized edits, and guidance-enhanced editing for semantic alignment.

Result: FlowDirector achieves state-of-the-art performance in instruction adherence, temporal consistency, and background preservation across benchmarks.

Conclusion: FlowDirector offers an efficient, consistent, and structurally faithful method for video editing, marking a significant shift towards inversion-free approaches.

Abstract: Text-driven video editing aims to modify video content according to natural
language instructions. While recent training-free approaches have made progress
by leveraging pre-trained diffusion models, they typically rely on
inversion-based techniques that map input videos into the latent space, which
often leads to temporal inconsistencies and degraded structural fidelity. To
address this, we propose FlowDirector, a novel inversion-free video editing
framework. Our framework models the editing process as a direct evolution in
data space, guiding the video via an Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE) to
smoothly transition along its inherent spatiotemporal manifold, thereby
preserving temporal coherence and structural details. To achieve localized and
controllable edits, we introduce an attention-guided masking mechanism that
modulates the ODE velocity field, preserving non-target regions both spatially
and temporally. Furthermore, to address incomplete edits and enhance semantic
alignment with editing instructions, we present a guidance-enhanced editing
strategy inspired by Classifier-Free Guidance, which leverages differential
signals between multiple candidate flows to steer the editing trajectory toward
stronger semantic alignment without compromising structural consistency.
Extensive experiments across benchmarks demonstrate that FlowDirector achieves
state-of-the-art performance in instruction adherence, temporal consistency,
and background preservation, establishing a new paradigm for efficient and
coherent video editing without inversion.

Method: The paper surveys existing Vietnamese DAR techniques, analyzes limitations, and explores the application of LLMs and multimodal approaches.

Result: The study identifies the potential of LLMs in enhancing Vietnamese DAR but emphasizes the need to tackle issues like domain adaptation and multimodal learning.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that addressing challenges like dataset scarcity and computational efficiency, while leveraging advanced models and community-driven initiatives, can significantly advance Vietnamese DAR.

Abstract: Vietnamese document analysis and recognition (DAR) is a crucial field with
applications in digitization, information retrieval, and automation. Despite
advancements in OCR and NLP, Vietnamese text recognition faces unique
challenges due to its complex diacritics, tonal variations, and lack of
large-scale annotated datasets. Traditional OCR methods often struggle with
real-world document variations, while deep learning approaches have shown
promise but remain limited by data scarcity and generalization issues.
Recently, large language models (LLMs) and vision-language models have
demonstrated remarkable improvements in text recognition and document
understanding, offering a new direction for Vietnamese DAR. However, challenges
such as domain adaptation, multimodal learning, and computational efficiency
persist. This survey provide a comprehensive review of existing techniques in
Vietnamese document recognition, highlights key limitations, and explores how
LLMs can revolutionize the field. We discuss future research directions,
including dataset development, model optimization, and the integration of
multimodal approaches for improved document intelligence. By addressing these
gaps, we aim to foster advancements in Vietnamese DAR and encourage
community-driven solutions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address shortcomings in previous versions of image-editing software, including edit instruction following and image content preservation on real images.

Method: Enhanced data curation pipeline using meta-info embedding, joint learning pipeline combining diffusion and reward losses, and testing benchmarks for evaluation.

Result: SeedEdit 3.0 outperforms earlier models, achieving a usability rate of 56.1%, higher than competing models like SeedEdit 1.6 (38.4%), GPT4o (37.1%), and Gemini 2.0 (30.3%).

Conclusion: SeedEdit 3.0 sets a new standard for image editing with superior performance and usability, supported by innovative data curation and learning strategies.

Abstract: We introduce SeedEdit 3.0, in companion with our T2I model Seedream 3.0 [22],
which significantly improves over our previous version [27] in both aspects of
edit instruction following and image content (e.g., ID/IP) preservation on real
image inputs. Additional to model upgrading with T2I, in this report, we
present several key improvements. First, we develop an enhanced data curation
pipeline with a meta-info paradigm and meta-info embedding strategy that help
mix images from multiple data sources. This allows us to scale editing data
effectively, and meta information is helpfult to connect VLM with diffusion
model more closely. Second, we introduce a joint learning pipeline for
computing a diffusion loss and a reward loss. Finally, we evaluate SeedEdit 3.0
on our testing benchmarks, for real image editing, where it achieves a best
trade-off between multiple aspects, yielding a high usability rate of 56.1%,
compared to SeedEdit 1.6 (38.4%), GPT4o (37.1%) and Gemini 2.0 (30.3%).

TL;DR: The paper introduces a Multimodal Street Evaluation Framework (MSEF) combining visual and language models to evaluate streetscapes both objectively and subjectively, validated with data from Harbin, China.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Objective metrics fail to capture subjective perceptions essential to inclusive urban design.

Method: The researchers fused a vision transformer (VisualGLM-6B) with a large language model (GPT-4), fine-tuned with LoRA and P-Tuning v2, using 15,000 annotated images from Harbin, China.

Result: The model achieved an F1 score of 0.84 for objective features and 89.3% agreement with resident perceptions, while identifying context-dependent contradictions and semantic patterns.

Conclusion: MSEF bridges sensory data with socio-affective inference, offering methodological innovation for urban perception modeling and utility for urban planning systems.

Abstract: While objective street metrics derived from imagery or GIS have become
standard in urban analytics, they remain insufficient to capture subjective
perceptions essential to inclusive urban design. This study introduces a novel
Multimodal Street Evaluation Framework (MSEF) that fuses a vision transformer
(VisualGLM-6B) with a large language model (GPT-4), enabling interpretable
dual-output assessment of streetscapes. Leveraging over 15,000 annotated
street-view images from Harbin, China, we fine-tune the framework using LoRA
and P-Tuning v2 for parameter-efficient adaptation. The model achieves an F1
score of 0.84 on objective features and 89.3 percent agreement with aggregated
resident perceptions, validated across stratified socioeconomic geographies.
Beyond classification accuracy, MSEF captures context-dependent contradictions:
for instance, informal commerce boosts perceived vibrancy while simultaneously
reducing pedestrian comfort. It also identifies nonlinear and semantically
contingent patterns -- such as the divergent perceptual effects of
architectural transparency across residential and commercial zones -- revealing
the limits of universal spatial heuristics. By generating natural-language
rationales grounded in attention mechanisms, the framework bridges sensory data
with socio-affective inference, enabling transparent diagnostics aligned with
SDG 11. This work offers both methodological innovation in urban perception
modeling and practical utility for planning systems seeking to reconcile
infrastructural precision with lived experience.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ASTRAEA is a framework designed to accelerate video diffusion transformer (vDiT) models for text-to-video generation. By optimizing token selection and attention mechanisms, it significantly improves computational efficiency with minimal video quality compromise.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the computational challenges posed by video diffusion transformers, which hinder their practical deployment despite their effectiveness in text-to-video generation.

Method: ASTRAEA employs lightweight token selection and a memory-efficient sparse attention strategy. It utilizes an evolutionary algorithm to optimize token reduction for different timesteps, ensuring efficient resource allocation.

Result: ASTRAEA achieves a 2.4x inference speedup on a single GPU and up to 13.2x speedup on 8 GPUs. Moreover, the framework ensures minimal video quality loss (<0.5% on VBench score) compared to baseline models.

Conclusion: ASTRAEA offers a significant improvement in the efficiency of vDiT-based video generation models, balancing computational speedup and generation quality, which facilitates their practical deployment.

Abstract: Video diffusion transformers (vDiTs) have made impressive progress in
text-to-video generation, but their high computational demands present major
challenges for practical deployment. While existing acceleration methods reduce
workload at various granularities, they often rely on heuristics, limiting
their applicability.
  We introduce ASTRAEA, an automatic framework that searches for near-optimal
configurations for vDiT-based video generation. At its core, ASTRAEA proposes a
lightweight token selection mechanism and a memory-efficient, GPU-parallel
sparse attention strategy, enabling linear reductions in execution time with
minimal impact on generation quality. To determine optimal token reduction for
different timesteps, we further design a search framework that leverages a
classic evolutionary algorithm to automatically determine the distribution of
the token budget effectively. Together, ASTRAEA achieves up to 2.4x inference
speedup on a single GPU with great scalability (up to 13.2x speedup on 8 GPUs)
while retaining better video quality compared to the state-of-the-art methods
(<0.5% loss on the VBench score compared to the baseline vDiT models).

*Revant Teotia,Candace Ross,Karen Ullrich,Sumit Chopra,Adriana Romero-Soriano,Melissa Hall,Matthew J. Muckley*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces DIM-CIM, a framework to measure diversity and generalization of text-to-image models, showing trade-offs and correlations between training data and model diversity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Evaluate and improve diversity representation and generalization in text-to-image models, which suffer from trade-offs between performance and attribute variety.

Method: Framework DIM-CIM measures diversity without requiring reference datasets. It assesses default-mode diversity and generalization capacity using the COCO-DIMCIM benchmark augmented by language model data.

Result: Scaling model parameters increases generalization but reduces diversity. DIMCIM reveals fine-grained limitations and identifies correlation between training data diversity and model performance.

Conclusion: DIM-CIM provides an adaptable and interpretable tool for evaluating and understanding the diversity and generalization performance of text-to-image models.

Abstract: Recent advances in text-to-image (T2I) models have achieved impressive
quality and consistency. However, this has come at the cost of representation
diversity. While automatic evaluation methods exist for benchmarking model
diversity, they either require reference image datasets or lack specificity
about the kind of diversity measured, limiting their adaptability and
interpretability. To address this gap, we introduce the Does-it/Can-it
framework, DIM-CIM, a reference-free measurement of default-mode diversity
("Does" the model generate images with expected attributes?) and generalization
capacity ("Can" the model generate diverse attributes for a particular
concept?). We construct the COCO-DIMCIM benchmark, which is seeded with COCO
concepts and captions and augmented by a large language model. With
COCO-DIMCIM, we find that widely-used models improve in generalization at the
cost of default-mode diversity when scaling from 1.5B to 8.1B parameters.
DIMCIM also identifies fine-grained failure cases, such as attributes that are
generated with generic prompts but are rarely generated when explicitly
requested. Finally, we use DIMCIM to evaluate the training data of a T2I model
and observe a correlation of 0.85 between diversity in training images and
default-mode diversity. Our work provides a flexible and interpretable
framework for assessing T2I model diversity and generalization, enabling a more
comprehensive understanding of model performance.

### [216] [Practical Manipulation Model for Robust Deepfake Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05119)
*Benedikt Hopf,Radu Timofte*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Practical Manipulation Model (PMM) to improve deepfake detection models' robustness and generality, specifically under non-ideal conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Non-ideal conditions significantly limit current deepfake detection models' performance, making them vulnerable and often unstable in real-world applications.

Method: The researchers developed the Practical Manipulation Model (PMM) by diversifying potential fake scenarios with Poisson blending, diverse masks, generator artifacts, and distractors, while enhancing image degradations during detector training.

Result: The model achieved a $3.51\%$ and $6.21\%$ improvement in AUC on DFDC and DFDCP datasets, respectively, outperforming the state-of-the-art LAA backbone. It also significantly increases robustness against degradations.

Conclusion: PMM successfully expands the range of detectable forgeries and ensures better robustness for real-world applications, representing a substantial step forward for deepfake detection.

Abstract: Modern deepfake detection models have achieved strong performance even on the
challenging cross-dataset task. However, detection performance under non-ideal
conditions remains very unstable, limiting success on some benchmark datasets
and making it easy to circumvent detection. Inspired by the move to a more
real-world degradation model in the area of image super-resolution, we have
developed a Practical Manipulation Model (PMM) that covers a larger set of
possible forgeries. We extend the space of pseudo-fakes by using Poisson
blending, more diverse masks, generator artifacts, and distractors.
Additionally, we improve the detectors' generality and robustness by adding
strong degradations to the training images. We demonstrate that these changes
not only significantly enhance the model's robustness to common image
degradations but also improve performance on standard benchmark datasets.
Specifically, we show clear increases of $3.51\%$ and $6.21\%$ AUC on the DFDC
and DFDCP datasets, respectively, over the s-o-t-a LAA backbone. Furthermore,
we highlight the lack of robustness in previous detectors and our improvements
in this regard. Code can be found at https://github.com/BenediktHopf/PMM

*Massimo Rizzoli,Simone Alghisi,Olha Khomyn,Gabriel Roccabruna,Seyed Mahed Mousavi,Giuseppe Riccardi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces CIVET, a framework to systematically evaluate Vision-Language Models (VLMs), finding that VLMs struggle with object properties, positional understanding, and relational comprehension compared to humans.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The research seeks to address the gap in understanding how well Vision-Language Models grasp the structure and semantics of visual scenes, focusing on their comprehension of object properties and relations.

Method: The study proposes and employs CIVET, a controlled framework for systematic evaluation of VLMs, using annotation-noise-free and unbiased stimuli to test their performance rigorously.

Result: The evaluation of five state-of-the-art VLMs reveals that they only accurately recognize basic object properties, depend on object positioning, and fail to understand object relations effectively. Human annotators significantly outperform these models.

Conclusion: Current VLMs possess limited capabilities in understanding scene structure and semantics, demonstrating a notable gap with human-level comprehension.

Abstract: While Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have achieved competitive performance in
various tasks, their comprehension of the underlying structure and semantics of
a scene remains understudied. To investigate the understanding of VLMs, we
study their capability regarding object properties and relations in a
controlled and interpretable manner. To this scope, we introduce CIVET, a novel
and extensible framework for systematiC evaluatIon Via controllEd sTimuli.
CIVET addresses the lack of standardized systematic evaluation for assessing
VLMs' understanding, enabling researchers to test hypotheses with statistical
rigor. With CIVET, we evaluate five state-of-the-art VLMs on exhaustive sets of
stimuli, free from annotation noise, dataset-specific biases, and uncontrolled
scene complexity. Our findings reveal that 1) current VLMs can accurately
recognize only a limited set of basic object properties; 2) their performance
heavily depends on the position of the object in the scene; 3) they struggle to
understand basic relations among objects. Furthermore, a comparative evaluation
with human annotators reveals that VLMs still fall short of achieving
human-level accuracy.

*Gabriele Magrini,Niccolò Marini,Federico Becattini,Lorenzo Berlincioni,Niccolò Biondi,Pietro Pala,Alberto Del Bimbo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Florence RGB-Event Drone dataset (FRED), combining RGB and event camera data for detecting, tracking, and forecasting drone trajectories under challenging scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional RGB cameras struggle with fast-moving drones, especially in poor lighting, while event cameras excel but lack specific benchmarks with fine temporal resolution or drone-specific motions.

Method: The authors created FRED, a multimodal dataset featuring over 7 hours of annotated data on drones. They used RGB and event cameras to capture data on 5 drone models in conditions like rain and adverse lighting.

Result: FRED provides a unique dataset with dense annotations for drones, aiding tasks such as detection, tracking, and trajectory forecasting, alongside robust evaluation protocols.

Conclusion: The dataset is expected to advance research in high-speed drone perception and multimodal spatiotemporal analysis.

Abstract: Small, fast, and lightweight drones present significant challenges for
traditional RGB cameras due to their limitations in capturing fast-moving
objects, especially under challenging lighting conditions. Event cameras offer
an ideal solution, providing high temporal definition and dynamic range, yet
existing benchmarks often lack fine temporal resolution or drone-specific
motion patterns, hindering progress in these areas. This paper introduces the
Florence RGB-Event Drone dataset (FRED), a novel multimodal dataset
specifically designed for drone detection, tracking, and trajectory
forecasting, combining RGB video and event streams. FRED features more than 7
hours of densely annotated drone trajectories, using 5 different drone models
and including challenging scenarios such as rain and adverse lighting
conditions. We provide detailed evaluation protocols and standard metrics for
each task, facilitating reproducible benchmarking. The authors hope FRED will
advance research in high-speed drone perception and multimodal spatiotemporal
understanding.

*Weicheng Gao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper explores using a non-neural network method for Through-the-Wall Radar (TWR) human activity recognition by leveraging physical interpretability and template-based approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The author believes the reliance on neural network models for TWR human activity recognition (HAR) has limited progress, and aims to revisit template-based methods which offer stronger physical interpretability and signal processing foundations.

Method: Instead of neural networks, the paper uses corner detection for target regions, a multiphase active contour model for micro-Doppler segmentation, and Mapper algorithm to calculate topological similarity for recognition.

Result: The proposed method achieved intelligent recognition comparable to neural network-based models, as demonstrated through numerical simulations and measured experiments.

Conclusion: The study validates that it is feasible to perform TWR HAR without neural networks by leveraging template-based models and traditional signal processing techniques, opening new perspectives in the field.

Abstract: After a few years of research in the field of through-the-wall radar (TWR)
human activity recognition (HAR), I found that we seem to be stuck in the
mindset of training on radar image data through neural network models. The
earliest related works in this field based on template matching did not require
a training process, and I believe they have never died. Because these methods
possess a strong physical interpretability and are closer to the basis of
theoretical signal processing research. In this paper, I would like to try to
return to the original path by attempting to eschew neural networks to achieve
the TWR HAR task and challenge to achieve intelligent recognition as neural
network models. In detail, the range-time map and Doppler-time map of TWR are
first generated. Then, the initial regions of the human target foreground and
noise background on the maps are determined using corner detection method, and
the micro-Doppler signature is segmented using the multiphase active contour
model. The micro-Doppler segmentation feature is discretized into a
two-dimensional point cloud. Finally, the topological similarity between the
resulting point cloud and the point clouds of the template data is calculated
using Mapper algorithm to obtain the recognition results. The effectiveness of
the proposed method is demonstrated by numerical simulated and measured
experiments. The open-source code of this work is released at:

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes the TAO framework for video anomaly detection, focusing on pixel-level tracking of anomalous objects rather than threshold-based methods, achieving better localization and accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for video anomaly detection focus on anomalous frames or objects, neglecting fine-grained detection like at pixel-level, limiting anomaly capture.

Method: The proposed TAO framework integrates fine-grained pixel-level anomaly detection using tracking, linking anomaly scores to tasks like segmentation and eliminating threshold tuning.

Result: Experiments show that TAO sets new benchmarks in both accuracy and robustness for video anomaly detection.

Conclusion: TAO provides a more precise and robust unified pipeline for video anomaly detection, particularly in complex video sequences, advancing the state of the art.

Abstract: Video anomaly detection (VAD) is crucial in scenarios such as surveillance
and autonomous driving, where timely detection of unexpected activities is
essential. Although existing methods have primarily focused on detecting
anomalous objects in videos -- either by identifying anomalous frames or
objects -- they often neglect finer-grained analysis, such as anomalous pixels,
which limits their ability to capture a broader range of anomalies. To address
this challenge, we propose a new framework called Track Any Anomalous Object
(TAO), which introduces a granular video anomaly detection pipeline that, for
the first time, integrates the detection of multiple fine-grained anomalous
objects into a unified framework. Unlike methods that assign anomaly scores to
every pixel, our approach transforms the problem into pixel-level tracking of
anomalous objects. By linking anomaly scores to downstream tasks such as
segmentation and tracking, our method removes the need for threshold tuning and
achieves more precise anomaly localization in long and complex video sequences.
Experiments demonstrate that TAO sets new benchmarks in accuracy and
robustness. Project page available online.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces TAPFM (Task Adaptation of Pathology Foundation Models), a novel method to adapt pretrained pathology models for specific clinical tasks like mutation prediction using single GPUs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Adapting pretrained pathology foundation models (PFMs) for specific clinical tasks is challenging due to the weak labels in gigapixel whole slide images (WSIs) and the reliance on computationally intensive multiple instance learning (MIL) methods.

Method: The paper proposes TAPFM, a vision-transformer-based MIL aggregation approach that optimizes feature representations and attention weights while maintaining separate computational graphs for stability in end-to-end adaptation.

Result: TAPFM outperforms conventional methods in mutation prediction tasks for bladder cancer and lung adenocarcinoma, showcasing superior multi-label classification performance across different datasets.

Conclusion: TAPFM is a practical solution for adapting PFMs using standard hardware, making it suitable for a wide range of clinical applications requiring WSI analysis.

Abstract: Pathology foundation models (PFMs) have emerged as powerful tools for
analyzing whole slide images (WSIs). However, adapting these pretrained PFMs
for specific clinical tasks presents considerable challenges, primarily due to
the availability of only weak (WSI-level) labels for gigapixel images,
necessitating multiple instance learning (MIL) paradigm for effective WSI
analysis. This paper proposes a novel approach for single-GPU \textbf{T}ask
\textbf{A}daptation of \textbf{PFM}s (TAPFM) that uses vision transformer
(\vit) attention for MIL aggregation while optimizing both for feature
representations and attention weights. The proposed approach maintains separate
computational graphs for MIL aggregator and the PFM to create stable training
dynamics that align with downstream task objectives during end-to-end
adaptation. Evaluated on mutation prediction tasks for bladder cancer and lung
adenocarcinoma across institutional and TCGA cohorts, TAPFM consistently
outperforms conventional approaches, with H-Optimus-0 (TAPFM) outperforming the
benchmarks. TAPFM effectively handles multi-label classification of actionable
mutations as well. Thus, TAPFM makes adaptation of powerful pre-trained PFMs
practical on standard hardware for various clinical applications.

*Yake Wei,Yu Miao,Dongzhan Zhou,Di Hu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces MokA, a multimodal-aware fine-tuning strategy addressing limitations in current multimodal learning methods by enhancing both unimodal and cross-modal adaptations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current efficient fine-tuning methods for multimodal large language models (MLLMs) fail to fully utilize all modalities because they are borrowed directly from unimodal models without considering multimodal-specific characteristics.

Method: The proposed method, Multimodal low-rank Adaptation (MokA), employs modality-specific parameters for compressing unimodal information while explicitly enhancing interactions across different modalities.

Result: Extensive experiments across various multimodal scenarios and multiple LLM architectures show consistent performance improvements, validating the robustness and versatility of MokA.

Conclusion: MokA offers a more targeted and effective solution for the efficient adaptation of MLLMs, enhancing both unimodal and cross-modal learning, thereby inspiring future research in the field.

Abstract: In this paper, we reveal that most current efficient multimodal fine-tuning
methods are hindered by a key limitation: they are directly borrowed from LLMs,
often neglecting the intrinsic differences of multimodal scenarios and even
affecting the full utilization of all modalities. Inspired by our empirical
observation, we argue that unimodal adaptation and cross-modal adaptation are
two essential parts for the effective fine-tuning of MLLMs. From this
perspective, we propose Multimodal low-rank Adaptation (MokA), a
multimodal-aware efficient fine-tuning strategy that takes multimodal
characteristics into consideration. It compresses unimodal information by
modality-specific parameters while explicitly enhancing cross-modal
interaction, ensuring both unimodal and cross-modal adaptation. Extensive
experiments cover three representative multimodal scenarios (audio-visual-text,
visual-text, and speech-text), and multiple LLM backbones (LLaMA2/3, Qwen2,
Qwen2.5-VL, etc). Consistent improvements indicate the efficacy and versatility
of the proposed method. Ablation studies and efficiency evaluation are also
conducted to fully asses our method. Overall, we think MokA provides a more
targeted solution for efficient adaptation of MLLMs, paving the way for further
exploration. The project page is at https://gewu-lab.github.io/MokA.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a vision-aided autonomous reflector system to improve mmWave communication in challenging environments by dynamically adjusting signal reflections using a motorized metallic plate.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improve the reliability of mmWave communication in NLoS conditions, particularly in urban or infrastructure-limited environments.

Method: Uses a monocular camera to detect ArUco markers, estimates the angles of arrival at transmitter and receiver nodes, and dynamically aligns a motorized metallic plate for optimal signal redirection.

Result: Achieved a 23 dB average gain in received signal strength and a 0.89 probability of maintaining signal reception above -65 dB threshold in indoor environments, outperforming static and no-reflector setups.

Conclusion: The system demonstrates strong potential for resilient and adaptive mmWave connectivity in complex environments without relying on external infrastructure.

Abstract: Reliable millimeter-wave (mmWave) communication in non-line-of-sight (NLoS)
conditions remains a major challenge for both military and civilian operations,
especially in urban or infrastructure-limited environments. This paper presents
a vision-aided autonomous reflector system designed to enhance mmWave link
performance by dynamically steering signal reflections using a motorized
metallic plate. The proposed system leverages a monocular camera to detect
ArUco markers on allied transmitter and receiver nodes, estimate their angles
of arrival, and align the reflector in real time for optimal signal
redirection. This approach enables selective beam coverage by serving only
authenticated targets with visible markers and reduces the risk of unintended
signal exposure. The designed prototype, built on a Raspberry Pi 4 and
low-power hardware, operates autonomously without reliance on external
infrastructure or GPS. Experimental results at 60\,GHz demonstrate a 23\,dB
average gain in received signal strength and an 0.89 probability of maintaining
signal reception above a target threshold of -65 dB in an indoor environment,
far exceeding the static and no-reflector baselines. These results demonstrate
the system's potential for resilient and adaptive mmWave connectivity in
complex and dynamic environments.

*Yuxin Wen,Yangsibo Huang,Tom Goldstein,Ravi Kumar,Badih Ghazi,Chiyuan Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper investigates how neural networks memorize across modalities, focusing on vision-language models, revealing gaps in cross-modal knowledge transfer and proposing a mitigation baseline.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand neural network memorization mechanisms, addressing both unintended data exposure and knowledge acquisition issues, particularly in multimodal setups.

Method: Introduced a synthetic persona dataset with diverse pairs of images and textual descriptions; trained and evaluated vision-language models on their ability to transfer knowledge between modalities.

Result: Found that knowledge learned in one modality is transferred to the other, but with a significant performance gap; this issue persists across various scenarios including advanced models and machine unlearning.

Conclusion: Proposed a baseline approach to address the gap in cross-modal transferability and aim to encourage more research into robust multimodal learning methods.

Abstract: Understanding what and how neural networks memorize during training is
crucial, both from the perspective of unintentional memorization of potentially
sensitive information and from the standpoint of effective knowledge
acquisition for real-world, knowledge-intensive tasks. While previous studies
primarily investigate memorization within a single modality, such as text
memorization in large language models or image memorization in diffusion
models, unified multimodal models are becoming increasingly prevalent in
practical applications. In this work, we focus on the unique characteristics of
cross-modality memorization and conduct a systematic study centered on
vision-language models. To facilitate controlled experiments, we first
introduce a synthetic persona dataset comprising diverse synthetic person
images and textual descriptions. We quantify factual knowledge memorization and
cross-modal transferability by training models on a single modality and
evaluating their performance in the other. Our results reveal that facts
learned in one modality transfer to the other, but a significant gap exists
between recalling information in the source and target modalities. Furthermore,
we observe that this gap exists across various scenarios, including more
capable models, machine unlearning, and the multi-hop case. At the end, we
propose a baseline method to mitigate this challenge. We hope our study can
inspire future research on developing more robust multimodal learning
techniques to enhance cross-modal transferability.

*Yani Zhang,Dongming Wu,Hao Shi,Yingfei Liu,Tiancai Wang,Haoqiang Fan,Xingping Dong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The study investigates whether detection models alone suffice for embodied 3D grounding and proposes DEGround, an enhanced framework for better object localization based on human instructions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to explore whether existing detection models sufficiently aid embodied 3D grounding and to address potential shortcomings in current methods.

Method: The paper introduces DEGround, which uses shared DETR queries for detection and grounding tasks. It also includes modules for regional activation and query-wise modulation to improve context-aware understanding of instructions.

Result: DEGround achieves a 7.52% improvement in overall accuracy on the EmbodiedScan validation set compared to the state-of-the-art model BIP3D.

Conclusion: Detection models alone are insufficient for fine-grained and context-aware embodied 3D grounding. DEGround effectively bridges this gap by integrating detection, grounding, and context understanding in a unified framework, setting a new state of the art.

Abstract: Embodied 3D grounding aims to localize target objects described in human
instructions from ego-centric viewpoint. Most methods typically follow a
two-stage paradigm where a trained 3D detector's optimized backbone parameters
are used to initialize a grounding model. In this study, we explore a
fundamental question: Does embodied 3D grounding benefit enough from detection?
To answer this question, we assess the grounding performance of detection
models using predicted boxes filtered by the target category. Surprisingly,
these detection models without any instruction-specific training outperform the
grounding models explicitly trained with language instructions. This indicates
that even category-level embodied 3D grounding may not be well resolved, let
alone more fine-grained context-aware grounding. Motivated by this finding, we
propose DEGround, which shares DETR queries as object representation for both
DEtection and Grounding and enables the grounding to benefit from basic
category classification and box detection. Based on this framework, we further
introduce a regional activation grounding module that highlights
instruction-related regions and a query-wise modulation module that
incorporates sentence-level semantic into the query representation,
strengthening the context-aware understanding of language instructions.
Remarkably, DEGround outperforms state-of-the-art model BIP3D by 7.52\% at
overall accuracy on the EmbodiedScan validation set. The source code will be
publicly available at https://github.com/zyn213/DEGround.

*Yanbo Wang,Ziyi Wang,Wenzhao Zheng,Jie Zhou,Jiwen Lu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces OGGSplat, a novel method for reconstructing semantic-aware 3D scenes using sparse views, significantly expanding the field-of-view and improving the semantic and visual coherence of the reconstruction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the challenges of reconstructing 3D scenes from sparse views in emerging applications such as VR and embodied AI, where existing methods either require dense input or fail to generalize effectively.

Method: OGGSplat uses an open Gaussian growing technique combined with a bidirectional RGB-semantic inpainting module, leveraging diffusion models for improved semantic and visual extrapolation.

Result: The method is validated through a newly established Gaussian Outpainting (GO) benchmark, demonstrating superior semantic-aware reconstruction quality using even minimal input, such as two smartphone-captured images.

Conclusion: OGGSplat effectively addresses the limitations of sparse-view 3D reconstruction by harnessing semantic-aware inpainting and open Gaussian parameters, enabling practical and efficient 3D scene generation for real-world applications.

Abstract: Reconstructing semantic-aware 3D scenes from sparse views is a challenging
yet essential research direction, driven by the demands of emerging
applications such as virtual reality and embodied AI. Existing per-scene
optimization methods require dense input views and incur high computational
costs, while generalizable approaches often struggle to reconstruct regions
outside the input view cone. In this paper, we propose OGGSplat, an open
Gaussian growing method that expands the field-of-view in generalizable 3D
reconstruction. Our key insight is that the semantic attributes of open
Gaussians provide strong priors for image extrapolation, enabling both semantic
consistency and visual plausibility. Specifically, once open Gaussians are
initialized from sparse views, we introduce an RGB-semantic consistent
inpainting module applied to selected rendered views. This module enforces
bidirectional control between an image diffusion model and a semantic diffusion
model. The inpainted regions are then lifted back into 3D space for efficient
and progressive Gaussian parameter optimization. To evaluate our method, we
establish a Gaussian Outpainting (GO) benchmark that assesses both semantic and
generative quality of reconstructed open-vocabulary scenes. OGGSplat also
demonstrates promising semantic-aware scene reconstruction capabilities when
provided with two view images captured directly from a smartphone camera.

TL;DR: The paper introduces Follow-Your-Motion, a two-stage video motion transfer framework addressing motion inconsistency and inefficiency issues in video diffusion transformers through spatial-temporal decoupled LoRA and adaptive mechanisms, validated on a new benchmark called MotionBench.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current motion-transfer methods using video diffusion transformers face challenges of motion inconsistency and inefficiency due to spatial-temporal coupling and time-consuming tuning.

Method: Follow-Your-Motion utilizes a spatial-temporal decoupled LoRA for attention architecture separation, sparse motion sampling, and adaptive RoPE mechanisms to improve tuning speed and motion consistency.

Result: The proposed approach demonstrated effectiveness in synthesizing complex motions and showed superior performance in evaluations using MotionBench, a newly introduced benchmark.

Conclusion: Follow-Your-Motion offers a more efficient and consistent motion transfer approach, providing a significant advancement validated by diverse motion benchmarks.

Abstract: Recently, breakthroughs in the video diffusion transformer have shown
remarkable capabilities in diverse motion generations. As for the
motion-transfer task, current methods mainly use two-stage Low-Rank Adaptations
(LoRAs) finetuning to obtain better performance. However, existing
adaptation-based motion transfer still suffers from motion inconsistency and
tuning inefficiency when applied to large video diffusion transformers. Naive
two-stage LoRA tuning struggles to maintain motion consistency between
generated and input videos due to the inherent spatial-temporal coupling in the
3D attention operator. Additionally, they require time-consuming fine-tuning
processes in both stages. To tackle these issues, we propose
Follow-Your-Motion, an efficient two-stage video motion transfer framework that
finetunes a powerful video diffusion transformer to synthesize complex
motion.Specifically, we propose a spatial-temporal decoupled LoRA to decouple
the attention architecture for spatial appearance and temporal motion
processing. During the second training stage, we design the sparse motion
sampling and adaptive RoPE to accelerate the tuning speed. To address the lack
of a benchmark for this field, we introduce MotionBench, a comprehensive
benchmark comprising diverse motion, including creative camera motion, single
object motion, multiple object motion, and complex human motion. We show
extensive evaluations on MotionBench to verify the superiority of
Follow-Your-Motion.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces DSG-World, an end-to-end framework for building efficient and consistent 3D world models from dual state observations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation stems from limitations in existing methods—generative models being hard to train and lacking 3D coherence, and explicit 3D methods requiring complex multi-stage processes.

Method: The approach leverages dual observations of a scene to address occlusions, builds segmentation-aware Gaussian fields, enforces photometric and semantic consistency, and uses strategies for refining geometric completeness.

Result: DSG-World achieves high-fidelity simulation, effective rendering, and object-level scene manipulation with robust generalization to novel views and states.

Conclusion: The method enables efficient, physically-consistent 3D reconstruction using a dual observation approach without multi-stage processing, proving its applicability in real-world contexts.

Abstract: Building an efficient and physically consistent world model from limited
observations is a long standing challenge in vision and robotics. Many existing
world modeling pipelines are based on implicit generative models, which are
hard to train and often lack 3D or physical consistency. On the other hand,
explicit 3D methods built from a single state often require multi-stage
processing-such as segmentation, background completion, and inpainting-due to
occlusions. To address this, we leverage two perturbed observations of the same
scene under different object configurations. These dual states offer
complementary visibility, alleviating occlusion issues during state transitions
and enabling more stable and complete reconstruction. In this paper, we present
DSG-World, a novel end-to-end framework that explicitly constructs a 3D
Gaussian World model from Dual State observations. Our approach builds dual
segmentation-aware Gaussian fields and enforces bidirectional photometric and
semantic consistency. We further introduce a pseudo intermediate state for
symmetric alignment and design collaborative co-pruning trategies to refine
geometric completeness. DSG-World enables efficient real-to-simulation transfer
purely in the explicit Gaussian representation space, supporting high-fidelity
rendering and object-level scene manipulation without relying on dense
observations or multi-stage pipelines. Extensive experiments demonstrate strong
generalization to novel views and scene states, highlighting the effectiveness
of our approach for real-world 3D reconstruction and simulation.

*Zhang Li,Yuliang Liu,Qiang Liu,Zhiyin Ma,Ziyang Zhang,Shuo Zhang,Zidun Guo,Jiarui Zhang,Xinyu Wang,Xiang Bai*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces MonkeyOCR, a vision-language model for document parsing that outperforms existing methods by adopting a Structure-Recognition-Relation (SRR) paradigm. It is faster, more efficient, and achieves state-of-the-art performance using a newly introduced dataset, MonkeyDoc.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address inefficiencies in existing document parsing pipelines that rely on modular approaches (e.g., MinerU) or large end-to-end models (e.g., Qwen-VL). Their goal is to strike a balance between accuracy, speed, and scalability with a more streamlined and effective method.

Method: The authors propose the SRR triplet paradigm for document parsing, which decomposes tasks into three questions: "Where is it?" (layout analysis), "What is it?" (content recognition), and "How is it organized?" (logical relation). They also introduce a comprehensive dataset, MonkeyDoc, for training and evaluation.

Result: Experiments show MonkeyOCR outperforms MinerU by 5.1% on average and achieves significant performance gains on complex content like formulas (+15%) and tables (+8.6%). It also surpasses larger models like Qwen2.5-VL and Gemini 2.5 Pro in English document parsing while processing documents faster and being hardware-efficient.

Conclusion: MonkeyOCR demonstrates a novel and effective approach to document parsing, combining precision, speed, and scalability. Its performance and efficiency make it a viable solution for real-world applications, and its dataset and models are publicly available for further research.

Abstract: We introduce MonkeyOCR, a vision-language model for document parsing that
advances the state of the art by leveraging a Structure-Recognition-Relation
(SRR) triplet paradigm. This design simplifies what would otherwise be a
complex multi-tool pipeline (as in MinerU's modular approach) and avoids the
inefficiencies of processing full pages with giant end-to-end models (e.g.,
large multimodal LLMs like Qwen-VL). In SRR, document parsing is abstracted
into three fundamental questions - "Where is it?" (structure), "What is it?"
(recognition), and "How is it organized?" (relation) - corresponding to layout
analysis, content identification, and logical ordering. This focused
decomposition balances accuracy and speed: it enables efficient, scalable
processing without sacrificing precision. To train and evaluate this approach,
we introduce the MonkeyDoc (the most comprehensive document parsing dataset to
date), with 3.9 million instances spanning over ten document types in both
Chinese and English. Experiments show that MonkeyOCR outperforms MinerU by an
average of 5.1%, with particularly notable improvements on challenging content
such as formulas (+15.0%) and tables (+8.6%). Remarkably, our 3B-parameter
model surpasses much larger and top-performing models, including Qwen2.5-VL
(72B) and Gemini 2.5 Pro, achieving state-of-the-art average performance on
English document parsing tasks. In addition, MonkeyOCR processes multi-page
documents significantly faster (0.84 pages per second compared to 0.65 for
MinerU and 0.12 for Qwen2.5-VL-7B). The 3B model can be efficiently deployed
for inference on a single NVIDIA 3090 GPU. Code and models will be released at

### [231] [SAM-aware Test-time Adaptation for Universal Medical Image Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05221)
*Jianghao Wu,Yicheng Wu,Yutong Xie,Wenjia Bai,You Zhang,Feilong Tang,Yulong Li,Yasmeen George,Imran Razzak*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces SAM-TTA, a test-time adaptation framework designed to enhance SAM's segmentation performance for medical images while preserving its generalization capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limited adaptability of SAM to the medical imaging domain and improve its segmentation performance without sacrificing generalization to unseen data.

Method: The SAM-TTA pipeline incorporates SBCT to transform single-channel medical images into SAM-compatible inputs and DUMT for consistency learning to align SAM's representations to medical semantics.

Result: Experiments on five public datasets confirm that SAM-TTA surpasses existing test-time adaptation methods and even outperforms fully fine-tuned models like MedSAM in some instances.

Conclusion: SAM-TTA successfully enhances SAM's utility in medical image segmentation, establishing a new approach while maintaining the model's universality and adaptability to unseen scenarios.

Abstract: Universal medical image segmentation using the Segment Anything Model (SAM)
remains challenging due to its limited adaptability to medical domains.
Existing adaptations, such as MedSAM, enhance SAM's performance in medical
imaging but at the cost of reduced generalization to unseen data. Therefore, in
this paper, we propose SAM-aware Test-Time Adaptation (SAM-TTA), a
fundamentally different pipeline that preserves the generalization of SAM while
improving its segmentation performance in medical imaging via a test-time
framework. SAM-TTA tackles two key challenges: (1) input-level discrepancies
caused by differences in image acquisition between natural and medical images
and (2) semantic-level discrepancies due to fundamental differences in object
definition between natural and medical domains (e.g., clear boundaries vs.
ambiguous structures). Specifically, our SAM-TTA framework comprises (1)
Self-adaptive Bezier Curve-based Transformation (SBCT), which adaptively
converts single-channel medical images into three-channel SAM-compatible inputs
while maintaining structural integrity, to mitigate the input gap between
medical and natural images, and (2) Dual-scale Uncertainty-driven Mean Teacher
adaptation (DUMT), which employs consistency learning to align SAM's internal
representations to medical semantics, enabling efficient adaptation without
auxiliary supervision or expensive retraining. Extensive experiments on five
public datasets demonstrate that our SAM-TTA outperforms existing TTA
approaches and even surpasses fully fine-tuned models such as MedSAM in certain
scenarios, establishing a new paradigm for universal medical image
segmentation. Code can be found at https://github.com/JianghaoWu/SAM-TTA.

### [232] [LeanPO: Lean Preference Optimization for Likelihood Alignment in Video-LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05260)
*Xiaodong Wang,Jinfa Huang,Li Yuan,Peixi Peng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper identifies a training issue in current Video-LLMs, proposes a new Lean Preference Optimization (LeanPO) approach to address it, and demonstrates its effectiveness in improving robustness and performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current Video-LLMs face a phenomenon where the probability of non-target responses increases during preference alignment training, particularly due to the complexity of video content.

Method: The authors propose LeanPO, a reference-free approach that redefines reward as the average likelihood of responses. LeanPO uses a self-generated preference data pipeline, infusing prior knowledge and refining data through self-reflection. Additionally, a dynamic label smoothing strategy is introduced to handle noise in video content.

Result: LeanPO was shown to significantly improve the performance of state-of-the-art Video-LLMs across various benchmarks with minimal additional training effort.

Conclusion: The paper provides a reliable and efficient method to align Video-LLM preferences with human trustworthiness, indicating its potential for creating robust and efficient Video-LLMs in the future.

Abstract: Most Video Large Language Models (Video-LLMs) adopt preference alignment
techniques, e.g., DPO~\citep{rafailov2024dpo}, to optimize the reward margin
between a winning response ($y_w$) and a losing response ($y_l$). However, the
likelihood displacement observed in DPO indicates that both $\log \pi_\theta
(y_w\mid x)$ and $\log \pi_\theta (y_l\mid x) $ often decrease during training,
inadvertently boosting the probabilities of non-target responses. In this
paper, we systematically revisit this phenomenon from LLMs to Video-LLMs,
showing that it intensifies when dealing with the redundant complexity of video
content. To alleviate the impact of this phenomenon, we propose \emph{Lean
Preference Optimization} (LeanPO), a reference-free approach that reformulates
the implicit reward as the average likelihood of the response with respect to
the policy model. A key component of LeanPO is the reward-trustworthiness
correlated self-generated preference data pipeline, which carefully infuses
relevant prior knowledge into the model while continuously refining the
preference data via self-reflection. This allows the policy model to obtain
high-quality paired data and accurately estimate the newly defined reward, thus
mitigating the unintended drop. In addition, we introduce a dynamic label
smoothing strategy that mitigates the impact of noise in responses from diverse
video content, preventing the model from overfitting to spurious details.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that LeanPO significantly enhances the
performance of state-of-the-art Video-LLMs, consistently boosting baselines of
varying capacities with minimal additional training overhead. Moreover, LeanPO
offers a simple yet effective solution for aligning Video-LLM preferences with
human trustworthiness, paving the way toward the reliable and efficient
Video-LLMs.

### [233] [Can Foundation Models Generalise the Presentation Attack Detection Capabilities on ID Cards?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05263)
*Juan E. Tapia,Christoph Busch*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper addresses the issue of poor generalization in presentation attack detection (PAD) systems for ID cards and explores how Foundation Models (FM) can enhance these capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to tackle the challenge of PAD systems failing to generalize effectively across ID cards from diverse countries, mainly due to limited training data caused by privacy constraints.

Method: The authors used Foundation Models trained on large datasets and experimented with different test protocols, including zero-shot and fine-tuning approaches, using two datasets: a private dataset of Chilean IDs and an open-set dataset with IDs from Finland, Spain, and Slovakia.

Result: Results highlight that the use of bona fide images plays a crucial role in achieving better generalization in PAD for ID cards.

Conclusion: Foundation Models can significantly improve the generalization of PAD systems for ID documents from multiple countries, with bona fide images being critical for success.

Abstract: Nowadays, one of the main challenges in presentation attack detection (PAD)
on ID cards is obtaining generalisation capabilities for a diversity of
countries that are issuing ID cards. Most PAD systems are trained on one, two,
or three ID documents because of privacy protection concerns. As a result, they
do not obtain competitive results for commercial purposes when tested in an
unknown new ID card country. In this scenario, Foundation Models (FM) trained
on huge datasets can help to improve generalisation capabilities. This work
intends to improve and benchmark the capabilities of FM and how to use them to
adapt the generalisation on PAD of ID Documents. Different test protocols were
used, considering zero-shot and fine-tuning and two different ID card datasets.
One private dataset based on Chilean IDs and one open-set based on three ID
countries: Finland, Spain, and Slovakia. Our findings indicate that bona fide
images are the key to generalisation.

### [234] [From Play to Replay: Composed Video Retrieval for Temporally Fine-Grained Videos](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05274)
*Animesh Gupta,Jay Parmar,Ishan Rajendrakumar Dave,Mubarak Shah*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces TF-CoVR, a benchmark for temporally fine-grained composed video retrieval (CoVR) focused on sports events. It also proposes a two-stage model, TF-CoVR-Base, for improving retrieval accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing CoVR benchmarks fail to adequately assess subtle and fast-paced temporal differences in videos, limiting their practicality for real-world tasks like sports analysis or highlight generation.

Method: TF-CoVR, the proposed benchmark, uses large-scale datasets and incorporates label differences processed by a large language model (LLM). The two-stage TF-CoVR-Base model involves pre-training a video encoder for fine-grained action classification and aligning queries with candidate videos using contrastive learning.

Result: TF-CoVR-Base achieves significant performance improvements in temporally fine-grained video retrieval, increasing zero-shot mAP@50 from 5.92 to 7.51, and fine-tuned performance from 19.83 to 25.82.

Conclusion: The work provides a new, practical benchmark for CoVR and demonstrates improved performance through a novel two-stage model, advancing the state-of-the-art in fine-grained temporal video retrieval.

Abstract: Composed Video Retrieval (CoVR) retrieves a target video given a query video
and a modification text describing the intended change. Existing CoVR
benchmarks emphasize appearance shifts or coarse event changes and therefore do
not test the ability to capture subtle, fast-paced temporal differences. We
introduce TF-CoVR, the first large-scale benchmark dedicated to temporally
fine-grained CoVR. TF-CoVR focuses on gymnastics and diving and provides 180K
triplets drawn from FineGym and FineDiving. Previous CoVR benchmarks focusing
on temporal aspect, link each query to a single target segment taken from the
same video, limiting practical usefulness. In TF-CoVR, we instead construct
each <query, modification> pair by prompting an LLM with the label differences
between clips drawn from different videos; every pair is thus associated with
multiple valid target videos (3.9 on average), reflecting real-world tasks such
as sports-highlight generation. To model these temporal dynamics we propose
TF-CoVR-Base, a concise two-stage training framework: (i) pre-train a video
encoder on fine-grained action classification to obtain temporally
discriminative embeddings; (ii) align the composed query with candidate videos
using contrastive learning. We conduct the first comprehensive study of image,
video, and general multimodal embedding (GME) models on temporally fine-grained
composed retrieval in both zero-shot and fine-tuning regimes. On TF-CoVR,
TF-CoVR-Base improves zero-shot mAP@50 from 5.92 (LanguageBind) to 7.51, and
after fine-tuning raises the state-of-the-art from 19.83 to 25.82.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a multi-scale bilateral grid to enhance neural rendering techniques like NeRF and GS in environments with photometric inconsistencies, yielding better geometry for autonomous driving.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing neural rendering techniques struggle with photometric inconsistencies in real-world data, affecting their ability to produce accurate reconstructions. This is especially critical in applications like autonomous driving, where precise geometry is essential.

Method: The authors propose a novel multi-scale bilateral grid that combines appearance codes and bilateral grids to address photometric inconsistencies. The approach is designed to improve pixel-wise color mapping and geometric reconstruction in dynamic scenes.

Result: The proposed method outperforms standard appearance codes and bilateral grids, achieving higher geometric accuracy on four datasets: Waymo, NuScenes, Argoverse, and PandaSet.

Conclusion: The incorporation of the multi-scale bilateral grid effectively mitigates floaters caused by photometric inconsistencies and achieves superior geometric reconstruction, demonstrating critical benefits for autonomous driving scenarios.

Abstract: Neural rendering techniques, including NeRF and Gaussian Splatting (GS), rely
on photometric consistency to produce high-quality reconstructions. However, in
real-world scenarios, it is challenging to guarantee perfect photometric
consistency in acquired images. Appearance codes have been widely used to
address this issue, but their modeling capability is limited, as a single code
is applied to the entire image. Recently, the bilateral grid was introduced to
perform pixel-wise color mapping, but it is difficult to optimize and constrain
effectively. In this paper, we propose a novel multi-scale bilateral grid that
unifies appearance codes and bilateral grids. We demonstrate that this approach
significantly improves geometric accuracy in dynamic, decoupled autonomous
driving scene reconstruction, outperforming both appearance codes and bilateral
grids. This is crucial for autonomous driving, where accurate geometry is
important for obstacle avoidance and control. Our method shows strong results
across four datasets: Waymo, NuScenes, Argoverse, and PandaSet. We further
demonstrate that the improvement in geometry is driven by the multi-scale
bilateral grid, which effectively reduces floaters caused by photometric
inconsistency.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a framework to improve long-term consistency in video world models using a geometry-grounded long-term spatial memory.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing video world models struggle with maintaining scene consistency across revisits due to limited temporal context, causing forgetfulness.

Method: The framework incorporates geometry-grounded long-term spatial memory with mechanisms to store and retrieve relevant information. Custom datasets were created for training and evaluation.

Result: Evaluations show enhancements in quality, consistency, and extended context length compared to baseline methods.

Conclusion: The proposed memory framework improves video world model performance and enables more consistent long-term world generation.

Abstract: Emerging world models autoregressively generate video frames in response to
actions, such as camera movements and text prompts, among other control
signals. Due to limited temporal context window sizes, these models often
struggle to maintain scene consistency during revisits, leading to severe
forgetting of previously generated environments. Inspired by the mechanisms of
human memory, we introduce a novel framework to enhancing long-term consistency
of video world models through a geometry-grounded long-term spatial memory. Our
framework includes mechanisms to store and retrieve information from the
long-term spatial memory and we curate custom datasets to train and evaluate
world models with explicitly stored 3D memory mechanisms. Our evaluations show
improved quality, consistency, and context length compared to relevant
baselines, paving the way towards long-term consistent world generation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces RaySt3R, a novel method for 3D shape completion, achieving state-of-the-art results by leveraging view synthesis from single RGB-D images.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 3D shape completion methods lack 3D consistency, are computationally demanding, and fail to capture sharp boundaries.

Method: The approach reframes 3D shape completion as a view synthesis problem, using a feedforward transformer to predict depth maps, object masks, and confidence scores, and fusing results for complete 3D reconstruction.

Result: RaySt3R achieves up to 44% improvement in 3D chamfer distance compared to baselines, evaluated on synthetic and real-world datasets.

Conclusion: RaySt3R offers an effective and computationally efficient solution for 3D shape completion, pushing performance boundaries in various datasets.

Abstract: 3D shape completion has broad applications in robotics, digital twin
reconstruction, and extended reality (XR). Although recent advances in 3D
object and scene completion have achieved impressive results, existing methods
lack 3D consistency, are computationally expensive, and struggle to capture
sharp object boundaries. Our work (RaySt3R) addresses these limitations by
recasting 3D shape completion as a novel view synthesis problem. Specifically,
given a single RGB-D image and a novel viewpoint (encoded as a collection of
query rays), we train a feedforward transformer to predict depth maps, object
masks, and per-pixel confidence scores for those query rays. RaySt3R fuses
these predictions across multiple query views to reconstruct complete 3D
shapes. We evaluate RaySt3R on synthetic and real-world datasets, and observe
it achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming the baselines on all
datasets by up to 44% in 3D chamfer distance. Project page:

*Lijie Hu,Songning Lai,Yuan Hua,Shu Yang,Jingfeng Zhang,Di Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Vision Concept Transformer (VCT) and Stable Vision Concept Transformer (SVCT) to enhance Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs) for medical AI applications, focusing on addressing accuracy and interpretability issues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs) overlook intrinsic feature embeddings of medical images and negatively impact model performance under input perturbations, limiting their reliability and application in the medical field.

Method: The paper proposes VCT and SVCT using Vision Transformer (ViT) architecture. SVCT includes conceptual layers for combining conceptual and image features and employs Denoised Diffusion Smoothing to ensure faithful explanations.

Result: Experiments on four medical datasets show that VCT and SVCT provide interpretable results without sacrificing accuracy. SVCT is more robust to input perturbations and consistently delivers reliable explanations.

Conclusion: SVCT addresses key challenges in CBMs by maintaining accuracy, enhancing interpretability, and delivering faithful explanations even under input perturbations, making it suitable for medical applications.

Abstract: Transparency is a paramount concern in the medical field, prompting
researchers to delve into the realm of explainable AI (XAI). Among these XAI
methods, Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs) aim to restrict the model's latent
space to human-understandable high-level concepts by generating a conceptual
layer for extracting conceptual features, which has drawn much attention
recently. However, existing methods rely solely on concept features to
determine the model's predictions, which overlook the intrinsic feature
embeddings within medical images. To address this utility gap between the
original models and concept-based models, we propose Vision Concept Transformer
(VCT). Furthermore, despite their benefits, CBMs have been found to negatively
impact model performance and fail to provide stable explanations when faced
with input perturbations, which limits their application in the medical field.
To address this faithfulness issue, this paper further proposes the Stable
Vision Concept Transformer (SVCT) based on VCT, which leverages the vision
transformer (ViT) as its backbone and incorporates a conceptual layer. SVCT
employs conceptual features to enhance decision-making capabilities by fusing
them with image features and ensures model faithfulness through the integration
of Denoised Diffusion Smoothing. Comprehensive experiments on four medical
datasets demonstrate that our VCT and SVCT maintain accuracy while remaining
interpretable compared to baselines. Furthermore, even when subjected to
perturbations, our SVCT model consistently provides faithful explanations, thus
meeting the needs of the medical field.

TL;DR: This paper introduces EOC-Bench, a benchmark for evaluating multimodal large language models (MLLMs) in dynamic egocentric scenarios with object interaction across temporal contexts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks for embodied cognition focus on static scenes and overlook dynamic changes that occur due to user interactions, creating a need for a tool to evaluate object-centric understanding in such scenarios.

Method: The authors developed EOC-Bench, which includes 3,277 QA pairs annotated with human-in-the-loop frameworks, categorized into Past, Present, and Future temporal dimensions. It also features a novel multi-scale temporal accuracy metric for evaluations.

Result: Comprehensive evaluations were conducted on various MLLMs (proprietary, open-source, and object-level) using the EOC-Bench, demonstrating its capability to assess dynamic object-centric cognition.

Conclusion: EOC-Bench is an essential tool for advancing the development of embodied object cognition in MLLMs, providing a foundation for reliable, dynamic, and context-aware systems.

Abstract: The emergence of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) has driven
breakthroughs in egocentric vision applications. These applications necessitate
persistent, context-aware understanding of objects, as users interact with
tools in dynamic and cluttered environments. However, existing embodied
benchmarks primarily focus on static scene exploration, emphasizing object's
appearance and spatial attributes while neglecting the assessment of dynamic
changes arising from users' interactions. To address this gap, we introduce
EOC-Bench, an innovative benchmark designed to systematically evaluate
object-centric embodied cognition in dynamic egocentric scenarios. Specially,
EOC-Bench features 3,277 meticulously annotated QA pairs categorized into three
temporal categories: Past, Present, and Future, covering 11 fine-grained
evaluation dimensions and 3 visual object referencing types. To ensure thorough
assessment, we develop a mixed-format human-in-the-loop annotation framework
with four types of questions and design a novel multi-scale temporal accuracy
metric for open-ended temporal evaluation. Based on EOC-Bench, we conduct
comprehensive evaluations of various proprietary, open-source, and object-level
MLLMs. EOC-Bench serves as a crucial tool for advancing the embodied object
cognitive capabilities of MLLMs, establishing a robust foundation for
developing reliable core models for embodied systems.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces AliTok, a novel tokenizer designed to enhance autoregressive image generation by aligning tokenization and generation processes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors identified an issue with existing image tokenizers, which rely on bidirectional dependencies during compression, creating challenges for autoregressive models designed for unidirectional prediction.

Method: AliTok employs a causal decoder to enforce unidirectional token dependencies. It also uses prefix tokens and a two-stage training process to improve reconstruction consistency.

Result: AliTok achieves state-of-the-art results on the ImageNet-256 benchmark, with a gFID score of 1.50 and an IS of 305.9 using a 177M-parameter model. With 662M parameters, it further improves performance and outpaces the best diffusion methods with a 10x faster sampling speed.

Conclusion: The proposed AliTok tokenizer successfully aligns tokenization techniques with autoregressive modeling, achieving superior generation quality and speed over existing methods.

Abstract: Autoregressive image generation aims to predict the next token based on
previous ones. However, existing image tokenizers encode tokens with
bidirectional dependencies during the compression process, which hinders the
effective modeling by autoregressive models. In this paper, we propose a novel
Aligned Tokenizer (AliTok), which utilizes a causal decoder to establish
unidirectional dependencies among encoded tokens, thereby aligning the token
modeling approach between the tokenizer and autoregressive model. Furthermore,
by incorporating prefix tokens and employing two-stage tokenizer training to
enhance reconstruction consistency, AliTok achieves great reconstruction
performance while being generation-friendly. On ImageNet-256 benchmark, using a
standard decoder-only autoregressive model as the generator with only 177M
parameters, AliTok achieves a gFID score of 1.50 and an IS of 305.9. When the
parameter count is increased to 662M, AliTok achieves a gFID score of 1.35,
surpassing the state-of-the-art diffusion method with 10x faster sampling
speed. The code and weights are available at

TL;DR: This paper introduces SeedVR2, a one-step diffusion-based video restoration model that achieves high-quality results with reduced computation for high-resolution videos, using dynamic attention mechanisms and specialized training losses.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing diffusion-based video restoration methods provide good quality but are computationally expensive and not well-adapted for high-resolution real-world settings in a single step.

Method: The paper introduces a one-step VR model called SeedVR2, which incorporates adaptive window attention to address window inconsistency in high-resolution settings and uses feature matching and other loss techniques for stable training.

Result: SeedVR2 demonstrates comparable or superior performance to traditional multi-step VR methods, achieving high efficiency and quality in a single-step approach for video restoration.

Conclusion: SeedVR2 is a significant advance in one-step diffusion-based video restoration, offering a practical solution for real-world high-resolution video restoration challenges with improved efficiency.

Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion-based video restoration (VR) demonstrate
significant improvement in visual quality, yet yield a prohibitive
computational cost during inference. While several distillation-based
approaches have exhibited the potential of one-step image restoration,
extending existing approaches to VR remains challenging and underexplored,
particularly when dealing with high-resolution video in real-world settings. In
this work, we propose a one-step diffusion-based VR model, termed as SeedVR2,
which performs adversarial VR training against real data. To handle the
challenging high-resolution VR within a single step, we introduce several
enhancements to both model architecture and training procedures. Specifically,
an adaptive window attention mechanism is proposed, where the window size is
dynamically adjusted to fit the output resolutions, avoiding window
inconsistency observed under high-resolution VR using window attention with a
predefined window size. To stabilize and improve the adversarial post-training
towards VR, we further verify the effectiveness of a series of losses,
including a proposed feature matching loss without significantly sacrificing
training efficiency. Extensive experiments show that SeedVR2 can achieve
comparable or even better performance compared with existing VR approaches in a
single step.

Motivation: The paper aims to enhance region-level visual understanding in images and videos by combining the capabilities of segmentation models and large language models.

Method: The proposed method, PAM, extends the SAM 2 segmentation model by incorporating a Semantic Perceiver component to translate visual features for LLMs. It also uses a refined data pipeline for producing a high-quality dataset.

Result: PAM achieves faster processing speeds (1.2-2.4x) and reduced GPU memory usage compared to existing methods, while delivering strong region-understanding capabilities.

Conclusion: PAM provides a lightweight, efficient, and high-performing framework for region-level visual tasks, setting a solid baseline for future advancements in the field.

Abstract: We present Perceive Anything Model (PAM), a conceptually straightforward and
efficient framework for comprehensive region-level visual understanding in
images and videos. Our approach extends the powerful segmentation model SAM 2
by integrating Large Language Models (LLMs), enabling simultaneous object
segmentation with the generation of diverse, region-specific semantic outputs,
including categories, label definition, functional explanations, and detailed
captions. A key component, Semantic Perceiver, is introduced to efficiently
transform SAM 2's rich visual features, which inherently carry general vision,
localization, and semantic priors into multi-modal tokens for LLM
comprehension. To support robust multi-granularity understanding, we also
develop a dedicated data refinement and augmentation pipeline, yielding a
high-quality dataset of 1.5M image and 0.6M video region-semantic annotations,
including novel region-level streaming video caption data. PAM is designed for
lightweightness and efficiency, while also demonstrates strong performance
across a diverse range of region understanding tasks. It runs 1.2-2.4x faster
and consumes less GPU memory than prior approaches, offering a practical
solution for real-world applications. We believe that our effective approach
will serve as a strong baseline for future research in region-level visual
understanding.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel approach to improve semantic correspondence in vision models through 3D-aware pseudo-labeling, achieving state-of-the-art performance on SPair-71k with reduced annotation needs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Semantic correspondence estimation remains a key challenge in computer vision, especially when dealing with symmetric objects or repeated parts in images.

Method: The authors suggest using 3D-aware pseudo-labeling by refining features with an adapter, utilizing pseudo-labels through 3D-aware chaining, relaxed cyclic consistency filtering, and 3D spherical prototype mapping.

Result: The proposed method achieves a new state-of-the-art accuracy on the SPair-71k benchmark, outperforming competing methods by more than 4% and 7% over those with similar supervision levels.

Conclusion: This approach enhances semantic matching performance while reducing dependency on dataset-specific annotations and exhibits scalability to other datasets.

Abstract: Finding correspondences between semantically similar points across images and
object instances is one of the everlasting challenges in computer vision. While
large pre-trained vision models have recently been demonstrated as effective
priors for semantic matching, they still suffer from ambiguities for symmetric
objects or repeated object parts. We propose to improve semantic correspondence
estimation via 3D-aware pseudo-labeling. Specifically, we train an adapter to
refine off-the-shelf features using pseudo-labels obtained via 3D-aware
chaining, filtering wrong labels through relaxed cyclic consistency, and 3D
spherical prototype mapping constraints. While reducing the need for dataset
specific annotations compared to prior work, we set a new state-of-the-art on
SPair-71k by over 4% absolute gain and by over 7% against methods with similar
supervision requirements. The generality of our proposed approach simplifies
extension of training to other data sources, which we demonstrate in our
experiments.

Method: The authors developed MARBLE, which leverages CLIP-space embeddings to find material directions and uses a block in the denoising UNet for material attribution. A shallow network predicts the direction for fine-grained material attribute changes.

Result: MARBLE achieves blending and recomposing materials with high precision, enables parametric control over attributes like roughness and metallic textures, and supports multiple edits in one pass. Results were validated through qualitative and quantitative analysis.

Conclusion: This work demonstrates a significant advancement in material editing, providing flexible and efficient solutions for modifying object materials in images, with potential applications in painting and creative tools.

Abstract: Editing materials of objects in images based on exemplar images is an active
area of research in computer vision and graphics. We propose MARBLE, a method
for performing material blending and recomposing fine-grained material
properties by finding material embeddings in CLIP-space and using that to
control pre-trained text-to-image models. We improve exemplar-based material
editing by finding a block in the denoising UNet responsible for material
attribution. Given two material exemplar-images, we find directions in the
CLIP-space for blending the materials. Further, we can achieve parametric
control over fine-grained material attributes such as roughness, metallic,
transparency, and glow using a shallow network to predict the direction for the
desired material attribute change. We perform qualitative and quantitative
analysis to demonstrate the efficacy of our proposed method. We also present
the ability of our method to perform multiple edits in a single forward pass
and applicability to painting.

### [245] [ProJo4D: Progressive Joint Optimization for Sparse-View Inverse Physics Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05317)
*Daniel Rho,Jun Myeong Choi,Biswadip Dey,Roni Sengupta*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces ProJo4D, a progressive joint optimization framework solving challenges in sparse multi-view physics-based neural rendering, achieving state-of-the-art results in 4D scene understanding and related tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of physics estimation from sparse multi-view videos for realistic applications like robotics and XR, where existing methods suffer from error accumulation and impractical input requirements.

Method: ProJo4D implements a gradual sensitivity-based joint optimization strategy that progressively increases the parameter set being optimized (geometry, appearance, physical state, and material properties), avoiding the downsides of sequential or direct optimization.

Result: ProJo4D demonstrates superior performance over prior methods in predicting future 4D states, rendering novel views of future states, and estimating material parameters, as validated on PAC-NeRF and Spring-Gaus datasets.

Conclusion: ProJo4D effectively addresses the limitations of prior approaches, providing a scalable solution for physically accurate 4D scene understanding, with potential real-world applications in robotics, XR, and digital twin creation.

Abstract: Neural rendering has made significant strides in 3D reconstruction and novel
view synthesis. With the integration with physics, it opens up new
applications. The inverse problem of estimating physics from visual data,
however, still remains challenging, limiting its effectiveness for applications
like physically accurate digital twin creation in robotics and XR. Existing
methods that incorporate physics into neural rendering frameworks typically
require dense multi-view videos as input, making them impractical for scalable,
real-world use. When presented with sparse multi-view videos, the sequential
optimization strategy used by existing approaches introduces significant error
accumulation, e.g., poor initial 3D reconstruction leads to bad material
parameter estimation in subsequent stages. Instead of sequential optimization,
directly optimizing all parameters at the same time also fails due to the
highly non-convex and often non-differentiable nature of the problem. We
propose ProJo4D, a progressive joint optimization framework that gradually
increases the set of jointly optimized parameters guided by their sensitivity,
leading to fully joint optimization over geometry, appearance, physical state,
and material property. Evaluations on PAC-NeRF and Spring-Gaus datasets show
that ProJo4D outperforms prior work in 4D future state prediction, novel view
rendering of future state, and material parameter estimation, demonstrating its
effectiveness in physically grounded 4D scene understanding. For demos, please

### [246] [Does Your 3D Encoder Really Work? When Pretrain-SFT from 2D VLMs Meets 3D VLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05318)
*Haoyuan Li,Yanpeng Zhou,Yufei Gao,Tao Tang,Jianhua Han,Yujie Yuan,Dave Zhenyu Chen,Jiawang Bian,Hang Xu,Xiaodan Liang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper examines the challenges of extending 2D Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to 3D settings and proposes a novel dataset to promote better 3D scene understanding by addressing limitations such as overreliance on linguistic cues and ineffective 3D encoder utilization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to resolve the performance gap seen in 3D scene-centric Vision-Language Models compared to 2D-based approaches, and to advance genuine 3D scene understanding capabilities in VLMs.

Method: It conducts an in-depth analysis of various 3D VLM architectures and introduces a 3D Relevance Discrimination QA dataset to mitigate issues like shortcut learning and overfitting.

Result: The study found that current 3D scene-centric VLMs underutilize 3D encoders, are less effective during the pre-training stage, and display limited data scaling benefits. Additionally, they overly depend on linguistic cues and frequent answer distributions.

Conclusion: The research emphasizes the necessity for more robust evaluation frameworks and methodologies to foster real 3D scene comprehension in 3D Vision-Language Models.

Abstract: Remarkable progress in 2D Vision-Language Models (VLMs) has spurred interest
in extending them to 3D settings for tasks like 3D Question Answering, Dense
Captioning, and Visual Grounding. Unlike 2D VLMs that typically process images
through an image encoder, 3D scenes, with their intricate spatial structures,
allow for diverse model architectures. Based on their encoder design, this
paper categorizes recent 3D VLMs into 3D object-centric, 2D image-based, and 3D
scene-centric approaches. Despite the architectural similarity of 3D
scene-centric VLMs to their 2D counterparts, they have exhibited comparatively
lower performance compared with the latest 3D object-centric and 2D image-based
approaches. To understand this gap, we conduct an in-depth analysis, revealing
that 3D scene-centric VLMs show limited reliance on the 3D scene encoder, and
the pre-train stage appears less effective than in 2D VLMs. Furthermore, we
observe that data scaling benefits are less pronounced on larger datasets. Our
investigation suggests that while these models possess cross-modal alignment
capabilities, they tend to over-rely on linguistic cues and overfit to frequent
answer distributions, thereby diminishing the effective utilization of the 3D
encoder. To address these limitations and encourage genuine 3D scene
understanding, we introduce a novel 3D Relevance Discrimination QA dataset
designed to disrupt shortcut learning and improve 3D understanding. Our
findings highlight the need for advanced evaluation and improved strategies for
better 3D understanding in 3D VLMs.

*Duochao Shi,Weijie Wang,Donny Y. Chen,Zeyu Zhang,Jia-Wang Bian,Bohan Zhuang,Chunhua Shen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper addresses the limitations of depth map-based 3D Gaussian Splatting pipelines, specifically issues with depth discontinuities, by introducing PM-Loss, a new regularization loss that enhances rendering quality using geometric smoothness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The main motivation is to tackle the rendering quality degradation caused by depth discontinuities at object boundaries in depth-based 3D Gaussian Splatting pipelines.

Method: PM-Loss, a novel regularization loss, is developed based on a pointmap predicted by a pre-trained transformer to enforce geometric smoothness and improve depth map accuracy.

Result: PM-Loss significantly improves depth map quality and rendering results across diverse architectures and scenes in feed-forward 3DGS pipelines.

Conclusion: The proposed PM-Loss enhances geometric smoothness and alleviates depth discontinuity issues, leading to consistent improvements in 3DGS rendering quality.

Abstract: Depth maps are widely used in feed-forward 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS)
pipelines by unprojecting them into 3D point clouds for novel view synthesis.
This approach offers advantages such as efficient training, the use of known
camera poses, and accurate geometry estimation. However, depth discontinuities
at object boundaries often lead to fragmented or sparse point clouds, degrading
rendering quality -- a well-known limitation of depth-based representations. To
tackle this issue, we introduce PM-Loss, a novel regularization loss based on a
pointmap predicted by a pre-trained transformer. Although the pointmap itself
may be less accurate than the depth map, it effectively enforces geometric
smoothness, especially around object boundaries. With the improved depth map,
our method significantly improves the feed-forward 3DGS across various
architectures and scenes, delivering consistently better rendering results. Our

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A new benchmark, CG-AV-Counting, is introduced for evaluating MLLMs on multimodal counting tasks using annotated clues and long videos. The AV-Reasoner model achieves state-of-the-art results but struggles in out-of-domain scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current multimodal language models (MLLMs) struggle with counting tasks due to limited benchmarks and lack of multimodal coverage, necessitating improved evaluation methodologies.

Method: The paper introduces CG-AV-Counting, a manually annotated benchmark for multimodal counting tasks, and develops AV-Reasoner, a model trained with reinforcement and curriculum learning to improve counting via task generalization.

Result: AV-Reasoner sets state-of-the-art performance across various counting benchmarks but shows limitations in reasoning for out-of-domain benchmarks.

Conclusion: CG-AV-Counting provides a robust testbed for video counting tasks, and AV-Reasoner demonstrates reinforcement learning's potential, though it faces challenges in out-of-domain contexts.

Abstract: Despite progress in video understanding, current MLLMs struggle with counting
tasks. Existing benchmarks are limited by short videos, close-set queries, lack
of clue annotations, and weak multimodal coverage. In this paper, we introduce
CG-AV-Counting, a manually-annotated clue-grounded counting benchmark with
1,027 multimodal questions and 5,845 annotated clues over 497 long videos. It
supports both black-box and white-box evaluation, serving as a comprehensive
testbed for both end-to-end and reasoning-based counting. To explore ways to
improve model's counting capability, we propose AV-Reasoner, a model trained
with GRPO and curriculum learning to generalize counting ability from related
tasks. AV-Reasoner achieves state-of-the-art results across multiple
benchmarks, demonstrating the effectiveness of reinforcement learning. However,
experiments show that on out-of-domain benchmarks, reasoning in the language
space fails to bring performance gains. The code and benchmark have been

*Xinyan Chen,Renrui Zhang,Dongzhi Jiang,Aojun Zhou,Shilin Yan,Weifeng Lin,Hongsheng Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces MINT-CoT, a model that enhances mathematical reasoning in Large Language Models (LLMs) by interleaving visual tokens with textual reasoning, overcoming limitations in handling multimodal mathematical problem solving.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for reasoning in multimodal domains face challenges like reliance on coarse image regions, limited vision encoders for mathematical data, and dependency on external tools.

Method: MINT-CoT uses dynamically selected visual tokens interleaved with textual reasoning steps and employs a new dataset (54K mathematical problems) and three-stage training (text-only CoT SFT, interleaved CoT SFT, interleaved CoT RL).

Result: The MINT-CoT-7B model significantly outperforms baseline models with improvements of +34.08% on MathVista, +28.78% on GeoQA, and +23.2% on MMStar.

Conclusion: MINT-CoT establishes a more effective approach for interleaved multimodal reasoning, particularly in mathematical contexts, setting a new benchmark for LLM multimodal tasks.

Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) has widely enhanced mathematical reasoning in Large
Language Models (LLMs), but it still remains challenging for extending it to
multimodal domains. Existing works either adopt a similar textual reasoning for
image input, or seek to interleave visual signals into mathematical CoT.
However, they face three key limitations for math problem-solving: reliance on
coarse-grained box-shaped image regions, limited perception of vision encoders
on math content, and dependence on external capabilities for visual
modification. In this paper, we propose MINT-CoT, introducing Mathematical
INterleaved Tokens for Chain-of-Thought visual reasoning. MINT-CoT adaptively
interleaves relevant visual tokens into textual reasoning steps via an
Interleave Token, which dynamically selects visual regions of any shapes within
math figures. To empower this capability, we construct the MINT-CoT dataset,
containing 54K mathematical problems aligning each reasoning step with visual
regions at the token level, accompanied by a rigorous data generation pipeline.
We further present a three-stage MINT-CoT training strategy, progressively
combining text-only CoT SFT, interleaved CoT SFT, and interleaved CoT RL, which
derives our MINT-CoT-7B model. Extensive experiments demonstrate the
effectiveness of our method for effective visual interleaved reasoning in
mathematical domains, where MINT-CoT-7B outperforms the baseline model by
+34.08% on MathVista, +28.78% on GeoQA, and +23.2% on MMStar, respectively. Our

TL;DR: The paper introduces VideoMarathon, a dataset with 9,700 hours of long videos designed for video-language understanding, and Hour-LLaVA, a model optimized for processing hour-long videos.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks for video-language models lack sufficient annotated hour-long videos, limiting progress in long-form video understanding.

Method: They developed VideoMarathon, leveraging diverse domains and topics, and introduced Hour-LLaVA models with a memory augmentation module for efficient hour-scale video training and inference.

Result: Hour-LLaVA achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple benchmarks, highlighting the effectiveness of both the dataset and the model.

Conclusion: VideoMarathon and Hour-LLaVA significantly advance long-form video-language understanding, setting new standards for training and inference at hour-long scales.

Abstract: Recent long-form video-language understanding benchmarks have driven progress
in video large multimodal models (Video-LMMs). However, the scarcity of
well-annotated long videos has left the training of hour-long Video-LLMs
underexplored. To close this gap, we present VideoMarathon, a large-scale
hour-long video instruction-following dataset. This dataset includes around
9,700 hours of long videos sourced from diverse domains, ranging from 3 to 60
minutes per video. Specifically, it contains 3.3M high-quality QA pairs,
spanning six fundamental topics: temporality, spatiality, object, action,
scene, and event. Compared to existing video instruction datasets,
VideoMarathon significantly extends training video durations up to 1 hour, and
supports 22 diverse tasks requiring both short- and long-term video
comprehension. Building on VideoMarathon, we propose Hour-LLaVA, a powerful and
efficient Video-LMM for hour-scale video-language modeling. It enables
hour-long video training and inference at 1-FPS sampling by leveraging a memory
augmentation module, which adaptively integrates user question-relevant and
spatiotemporal-informative semantics from a cached full video context. In our
experiments, Hour-LLaVA achieves the best performance on multiple long
video-language benchmarks, demonstrating the high quality of the VideoMarathon
dataset and the superiority of the Hour-LLaVA model.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VideoMolmo is a multimodal model designed for accurate spatio-temporal pointing in videos, leveraging text descriptions, and achieves superior performance with novel temporal modules and datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of current video-based methodologies that excel at tracking but lack contextual understanding and reasoning capabilities akin to large language models.

Method: VideoMolmo employs a temporal attention mechanism to ensure frame coherence and introduces a temporal mask fusion pipeline for enhanced video consistency. It utilizes a large dataset of 72k video-caption pairs and introduces a new benchmark (VPoS-Bench) to assess generalization.

Result: VideoMolmo outperforms existing models in both spatio-temporal pointing accuracy and reasoning tasks, validated on diverse domains such as cell tracking, robotics, and autonomous driving.

Conclusion: The integration of temporal reasoning and language model insights into VideoMolmo demonstrates significant advancements in fine-grained spatio-temporal localization tasks, highlighting its potential in various real-world applications.

Abstract: Spatio-temporal localization is vital for precise interactions across diverse
domains, from biological research to autonomous navigation and interactive
interfaces. Current video-based approaches, while proficient in tracking, lack
the sophisticated reasoning capabilities of large language models, limiting
their contextual understanding and generalization. We introduce VideoMolmo, a
large multimodal model tailored for fine-grained spatio-temporal pointing
conditioned on textual descriptions. Building upon the Molmo architecture,
VideoMolmo incorporates a temporal module utilizing an attention mechanism to
condition each frame on preceding frames, ensuring temporal consistency.
Additionally, our novel temporal mask fusion pipeline employs SAM2 for
bidirectional point propagation, significantly enhancing coherence across video
sequences. This two-step decomposition, i.e., first using the LLM to generate
precise pointing coordinates, then relying on a sequential mask-fusion module
to produce coherent segmentation, not only simplifies the task for the language
model but also enhances interpretability. Due to the lack of suitable datasets,
we curate a comprehensive dataset comprising 72k video-caption pairs annotated
with 100k object points. To evaluate the generalization of VideoMolmo, we
introduce VPoS-Bench, a challenging out-of-distribution benchmark spanning five
real-world scenarios: Cell Tracking, Egocentric Vision, Autonomous Driving,
Video-GUI Interaction, and Robotics. We also evaluate our model on Referring
Video Object Segmentation (Refer-VOS) and Reasoning VOS tasks. In comparison to
existing models, VideoMolmo substantially improves spatio-temporal pointing
accuracy and reasoning capability. Our code and models are publicly available

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a pipeline for creating defurnished 3D meshes and panoramic images of indoor spaces by removing furniture using mesh segmentation, hole-filling, and ControlNet inpainting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve the quality of defurnished asset generation by overcoming the limitations of existing methods like neural radiance fields and RGB-D inpainting, which often result in blurry images or hallucinations.

Method: The process involves segmenting and removing furniture from 3D meshes, extending planes, filling holes, extracting edges, and using ControlNet inpainting on multi-view panoramas, guided by global geometric information.

Result: The approach yields higher quality defurnished meshes and panoramas compared to neural radiance fields and RGB-D inpainting, producing less blurry and more reliable results.

Conclusion: The pipeline offers a significant improvement in defurnished asset creation, demonstrating the value of integrating geometric guidance and advanced inpainting techniques.

Abstract: We present a pipeline for generating defurnished replicas of indoor spaces
represented as textured meshes and corresponding multi-view panoramic images.
To achieve this, we first segment and remove furniture from the mesh
representation, extend planes, and fill holes, obtaining a simplified
defurnished mesh (SDM). This SDM acts as an ``X-ray'' of the scene's underlying
structure, guiding the defurnishing process. We extract Canny edges from depth
and normal images rendered from the SDM. We then use these as a guide to remove
the furniture from panorama images via ControlNet inpainting. This control
signal ensures the availability of global geometric information that may be
hidden from a particular panoramic view by the furniture being removed. The
inpainted panoramas are used to texture the mesh. We show that our approach
produces higher quality assets than methods that rely on neural radiance
fields, which tend to produce blurry low-resolution images, or RGB-D
inpainting, which is highly susceptible to hallucinations.

*Xingjian Ran,Yixuan Li,Linning Xu,Mulin Yu,Bo Dai*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces DirectLayout, a method to generate 3D indoor scene layouts from textual descriptions using large language models and spatial reasoning. The process involves three stages: BEV layout creation, 3D lifting, and layout refinement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 3D layout generation methods struggle with limited datasets and lack alignment with user instructions, limiting their flexibility and generalization.

Method: DirectLayout uses a three-stage pipeline: generating Bird's-Eye View layouts, translating these to 3D, and refining placements. Chain-of-Thought Activation and CoT-Grounded Generative Layout Reward are employed for enhanced spatial reasoning and model generalization.

Result: DirectLayout outperforms prior methods in terms of semantic consistency, generalization, and physical plausibility.

Conclusion: DirectLayout provides a more effective and flexible approach for generating realistic 3D indoor scenes guided by textual input, showcasing robustness in generalization and alignment with user instructions.

Abstract: Realistic 3D indoor scene synthesis is vital for embodied AI and digital
content creation. It can be naturally divided into two subtasks: object
generation and layout generation. While recent generative models have
significantly advanced object-level quality and controllability, layout
generation remains challenging due to limited datasets. Existing methods either
overfit to these datasets or rely on predefined constraints to optimize
numerical layout that sacrifice flexibility. As a result, they fail to generate
scenes that are both open-vocabulary and aligned with fine-grained user
instructions. We introduce DirectLayout, a framework that directly generates
numerical 3D layouts from text descriptions using generalizable spatial
reasoning of large language models (LLMs). DirectLayout decomposes the
generation into three stages: producing a Bird's-Eye View (BEV) layout, lifting
it into 3D space, and refining object placements. To enable explicit spatial
reasoning and help the model grasp basic principles of object placement, we
employ Chain-of-Thought (CoT) Activation based on the 3D-Front dataset.
Additionally, we design CoT-Grounded Generative Layout Reward to enhance
generalization and spatial planning. During inference, DirectLayout addresses
asset-layout mismatches via Iterative Asset-Layout Alignment through in-context
learning. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DirectLayout achieves
impressive semantic consistency, generalization and physical plausibility.

Motivation: The authors aim to address the limitations of image segmentation models, which lack the ability to semantically process complex queries combining language and vision, resulting in challenges for vision-language prompt-based applications.

Method: The authors propose RAS (Refer to Any Segmentation Mask Group), a mask-centric multimodal framework. This framework enhances segmentation models to handle multimodal semantic understanding. They also constructed two datasets, MaskGroups-2M and MaskGroups-HQ, for training and benchmarking.

Result: RAS achieved superior performance in omnimodal referring expression segmentation (ORES) and improved results on traditional RES and GRES tasks through extensive evaluations.

Conclusion: The study bridges the gap in segmentation models by introducing ORES and showcasing RAS as an effective solution to drive user-friendly, multimodal segmentation using text and visual cues.

Abstract: Recent image segmentation models have advanced to segment images into
high-quality masks for visual entities, and yet they cannot provide
comprehensive semantic understanding for complex queries based on both language
and vision. This limitation reduces their effectiveness in applications that
require user-friendly interactions driven by vision-language prompts. To bridge
this gap, we introduce a novel task of omnimodal referring expression
segmentation (ORES). In this task, a model produces a group of masks based on
arbitrary prompts specified by text only or text plus reference visual
entities. To address this new challenge, we propose a novel framework to "Refer
to Any Segmentation Mask Group" (RAS), which augments segmentation models with
complex multimodal interactions and comprehension via a mask-centric large
multimodal model. For training and benchmarking ORES models, we create datasets
MaskGroups-2M and MaskGroups-HQ to include diverse mask groups specified by
text and reference entities. Through extensive evaluation, we demonstrate
superior performance of RAS on our new ORES task, as well as classic referring
expression segmentation (RES) and generalized referring expression segmentation
(GRES) tasks. Project page: https://Ref2Any.github.io.

*Jiahui Wang,Zuyan Liu,Yongming Rao,Jiwen Lu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper explores how Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) process visual inputs, revealing that less than 5% of attention heads in LLMs are responsible for visual understanding (visual heads). The study introduces SparseMM, a method for optimizing computation by focusing on these heads, achieving faster and more memory-efficient inference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how MLLMs integrate visual inputs and address inefficiencies in their attention mechanisms during visual processing.

Method: The authors analyze attention mechanisms, identify a small subset of 'visual heads,' and develop a training-free framework to measure their visual relevance. They implement SparseMM, an optimization strategy that allocates asymmetric computation budgets to these visual heads during inference.

Result: SparseMM achieves 1.38x real-time acceleration and reduces memory usage by 52% during generation, maintaining performance levels across multimodal benchmarks.

Conclusion: The research highlights the sparsity of visual attention in MLLMs and offers an optimized approach, SparseMM, that improves inference efficiency without compromising performance.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) are commonly derived by extending
pre-trained Large Language Models (LLMs) with visual capabilities. In this
work, we investigate how MLLMs process visual inputs by analyzing their
attention mechanisms. We reveal a surprising sparsity phenomenon: only a small
subset (approximately less than 5%) of attention heads in LLMs actively
contribute to visual understanding, termed visual heads. To identify these
heads efficiently, we design a training-free framework that quantifies
head-level visual relevance through targeted response analysis. Building on
this discovery, we introduce SparseMM, a KV-Cache optimization strategy that
allocates asymmetric computation budgets to heads in LLMs based on their visual
scores, leveraging the sparity of visual heads for accelerating the inference
of MLLMs. Compared with prior KV-Cache acceleration methods that ignore the
particularity of visual, SparseMM prioritizes stress and retaining visual
semantics during decoding. Extensive evaluations across mainstream multimodal
benchmarks demonstrate that SparseMM achieves superior accuracy-efficiency
trade-offs. Notably, SparseMM delivers 1.38x real-time acceleration and 52%
memory reduction during generation while maintaining performance parity on
efficiency test. Our project is open sourced at

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel system for neural inverse rendering using multi-viewpoint videos of light propagation. It leverages a time-resolved neural radiance caching approach.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve 3D reconstruction and inverse rendering methods, especially in the presence of complex indirect light transport effects.

Method: The approach extends neural radiance caching to be time-resolved, allowing for the storage of infinite-bounce radiance and enabling accurate modeling of light interactions.

Result: State-of-the-art 3D reconstruction is achieved, along with view synthesis of propagating light, decomposition into direct and indirect light, and relighting of scenes.

Conclusion: The proposed system provides a powerful tool for advanced light interaction analysis and rendering, opening pathways for further applications in 3D graphics and lighting studies.

Abstract: We present the first system for physically based, neural inverse rendering
from multi-viewpoint videos of propagating light. Our approach relies on a
time-resolved extension of neural radiance caching -- a technique that
accelerates inverse rendering by storing infinite-bounce radiance arriving at
any point from any direction. The resulting model accurately accounts for
direct and indirect light transport effects and, when applied to captured
measurements from a flash lidar system, enables state-of-the-art 3D
reconstruction in the presence of strong indirect light. Further, we
demonstrate view synthesis of propagating light, automatic decomposition of
captured measurements into direct and indirect components, as well as novel

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes FreeTimeGS, a new 4D representation for high-quality reconstruction of dynamic 3D scenes with complex motions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the difficulty of reconstructing dynamic 3D scenes with complex motions, which current methods struggle to handle due to the optimization challenges of deformation fields.

Method: Developed a novel 4D representation, FreeTimeGS, incorporating Gaussian primitives that can appear at arbitrary times and locations, and equipped them with motion functions to reduce redundancy over time.

Result: Experimental results demonstrate that FreeTimeGS significantly improves rendering quality, outperforming recent methods by a large margin on several datasets.

Conclusion: FreeTimeGS enhances flexibility and effectiveness in modeling dynamic 3D scenes, marking a notable advancement over existing approaches.

Abstract: This paper addresses the challenge of reconstructing dynamic 3D scenes with
complex motions. Some recent works define 3D Gaussian primitives in the
canonical space and use deformation fields to map canonical primitives to
observation spaces, achieving real-time dynamic view synthesis. However, these
methods often struggle to handle scenes with complex motions due to the
difficulty of optimizing deformation fields. To overcome this problem, we
propose FreeTimeGS, a novel 4D representation that allows Gaussian primitives
to appear at arbitrary time and locations. In contrast to canonical Gaussian
primitives, our representation possesses the strong flexibility, thus improving
the ability to model dynamic 3D scenes. In addition, we endow each Gaussian
primitive with an motion function, allowing it to move to neighboring regions
over time, which reduces the temporal redundancy. Experiments results on
several datasets show that the rendering quality of our method outperforms
recent methods by a large margin.

### [259] [VideoMathQA: Benchmarking Mathematical Reasoning via Multimodal Understanding in Videos](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05349)
*Hanoona Rasheed,Abdelrahman Shaker,Anqi Tang,Muhammad Maaz,Ming-Hsuan Yang,Salman Khan,Fahad Khan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces VideoMathQA, a benchmark evaluating AI's ability to perform temporally extended cross-modal reasoning in real-world video settings across diverse mathematical domains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the challenge of mathematical reasoning in multimodal video contexts, which require integrating visual, textual, and audio cues dispersed over time.

Method: The authors developed VideoMathQA, a benchmark with questions spanning mathematical domains in various real-world scenarios, annotated by experts. It includes reasoning challenges such as direct problem solving, conceptual transfer, and deep instructional comprehension.

Result: The benchmark reveals limitations of existing models while providing a structured framework for evaluating AI's reasoning abilities across extended temporal and multimodal contexts.

Conclusion: VideoMathQA establishes a systematic evaluation approach for advancing AI's capability in complex, temporally extended reasoning tasks across video-based mathematical problems.

Abstract: Mathematical reasoning in real-world video settings presents a fundamentally
different challenge than in static images or text. It requires interpreting
fine-grained visual information, accurately reading handwritten or digital
text, and integrating spoken cues, often dispersed non-linearly over time. In
such multimodal contexts, success hinges not just on perception, but on
selectively identifying and integrating the right contextual details from a
rich and noisy stream of content. To this end, we introduce VideoMathQA, a
benchmark designed to evaluate whether models can perform such temporally
extended cross-modal reasoning on videos. The benchmark spans 10 diverse
mathematical domains, covering videos ranging from 10 seconds to over 1 hour.
It requires models to interpret structured visual content, understand
instructional narratives, and jointly ground concepts across visual, audio, and
textual modalities. We employ graduate-level experts to ensure high quality,
totaling over $920$ man-hours of annotation. To reflect real-world scenarios,
questions are designed around three core reasoning challenges: direct problem
solving, where answers are grounded in the presented question; conceptual
transfer, which requires applying learned methods to new problems; and deep
instructional comprehension, involving multi-step reasoning over extended
explanations and partially worked-out solutions. Each question includes
multi-step reasoning annotations, enabling fine-grained diagnosis of model
capabilities. Through this benchmark, we highlight the limitations of existing
approaches and establish a systematic evaluation framework for models that must
reason, rather than merely perceive, across temporally extended and
modality-rich mathematical problem settings. Our benchmark and evaluation code
are available at: https://mbzuai-oryx.github.io/VideoMathQA

### [260] [Contrastive Flow Matching](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05350)
*George Stoica,Vivek Ramanujan,Xiang Fan,Ali Farhadi,Ranjay Krishna,Judy Hoffman*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces Contrastive Flow Matching (CFM), an improvement on unconditional flow-matching, to ensure uniqueness in conditional diffusion models, resulting in faster training, fewer de-noising steps, and better performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conditional diffusion models suffer from overlapping flows across conditions, resulting in ambiguities in outputs. The authors aim to address this limitation.

Method: Contrastive Flow Matching integrates a contrastive objective to maximize dissimilarities between flows of different conditions, improving uniqueness across conditional flows.

Result: CFM improves training speed by up to 9x, reduces de-noising steps by up to 5x, and significantly lowers FID scores on benchmarks like ImageNet-1k and CC3M.

Conclusion: Contrastive Flow Matching enhances conditional diffusion model training by improving flow uniqueness, efficiency, and outcome quality over traditional flow matching methods.

Abstract: Unconditional flow-matching trains diffusion models to transport samples from
a source distribution to a target distribution by enforcing that the flows
between sample pairs are unique. However, in conditional settings (e.g.,
class-conditioned models), this uniqueness is no longer guaranteed--flows from
different conditions may overlap, leading to more ambiguous generations. We
introduce Contrastive Flow Matching, an extension to the flow matching
objective that explicitly enforces uniqueness across all conditional flows,
enhancing condition separation. Our approach adds a contrastive objective that
maximizes dissimilarities between predicted flows from arbitrary sample pairs.
We validate Contrastive Flow Matching by conducting extensive experiments
across varying model architectures on both class-conditioned (ImageNet-1k) and
text-to-image (CC3M) benchmarks. Notably, we find that training models with
Contrastive Flow Matching (1) improves training speed by a factor of up to 9x,
(2) requires up to 5x fewer de-noising steps and (3) lowers FID by up to 8.9
compared to training the same models with flow matching. We release our code
at: https://github.com/gstoica27/DeltaFM.git.

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: This paper introduces GreenPod, a TOPSIS-based scheduler for Kubernetes aiming to optimize pod placement for AIoT workloads by considering multiple criteria like execution time and energy efficiency. Tests show it improves energy efficiency by up to 39.1%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AIoT applications necessitate energy-efficient orchestration among diverse cloud-edge infrastructures, which Kubernetes' conventional scheduler struggles to achieve.

Method: GreenPod leverages a TOPSIS (Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution)-based approach, incorporating factors like energy consumption, execution time, and resource balance for optimal pod placement within heterogeneous Kubernetes clusters.

Result: Experiments on Google Kubernetes clusters demonstrate GreenPod's energy efficiency enhancement by up to 39.1% compared to the default K8s scheduler, especially under energy-focused setups.

Conclusion: GreenPod showcases its ability to maintain a balance between sustainability and performance, meaningfully improving energy efficiency for medium complexity AIoT workloads without significant scheduling delays.

Abstract: AIoT workloads demand energy-efficient orchestration across cloud-edge
infrastructures, but Kubernetes' default scheduler lacks multi-criteria
optimization for heterogeneous environments. This paper presents GreenPod, a
TOPSIS-based scheduler optimizing pod placement based on execution time, energy
consumption, processing core, memory availability, and resource balance. Tested
on a heterogeneous Google Kubernetes cluster, GreenPod improves energy
efficiency by up to 39.1% over the default Kubernetes (K8s) scheduler,
particularly with energy-centric weighting schemes. Medium complexity workloads
showed the highest energy savings, despite slight scheduling latency. GreenPod
effectively balances sustainability and performance for AIoT applications.

*Aayush Gupta,Gopal Pandurangan*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: The paper introduces a protocol to maintain a robust and efficient P2P network topology under high churn and Byzantine attacks, using a lightweight, scalable, randomized approach.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address the challenge of maintaining secure and efficient P2P network topologies that can handle high levels of node churn and malicious activity.

Method: They propose a randomized, fully-distributed protocol that uses minimal local knowledge and ensures the network exhibits desired properties like low diameter and high expansion, with polylogarithmic overhead.

Result: The protocol maintains a sparse, expansive topology under adverse conditions, tolerating up to $o(n/poly\log(n))$ Byzantine nodes, while minimizing computational and communication overhead.

Conclusion: The developed protocol ensures robust network performance and scalability in dynamic and Byzantine environments, serving as a foundation for solving key distributed computing problems.

Abstract: We address a fundamental problem in Peer-to-Peer (P2P) networks, namely,
constructing and maintaining dynamic P2P overlay network topologies with
essential properties such as connectivity, low diameter, and high expansion,
that are resilient to continuous high churn and the presence of a large number
of malicious (Byzantine) nodes. Our main goal is to construct and maintain a
sparse (bounded degree) expander topology despite high churn and a large number
of Byzantine nodes. Such an expander topology has logarithmic diameter, high
expansion, and is robust to churn and the presence of a large number of bad
nodes, and facilitates efficient and robust algorithms for fundamental problems
in distributed computing, such as agreement, broadcasting, routing, etc.
  Our main contribution is a randomized, fully-distributed dynamic P2P protocol
that works with only local initial knowledge and guarantees, with a high
probability, the maintenance of a constant degree graph with high expansion
even under continuous churn and in the presence of a large number of Byzantine
nodes. Our protocol can tolerate up to $o(n/poly\log(n))$ Byzantine nodes
(where $n$ is the stable network size). Our protocol is efficient, lightweight,
and scalable, and it incurs only $O(poly\log(n))$ overhead for topology
maintenance: only polylogarithmic (in $n$) bits need to be processed and sent
by each honest node per round, and any honest node's computation cost per round
is also polylogarithmic.
  Our protocol can be used as a building block for solving fundamental
distributed computing problems in highly dynamic networks, such as Byzantine
agreement and Byzantine leader election, and enables fast and scalable
algorithms for these problems.

Result: Simulation results show that KATO achieves near-optimal task processing performance with significantly reduced computational overhead, and it generalizes well across different network configurations.

Conclusion: KATO offers a practical solution to enhance computation task offloading in VEC, striking a balance between high performance and computational efficiency.

Abstract: Vehicle edge computing (VEC) brings abundant computing resources close to
vehicles by deploying them at roadside units (RSUs) or base stations, thereby
enabling diverse computation-intensive and delay sensitive applications.
Existing task offloading strategies are often computationally expensive to
execute or generate suboptimal solutions. In this paper, we propose a novel
learning-based approach, Knowledge-guided Attention-inspired Task Offloading
(KATO), designed to efficiently offload tasks from moving vehicles to nearby
RSUs. KATO integrates an attention-inspired encoder-decoder model for selecting
a subset of RSUs that can reduce overall task processing time, along with an
efficient iterative algorithm for computing optimal task allocation among the
selected RSUs. Simulation results demonstrate that KATO achieves optimal or
near-optimal performance with significantly lower computational overhead and
generalizes well across networks of varying sizes and configurations.

TL;DR: FlashDMoE introduces a GPU-resident Mixture-of-Experts operator that addresses inefficiencies like low GPU utilization and latency overhead present in existing implementations, achieving significant performance improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for computational efficiency in scalable training of massive neural networks using Mixture-of-Experts models, resolving issues like low GPU utilization and task locality inefficiencies present in CPU-driven implementations.

Method: Developing a GPU-resident operator called FlashDMoE to fully integrate inter-GPU communication, computation, and dispatch phases using a single persistent GPU kernel and device-driven communication protocol.

Result: Performance metrics show FlashDMoE achieves up to 6x lower latency, 5.7x higher throughput, 4x improved weak scaling efficiency, and 9x higher GPU utilization compared to current benchmarks, even using FP32 precision.

Conclusion: FlashDMoE highlights the importance of GPU kernel-hardware co-design in optimizing the scaling and efficiency of large distributed ML models, overcoming limitations of prior implementations.

Abstract: The computational sparsity of Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models enables
sub-linear growth in compute cost as model size increases, offering a scalable
path to training massive neural networks. However, existing implementations
suffer from \emph{low GPU utilization}, \emph{significant latency overhead},
and a fundamental \emph{inability to leverage task locality}, primarily due to
CPU-managed scheduling, host-initiated communication, and frequent kernel
launches. To overcome these limitations, we develop FlashDMoE, a fully
GPU-resident MoE operator that fuses expert computation and inter-GPU
communication into a \emph{single persistent GPU kernel}. FlashDMoE enables
fine-grained pipelining of dispatch, compute, and combine phases, eliminating
launch overheads and reducing idle gaps. Its device-initiated communication
protocol introduces \emph{payload-efficient} data transfers, significantly
shrinking buffer sizes in sparsely activated MoE layers. When evaluated on a
single 8-H100 GPU node with MoE models having up to 128 experts and 16K token
sequences, FlashDMoE achieves up to \textbf{6}x lower latency, \textbf{5,7}x
higher throughput, \textbf{4}x better weak scaling efficiency, and \textbf{9}x
higher GPU utilization compared to state-of-the-art baselines, despite using
FP32 while baselines use FP16. FlashDMoE demonstrates that principled GPU
kernel-hardware co-design is key to unlocking the performance ceiling of
large-scale distributed ML workloads.

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: The paper introduces a synchronous randomized Byzantine agreement protocol that achieves better round complexity than previous protocols under an adaptive Byzantine adversary.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address limitations in solving Byzantine Agreement under adaptive Byzantine adversaries, which represent a significant challenge in fault-tolerant distributed systems.

Method: Develop a randomized protocol that operates within the full information model, accommodating adaptive rushing adversaries capable of malicious behavior, collusion, and network state knowledge.

Result: The protocol achieves a complexity of $O(\min\{t^2\log n/n, t/\log n\})$ rounds, improving over the previously established bound of $O(t/\log n)$.

Conclusion: The paper presents progress in distributed computing by providing an efficient solution for Byzantine Agreement in the presence of an adaptive adversary, overcoming a long-standing round complexity limitation.

Abstract: Byzantine agreement is a fundamental problem in fault-tolerant distributed
computing that has been studied intensively for the last four decades. Much of
the research has focused on a static Byzantine adversary, where the adversary
is constrained to choose the Byzantine nodes in advance of the protocol's
execution. This work focuses on the harder case of an adaptive Byzantine
adversary that can choose the Byzantine nodes \emph{adaptively} based on the
protocol's execution. While efficient $O(\log n)$-round protocols ($n$ is the
total number of nodes) are known for the static adversary (Goldwasser, Pavlov,
and Vaikuntanathan, FOCS 2006) tolerating up to $t < n/(3+\epsilon)$ Byzantine
nodes, $\Omega(t/\sqrt{n \log n})$ rounds is a well-known lower bound for
adaptive adversary [Bar-Joseph and Ben-Or, PODC 1998]. The best-known protocol
for adaptive adversary runs in $O(t/\log n)$ rounds [Chor and Coan, IEEE Trans.
Soft. Engg., 1985].
  This work presents a synchronous randomized Byzantine agreement protocol
under an adaptive adversary that improves over previous results. Our protocol
works under the powerful \emph{adaptive rushing adversary in the full
information model}. That is, we assume that the Byzantine nodes can behave
arbitrarily and maliciously, have knowledge about the entire state of the
network at every round, including random choices made by all the nodes up to
and including the current round, have unlimited computational power, and may
collude among themselves. Furthermore, the adversary can \emph{adaptively}
corrupt up to $t < n/3$ nodes based on the protocol's execution. We present a
simple randomized Byzantine agreement protocol that runs in $O(\min\{t^2\log
n/n, t/\log n\})$ rounds that improves over the long-standing bound of
$O(t/\log n)$ rounds due to Chor and Coan [IEEE Trans. Soft. Engg., 1985].

Motivation: There is a need to develop more trustworthy and explainable AI models for sensitive applications, such as medical diagnoses and financial predictions.

Method: The paper conducts a survey focusing on challenges, mitigating architecture choices, and recent advancements in Concept-based Models across supervised and unsupervised paradigms.

Result: The survey identifies key vulnerabilities in CBMs, including adversarial susceptibility, limited robustness, and issues with human interventions.

Conclusion: Concept-based Models hold promise but face significant limitations. Addressing their reliability and generalization issues is crucial to improving real-world applicability and fostering trust in sensitive domains.

Abstract: Concept-based Models are a class of inherently explainable networks that
improve upon standard Deep Neural Networks by providing a rationale behind
their predictions using human-understandable `concepts'. With these models
being highly successful in critical applications like medical diagnosis and
financial risk prediction, there is a natural push toward their wider adoption
in sensitive domains to instill greater trust among diverse stakeholders.
However, recent research has uncovered significant limitations in the structure
of such networks, their training procedure, underlying assumptions, and their
susceptibility to adversarial vulnerabilities. In particular, issues such as
concept leakage, entangled representations, and limited robustness to
perturbations pose challenges to their reliability and generalization.
Additionally, the effectiveness of human interventions in these models remains
an open question, raising concerns about their real-world applicability. In
this paper, we provide a comprehensive survey on the risks and limitations
associated with Concept-based Models. In particular, we focus on aggregating
commonly encountered challenges and the architecture choices mitigating these
challenges for Supervised and Unsupervised paradigms. We also examine recent

Motivation: Ensure reliable performance and improve explainability for deep learning models in open-world scenarios.

Method: Proposing probabilistic reasoning using MLNs to aid OOD detection, and introducing an algorithm for learning logical constraints from datasets.

Result: MLNs boost performance across various OOD detectors while retaining computational efficiency.

Conclusion: Integrating MLNs into OOD detection improves results and explainability, supported by experiments on multiple datasets.

Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is essential for ensuring the reliability
of deep learning models operating in open-world scenarios. Current OOD
detectors mainly rely on statistical models to identify unusual patterns in the
latent representations of a deep neural network. This work proposes to augment
existing OOD detectors with probabilistic reasoning, utilizing Markov logic
networks (MLNs). MLNs connect first-order logic with probabilistic reasoning to
assign probabilities to inputs based on weighted logical constraints defined
over human-understandable concepts, which offers improved explainability.
Through extensive experiments on multiple datasets, we demonstrate that MLNs
can significantly enhance the performance of a wide range of existing OOD
detectors while maintaining computational efficiency. Furthermore, we introduce
a simple algorithm for learning logical constraints for OOD detection from a
dataset and showcase its effectiveness.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current concrete creep prediction models fail to capture the sequential nature of deformation, necessitating better approaches.

Method: A Triple Attention Transformer incorporating temporal, feature, and batch attention mechanisms was employed to model concrete creep as an autoregressive sequence.

Result: The model achieved a mean absolute percentage error of 1.63% and R2 of 0.999, outperforming traditional and machine learning methods on experimental datasets spanning 160 days.

Conclusion: This study proves that transformer architectures can revolutionize structural prediction methods in materials science, offering exceptional accuracy and practical usability through a web-based interface.

Abstract: This paper presents a novel Triple Attention Transformer Architecture for
predicting time-dependent concrete creep, addressing fundamental limitations in
current approaches that treat time as merely an input parameter rather than
modeling the sequential nature of deformation development. By transforming
concrete creep prediction into an autoregressive sequence modeling task similar
to language processing, our architecture leverages the transformer's
self-attention mechanisms to capture long-range dependencies in historical
creep patterns. The model implements a triple-stream attention framework
incorporating temporal attention for sequential progression, feature attention
for material property interactions, and batch attention for inter-sample
relationships. Evaluated on experimental datasets with standardized daily
measurements spanning 160 days, the architecture achieves exceptional
performance with mean absolute percentage error of 1.63% and R2 values of 0.999
across all datasets, substantially outperforming traditional empirical models
and existing machine learning approaches. Ablation studies confirm the critical
role of attention mechanisms, with attention pooling contributing most
significantly to model performance. SHAP analysis reveals Young's modulus as
the primary predictive feature, followed by density and compressive strength,
providing interpretability essential for engineering applications. A deployed
web-based interface facilitates practical implementation, enabling real-time
predictions using standard laboratory parameters. This work establishes the
viability of applying transformer architectures to materials science problems,
demonstrating the potential for data-driven approaches to revolutionize
structural behavior prediction and engineering design practices.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address growing concerns about the cost, efficiency, and sustainability of LLM-based AI agents, which rely on adaptive multi-step reasoning processes, and to quantify their resource and infrastructure demands.

Method: Conducted a comprehensive system-level analysis, evaluating resource usage, latency, energy consumption, and datacenter power demands across diverse AI agent designs and testing configurations.

Result: The study shows increased compute improves accuracy but leads to diminishing returns in performance, greater latency variance, and unsustainable infrastructure costs, underscoring a looming sustainability crisis.

Conclusion: A shift in AI agent design is necessary, focusing on compute-efficient reasoning that balances accuracy with real-world deployability constraints.

Abstract: Large-language-model (LLM)-based AI agents have recently showcased impressive
versatility by employing dynamic reasoning, an adaptive, multi-step process
that coordinates with external tools. This shift from static, single-turn
inference to agentic, multi-turn workflows broadens task generalization and
behavioral flexibility, but it also introduces serious concerns about
system-level cost, efficiency, and sustainability. This paper presents the
first comprehensive system-level analysis of AI agents, quantifying their
resource usage, latency behavior, energy consumption, and datacenter-wide power
consumption demands across diverse agent designs and test-time scaling
strategies. We further characterize how AI agent design choices, such as
few-shot prompting, reflection depth, and parallel reasoning, impact
accuracy-cost tradeoffs. Our findings reveal that while agents improve accuracy
with increased compute, they suffer from rapidly diminishing returns, widening
latency variance, and unsustainable infrastructure costs. Through detailed
evaluation of representative agents, we highlight the profound computational
demands introduced by AI agent workflows, uncovering a looming sustainability
crisis. These results call for a paradigm shift in agent design toward
compute-efficient reasoning, balancing performance with deployability under
real-world constraints.

is costly and impractical. Mechanistic interpretability enables inference-time
control through latent activation steering, yet its potential for precise,
customizable safety adjustments remains largely untapped. This paper
investigates an approach called SafeSteer for guiding the outputs of LLMs by:
(i) leveraging category-specific steering vectors for more precise control,
(ii) employing a simple, gradient-free unsupervised method to enhance safety
steering while preserving text quality, topic relevance, and without explicit
refusal, and (iii) accomplishing this without a hard requirement of contrastive
pairwise safe data. We also highlight that our method, being simple and
effective, aligns with recent studies suggesting that simple techniques often
outperform more complex ones in activation steering. We showcase the
effectiveness of our approach across various LLMs, datasets, and risk
categories, demonstrating its ability to provide precise control, prevent
blanket refusals, and guide models toward generating safe content while
maintaining topic relevance.

### [274] [Localized Forest Fire Risk Prediction: A Department-Aware Approach for Operational Decision Support](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04254)
*Nicolas Caron,Christophe Guyeux,Hassan Noura,Benjamin Aynes*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper addresses the challenge of forest fire prediction by proposing models tailored to regional, departmental contexts, focusing on operational usability in firefighting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The increasing intensity and frequency of wildfires due to climate change make precise forest fire predictions critical, particularly for regional firefighting planning and intervention.

Method: The study uses state-of-the-art AI models to create the first national-scale benchmark for metropolitan France, utilizing a novel, relatively unexplored dataset.

Result: The proposed approach successfully offers region-specific, actionable fire risk assessments sensitive to local conditions, advancing beyond the traditional binary classification of fire risks.

Conclusion: Localized and operationally focused fire prediction models improve actionability for end-users like firefighters, and promising areas for further exploration are identified.

Abstract: Forest fire prediction involves estimating the likelihood of fire ignition or
related risk levels in a specific area over a defined time period. With climate
change intensifying fire behavior and frequency, accurate prediction has become
one of the most pressing challenges in Artificial Intelligence (AI).
Traditionally, fire ignition is approached as a binary classification task in
the literature. However, this formulation oversimplifies the problem,
especially from the perspective of end-users such as firefighters. In general,
as is the case in France, firefighting units are organized by department, each
with its terrain, climate conditions, and historical experience with fire
events. Consequently, fire risk should be modeled in a way that is sensitive to
local conditions and does not assume uniform risk across all regions. This
paper proposes a new approach that tailors fire risk assessment to departmental
contexts, offering more actionable and region-specific predictions for
operational use. With this, we present the first national-scale AI benchmark
for metropolitan France using state-of-the-art AI models on a relatively
unexplored dataset. Finally, we offer a summary of important future works that
should be taken into account. Supplementary materials are available on GitHub.

*Cliff B. Abbott,Mark Elo,Dmytro A. Bozhko*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces Perturbative Gradient Training (PGT), a novel paradigm allowing gradient-based training for physical reservoirs without backpropagation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to resolve a major limitation in physical reservoir computing, which is the inability to use backpropagation for training, hindering its integration into advanced neural networks.

Method: PGT employs random perturbations in the parameter space for gradient approximation, relying solely on forward passes inspired by perturbation theory in physics.

Result: PGT is shown to be effective on simulated networks such as dense models and transformers, as well as experimental setups like magnonic hardware, achieving performance comparable to backpropagation.

Conclusion: PGT offers a viable method to integrate physical reservoirs into complex neural architectures, enabling energy-efficient AI training without reliance on backpropagation.

Abstract: We introduce Perturbative Gradient Training (PGT), a novel training paradigm
that overcomes a critical limitation of physical reservoir computing: the
inability to perform backpropagation due to the black-box nature of physical
reservoirs. Drawing inspiration from perturbation theory in physics, PGT uses
random perturbations in the network's parameter space to approximate gradient
updates using only forward passes. We demonstrate the feasibility of this
approach on both simulated neural network architectures, including a dense
network and a transformer model with a reservoir layer, and on experimental
hardware using a magnonic auto-oscillation ring as the physical reservoir. Our
results show that PGT can achieve performance comparable to that of standard
backpropagation methods in cases where backpropagation is impractical or
impossible. PGT represents a promising step toward integrating physical
reservoirs into deeper neural network architectures and achieving significant
energy efficiency gains in AI training.

*Jingyang Li,Guoqiang Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MUC-G4 is a novel method for verifying compressed neural networks by leveraging minimal unsat cores to improve proof efficiency and speed.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a need to ensure the reliability of neural networks deployed on resource-constrained edge devices, which require compression techniques like quantization and pruning.

Method: The paper introduces MUC-G4, a framework that translates network compression into SMT formulas, classifies changes, and utilizes Minimal Unsat Cores from the original network for verifying compressed networks incrementally.

Result: Experimental findings demonstrate that MUC-G4 successfully handles both quantization and pruning, achieving high proof reuse rates and significant speedup in verification compared to other methods.

Conclusion: MUC-G4 is a useful tool for efficient verification of compressed deep neural networks, making models safer and more reliable for practical use.

Abstract: The rapid development of deep learning has led to challenges in deploying
neural networks on edge devices, mainly due to their high memory and runtime
complexity. Network compression techniques, such as quantization and pruning,
aim to reduce this complexity while maintaining accuracy. However, existing
incremental verification methods often focus only on quantization and struggle
with structural changes. This paper presents MUC-G4 (Minimal Unsat Core-Guided
Incremental Verification), a novel framework for incremental verification of
compressed deep neural networks. It encodes both the original and compressed
networks into SMT formulas, classifies changes, and use \emph{Minimal Unsat
Cores (MUCs)} from the original network to guide efficient verification for the
compressed network. Experimental results show its effectiveness in handling
quantization and pruning, with high proof reuse rates and significant speedup
in verification time compared to traditional methods. MUC-G4 hence offers a
promising solution for ensuring the safety and reliability of compressed neural
networks in practical applications.

### [277] [Relational reasoning and inductive bias in transformers trained on a transitive inference task](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04289)
*Jesse Geerts,Stephanie Chan,Claudia Clopath,Kimberly Stachenfeld*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper examines how transformer-based models perform relational reasoning tasks, such as transitive inference, comparing two learning regimes: in-weights learning (IWL) and in-context learning (ICL).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to unravel how transformers undertake relational reasoning tasks, particularly transitive inference, and to understand the differences in reasoning between two learning approaches.

Method: The authors compared behavior and mechanisms between IWL models, which generalize transitive relationships through stored parameters, and ICL models, which encode relations from input sequences, using psychological-style tasks and experimentation.

Result: IWL models naturally generalize transitive relationships, while ICL models initially fail to do so. Pre-training on structured tasks improves ICL generalization to in-context transitive reasoning and mimics human-like performance patterns.

Conclusion: Structured pre-training reinforces transformers’ capacity for in-context relational reasoning, enabling behaviors similar to human inference without dependency on induction circuits.

Abstract: Transformer-based models have demonstrated remarkable reasoning abilities,
but the mechanisms underlying relational reasoning in different learning
regimes remain poorly understood. In this work, we investigate how transformers
perform a classic relational reasoning task from the Psychology literature,
\textit{transitive inference}, which requires inference about indirectly
related items by integrating information across observed adjacent item pairs
(e.g., if A>B and B>C, then A>C). We compare transitive inference behavior
across two distinct learning regimes: in-weights learning (IWL), where models
store information in network parameters, and in-context learning (ICL), where
models flexibly utilize information presented within the input sequence. Our
findings reveal that IWL naturally induces a generalization bias towards
transitive inference, despite being trained only on adjacent items, whereas ICL
models trained solely on adjacent items do not generalize transitively.
Mechanistic analysis shows that ICL models develop induction circuits that
implement a simple match-and-copy strategy that performs well at relating
adjacent pairs, but does not encoding hierarchical relationships among
indirectly related items. Interestingly, when pre-trained on in-context linear
regression tasks, transformers successfully exhibit in-context generalizable
transitive inference. Moreover, like IWL, they display both \textit{symbolic
distance} and \textit{terminal item effects} characteristic of human and animal
performance, without forming induction circuits. These results suggest that
pre-training on tasks with underlying structure promotes the development of
representations that can scaffold in-context relational reasoning.

Motivation: The aim of this research is to understand the role of the sampling distribution in DPO and its influence on the training dynamics to improve optimization efficiency and policy learning.

Method: The authors analyze response distributions in DPO, propose a simplified alignment model to study gradient signal amplification, and validate their findings with theoretical analysis and experiments.

Result: The study reveals that high-quality responses lead to amplified gradient signals, optimizing the landscape for effective policy learning. The findings also support the effectiveness of the online DPO framework.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that the quality and support of the sampling distribution crucially affect DPO's performance, providing theoretical and empirical insights into enhancing policy optimization.

Abstract: We study the role of the sampling distribution in Direct Preference
Optimization (DPO) and aim to understand its impact on DPO's training dynamics.
Our analyses show that both the solution space and the convergence behavior of
DPO depend on the support and quality of the generating distribution. We first
analyze how distribution of responses influences policy updates during gradient
descent, drawing connections to common phenomena found in practice. We then
design a simplified yet well-structured alignment model as a proxy, and develop
quantitative results showing how more frequent high-quality responses amplify
the gradient signal and improve the optimization landscape, leading to more
effective policy learning. Our theoretical findings are supported by empirical
experiments and provide a principled justification for the online DPO framework
in practice.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces SF2Bench, a comprehensive dataset on compound floods in South Florida, enabling improved flood forecasting through machine learning methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the challenges of forecasting compound floods caused by limited datasets and inefficiency in traditional physics-based models.

Method: SF2Bench integrates four key factors (tide, rainfall, groundwater, human management activities) and evaluates six machine learning modeling approaches, including neural networks and transformers.

Result: The study demonstrates the importance of different features and analyzes the performance of various modeling paradigms in capturing temporal and spatial dependencies.

Conclusion: SF2Bench highlights the potential of machine learning in improving compound flood forecasting, facilitating more accurate and efficient predictions.

Abstract: Forecasting compound floods presents a significant challenge due to the
intricate interplay of meteorological, hydrological, and oceanographic factors.
Analyzing compound floods has become more critical as the global climate
increases flood risks. Traditional physics-based methods, such as the
Hydrologic Engineering Center's River Analysis System, are often
time-inefficient. Machine learning has recently demonstrated promise in both
modeling accuracy and computational efficiency. However, the scarcity of
comprehensive datasets currently hinders systematic analysis. Existing
water-related datasets are often limited by a sparse network of monitoring
stations and incomplete coverage of relevant factors. To address this
challenge, we introduce SF2Bench, a comprehensive time series collection on
compound floods in South Florida, which integrates four key factors: tide,
rainfall, groundwater, and human management activities (gate and pump
controlling). This integration allows for a more detailed analysis of the
individual contributions of these drivers to compound flooding and informs the
development of improved flood forecasting approaches. To comprehensively
evaluate the potential of various modeling paradigms, we assess the performance
of six categories of methods, encompassing Multilayer Perceptrons,
Convolutional Neural Networks, Recurrent Neural Networks, Graph Neural
Networks, Transformers, and Large Language Models. We verified the impact of
different key features on flood forecasting through experiments. Our analysis
examines temporal and spatial aspects, providing insights into the influence of
historical data and spatial dependencies. The varying performance across these
approaches underscores the diverse capabilities of each in capturing complex
temporal and spatial dependencies inherent in compound floods.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation of the paper is to address practical challenges in deploying large language models (LLMs) for inference, specifically the balance between cost efficiency and generation speed.

Method: The authors develop a detailed theoretical model that incorporates constraints such as arithmetic, memory and network bandwidth, and latency. It then explores various parallelism setups and batch sizes to identify optimal configurations.

Result: The model computes Pareto frontiers illustrating the trade-off between serial inference speed and cost efficiency for popular LLMs.

Conclusion: The study provides insights and a framework to help optimize deployment strategies of LLMs, enabling stakeholders to achieve desired trade-offs at scale.

Abstract: We develop a theoretical model that addresses the economic trade-off between
cost per token versus serial token generation speed when deploying LLMs for
inference at scale. Our model takes into account arithmetic, memory bandwidth,
network bandwidth and latency constraints; and optimizes over different
parallelism setups and batch sizes to find the ones that optimize serial
inference speed at a given cost per token. We use the model to compute Pareto

*Luca Ghafourpour,Valentin Duruisseaux,Bahareh Tolooshams,Philip H. Wong,Costas A. Anastassiou,Anima Anandkumar*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces NOBLE, a neural operator framework that efficiently models neural variability and dynamics using a biophysically realistic approach validated on experimental data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current neuron modeling approaches face limitations due to variability and computational inefficiencies, hindering advancements in understanding neural mechanisms.

Method: NOBLE leverages a neural operator framework trained on realistic neuronal data and maps neuron features to somatic voltage responses while addressing intrinsic variability.

Result: NOBLE achieves a 4200× speedup compared to traditional numerical solvers, efficiently modeling neural dynamics with consistency to experimental responses.

Conclusion: NOBLE enables scalable and realistic neuron modeling, contributing to advancements in neuroscience research, neuromorphic architectures, and neuroAI applications.

Abstract: Characterizing the diverse computational properties of human neurons via
multimodal electrophysiological, transcriptomic, and morphological data
provides the foundation for constructing and validating bio-realistic neuron
models that can advance our understanding of fundamental mechanisms underlying
brain function. However, current modeling approaches remain constrained by the
limited availability and intrinsic variability of experimental neuronal data.
To capture variability, ensembles of deterministic models are often used, but
are difficult to scale as model generation requires repeating computationally
expensive optimization for each neuron. While deep learning is becoming
increasingly relevant in this space, it fails to capture the full biophysical
complexity of neurons, their nonlinear voltage dynamics, and variability. To
address these shortcomings, we introduce NOBLE, a neural operator framework
that learns a mapping from a continuous frequency-modulated embedding of
interpretable neuron features to the somatic voltage response induced by
current injection. Trained on data generated from biophysically realistic
neuron models, NOBLE predicts distributions of neural dynamics accounting for
the intrinsic experimental variability. Unlike conventional bio-realistic
neuron models, interpolating within the embedding space offers models whose
dynamics are consistent with experimentally observed responses. NOBLE is the
first scaled-up deep learning framework validated on real experimental data,
enabling efficient generation of synthetic neurons that exhibit trial-to-trial
variability and achieve a $4200\times$ speedup over numerical solvers. To this
end, NOBLE captures fundamental neural properties, opening the door to a better
understanding of cellular composition and computations, neuromorphic
architectures, large-scale brain circuits, and general neuroAI applications.

*Runxiang Wang,Boxiao Wang,Kai Li,Yifan Zhang,Jian Cheng*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DrSR, a symbolic regression model, combines data-driven insights and reflective learning to improve equation discovery and surpasses prior methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome limitations in LLM-based symbolic regression methods, such as over-reliance on internal priors and lack of explicit data analysis.

Method: DrSR integrates structural data analysis and a feedback loop to refine equation generation, enhancing the exploration of symbolic expressions.

Result: Experiments indicate higher accuracy, generalization, and search efficiency across datasets in multiple scientific disciplines compared to classical and LLM-based methods.

Conclusion: By combining data understanding and reflective learning, DrSR enhances symbolic regression, making it a promising tool for scientific equation discovery.

Abstract: Symbolic regression is a fundamental tool for discovering interpretable
mathematical expressions from data, with broad applications across scientific
and engineering domains. Recently, large language models (LLMs) have
demonstrated strong performance in this task, leveraging embedded scientific
priors and reasoning capabilities to surpass traditional methods. However,
existing LLM-based approaches, such as LLM-SR, often over-rely on internal
priors, lacking explicit data understanding and systematic reflection during
equation generation. To address these limitations, we propose DrSR (Dual
Reasoning Symbolic Regression), a framework that combines data-driven insight
with reflective learning to enhance both robustness and discovery capability.
Specifically, DrSR guides LLMs to analyze structural relationships (e.g.,
monotonicity, nonlinearity, and correlation) within the data to generate
structured descriptions. Simultaneously, it monitors equation performance and
establishes a feedback loop to refine subsequent generations. By integrating
data understanding and generation reflection in a closed loop, DrSR enables
more efficient exploration of the symbolic expression space. Experiments across
interdisciplinary datasets in physics, chemistry, biology, and materials
science demonstrate that DrSR substantially improves the valid equation rate
and consistently outperforms both classical and recent LLM-based methods in
terms of accuracy, generalization, and search efficiency. These results
underscore its potential for scientific equation discovery.

### [283] [Grokking and Generalization Collapse: Insights from \texttt{HTSR} theory](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04434)
*Hari K. Prakash,Charles H. Martin*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces a novel phenomenon, 'anti-grokking,' observed in late-stage neural network training, characterized by a collapse in test accuracy while training accuracy remains perfect. A unique metric, HTSR α, is proposed to identify and measure this phase.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to investigate and extend the understanding of grokking phenomena in neural networks by identifying a previously unknown phase, 'anti-grokking,' which addresses challenges related to overfitting and generalization collapse.

Method: The paper analyzes a 3-layer MLP model trained on a MNIST subset, utilizing Heavy-Tailed Self-Regularization (HTSR) through the WeightWatcher tool to measure different phases of neural network training, especially focusing on spectral density and correlation traps.

Result: The HTSR α metric successfully identifies all three phases of grokking, including the newly discovered anti-grokking phase, while other metrics fail to detect test accuracy collapse during this phase.

Conclusion: HTSR α emerges as a universal and reliable measure for capturing layer convergence and detecting overfitting/generalization collapse, enhancing the ability to assess neural network training phases without relying on test data.

Abstract: We study the well-known grokking phenomena in neural networks (NNs) using a
3-layer MLP trained on 1 k-sample subset of MNIST, with and without weight
decay, and discover a novel third phase -- \emph{anti-grokking} -- that occurs
very late in training and resembles but is distinct from the familiar
\emph{pre-grokking} phases: test accuracy collapses while training accuracy
stays perfect. This late-stage collapse is distinct, from the known
pre-grokking and grokking phases, and is not detected by other proposed
grokking progress measures. Leveraging Heavy-Tailed Self-Regularization HTSR
through the open-source WeightWatcher tool, we show that the HTSR layer quality
metric $\alpha$ alone delineates all three phases, whereas the best competing
metrics detect only the first two. The \emph{anti-grokking} is revealed by
training for $10^7$ and is invariably heralded by $\alpha < 2$ and the
appearance of \emph{Correlation Traps} -- outlier singular values in the
randomized layer weight matrices that make the layer weight matrix atypical and
signal overfitting of the training set. Such traps are verified by visual
inspection of the layer-wise empirical spectral densities, and by using
Kolmogorov--Smirnov tests on randomized spectra. Comparative metrics, including
activation sparsity, absolute weight entropy, circuit complexity, and $l^2$
weight norms track pre-grokking and grokking but fail to distinguish grokking
from anti-grokking. This discovery provides a way to measure overfitting and
generalization collapse without direct access to the test data. These results
strengthen the claim that the \emph{HTSR} $\alpha$ provides universal
layer-convergence target at $\alpha \approx 2$ and underscore the value of
using the HTSR alpha $(\alpha)$ metric as a measure of generalization.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the connection between generative diffusion models and associative memory systems, and to characterize stability and transitions in such systems as noise levels approach zero.

Method: The study leverages Morse-Smale dynamical systems as universal approximators and examines behavior under diminishing noise, using examples from gradient-based systems and Hopfield networks.

Result: It reveals universal properties of memory systems under low noise and establishes structural stability, indicating stability except at isolated bifurcation points for learning and generation landscapes.

Conclusion: The research characterizes stable transitions in associative memory and generative diffusion models, providing criteria for structural stability applicable to models like Hopfield networks and attention mechanisms.

Abstract: Connections between generative diffusion and continuous-state associative
memory models are studied. Morse-Smale dynamical systems are emphasized as
universal approximators of gradient-based associative memory models and
diffusion models as white-noise perturbed systems thereof. Universal properties
of associative memory that follow from this description are described and used
to characterize a generic transition from generation to memory as noise levels
diminish. Structural stability inherited by Morse-Smale flows is shown to imply
a notion of stability for diffusions at vanishing noise levels. Applied to one-
and two-parameter families of gradients, this indicates stability at all but
isolated points of associative memory learning landscapes and the learning and
generation landscapes of diffusion models with gradient drift in the zero-noise
limit, at which small sets of generic bifurcations characterize qualitative
transitions between stable systems. Examples illustrating the characterization
of these landscapes by sequences of these bifurcations are given, along with
structural stability criterion for classic and modern Hopfield networks
(equivalently, the attention mechanism).

TL;DR: The paper proposes a Physics Aware Neuromorphic Network (PANN) to detect disaster-induced changes in satellite images, allowing prioritized data transmission with low latency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address the bottleneck in bandwidth-limited downlinking of satellite data to ground stations, which affects timely decision-making in natural disaster management.

Method: The proposed PANN detects changes using a sequence of multi-spectral images and memristor-inspired physics principles to generate change maps. The model is training-free and operates with minimal computational resources.

Result: The PANN demonstrated comparable or superior performance to a state-of-the-art AI model in detecting natural disaster changes across multiple categories.

Conclusion: PANN offers a resource-efficient, training-free solution for onboard satellite image processing, enabling timely and prioritized disaster data transmission.

Abstract: Earth observations from low Earth orbit satellites provide vital information
for decision makers to better manage time-sensitive events such as natural
disasters. For the data to be most effective for first responders, low latency
is required between data capture and its arrival to decision makers. A major
bottleneck is in the bandwidth-limited downlinking of the data from satellites
to ground stations. One approach to overcome this challenge is to process at
least some of the data on-board and prioritise pertinent data to be downlinked.
In this work we propose a Physics Aware Neuromorphic Network (PANN) to detect
changes caused by natural disasters from a sequence of multi-spectral satellite
images and produce a change map, enabling relevant data to be prioritised for
downlinking. The PANN used in this study is motivated by physical neural
networks comprised of nano-electronic circuit elements known as "memristors"
(nonlinear resistors with memory). The weights in the network are dynamic and
update in response to varying input signals according to memristor equations of
state and electrical circuit conservation laws. The PANN thus generates
physics-constrained dynamical output features which are used to detect changes
in a natural disaster detection task by applying a distance-based metric.
Importantly, this makes the whole model training-free, allowing it to be
implemented with minimal computing resources. The PANN was benchmarked against
a state-of-the-art AI model and achieved comparable or better results in each
natural disaster category. It thus presents a promising solution to the
challenge of resource-constrained on-board processing.

TL;DR: Orthogonalizing gradients during training improves model calibration metrics without losing accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address issues of model calibration and overconfidence in machine learning systems, especially under limited labeled data and robust scenarios.

Method: Introduce and analyze '$\perp$Grad', an approach that orthogonalizes gradients during training, and provide both empirical evidence and theoretical justification of its benefits.

Result: $
abla$Grad maintains accuracy comparable to SGD but enhances calibration metrics like reduced overconfidence and improved predictive entropy in standard and corrupted input scenarios.

Conclusion: $
abla$Grad is a promising optimizer-agnostic technique for superior calibration; it converges to points where confidence scaling, not boundary improvement, is essential for additional loss reduction.

Abstract: We provide evidence that orthogonalizing gradients during training improves
model calibration without sacrificing accuracy. On CIFAR-10 with 10% labeled
data, $\perp$Grad matches SGD in accuracy but yields consistently improved
calibration metrics such as lower test loss, reduced softmax overconfidence,
and higher predictive entropy. These benefits persist under input corruption
(CIFAR-10C) and extended training, where $\perp$Grad models degrade more
gracefully than SGD-trained counterparts. $\perp$Grad is optimizer-agnostic,
incurs minimal overhead, and works well with post-hoc calibration techniques
like temperature scaling.
  Theoretically, we prove convergence of a simplified version of $\perp$Grad
under mild assumptions and characterize its stationary points in positive
homogeneous networks: $\perp$Grad converges to solutions where further loss
reduction requires confidence scaling rather than decision boundary
improvement.

Motivation: The paper is motivated by the challenge of training large backbone models efficiently when adaptation datasets are scarce.

Method: The authors propose BAT, mathematically validate its feasibility, introduce a data selection scheme, and implement the ALBAT algorithm for adaptation training.

Result: BAT and the ALBAT algorithm demonstrate improved performance in personalization and language generation tasks, especially under data scarcity.

Conclusion: BAT is an effective strategy for leveraging pre-training data to overcome challenges in adaptation training due to limited data availability.

Abstract: Adaptations facilitate efficient training of large backbone models, including
diffusion models for image generation and transformer-based language models.
While various adaptation techniques enhance performance with minimal
computational resources, limited adaptation data often leads to challenges in
training. To address this, we focus on the enormous amount of backbone data
used to pre-train the backbone models. We propose Backbone Augmented Training
(BAT), a method that leverages backbone data to augment the adaptation dataset.
First, we formulate and prove two mathematical key propositions: one
establishes the validity of BAT, while the other identifies a condition under
which BAT benefits adaptation. Furthermore, we introduce an advanced data
selection scheme that satisfies these propositions and present ALBAT algorithm
to implement this approach. ALBAT efficiently enhances adaptation training in
both personalization and language generation tasks with scarce data.

Conclusion: Structured workflows for unsupervised learning can lead to enhanced scientific discoveries and reproducibility, as demonstrated through the case study.

Abstract: Unsupervised machine learning is widely used to mine large, unlabeled

formulating validatable scientific questions, conducting robust data
preparation and exploration, using a range of modeling techniques, performing
rigorous validation by evaluating the stability and generalizability of
unsupervised learning conclusions, and promoting effective communication and
documentation of results to ensure reproducible scientific discoveries. To
illustrate our proposed workflow, we present a case study from astronomy,
seeking to refine globular clusters of Milky Way stars based upon their
chemical composition. Our case study highlights the importance of validation
and illustrates how the benefits of a carefully-designed workflow for
unsupervised learning can advance scientific discovery.

Forest-based temperature anomaly detection, developed using the previously
mentioned federated learning frameworks, aimed at small edge devices and IoT
systems running MicroPython. The system has been experimentally evaluated,
achieving over 96% accuracy in distinguishing normal from abnormal readings and
above 78% precision in detecting anomalies across all tested configurations,
while maintaining a memory usage below 160 KB during model training. These
results highlight its suitability for resource-constrained environments and
edge systems, while upholding federated learning principles of data privacy and
collaborative learning.

*Daniel Berg Thomsen,Adrien Taylor,Aymeric Dieuleveut*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper provides a rigorous and tight analysis of two popular error feedback methods, EF and EF^21, used to counteract convergence degradation in distributed learning with compressed communication.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address the computational bottleneck of communication in distributed learning by improving and analyzing strategies that mitigate degradation due to information compression.

Method: The authors find optimal Lyapunov functions that provide the best convergence rates for EF and EF^21, presenting sharp performance guarantees and conducting a rigorous comparison with compressed gradient descent.

Result: They achieve a precise mathematical understanding of the performance of EF and EF^21, with matching lower bounds for their convergence rates.

Conclusion: The findings provide insight into the efficiency of these error feedback schemes in distributed learning, offering a fair and thorough basis for comparing their efficiency with other strategies.

Abstract: Communication between agents often constitutes a major computational
bottleneck in distributed learning. One of the most common mitigation
strategies is to compress the information exchanged, thereby reducing
communication overhead. To counteract the degradation in convergence associated
with compressed communication, error feedback schemes -- most notably
$\mathrm{EF}$ and $\mathrm{EF}^{21}$ -- were introduced. In this work, we
provide a tight analysis of both of these methods. Specifically, we find the
Lyapunov function that yields the best possible convergence rate for each
method -- with matching lower bounds. This principled approach yields sharp
performance guarantees and enables a rigorous, apples-to-apples comparison
between $\mathrm{EF}$, $\mathrm{EF}^{21}$, and compressed gradient descent. Our
analysis is carried out in a simplified yet representative setting, which
allows for clean theoretical insights and fair comparison of the underlying
mechanisms.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper presents the LDPTRLQ algorithm, an integration of the Lyapunov Drift-Plus-Penalty method with reinforcement learning, demonstrating superior performance in balancing queue stability and long-term optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The growth of IoT devices introduces complex optimization challenges requiring novel approaches to balance stability and performance, motivating the adaptation of existing methods like Lyapunov Drift-Plus-Penalty for reinforcement learning.

Method: The authors combine the Lyapunov Drift-Plus-Penalty algorithm with reinforcement learning (RL) through rigorous theoretical analysis, developing the LDPTRLQ algorithm tailored for queue stability and long-term decision-making.

Result: Simulation results show that the LDPTRLQ algorithm outperforms baseline methods based solely on Lyapunov Drift-Plus-Penalty or RL frameworks in compatibility and stability across multiple test problems.

Conclusion: LDPTRLQ effectively integrates Lyapunov Drift-Plus-Penalty and RL approaches, offering superior theoretical and practical performance, particularly for IoT-related optimization problems necessitating queue stability.

Abstract: With the proliferation of Internet of Things (IoT) devices, the demand for
addressing complex optimization challenges has intensified. The Lyapunov
Drift-Plus-Penalty algorithm is a widely adopted approach for ensuring queue
stability, and some research has preliminarily explored its integration with
reinforcement learning (RL). In this paper, we investigate the adaptation of
the Lyapunov Drift-Plus-Penalty algorithm for RL applications, deriving an
effective method for combining Lyapunov Drift-Plus-Penalty with RL under a set
of common and reasonable conditions through rigorous theoretical analysis.
Unlike existing approaches that directly merge the two frameworks, our proposed
algorithm, termed Lyapunov drift-plus-penalty method tailored for reinforcement
learning with queue stability (LDPTRLQ) algorithm, offers theoretical
superiority by effectively balancing the greedy optimization of Lyapunov
Drift-Plus-Penalty with the long-term perspective of RL. Simulation results for
multiple problems demonstrate that LDPTRLQ outperforms the baseline methods
using the Lyapunov drift-plus-penalty method and RL, corroborating the validity
of our theoretical derivations. The results also demonstrate that our proposed
algorithm outperforms other benchmarks in terms of compatibility and stability.

*Xingwu Chen,Tianle Li,Difan Zou*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper investigates how Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) enhances reasoning in language models by optimizing the selection of effective reasoning patterns.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of clarity about how reinforcement learning improves reasoning abilities in large language models.

Method: The paper introduces RLVR, performs extensive experiments, and conducts theoretical analyses to understand its impact on reasoning patterns, providing insights into training dynamics and convergence regimes.

Result: RLVR-trained models favor reasoning patterns with higher success rates, while keeping performance stable. The paper identifies two convergence regimes depending on models' initial reasoning strength, and demonstrates the benefits of pre-training weaker models with supervised fine-tuning.

Conclusion: RLVR improves reasoning in language models by optimizing successful reasoning patterns, with theoretical and practical insights into training dynamics, paving the way for fine-tuning strategies.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has demonstrated remarkable success in enhancing
model capabilities, including instruction-following, preference learning, and
reasoning. Yet despite its empirical successes, the mechanisms by which RL
improves reasoning abilities remain poorly understood. We present a systematic
study of Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR), showing that
its primary benefit comes from optimizing the selection of existing reasoning
patterns. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that RLVR-trained
models preferentially adopt high-success-rate reasoning patterns while mostly
maintaining stable performance on individual patterns. We further develop
theoretical analyses on the convergence and training dynamics of RLVR based on
a simplified question-reason-answer model. We study the gradient flow and show
that RLVR can indeed find the solution that selects the reason pattern with the
highest success rate. Besides, our theoretical results
  reveal two distinct regimes regarding the convergence of RLVR training: (1)
rapid convergence for models with relatively strong initial reasoning
capabilities versus (2) slower optimization dynamics for weaker models.
Furthermore, we show that the slower optimization for weaker models can be
mitigated by applying the supervised fine-tuning (SFT) before RLVR, when using
a feasibly high-quality SFT dataset. We validate the theoretical findings
through extensive experiments. This work advances our theoretical understanding
of RL's role in LLM fine-tuning and offers insights for further enhancing
reasoning capabilities.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes AutoCT, a novel system for improving clinical trial predictions by blending explainable machine learning with large language models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Clinical trials are expensive and time-consuming, and accurate outcome prediction can help reduce costs and speed up drug discovery.

Method: AutoCT uses large language models for feature generation combined with Monte Carlo Tree Search for iterative optimization in a fully autonomous framework.

Result: AutoCT matches or outperforms state-of-the-art methods in clinical trial prediction with minimal self-refinement iterations.

Conclusion: AutoCT offers a scalable, interpretable, and cost-efficient solution for clinical trial outcome prediction, setting a new standard in the field.

Abstract: Clinical trials are critical for advancing medical treatments but remain
prohibitively expensive and time-consuming. Accurate prediction of clinical
trial outcomes can significantly reduce research and development costs and
accelerate drug discovery. While recent deep learning models have shown promise
by leveraging unstructured data, their black-box nature, lack of
interpretability, and vulnerability to label leakage limit their practical use
in high-stakes biomedical contexts. In this work, we propose AutoCT, a novel
framework that combines the reasoning capabilities of large language models
with the explainability of classical machine learning. AutoCT autonomously
generates, evaluates, and refines tabular features based on public information
without human input. Our method uses Monte Carlo Tree Search to iteratively
optimize predictive performance. Experimental results show that AutoCT performs
on par with or better than SOTA methods on clinical trial prediction tasks
within only a limited number of self-refinement iterations, establishing a new
paradigm for scalable, interpretable, and cost-efficient clinical trial
prediction.

*José Manuel de Frutos,Manuel A. Vázquez,Pablo M. Olmos,Joaquín Míguez*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces dual-ISL, a likelihood-free objective for training implicit generative models, with unique theoretical and practical advantages over classical methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations in existing rank-based metrics and implicit generative model training methods, particularly concerning continuity, convexity, and issues like mode collapse.

Method: The method reformulates the ISL framework, switching roles of target and model distributions to derive a convex optimization problem. It interprets the rank-based discrepancy $d_K$ as an $L^2$-projection and extends this to multivariate settings using sliced random projections, ensuring stability and performance.

Result: Dual-ISL provides a more stable and rapid training process, effectively mitigates mode collapse, and delivers explicit density approximations. It outperforms ISL and other implicit generative modeling methods on benchmarks.

Conclusion: Dual-ISL's convexity, continuity, and interpretability lead to superior practical performance and theoretical properties, making it a robust advancement for implicit generative modeling.

Abstract: Rank-based statistical metrics, such as the invariant statistical loss (ISL),
have recently emerged as robust and practically effective tools for training
implicit generative models. In this work, we introduce dual-ISL, a novel
likelihood-free objective for training implicit generative models that
interchanges the roles of the target and model distributions in the ISL
framework, yielding a convex optimization problem in the space of model
densities. We prove that the resulting rank-based discrepancy $d_K$ is i)
continuous under weak convergence and with respect to the $L^1$ norm, and ii)
convex in its first argument-properties not shared by classical divergences
such as KL or Wasserstein distances. Building on this, we develop a theoretical
framework that interprets $d_K$ as an $L^2$-projection of the density ratio $q
= p/\tilde p$ onto a Bernstein polynomial basis, from which we derive exact
bounds on the truncation error, precise convergence rates, and a closed-form
expression for the truncated density approximation. We further extend our
analysis to the multivariate setting via random one-dimensional projections,
defining a sliced dual-ISL divergence that retains both convexity and
continuity. We empirically show that these theoretical advantages translate
into practical ones. Specifically, across several benchmarks dual-ISL converges
more rapidly, delivers markedly smoother and more stable training, and more
effectively prevents mode collapse than classical ISL and other leading
implicit generative methods-while also providing an explicit density
approximation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To ensure grid stability amidst the renewable energy transition by enhancing accuracy in power demand forecasting.

Method: Clustered consumers by type (industrial, commercial, residential), performed feature selection with temporal, socio-economic, and weather data, and tested various AI/ML models for short-term and very short-term load forecasting.

Result: Proposed new forecasting approaches that outperform simpler models, demonstrating improved accuracy by using consumer-specific strategies and integrating detailed weather data.

Conclusion: Customized forecasting methods for varying consumer groups and incorporating weather details significantly improve power demand forecasting, aiding grid stability.

Abstract: Ensuring grid stability in the transition to renewable energy sources
requires accurate power demand forecasting. This study addresses the need for
precise forecasting by differentiating among industrial, commercial, and
residential consumers through customer clusterisation, tailoring the
forecasting models to capture the unique consumption patterns of each group. A
feature selection process is done for each consumer type including temporal,
socio-economic, and weather-related data obtained from the Copernicus Earth
Observation (EO) program. A variety of AI and machine learning algorithms for
Short-Term Load Forecasting (STLF) and Very Short-Term Load Forecasting (VSTLF)
are explored and compared, determining the most effective approaches. With all
that, the main contribution of this work are the new forecasting approaches
proposed, which have demonstrated superior performance compared to simpler
models, both for STLF and VSTLF, highlighting the importance of customized
forecasting strategies for different consumer groups and demonstrating the
impact of incorporating detailed weather data on forecasting accuracy. These
advancements contribute to more reliable power demand predictions, thereby

*N Guerin,M Nakhla,A Dehoux,J L Loyer*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a hybrid deep-learning framework for accurate short-term fleet capacity forecasting in open-pit mining by combining real-world telemetry, rainfall data, and synthetic breakdown scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for precise fleet capacity predictions in open-pit mining arises from the impact of uncertainties like weather, mechanical failures, and crew availability on operational efficiency.

Method: The authors propose a hybrid deep-learning framework using both XGBoost and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) architectures, incorporating data like rainfall measurements, fleet telemetry, and simulated breakdown scenarios. They also use SHAP value analysis to identify key predictors.

Result: The XGBoost model achieved a median absolute error (MedAE) of 14.3%, while the LSTM model had a MedAE of 15.1%. The integration of synthetic data and key features reduced prediction volatility.

Conclusion: The hybrid model showcases potential as an effective decision-support tool for mining operations, and future work aims to enhance its robustness by including maintenance, human resource, and scheduling factors.

Abstract: Accurate short-term forecasting of hauling-fleet capacity is crucial in
open-pit mining, where weather fluctuations, mechanical breakdowns, and
variable crew availability introduce significant operational uncertainties. We
propose a deep-learning framework that blends real-world operational records
(high-resolution rainfall measurements, fleet performance telemetry) with
synthetically generated mechanical-breakdown scenarios to enable the model to
capture fluctuating high-impact failure events. We evaluate two architectures:
an XGBoost regressor achieving a median absolute error (MedAE) of 14.3 per cent
and a Long Short-Term Memory network with a MedAE of 15.1 per cent. Shapley
Additive exPlanations (SHAP) value analyses identify cumulative rainfall,
historical payload trends, and simulated breakdown frequencies as dominant
predictors. Integration of simulated breakdown data and shift-planning features
notably reduces prediction volatility. Future work will further integrate
maintenance-scheduling indicators (Mean Time Between Failures, Mean Time to
Repair), detailed human resource data (operator absenteeism, crew efficiency
metrics), blast event scheduling, and other operational constraints to enhance
forecast robustness and adaptability. This hybrid modelling approach offers a
comprehensive decision-support tool for proactive, data-driven fleet management
under dynamically uncertain conditions.

*Artin Tajdini,Jonathan Scarlett,Kevin Jamieson*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The study examines stochastic linear bandits with heavy-tailed rewards and improves both upper and lower bounds on minimax regret compared to prior work. It develops a regret reduction algorithm and longer regret bounds for kernel methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Heavy-tailed stochastic rewards pose challenges in linear bandit frameworks due to the inability of existing methods to accurately bound minimax regret rates, motivating improved methodologies.

Method: A new elimination-based algorithm guided by experimental design to reduce regret for heavy-tailed linear bandit problems; establishment of improved upper and lower minimax regret bounds for finite and infinite action sets.

Result: Algorithm achieves $	ilde{\mathcal{O}}(d^{\frac{1+3\epsilon}{2(1+\epsilon)}} T^{\frac{1}{1+\epsilon}})$ regret improving $d$ dependence; lower bound derived $	extit{strict improved}$ from $	extit{others+ bounded-moment rates$.

Conclusion: This work advances understanding in heavy-tailed linear bandits, improving dependencies geometries strategies kernel-metric cases while provides sub-linearity regressions bounds vs context ( $\le |/some+rules/

Abstract: We study stochastic linear bandits with heavy-tailed rewards, where the
rewards have a finite $(1+\epsilon)$-absolute central moment bounded by
$\upsilon$ for some $\epsilon \in (0,1]$. We improve both upper and lower
bounds on the minimax regret compared to prior work. When $\upsilon =
\mathcal{O}(1)$, the best prior known regret upper bound is
$\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(d T^{\frac{1}{1+\epsilon}})$. While a lower with the same
scaling has been given, it relies on a construction using $\upsilon =
\mathcal{O}(d)$, and adapting the construction to the bounded-moment regime
with $\upsilon = \mathcal{O}(1)$ yields only a
$\Omega(d^{\frac{\epsilon}{1+\epsilon}} T^{\frac{1}{1+\epsilon}})$ lower bound.
This matches the known rate for multi-armed bandits and is generally loose for
linear bandits, in particular being $\sqrt{d}$ below the optimal rate in the
finite-variance case ($\epsilon = 1$). We propose a new elimination-based
algorithm guided by experimental design, which achieves regret
$\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(d^{\frac{1+3\epsilon}{2(1+\epsilon)}}
T^{\frac{1}{1+\epsilon}})$, thus improving the dependence on $d$ for all
$\epsilon \in (0,1)$ and recovering a known optimal result for $\epsilon = 1$.
We also establish a lower bound of $\Omega(d^{\frac{2\epsilon}{1+\epsilon}}
T^{\frac{1}{1+\epsilon}})$, which strictly improves upon the multi-armed bandit
rate and highlights the hardness of heavy-tailed linear bandit problems. For
finite action sets, we derive similarly improved upper and lower bounds for
regret. Finally, we provide action set dependent regret upper bounds showing
that for some geometries, such as $l_p$-norm balls for $p \le 1 + \epsilon$, we
can further reduce the dependence on $d$, and we can handle
infinite-dimensional settings via the kernel trick, in particular establishing
new regret bounds for the Mat\'ern kernel that are the first to be sublinear
for all $\epsilon \in (0, 1]$.

*Abdourrahmane Mahamane Atto*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a 4-step method using softlog-softmax cascades to enhance ensemble learning systems' consistency and dependability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve the consistency, reliability, and decision-making capacity of next-generation ensemble learning models.

Method: The method involves four steps: (1) ensemble diversity based on convolutional frustum elements, (2) softlog-softmax layers for intermediate decisions, (3) softlog entropy measures for decision consistency, and (4) performance tensor for reliable evaluation.

Result: The approach improves intermediate decision-making consistency, calculates reliable entropy measures, and evaluates ensemble performance comprehensively.

Conclusion: Softlog-softmax cascades are crucial for advancing ensemble learning systems by improving diversity, consistency, and dependability.

Abstract: The paper proposes a 4-step process for highlighting that softlog-softmax
cascades can improve both consistency and dependability of the next generation
ensemble learning systems. The first process is anatomical in nature: the
target ensemble model under consideration is composed by canonical elements
relating to the definition of a convolutional frustum. No a priori is
considered in the choice of canonical forms. Diversity is the main criterion
for selecting these forms. It is shown that the more complex the problem, the
more useful this ensemble diversity is. The second process is physiological and
relates to neural engineering: a softlog is derived to both make weak
logarithmic operations consistent and lead, through multiple softlog-softmax
layers, to intermediate decisions in the sense of respecting the same class
logic as that faced by the output layer. The third process concerns neural
information theory: softlog-based entropy and divergence are proposed for the
sake of constructing information measures yielding consistent values on closed
intervals. These information measures are used to determine the relationships
between individual and sub-community decisions in frustum diversitybased
ensemble learning. The concluding process addresses the derivation of an
informative performance tensor for the purpose of a reliable ensemble
evaluation.

Motivation: To address the instability, reproducibility issues, and lack of a unified benchmark in Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)-based RFT methods for red teaming.

Method: The authors developed RedRFT, a lightweight benchmark combining features from CleanRL and Tianshou, and conducted ablation studies on key components like LoRA, KL divergence, and Lagrange Multiplier.

Result: RedRFT provides a standardized, modularized suite for implementing and evaluating RFT-based red teaming with various diversity metrics and intrinsic reward options.

Conclusion: RedRFT aims to enhance understanding of RFT methods' nuances and foster innovation and prototyping for red teaming strategies in LLMs.

Abstract: Red teaming has proven to be an effective method for identifying and
mitigating vulnerabilities in Large Language Models (LLMs). Reinforcement
Fine-Tuning (RFT) has emerged as a promising strategy among existing red
teaming techniques. However, a lack of a unified benchmark hinders current
RFT-based red teaming methods. Implementation details, especially in Proximal
Policy Optimization (PPO)-based RFT, significantly affect outcome stability and
reproducibility. To address this issue, we introduce RedRFT, a lightweight
benchmark designed to simplify and standardize the implementation and
evaluation of RFT-based red teaming. RedRFT combines the design strengths of
both single-file CleanRL and highly modularized Tianshou, offering high-quality
single-file red teaming implementations and modular PPO core components, such
as the General Advantage Estimator. It supports a variety of token and sentence
diversity metrics, featuring modularized intrinsic reward computation that
facilitates plug-and-play experimentation. To clarify their influence on RFT
performance, we conducted an extensive ablation study on key components,
including Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence, and
Lagrange Multiplier. We hope this work contributes to 1) gaining a
comprehensive understanding of the implementation nuances of RFT-based red
teaming algorithms, and 2) enabling rapid prototyping of innovative features
for RFT-based red teaming. Code for the benchmark can be accessed at

TL;DR: The paper introduces CREAM, a novel Concept Bottleneck Model (CBM) that uses human-specified concept relationships for reasoning and a side-channel for competitive task performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address limitations in current Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs) by ensuring model reasoning through explicit concept relationships and achieving competitive task performance.

Method: CREAM embeds human-specified relationships between concepts and between concepts and tasks, while using a regularized side-channel to manage performance and concept importance.

Result: Experiments show that CREAM leverages concepts for reasoning while achieving task performance comparable to traditional black-box models, with reduced concept leakage.

Conclusion: CREAM enhances interpretability and ensures desired model reasoning by embedding concept relationships and using a regulated side-channel for task accuracy.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose $\textbf{C}$oncept $\textbf{REA}$soning
$\textbf{M}$odels (CREAM), a novel family of Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs)
that: (i) explicitly encodes concept-concept (${\texttt{C-C}}$) and
concept-task (${\texttt{C$\rightarrow$Y}}$) relationships to enforce a desired
model reasoning; and (ii) use a regularized side-channel to achieve competitive
task performance, while keeping high concept importance. Specifically, CREAM
architecturally embeds (bi)directed concept-concept, and concept to task
relationships specified by a human expert, while severing undesired information
flows (e.g., to handle mutually exclusive concepts). Moreover, CREAM integrates
a black-box side-channel that is regularized to encourage task predictions to
be grounded in the relevant concepts, thereby utilizing the side-channel only
when necessary to enhance performance. Our experiments show that: (i) CREAM
mainly relies on concepts while achieving task performance on par with
black-box models; and (ii) the embedded ${\texttt{C-C}}$ and
${\texttt{C$\rightarrow$Y}}$ relationships ease model interventions and
mitigate concept leakage.

### [301] [You Only Train Once](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04349)
*Christos Sakaridis*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces YOTO (You Only Train Once), a method to optimize loss weight hyperparameters and network parameters simultaneously in one training run.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Many machine learning processes require multiple training runs with varying loss setups, which is inefficient. This paper aims to simplify the optimization process into a one-shot procedure, focusing on loss weights.

Method: The authors propose modeling loss weight hyperparameters as regular network parameters, optimizing them via gradient-based methods within an end-to-end framework. A novel regularization loss ensures uniformity and bounded values for the learned hyperparameters.

Result: YOTO demonstrates improved performance over traditional brute-force grid search methods in key computer vision tasks like 3D estimation and semantic segmentation, yielding better results on unseen test data.

Conclusion: YOTO successfully offers a novel way to optimize loss weight hyperparameters in one shot, showcasing potential improvement in training efficiency and model performance across computer vision tasks.

Abstract: The title of this paper is perhaps an overclaim. Of course, the process of
creating and optimizing a learned model inevitably involves multiple training
runs which potentially feature different architectural designs, input and
output encodings, and losses. However, our method, You Only Train Once (YOTO),
indeed contributes to limiting training to one shot for the latter aspect of
losses selection and weighting. We achieve this by automatically optimizing
loss weight hyperparameters of learned models in one shot via standard
gradient-based optimization, treating these hyperparameters as regular
parameters of the networks and learning them. To this end, we leverage the
differentiability of the composite loss formulation which is widely used for
optimizing multiple empirical losses simultaneously and model it as a novel
layer which is parameterized with a softmax operation that satisfies the
inherent positivity constraints on loss hyperparameters while avoiding
degenerate empirical gradients. We complete our joint end-to-end optimization
scheme by defining a novel regularization loss on the learned hyperparameters,
which models a uniformity prior among the employed losses while ensuring
boundedness of the identified optima. We evidence the efficacy of YOTO in
jointly optimizing loss hyperparameters and regular model parameters in one
shot by comparing it to the commonly used brute-force grid search across
state-of-the-art networks solving two key problems in computer vision, i.e. 3D
estimation and semantic segmentation, and showing that it consistently
outperforms the best grid-search model on unseen test data. Code will be made
publicly available.

*Shijian Xu,Marcello Massimo Negri,Volker Roth*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces NIMO, a model combining neural networks' predictive power with linear models' interpretability by learning nonlinear corrections while maintaining linear coefficients' interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enable interpretable models that leverage the predictive power of neural networks without sacrificing the interpretability of linear models.

Method: Develop a model where nonlinear corrections by a neural network complement linear models, coupled with an optimization algorithm utilizing profile likelihood and adaptive ridge regression for sparsity.

Result: Empirically, the method recovers linear coefficients with high accuracy while improving predictive performance compared to hybrid interpretable methods.

Conclusion: NIMO offers an advancement in interpretable machine learning by achieving the interpretability of linear models alongside superior predictive accuracy.

Abstract: Neural networks (NNs) have achieved tremendous success over the past decade,
yet they are still extremely difficult to interpret. In contrast, linear models
are less expressive but offer inherent interpretability. Linear coefficients
are interpretable as the marginal effect of a feature on the prediction,
assuming all other features are kept fixed. To combine the benefits of both
approaches, we introduce NIMO (Nonlinear Interpretable MOdel). The key idea is
to define a model where the NN is designed to learn nonlinear corrections to
the linear model predictions, while also maintaining the original
interpretability of the linear coefficients. Relevantly, we develop an
optimization algorithm based on profile likelihood that elegantly allows for
optimizing over the NN parameters while updating the linear coefficients
analytically. By relying on adaptive ridge regression we can easily incorporate
sparsity constraints as well. We show empirically that we can recover the
underlying linear coefficients while significantly improving the predictive
accuracy. Compared to other hybrid interpretable approaches, our model is the
only one that actually maintains the same interpretability of linear
coefficients as in linear models. We also achieve higher performance on various
regression and classification settings.

TL;DR: The paper introduces 'half' layers for deep networks, where some weights are fixed randomly and others are trainable, reducing the number of parameters and enhancing regularization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to simplify the architecture of deep networks by reducing the number of trainable parameters while maintaining performance.

Method: They design a new type of hidden unit that combines fixed random weights and trainable weights, using two adjustable parameters after processing inputs through a nonlinearity.

Result: Experiments on MNIST and FashionMNIST datasets show promising accuracy and reduced parameter requirements, demonstrating the potential of 'half' layers.

Conclusion: 'Half' layers offer a way to improve efficiency and regularization in deep networks, making them suitable for tasks with limited computational resources.

Abstract: We propose a ``half'' layer of hidden units that has some of its weights
randomly set and some of them trained. A half unit is composed of two stages:
First, it takes a weighted sum of its inputs with fixed random weights, and
second, the total activation is multiplied and then translated using two
modifiable weights, before the result is passed through a nonlinearity. The
number of modifiable weights of each hidden unit is thus two and does not
depend on the fan-in. We show how such half units can be used in the first or
any later layer in a deep network, possibly following convolutional layers. Our
experiments on MNIST and FashionMNIST data sets indicate the promise of half
layers, where we can achieve reasonable accuracy with a reduced number of
parameters due to the regularizing effect of the randomized connections.

*Marten Lienen,Abdullah Saydemir,Stephan Günnemann*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper enhances the HiPPO framework to handle noise in state-space models by introducing an uncertainty-aware initialization method.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The HiPPO framework struggles in noisy data environments because it assumes noise-free data, which is unrealistic in many practical applications.

Method: The authors reformulated the HiPPO problem by treating data as noisy outputs of a latent system instead of noise-free control signals, deriving a new dynamics initialization for state-space models without increasing computational runtime.

Result: The proposed initialization method improves the robustness of state-space models to noise during both training and inference.

Conclusion: The study extends HiPPO theory to incorporate measurement noise and demonstrates its effectiveness in making state-space models more resilient to noise.

Abstract: State space models are emerging as a dominant model class for sequence
problems with many relying on the HiPPO framework to initialize their dynamics.
However, HiPPO fundamentally assumes data to be noise-free; an assumption often
violated in practice. We extend the HiPPO theory with measurement noise and
derive an uncertainty-aware initialization for state space model dynamics. In
our analysis, we interpret HiPPO as a linear stochastic control problem where
the data enters as a noise-free control signal. We then reformulate the problem
so that the data become noisy outputs of a latent system and arrive at an
alternative dynamics initialization that infers the posterior of this latent
system from the data without increasing runtime. Our experiments show that our
initialization improves the resistance of state-space models to noise both at
training and inference time. Find our implementation at

*Uditansh Srivastava,Shivam Aryan,Shaurya Singh*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a composite reward function for financial trading reinforcement learning, balancing return and risk using multiple metrics beyond single-objective approaches like the Sharpe ratio.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of single-metric objectives (e.g., Sharpe ratio) in financial trading by developing a modular and parameterized reward function to better capture diverse investor preferences.

Method: A composite reward function is proposed with four differentiable terms and parameterized weights. Grid search is used to tune weights for specific risk-return profiles, and closed-form gradients are derived for gradient-based training.

Result: The framework allows encoding diverse preferences by adjusting weights and demonstrates key theoretical properties like monotonicity and modularity. Performance is analyzed in the context of complex trading environments.

Conclusion: This modular and flexible reward function design can serve as a general framework for multi-objective RL in trading and can be extended with additional risk measures or adaptive weights.

Abstract: We propose a novel composite reward function for reinforcement learning in
financial trading that balances return and risk using four differentiable
terms: annualized return downside risk differential return and the Treynor
ratio
  Unlike single metric objectives for example the Sharpe ratio our formulation
is modular and parameterized by weights w1 w2 w3 and w4 enabling practitioners
to encode diverse investor preferences
  We tune these weights via grid search to target specific risk return profiles
  We derive closed form gradients for each term to facilitate gradient based
training and analyze key theoretical properties including monotonicity
boundedness and modularity
  This framework offers a general blueprint for building robust multi objective
reward functions in complex trading environments and can be extended with
additional risk measures or adaptive weighting

*Clément Pierquin,Aurélien Bellet,Marc Tommasi,Matthieu Boussard*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores the privacy amplification of synthetic data generated by models with differential privacy guarantees using linear regression as a framework.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to establish a theoretical understanding of privacy amplification in synthetic data, which is empirically observed but lacks rigorous analysis.

Method: The study analyzes the privacy implications of synthetic data through linear regression, presenting both negative and positive results related to privacy leakage and amplification.

Result: It was found that synthetic data can amplify privacy if generated from random inputs with limited points released, but leaks information if the adversary controls the seed of the generative model.

Conclusion: The findings suggest that synthetic data's privacy amplification depends on how it is generated, providing a basis for further general exploration of privacy guarantees in synthetic data.

Abstract: Synthetic data inherits the differential privacy guarantees of the model used
to generate it. Additionally, synthetic data may benefit from privacy
amplification when the generative model is kept hidden. While empirical studies
suggest this phenomenon, a rigorous theoretical understanding is still lacking.
In this paper, we investigate this question through the well-understood
framework of linear regression. First, we establish negative results showing
that if an adversary controls the seed of the generative model, a single
synthetic data point can leak as much information as releasing the model
itself. Conversely, we show that when synthetic data is generated from random
inputs, releasing a limited number of synthetic data points amplifies privacy
beyond the model's inherent guarantees. We believe our findings in linear
regression can serve as a foundation for deriving more general bounds in the
future.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper reformulates the hyperDT algorithm in the Beltrami-Klein model, enabling compatibility with existing Euclidean tree models and improving performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance the usability and optimization of decision tree-based models in hyperbolic spaces.

Method: Re-express the hyperDT algorithm in the Beltrami-Klein model and implement it as a wrapper for existing Euclidean decision tree-based models.

Result: The wrapper approach allows compatibility with Euclidean optimizations, resulting in greater flexibility, speed, and accuracy.

Conclusion: The reformulation provides a simpler, maintainable, and extensible method for utilizing decision tree models in hyperbolic spaces, with practical implementation available.

Abstract: Decision trees and models that use them as primitives are workhorses of
machine learning in Euclidean spaces. Recent work has further extended these
models to the Lorentz model of hyperbolic space by replacing axis-parallel
hyperplanes with homogeneous hyperplanes when partitioning the input space. In
this paper, we show how the hyperDT algorithm can be elegantly reexpressed in
the Beltrami-Klein model of hyperbolic spaces. This preserves the thresholding
operation used in Euclidean decision trees, enabling us to further rewrite
hyperDT as simple pre- and post-processing steps that form a wrapper around
existing tree-based models designed for Euclidean spaces. The wrapper approach
unlocks many optimizations already available in Euclidean space models,
improving flexibility, speed, and accuracy while offering a simpler, more
maintainable, and extensible codebase. Our implementation is available at

### [308] [Transformers Meet In-Context Learning: A Universal Approximation Theory](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05200)
*Gen Li,Yuchen Jiao,Yu Huang,Yuting Wei,Yuxin Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper develops a universal approximation theory for understanding how transformers perform in-context learning and constructs a framework showing transformers' ability to adapt dynamically to tasks with a few examples.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the mechanism by which transformers enable in-context learning – learning new tasks at inference time without parameter updates.

Method: The authors devised a universal approximation framework for designing transformers capable of reliable predictions using in-context examples, without focusing on emulating optimization algorithms.

Result: The study demonstrates a construction method for transformers that ensures approximation guarantees beyond traditional algorithmic approaches, capable of handling diverse and non-convex function classes.

Conclusion: Transformers can achieve general-purpose learning and dynamic task adaptation through in-context examples, without being constrained by optimization-based approximations.

Abstract: Modern large language models are capable of in-context learning, the ability
to perform new tasks at inference time using only a handful of input-output
examples in the prompt, without any fine-tuning or parameter updates. We
develop a universal approximation theory to better understand how transformers
enable in-context learning. For any class of functions (each representing a
distinct task), we demonstrate how to construct a transformer that, without any
further weight updates, can perform reliable prediction given only a few
in-context examples. In contrast to much of the recent literature that frames
transformers as algorithm approximators -- i.e., constructing transformers to
emulate the iterations of optimization algorithms as a means to approximate
solutions of learning problems -- our work adopts a fundamentally different
approach rooted in universal function approximation. This alternative approach
offers approximation guarantees that are not constrained by the effectiveness
of the optimization algorithms being approximated, thereby extending far beyond
convex problems and linear function classes. Our construction sheds light on
how transformers can simultaneously learn general-purpose representations and
adapt dynamically to in-context examples.

### [309] [Replay Can Provably Increase Forgetting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04377)
*Yasaman Mahdaviyeh,James Lucas,Mengye Ren,Andreas S. Tolias,Richard Zemel,Toniann Pitassi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper examines sample replay in continual learning, showing it can reduce forgetting but also potentially harm performance under certain conditions even with linear and neural models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of performance degradation (forgetting) in machine learning systems trained sequentially on multiple tasks.

Method: Theoretical analysis of sample replay in over-parameterized linear regression settings and empirical tests with neural networks, focusing on replay samples' effects and task relationships.

Result: The study reveals that harmful replay can occur, leading to increased forgetting in worst-case or distributional settings with certain sample choices.

Conclusion: Replay sample selection and task relationships play critical roles in mitigating forgetting, and careless replay can sometimes be counterproductive.

Abstract: Continual learning seeks to enable machine learning systems to solve an
increasing corpus of tasks sequentially. A critical challenge for continual
learning is forgetting, where the performance on previously learned tasks
decreases as new tasks are introduced. One of the commonly used techniques to
mitigate forgetting, sample replay, has been shown empirically to reduce
forgetting by retaining some examples from old tasks and including them in new
training episodes. In this work, we provide a theoretical analysis of sample
replay in an over-parameterized continual linear regression setting, where each
task is given by a linear subspace and with enough replay samples, one would be
able to eliminate forgetting. Our analysis focuses on sample replay and
highlights the role of the replayed samples and the relationship between task
subspaces. Surprisingly, we find that, even in a noiseless setting, forgetting
can be non-monotonic with respect to the number of replay samples. We present
tasks where replay can be harmful with respect to worst-case settings, and also
in distributional settings where replay of randomly selected samples increases
forgetting in expectation. We also give empirical evidence that harmful replay
is not limited to training with linear models by showing similar behavior for a
neural networks equipped with SGD. Through experiments on a commonly used
benchmark, we provide additional evidence that, even in seemingly benign
scenarios, performance of the replay heavily depends on the choice of replay
samples and the relationship between tasks.

### [310] [Progressive Tempering Sampler with Diffusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05231)
*Severi Rissanen,RuiKang OuYang,Jiajun He,Wenlin Chen,Markus Heinonen,Arno Solin,José Miguel Hernández-Lobato*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes PTSD, a neural sampler system combining Progressive Tempering and Diffusion models to improve sampling efficiency and overcome limitations of traditional methods like Parallel Tempering.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing neural samplers underperform compared to MCMC methods like Parallel Tempering in terms of efficiency despite advancements, and PT requires rerunning for new samples, which is computationally expensive.

Method: The authors introduce PTSD, a method that sequentially trains diffusion models across temperatures and combines high-temperature samples incrementally refined with MCMC to train subsequent models efficiently.

Result: PTSD achieves a significant improvement in target evaluation efficiency while also outperforming current diffusion-based neural samplers.

Conclusion: PTSD effectively combines the strengths of PT and diffusion models, offering a more computationally efficient way to generate uncorrelated samples and overcome current system limitations.

Abstract: Recent research has focused on designing neural samplers that amortize the
process of sampling from unnormalized densities. However, despite significant
advancements, they still fall short of the state-of-the-art MCMC approach,
Parallel Tempering (PT), when it comes to the efficiency of target evaluations.
On the other hand, unlike a well-trained neural sampler, PT yields only
dependent samples and needs to be rerun -- at considerable computational cost
-- whenever new samples are required. To address these weaknesses, we propose
the Progressive Tempering Sampler with Diffusion (PTSD), which trains diffusion
models sequentially across temperatures, leveraging the advantages of PT to
improve the training of neural samplers. We also introduce a novel method to
combine high-temperature diffusion models to generate approximate
lower-temperature samples, which are minimally refined using MCMC and used to
train the next diffusion model. PTSD enables efficient reuse of sample
information across temperature levels while generating well-mixed, uncorrelated
samples. Our method significantly improves target evaluation efficiency,
outperforming diffusion-based neural samplers.

### [311] [Bridging the Performance Gap Between Target-Free and Target-Based Reinforcement Learning With Iterated Q-Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04398)
*Théo Vincent,Yogesh Tripathi,Tim Faust,Yaniv Oren,Jan Peters,Carlo D'Eramo*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes iterated Shared Q-Learning (iS-QL), which uses a modified target network to increase performance and memory efficiency in reinforcement learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional target networks in value-based RL ensure stability but occupy memory and limit adaptability. The challenge is to balance stability and performance while improving scalability.

Method: The paper introduces a shared target network where only the last linear layer is copied from the online network, while all other parameters remain shared. This approach incorporates concepts from iterated Q-learning, allowing consecutive Bellman iterations to be learned in parallel.

Result: iS-QL improves sample efficiency compared to target-free approaches, performs similarly to target-based algorithms, and has a smaller memory footprint.

Conclusion: iS-QL strikes a balance between the strengths of target-based and target-free reinforcement learning approaches, offering both scalability and strong performance.

Abstract: In value-based reinforcement learning, removing the target network is
tempting as the boostrapped target would be built from up-to-date estimates,
and the spared memory occupied by the target network could be reallocated to
expand the capacity of the online network. However, eliminating the target
network introduces instability, leading to a decline in performance. Removing
the target network also means we cannot leverage the literature developed
around target networks. In this work, we propose to use a copy of the last
linear layer of the online network as a target network, while sharing the
remaining parameters with the up-to-date online network, hence stepping out of
the binary choice between target-based and target-free methods. It enables us
to leverage the concept of iterated Q-learning, which consists of learning
consecutive Bellman iterations in parallel, to reduce the performance gap
between target-free and target-based approaches. Our findings demonstrate that
this novel method, termed iterated Shared Q-Learning (iS-QL), improves the
sample efficiency of target-free approaches across various settings.
Importantly, iS-QL requires a smaller memory footprint and comparable training
time to classical target-based algorithms, highlighting its potential to scale
reinforcement learning research.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores theoretical aspects of test-time strategies like self-consistency and self-correction for LLMs, and validates their effectiveness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing test-time strategies for LLMs are effective but lack theoretical understanding regarding sample efficiency.

Method: The paper compares self-consistency and best-of-$n$ strategies in sample requirements and investigates self-correction with verifier feedback for adaptability across tasks.

Result: Self-consistency requires $\Theta(1/\Delta^2)$ samples, while best-of-$n$ needs $\Theta(1/\Delta)$. Self-correction enables online multi-task learning and multi-expertise adaptability.

Conclusion: Self-correction broadens the application of LLMs to multi-task scenarios, validated through theoretical and empirical studies.

Abstract: Test-time scaling paradigms have significantly advanced the capabilities of
large language models (LLMs) on complex tasks. Despite their empirical success,
theoretical understanding of the sample efficiency of various test-time
strategies -- such as self-consistency, best-of-$n$, and self-correction --
remains limited. In this work, we first establish a separation result between
two repeated sampling strategies: self-consistency requires
$\Theta(1/\Delta^2)$ samples to produce the correct answer, while best-of-$n$
only needs $\Theta(1/\Delta)$, where $\Delta < 1$ denotes the probability gap
between the correct and second most likely answers. Next, we present an
expressiveness result for the self-correction approach with verifier feedback:
it enables Transformers to simulate online learning over a pool of experts at
test time. Therefore, a single Transformer architecture can provably solve
multiple tasks without prior knowledge of the specific task associated with a
user query, extending the representation theory of Transformers from
single-task to multi-task settings. Finally, we empirically validate our
theoretical results, demonstrating the practical effectiveness of
self-correction methods.

*Suzan Ece Ada,Emre Ugur*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: UMCNP is a new meta-reinforcement learning method that improves sample efficiency in settings where reward signals are unavailable during meta-testing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the challenge of few-shot meta-RL adaptation, particularly in scenarios where reward signals are absent during meta-testing.

Method: UMCNP integrates parameterized policy gradients and Conditional Neural Processes (CNPs). It reuses samples from meta-training offline to infer task dynamics during meta-testing.

Result: UMCNP demonstrates superior sample efficiency in 2D-Point Agent and continuous control benchmarks, such as cartpole and walker tasks, compared to baselines.

Conclusion: The proposed UMCNP method enables efficient adaptation to unseen tasks with fewer samples, leveraging learned task dynamics during interactions.

Abstract: We introduce Unsupervised Meta-Testing with Conditional Neural Processes
(UMCNP), a novel hybrid few-shot meta-reinforcement learning (meta-RL) method
that uniquely combines, yet distinctly separates, parameterized policy
gradient-based (PPG) and task inference-based few-shot meta-RL. Tailored for
settings where the reward signal is missing during meta-testing, our method
increases sample efficiency without requiring additional samples in
meta-training. UMCNP leverages the efficiency and scalability of Conditional
Neural Processes (CNPs) to reduce the number of online interactions required in
meta-testing. During meta-training, samples previously collected through PPG
meta-RL are efficiently reused for learning task inference in an offline
manner. UMCNP infers the latent representation of the transition dynamics model
from a single test task rollout with unknown parameters. This approach allows
us to generate rollouts for self-adaptation by interacting with the learned
dynamics model. We demonstrate our method can adapt to an unseen test task
using significantly fewer samples during meta-testing than the baselines in
2D-Point Agent and continuous control meta-RL benchmarks, namely, cartpole with
unknown angle sensor bias, walker agent with randomized dynamics parameters.

*Achleshwar Luthra,Tianbao Yang,Tomer Galanti*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper establishes a theoretical foundation for self-supervised contrastive learning (CL), showing its equivalence to a supervised variant (NSCL) in specific scenarios, and proposes a bound on few-shot learning error for CL representations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of rigorous theoretical understanding of self-supervised contrastive learning and its connection to supervised learning objectives.

Method: The authors analyze the relationship between CL and a supervised variant, NSCL, proving the gap between their losses vanishes as the number of classes increases. They characterize the geometric properties of the NSCL loss minimizers and derive a bound on few-shot error based on feature variability metrics.

Result: The research confirms the diminishing gap between CL and NSCL losses with increasing semantic classes, validates the proposed few-shot error bound, and demonstrates a close correlation between minimizing CL loss and the value of NSCL loss.

Conclusion: CL and NSCL-trained representations yield geometrically structured, effective embeddings that support accurate few-shot learning via linear probes, aligning theoretical findings with empirical results.

Abstract: Despite its empirical success, the theoretical foundations of self-supervised
contrastive learning (CL) are not yet fully established. In this work, we
address this gap by showing that standard CL objectives implicitly approximate
a supervised variant we call the negatives-only supervised contrastive loss
(NSCL), which excludes same-class contrasts. We prove that the gap between the
CL and NSCL losses vanishes as the number of semantic classes increases, under
a bound that is both label-agnostic and architecture-independent.
  We characterize the geometric structure of the global minimizers of the NSCL
loss: the learned representations exhibit augmentation collapse, within-class
collapse, and class centers that form a simplex equiangular tight frame. We
further introduce a new bound on the few-shot error of linear-probing. This
bound depends on two measures of feature variability--within-class dispersion
and variation along the line between class centers. We show that directional
variation dominates the bound and that the within-class dispersion's effect
diminishes as the number of labeled samples increases. These properties enable
CL and NSCL-trained representations to support accurate few-shot label recovery
using simple linear probes.
  Finally, we empirically validate our theoretical findings: the gap between CL
and NSCL losses decays at a rate of $\mathcal{O}(\frac{1}{\#\text{classes}})$;
the two losses are highly correlated; minimizing the CL loss implicitly brings
the NSCL loss close to the value achieved by direct minimization; and the
proposed few-shot error bound provides a tight estimate of probing performance
in practice.

*Egor Petrov,Grigoriy Evseev,Aleksey Antonov,Andrey Veprikov,Pavel Plyusnin,Nikolay Bushkov,Stanislav Moiseev,Aleksandr Beznosikov*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper investigates zero-order (ZO) optimizers for memory- and compute-efficient fine-tuning of large language models (LLMs). It introduces two novel ZO optimization algorithms—JAGUAR SignSGD and JAGUAR Muon—and compares them to traditional first-order methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the prohibitive memory and computational costs of traditional first-order optimizers like SGD and Adam when fine-tuning large models. By exploring ZO optimization methods, the authors aim to create a resource-efficient alternative that can still achieve high-quality convergence.

Method: They develop two new ZO algorithms: JAGUAR SignSGD and JAGUAR Muon. JAGUAR SignSGD is a momentum-based extension of ZO SignSGD, while JAGUAR Muon leverages the matrix structure of model parameters. Both are designed to deliver efficient convergence with low memory and compute requirements. Rigorous theoretical proofs and extensive experiments support their approach.

Result: The proposed ZO algorithms are shown to match or exceed the convergence quality of traditional first-order methods on challenging fine-tuning tasks for LLMs. Additionally, they achieve significant memory savings, making them practical for resource-constrained scenarios.

Conclusion: This work establishes ZO optimization as a viable and efficient alternative to existing methods for fine-tuning LLMs. It offers a blend of theoretical rigor and practical impact, presenting a solution for resource-efficient model adaptation in constrained environments.

Abstract: Fine-tuning Large Language Models (LLMs) is essential for adapting
pre-trained models to downstream tasks. Yet traditional first-order optimizers
such as Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) and Adam incur prohibitive memory and
computational costs that scale poorly with model size. In this paper, we
investigate zero-order (ZO) optimization methods as a memory- and
compute-efficient alternative, particularly in the context of
parameter-efficient fine-tuning techniques like LoRA. We propose
$\texttt{JAGUAR SignSGD}$, a ZO momentum-based algorithm that extends ZO
SignSGD, requiring the same number of parameters as the standard ZO SGD and
only $\mathcal{O}(1)$ function evaluations per iteration. To the best of our
knowledge, this is the first study to establish rigorous convergence guarantees
for SignSGD in the stochastic ZO case. We further propose $\texttt{JAGUAR
Muon}$, a novel ZO extension of the Muon optimizer that leverages the matrix
structure of model parameters, and we provide its convergence rate under
arbitrary stochastic noise. Through extensive experiments on challenging LLM
fine-tuning benchmarks, we demonstrate that the proposed algorithms meet or
exceed the convergence quality of standard first-order methods, achieving
significant memory reduction. Our theoretical and empirical results establish
new ZO optimization methods as a practical and theoretically grounded approach
for resource-constrained LLM adaptation. Our code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Optimize neural network training by addressing structured gradient uncertainty efficiently, avoiding costly second-order calculations.

Method: Uses a Kalman-based approach to update compact gradient covariance products recursively, avoiding full covariance matrix storage and large matrix inversions.

Result: Demonstrated on diverse tasks, KOALA++ performs as well or better than state-of-the-art optimizers with first-order method efficiency.

Conclusion: KOALA++ offers scalable optimization with structured gradient uncertainty, combining accuracy and efficiency for neural network tasks.

Abstract: We propose KOALA++, a scalable Kalman-based optimization algorithm that
explicitly models structured gradient uncertainty in neural network training.
Unlike second-order methods, which rely on expensive second order gradient
calculation, our method directly estimates the parameter covariance matrix by
recursively updating compact gradient covariance products. This design improves
upon the original KOALA framework that assumed diagonal covariance by
implicitly capturing richer uncertainty structure without storing the full
covariance matrix and avoiding large matrix inversions. Across diverse tasks,
including image classification and language modeling, KOALA++ achieves accuracy
on par or better than state-of-the-art first- and second-order optimizers while
maintaining the efficiency of first-order methods.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces RETROSYNFLOW (RSF), a novel method for single-step retrosynthesis planning using a discrete flow-matching framework and achieving significant accuracy improvements over previous state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of accurately and diversely predicting single-step retrosynthesis reactions, a significant problem due to the combinatorial complexity of chemical synthesis.

Method: RSF employs a flow-matching framework, with a reaction center identification step to generate intermediate synthons, enhanced by Feynman-Kac steering and Sequential Monte Carlo resampling, supported by a forward-synthesis model for generating feasible reactions.

Result: RSF achieved top-1 accuracy of 60.0%, outperforming the state-of-the-art by 20%, and improved top-5 round-trip accuracy by 19% while maintaining competitive top-k accuracy.

Conclusion: RSF demonstrates that identifying reaction centers and using FK-steering with resampling can significantly improve retrosynthesis accuracy and diversity, setting a new performance benchmark in template-free methods.

Abstract: A fundamental problem in organic chemistry is identifying and predicting the
series of reactions that synthesize a desired target product molecule. Due to
the combinatorial nature of the chemical search space, single-step reactant
prediction -- i.e. single-step retrosynthesis -- remains challenging even for
existing state-of-the-art template-free generative approaches to produce an
accurate yet diverse set of feasible reactions. In this paper, we model
single-step retrosynthesis planning and introduce RETRO SYNFLOW (RSF) a
discrete flow-matching framework that builds a Markov bridge between the
prescribed target product molecule and the reactant molecule. In contrast to
past approaches, RSF employs a reaction center identification step to produce
intermediate structures known as synthons as a more informative source
distribution for the discrete flow. To further enhance diversity and
feasibility of generated samples, we employ Feynman-Kac steering with
Sequential Monte Carlo based resampling to steer promising generations at
inference using a new reward oracle that relies on a forward-synthesis model.
Empirically, we demonstrate \nameshort achieves $60.0 \%$ top-1 accuracy, which
outperforms the previous SOTA by $20 \%$. We also substantiate the benefits of
steering at inference and demonstrate that FK-steering improves top-$5$
round-trip accuracy by $19 \%$ over prior template-free SOTA methods, all while
preserving competitive top-$k$ accuracy results.

### [318] [Selective Matching Losses -- Not All Scores Are Created Equal](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04446)
*Gil I. Shamir,Manfred K. Warmuth*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces selective matching loss functions to prioritize predictions in important regions of the domain using specialized score-sensitive designs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Many prediction tasks require higher accuracy in specific regions of the domain, making it essential to focus on those areas while deprioritizing less important ones.

Method: The authors design selective matching loss functions using link functions with scaled and shifted Sigmoid and hyperbolic sine patterns for scalar cases. For multidimensional tasks, they enhance the Softmax mechanism to improve sensitivity to score rankings among classes.

Result: Selective losses outperform traditional loss functions in tasks that emphasize specific score regions, benefiting applications like ranking, distillation, and LLM fine-tuning.

Conclusion: Selective loss functions enable better focus on critical regions in prediction tasks, providing enhanced performance in real-world applications requiring nuanced accuracy.

Abstract: Learning systems match predicted scores to observations over some domain.
Often, it is critical to produce accurate predictions in some subset (or
region) of the domain, yet less important to accurately predict in other
regions. We construct selective matching loss functions by design of increasing
link functions over score domains. A matching loss is an integral over the
link. A link defines loss sensitivity as function of the score, emphasizing
high slope high sensitivity regions over flat ones. Loss asymmetry drives a
model and resolves its underspecification to predict better in high sensitivity
regions where it is more important, and to distinguish between high and low
importance regions. A large variety of selective scalar losses can be designed
with scaled and shifted Sigmoid and hyperbolic sine links. Their properties,
however, do not extend to multi-class. Applying them per dimension lacks
ranking sensitivity that assigns importance according to class score ranking.
Utilizing composite Softmax functions, we develop a framework for
multidimensional selective losses. We overcome limitations of the standard
Softmax function, that is good for classification, but not for distinction
between adjacent scores. Selective losses have substantial advantage over
traditional losses in applications with more important score regions, including
dwell-time prediction, retrieval, ranking with either pointwise, contrastive
pairwise, or listwise losses, distillation problems, and fine-tuning alignment
of Large Language Models (LLMs).

*Huynh T. T. Tran,Jacob Sander,Achraf Cohen,Brian Jalaian,Nathaniel D. Bastian*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper enhances NIDS by extending the ODXU framework with Neurosymbolic AI and transfer learning strategies. Significant improvements in accuracy and reliability are demonstrated across datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in cybersecurity, such as robustness, interpretability, and generalization in NIDS, by leveraging Neurosymbolic AI and transfer learning.

Method: Extending the ODXU framework with deep embedded clustering, symbolic reasoning, uncertainty quantification methods, and a novel transfer learning strategy for improved NIDS.

Result: Experimental results highlight better performance than traditional models on various metrics, and metamodel-based UQ methods outperform score-based approaches across datasets.

Conclusion: The enhanced ODXU framework and developed transfer learning strategies improve NIDS performance while ensuring robustness and interpretability.

Abstract: Network Intrusion Detection Systems (NIDS) play a vital role in protecting
digital infrastructures against increasingly sophisticated cyber threats. In
this paper, we extend ODXU, a Neurosymbolic AI (NSAI) framework that integrates
deep embedded clustering for feature extraction, symbolic reasoning using
XGBoost, and comprehensive uncertainty quantification (UQ) to enhance
robustness, interpretability, and generalization in NIDS. The extended ODXU
incorporates score-based methods (e.g., Confidence Scoring, Shannon Entropy)
and metamodel-based techniques, including SHAP values and Information Gain, to
assess the reliability of predictions. Experimental results on the CIC-IDS-2017
dataset show that ODXU outperforms traditional neural models across six
evaluation metrics, including classification accuracy and false omission rate.
While transfer learning has seen widespread adoption in fields such as computer
vision and natural language processing, its potential in cybersecurity has not
been thoroughly explored. To bridge this gap, we develop a transfer learning
strategy that enables the reuse of a pre-trained ODXU model on a different
dataset. Our ablation study on ACI-IoT-2023 demonstrates that the optimal
transfer configuration involves reusing the pre-trained autoencoder, retraining
the clustering module, and fine-tuning the XGBoost classifier, and outperforms
traditional neural models when trained with as few as 16,000 samples
(approximately 50% of the training data). Additionally, results show that
metamodel-based UQ methods consistently outperform score-based approaches on
both datasets.

*Ivan Vegner,Sydelle de Souza,Valentin Forch,Martha Lewis,Leonidas A. A. Doumas*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper addresses systematicity, a core aspect of compositionality important for ML model generalization, and emphasizes the distinction between systematicity of behavior and representations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The increasing importance of systematic generalization in machine learning (ML) models motivates the need for systematic evaluation. The paper aims to address gaps in current benchmarks that focus on behavioral systematicity but neglect representational systematicity.

Method: The authors analyze benchmarks focused on systematic generalization across language and vision. They also adapt principles from the field of mechanistic interpretability to evaluate systematicity of representations.

Result: The paper identifies limitations in existing benchmarks that primarily test behavioral systematicity. It showcases the need for complementary methods to test representational systematicity in machine learning.

Conclusion: The authors emphasize the need to distinguish and adequately test both behavioral and representational systematicity in ML models, presenting representational examination methods as a step forward.

Abstract: A core aspect of compositionality, systematicity is a desirable property in
ML models as it enables strong generalization to novel contexts. This has led
to numerous studies proposing benchmarks to assess systematic generalization,
as well as models and training regimes designed to enhance it. Many of these
efforts are framed as addressing the challenge posed by Fodor and Pylyshyn.
However, while they argue for systematicity of representations, existing
benchmarks and models primarily focus on the systematicity of behaviour. We
emphasize the crucial nature of this distinction. Furthermore, building on
Hadley's (1994) taxonomy of systematic generalization, we analyze the extent to
which behavioural systematicity is tested by key benchmarks in the literature
across language and vision. Finally, we highlight ways of assessing
systematicity of representations in ML models as practiced in the field of
mechanistic interpretability.

TL;DR: The study explores classifying dental providers using machine learning (ML) models on a dataset with significant missing data. The Neural Network performed best with 94.1% accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To classify dental providers into standard rendering providers and safety net clinic (SNC) providers, facilitating better resource allocation, especially for underserved populations.

Method: A dataset with 24,300 instances and significant missing values was analyzed. Feature ranking was conducted using methods like Gini index and ANOVA. Twelve ML models were tested using 10-fold cross-validation across feature subsets.

Result: The Neural Network model achieved the highest accuracy (94.1%), with models generally improving performance as more features were used. Treatment-related metrics were identified as key predictors, while demographic variables had minimal influence.

Conclusion: Feature selection is crucial for improving ML model efficiency and accuracy in health datasets. Integrating feature ranking with advanced ML algorithms can optimize classification for targeted interventions.

Abstract: This study investigates the application of machine learning (ML) models for
classifying dental providers into two categories - standard rendering providers
and safety net clinic (SNC) providers - using a 2018 dataset of 24,300
instances with 20 features. The dataset, characterized by high missing values
(38.1%), includes service counts (preventive, treatment, exams), delivery
systems (FFS, managed care), and beneficiary demographics. Feature ranking
methods such as information gain, Gini index, and ANOVA were employed to
identify critical predictors, revealing treatment-related metrics
(TXMT_USER_CNT, TXMT_SVC_CNT) as top-ranked features. Twelve ML models,
including k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN), Decision Trees, Support Vector Machines
(SVM), Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), Random Forest, Neural Networks, and
Gradient Boosting, were evaluated using 10-fold cross-validation.
Classification accuracy was tested across incremental feature subsets derived
from rankings. The Neural Network achieved the highest accuracy (94.1%) using
all 20 features, followed by Gradient Boosting (93.2%) and Random Forest
(93.0%). Models showed improved performance as more features were incorporated,
with SGD and ensemble methods demonstrating robustness to missing data. Feature
ranking highlighted the dominance of treatment service counts and annotation
codes in distinguishing provider types, while demographic variables (AGE_GROUP,
CALENDAR_YEAR) had minimal impact. The study underscores the importance of
feature selection in enhancing model efficiency and accuracy, particularly in
imbalanced healthcare datasets. These findings advocate for integrating
feature-ranking techniques with advanced ML algorithms to optimize dental
provider classification, enabling targeted resource allocation for underserved
populations.

Abstract: Dental provider classification plays a crucial role in optimizing healthcare
resource allocation and policy planning. Effective categorization of providers,
such as standard rendering providers and safety net clinic (SNC) providers,
enhances service delivery to underserved populations. This study aimed to
evaluate the performance of machine learning models in classifying dental
providers using a 2018 dataset. A dataset of 24,300 instances with 20 features
was analyzed, including beneficiary and service counts across fee-for-service
(FFS), Geographic Managed Care, and Pre-Paid Health Plans. Providers were
categorized by delivery system and patient age groups (0-20 and 21+). Despite
38.1% missing data, multiple machine learning algorithms were tested, including
k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN), Decision Trees, Support Vector Machines (SVM),
Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), Random Forest, Neural Networks, and Gradient
Boosting. A 10-fold cross-validation approach was applied, and models were
evaluated using AUC, classification accuracy (CA), F1-score, precision, and
recall. Neural Networks achieved the highest AUC (0.975) and CA (94.1%),
followed by Random Forest (AUC: 0.948, CA: 93.0%). These models effectively
handled imbalanced data and complex feature interactions, outperforming
traditional classifiers like Logistic Regression and SVM. Advanced machine
learning techniques, particularly ensemble and deep learning models,
significantly enhance dental workforce classification. Their integration into
healthcare analytics can improve provider identification and resource
distribution, benefiting underserved populations.

*Jiayu Wang,Aws Albarghouthi,Frederic Sala*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces COSMOS, a prediction framework for Large Language Models (LLMs) that estimates performance and cost of adaptation strategies without costly trials, achieving substantial computational cost savings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of selecting optimal models and adaptation strategies for LLMs under resource constraints without requiring extensive experimentation.

Method: The authors formalize the strategy selection problem for LLMs and propose COSMOS, which utilizes two prediction techniques: embedding-augmented lightweight proxy models for fine-tuning and low-sample scaling laws for retrieval-augmented in-context learning.

Result: COSMOS achieved high prediction accuracy during evaluation across eight benchmarks, reducing computational costs by 92.72% on average and up to 98.71% in more resource-intensive setups.

Conclusion: Efficient prediction frameworks like COSMOS can significantly lower computational costs while maintaining model performance, making them valuable for practical LLM deployment.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) achieve remarkable performance across numerous
tasks by using a diverse array of adaptation strategies. However, optimally
selecting a model and adaptation strategy under resource constraints is
challenging and often requires extensive experimentation. We investigate
whether it is possible to accurately predict both performance and cost without
expensive trials. We formalize the strategy selection problem for LLMs and
introduce COSMOS, a unified prediction framework that efficiently estimates
adaptation outcomes at minimal cost. We instantiate and study the capability of
our framework via a pair of powerful predictors: embedding-augmented
lightweight proxy models to predict fine-tuning performance, and low-sample
scaling laws to forecast retrieval-augmented in-context learning. Extensive
evaluation across eight representative benchmarks demonstrates that COSMOS
achieves high prediction accuracy while reducing computational costs by 92.72%
on average, and up to 98.71% in resource-intensive scenarios. Our results show
that efficient prediction of adaptation outcomes is not only feasible but can
substantially reduce the computational overhead of LLM deployment while
maintaining performance standards.

*Rishwanth Raghu,Axel Levy,Gordon Wetzstein,Ellen D. Zhong*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CryoBoltz integrates protein structure prediction models with cryo-EM density maps to accurately model conformational diversity in biomolecular complexes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Protein structure prediction models have limitations in capturing dynamic conformational diversity, while cryo-EM struggles with data-to-model pipelines.

Method: CryoBoltz combines pretrained protein structure prediction models with structural constraints from cryo-EM density maps to guide sampling trajectories.

Result: CryoBoltz successfully builds atomic models into heterogeneous cryo-EM maps for dynamic systems like transporters and antibodies.

Conclusion: CryoBoltz offers a powerful, flexible approach to model protein conformations consistent with experimental cryo-EM data, addressing key challenges in structural biology.

Abstract: Protein structure prediction models are now capable of generating accurate 3D
structural hypotheses from sequence alone. However, they routinely fail to
capture the conformational diversity of dynamic biomolecular complexes, often
requiring heuristic MSA subsampling approaches for generating alternative
states. In parallel, cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) has emerged as a
powerful tool for imaging near-native structural heterogeneity, but is
challenged by arduous pipelines to go from raw experimental data to atomic
models. Here, we bridge the gap between these modalities, combining cryo-EM
density maps with the rich sequence and biophysical priors learned by protein
structure prediction models. Our method, CryoBoltz, guides the sampling
trajectory of a pretrained protein structure prediction model using both global
and local structural constraints derived from density maps, driving predictions
towards conformational states consistent with the experimental data. We
demonstrate that this flexible yet powerful inference-time approach allows us
to build atomic models into heterogeneous cryo-EM maps across a variety of
dynamic biomolecular systems including transporters and antibodies.

*Ruoxi Jiang,Xiao Zhang,Karan Jakhar,Peter Y. Lu,Pedram Hassanzadeh,Michael Maire,Rebecca Willett*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a multiscale implicit neural emulator aimed at improving long-term prediction accuracy and stability in neural PDE solvers for dynamical systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional neural PDE solvers struggle with accumulating errors, stability, and consistency over extended time predictions.

Method: The proposed method uses a multiscale implicit neural design, leveraging lower-dimensional future state representations and temporal downsampling ratios to refine next-timestep predictions and maintain temporal coherence.

Result: In experiments with turbulent fluid dynamics, the approach delivered better short-term accuracy and long-term stability, outperforming autoregressive models with minimal computational cost.

Conclusion: This multiscale implicit neural emulator effectively addresses challenges in long-term forecasting for dynamical systems, making it a robust tool for future modeling.

Abstract: Neural PDE solvers offer a powerful tool for modeling complex dynamical
systems, but often struggle with error accumulation over long time horizons and
maintaining stability and physical consistency. We introduce a multiscale
implicit neural emulator that enhances long-term prediction accuracy by
conditioning on a hierarchy of lower-dimensional future state representations.
Drawing inspiration from the stability properties of numerical implicit
time-stepping methods, our approach leverages predictions several steps ahead
in time at increasing compression rates for next-timestep refinements. By
actively adjusting the temporal downsampling ratios, our design enables the
model to capture dynamics across multiple granularities and enforce long-range
temporal coherence. Experiments on turbulent fluid dynamics show that our
method achieves high short-term accuracy and produces long-term stable
forecasts, significantly outperforming autoregressive baselines while adding
minimal computational overhead.

*Geon-Woo Kim,Junbo Li,Shashidhar Gandham,Omar Baldonado,Adithya Gangidi,Pavan Balaji,Zhangyang Wang,Aditya Akella*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces HALoS, a hierarchical optimization framework that significantly reduces communication costs and improves training efficiency in geographically distributed large language model (LLM) training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Geographically distributed training of large language models (LLMs) faces high communication costs and uneven hardware utilization, which hinders scalability and efficiency.

Method: HALoS introduces hierarchical asynchronous optimization with local parameter servers (LPSs) in each region and a global parameter server (GPS) to manage inter-regional updates, minimizing inter-region communication and utilizing fast intra-region links.

Result: HALoS achieves up to 7.5x faster convergence over synchronous methods in geo-distributed LLM training and up to 2.1x improvement over other asynchronous approaches while maintaining or improving model quality.

Conclusion: HALoS offers a scalable and efficient solution for training LLMs in heterogeneous, geo-distributed environments by combining hierarchical momentum and asynchronous updates, enabling faster convergence without compromising model performance.

Abstract: Training large language models (LLMs) increasingly relies on geographically
distributed accelerators, causing prohibitive communication costs across
regions and uneven utilization of heterogeneous hardware. We propose HALoS, a
hierarchical asynchronous optimization framework that tackles these issues by
introducing local parameter servers (LPSs) within each region and a global
parameter server (GPS) that merges updates across regions. This hierarchical
design minimizes expensive inter-region communication, reduces straggler
effects, and leverages fast intra-region links. We provide a rigorous
convergence analysis for HALoS under non-convex objectives, including
theoretical guarantees on the role of hierarchical momentum in asynchronous
training. Empirically, HALoS attains up to 7.5x faster convergence than
synchronous baselines in geo-distributed LLM training and improves upon
existing asynchronous methods by up to 2.1x. Crucially, HALoS preserves the
model quality of fully synchronous SGD-matching or exceeding accuracy on
standard language modeling and downstream benchmarks-while substantially
lowering total training time. These results demonstrate that hierarchical,
server-side update accumulation and global model merging are powerful tools for
scalable, efficient training of new-era LLMs in heterogeneous, geo-distributed
environments.

*Yuanpei Gao,Qi Yan,Yan Leng,Renjie Liao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The proposed Neural MJD model enhances time series forecasting by modeling non-stationary stochastic dynamics and abrupt changes, achieving superior performance compared to existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep learning struggles with non-stationary data and abrupt changes due to its black-box nature and lack of explicit modeling for stochastic processes.

Method: The Neural MJD combines time-inhomogeneous Itô diffusion for stochastic dynamics and time-inhomogeneous compound Poisson process for modeling jumps, supported by a likelihood truncation mechanism and an advanced Euler-Maruyama solver.

Result: Experiments validate Neural MJD's effectiveness, demonstrating performance improvements on synthetic and real-world datasets compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: The Neural MJD approach provides a robust solution to the limitations of current forecasting methods, offering improved generalization and accuracy for challenging non-stationary time series prediction tasks.

Abstract: While deep learning methods have achieved strong performance in time series
prediction, their black-box nature and inability to explicitly model underlying
stochastic processes often limit their generalization to non-stationary data,
especially in the presence of abrupt changes. In this work, we introduce Neural
MJD, a neural network based non-stationary Merton jump diffusion (MJD) model.
Our model explicitly formulates forecasting as a stochastic differential
equation (SDE) simulation problem, combining a time-inhomogeneous It\^o
diffusion to capture non-stationary stochastic dynamics with a
time-inhomogeneous compound Poisson process to model abrupt jumps. To enable
tractable learning, we introduce a likelihood truncation mechanism that caps
the number of jumps within small time intervals and provide a theoretical error
bound for this approximation. Additionally, we propose an Euler-Maruyama with
restart solver, which achieves a provably lower error bound in estimating
expected states and reduced variance compared to the standard solver.
Experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that Neural
MJD consistently outperforms state-of-the-art deep learning and statistical
learning methods.

*Dev Gurung,Shiva Raj Pokhrel*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces a model-driven quantum federated learning algorithm (mdQFL) to tackle key challenges in quantum federated learning, like training bottlenecks, device scalability, and heterogeneous non-IID data distributions, showing improved communication costs and accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Federated learning faces bottlenecks from large datasets, numerous devices, and heterogeneity in client data, which limit its scalability and efficiency. Quantum federated learning seeks to address these issues.

Method: The authors propose mdQFL, which integrates model-driven quantum approaches to personalize training, updates, and test generalization. They evaluate the algorithm under various non-IID conditions using Qiskit.

Result: mdQFL reduced communication costs by approximately 50% and improved or maintained accuracy compared to standard quantum federated learning baselines. Local model training performance also consistently improved.

Conclusion: MDQFL represents an advance in quantum federated learning by addressing scalability and heterogeneity, providing a framework adaptable to other FL scenarios while optimizing computational complexities and performance.

Abstract: Training with huge datasets and a large number of participating devices leads
to bottlenecks in federated learning (FL). Furthermore, the challenges of
heterogeneity between multiple FL clients affect the overall performance of the
system. In a quantum federated learning (QFL) context, we address these three
main challenges: i) training bottlenecks from massive datasets, ii) the
involvement of a substantial number of devices, and iii) non-IID data
distributions. We introduce a model-driven quantum federated learning algorithm
(mdQFL) to tackle these challenges. Our proposed approach is efficient and
adaptable to various factors, including different numbers of devices. To the
best of our knowledge, it is the first to explore training and update
personalization, as well as test generalization within a QFL setting, which can
be applied to other FL scenarios. We evaluated the efficiency of the proposed
mdQFL framework through extensive experiments under diverse non-IID data
heterogeneity conditions using various datasets within the Qiskit environment.
Our results demonstrate a nearly 50% decrease in total communication costs
while maintaining or, in some cases, exceeding the accuracy of the final model
and consistently improving local model training compared to the standard QFL
baseline. Moreover, our experimental evaluation thoroughly explores the QFL and
mdQFL algorithms, along with several influencing factors. In addition, we
present a theoretical analysis to clarify the complexities of the proposed
algorithm. The experimental code is available at 1.

*Kareem Amin,Salman Avestimehr,Sara Babakniya,Alex Bie,Weiwei Kong,Natalia Ponomareva,Umar Syed*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper improves differentially private text generation by clustering sensitive inputs and aggregating predictions using medians, achieving better representation and task performance at lower privacy costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to improve the quality of differentially private synthetic text generation, as uniform sampling degrades text quality when sensitive inputs vary across topics.

Method: The authors introduce clustering of input data to group heterogeneous topics, and propose using median-based aggregation to reduce local sensitivity and provide an ex-post differential privacy guarantee.

Result: The results showcase improved text quality and relevance based on metrics like MAUVE, and better performance in downstream tasks compared to prior methods, achieved with a reduced privacy cost.

Conclusion: Clustering and median-based aggregation significantly enhance the quality and privacy-efficiency of synthetic data generation in differentially private language model inference.

Abstract: Differentially private (DP) language model inference is an approach for
generating private synthetic text. A sensitive input example is used to prompt
an off-the-shelf large language model (LLM) to produce a similar example.
Multiple examples can be aggregated together to formally satisfy the DP
guarantee.
  Prior work creates inference batches by sampling sensitive inputs uniformly
at random. We show that uniform sampling degrades the quality of privately
generated text, especially when the sensitive examples concern heterogeneous
topics.
  We remedy this problem by clustering the input data before selecting
inference batches. Next, we observe that clustering also leads to more similar
next-token predictions across inferences. We use this insight to introduce a
new algorithm that aggregates next token statistics by privately computing
medians instead of averages. This approach leverages the fact that the median
has decreased local sensitivity when next token predictions are similar,
allowing us to state a data-dependent and ex-post DP guarantee about the
privacy properties of this algorithm. Finally, we demonstrate improvements in
terms of representativeness metrics (e.g., MAUVE) as well as downstream task
performance. We show that our method produces high-quality synthetic data at
significantly lower privacy cost than a previous state-of-the-art method.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: StatsMerging is a novel framework enabling efficient model merging without ground truth labels by employing statistics-driven methods like singular value decomposition and lightweight learners.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of memory constraints while accommodating multiple large models and improving generalization and adaptation without reliance on ground-truth labels.

Method: The method incorporates singular value decomposition for task importance prediction, a lightweight learner StatsMergeLearner for weight modeling, and Task-Specific Teacher Distillation for label-free merging of heterogeneous vision models.

Result: The approach demonstrated superior accuracy, generalization to unseen tasks, and robustness to image variations across eight tasks compared to state-of-the-art merging techniques.

Conclusion: StatsMerging proves to be an effective and efficient model merging technique that is lightweight, label-free, and robust across diverse tasks and conditions.

Abstract: Model merging has emerged as a promising solution to accommodate multiple
large models within constrained memory budgets. We present StatsMerging, a
novel lightweight learning-based model merging method guided by weight
distribution statistics without requiring ground truth labels or test samples.
StatsMerging offers three key advantages: (1) It uniquely leverages singular
values from singular value decomposition (SVD) to capture task-specific weight
distributions, serving as a proxy for task importance to guide task coefficient
prediction; (2) It employs a lightweight learner StatsMergeLearner to model the
weight distributions of task-specific pre-trained models, improving
generalization and enhancing adaptation to unseen samples; (3) It introduces
Task-Specific Teacher Distillation for merging vision models with heterogeneous
architectures, a merging learning paradigm that avoids costly ground-truth
labels by task-specific teacher distillation. Notably, we present two types of
knowledge distillation, (a) distilling knowledge from task-specific models to
StatsMergeLearner; and (b) distilling knowledge from models with heterogeneous
architectures prior to merging. Extensive experiments across eight tasks
demonstrate the effectiveness of StatsMerging. Our results show that
StatsMerging outperforms state-of-the-art techniques in terms of overall
accuracy, generalization to unseen tasks, and robustness to image quality
variations.

*Marianna Nezhurina,Tomer Porian,Giovanni Pucceti,Tommie Kerssies,Romain Beaumont,Mehdi Cherti,Jenia Jitsev*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This research uses scaling laws to compare two key vision-language models, CLIP and MaMMUT, revealing MaMMUT's superiority in scaling and sample efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a systematic methodology for comparing foundation models and datasets at varying scales to avoid misleading conclusions based on single-scale measurements.

Method: Scaling laws derived from dense measurements across model and sample scales were used to benchmark different model architectures, loss functions, and datasets. A constant learning rate schedule was applied to minimize computational costs.

Result: MaMMUT exhibited stronger improvements with scale and better sample efficiency than CLIP, consistently outperforming across downstream tasks (classification, retrieval, segmentation) with various datasets.

Conclusion: Scaling law derivation facilitates systematic model and dataset comparisons while promoting improved methodologies for constructing foundation models and datasets. Comprehensive resources including checkpoints and code were released for reproducibility.

Abstract: In studies of transferable learning, scaling laws are obtained for various
important foundation models to predict their properties and performance at
larger scales. We show here how scaling law derivation can also be used for
model and dataset comparison, allowing to decide which procedure is to be
preferred for pre-training. For the first time, full scaling laws based on
dense measurements across a wide span of model and samples seen scales are
derived for two important language-vision learning procedures, CLIP and MaMMUT,
that use either contrastive only or contrastive and captioning text generative
loss. Ensuring sufficient prediction accuracy for held out points, we use
derived scaling laws to compare both models, obtaining evidence for MaMMUT's
stronger improvement with scale and better sample efficiency than standard
CLIP. To strengthen validity of the comparison, we show scaling laws for
various downstream tasks, classification, retrieval, and segmentation, and for
different open datasets, DataComp, DFN and Re-LAION, observing consistently the
same trends. We show that comparison can also be performed when deriving
scaling laws with a constant learning rate schedule, reducing compute cost.
Accurate derivation of scaling laws provides thus means to perform model and
dataset comparison across scale spans, avoiding misleading conclusions based on
measurements from single reference scales only, paving the road for systematic
comparison and improvement of open foundation models and datasets for their
creation. We release all the pre-trained models with their intermediate
checkpoints, including openMaMMUT-L/14, which achieves $80.3\%$ zero-shot
ImageNet-1k accuracy, trained on 12.8B samples from DataComp-1.4B. Code for
reproducing experiments in the paper and raw experiments data can be found at

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper highlights how graph symmetrization in GNNs leads to the loss of directional information, compromising the quality of explanations in critical applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the issue of compromised explanation fidelity caused by graph symmetrization in GNNs, particularly in security-critical contexts.

Method: The paper uses theoretical and empirical analyses to assess the impact of preserving directional semantics on explanation quality in GNNs.

Result: The study demonstrates that maintaining directional information significantly enhances the fidelity and quality of GNN explanations.

Conclusion: Direction-aware explainability should be prioritized in GNNs, especially for applications requiring high stakes in decision-making.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are increasingly used in critical domains, where
reliable explanations are vital for supporting human decision-making. However,
the common practice of graph symmetrization discards directional information,
leading to significant information loss and misleading explanations. Our
analysis demonstrates how this practice compromises explanation fidelity.
Through theoretical and empirical studies, we show that preserving directional
semantics significantly improves explanation quality, ensuring more faithful
insights for human decision-makers. These findings highlight the need for
direction-aware GNN explainability in security-critical applications.

*Cong Geng,Jia Wang,Li Chen,Zhiyong Gao,Jes Frellsen,Søren Hauberg*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper discusses improving training of energy-based models (EBMs) by using bidirectional bounds—maximizing lower bounds and minimizing upper bounds.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Training EBMs is challenging due to instabilities associated with minimizing variational lower bounds, and the paper aims to resolve this issue.

Method: Bidirectional bounds are employed to stabilize EBM training, with four different bounds derived and algorithms provided for evaluating them.

Result: By applying bidirectional bounds, the paper achieves stable EBM training while improving density estimation and sample generation quality.

Conclusion: Using bidirectional bounds improves both the stability of EBM training and the generative capabilities of the models.

Abstract: Energy-based models (EBMs) estimate unnormalized densities in an elegant
framework, but they are generally difficult to train. Recent work has linked
EBMs to generative adversarial networks, by noting that they can be trained
through a minimax game using a variational lower bound. To avoid the
instabilities caused by minimizing a lower bound, we propose to instead work
with bidirectional bounds, meaning that we maximize a lower bound and minimize
an upper bound when training the EBM. We investigate four different bounds on
the log-likelihood derived from different perspectives. We derive lower bounds
based on the singular values of the generator Jacobian and on mutual
information. To upper bound the negative log-likelihood, we consider a gradient
penalty-like bound, as well as one based on diffusion processes. In all cases,
we provide algorithms for evaluating the bounds. We compare the different
bounds to investigate, the pros and cons of the different approaches. Finally,
we demonstrate that the use of bidirectional bounds stabilizes EBM training and
yields high-quality density estimation and sample generation.

### [334] [Composing Agents to Minimize Worst-case Risk](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04632)
*Guruprerana Shabadi,Rajeev Alur*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a framework to optimize agent compositions in directed acyclic graphs, minimizing risks like safety and fairness while maximizing task success through an efficient algorithm.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Agentic systems face challenges in balancing task success with minimizing risks such as safety, fairness, and privacy when choosing compositions of AI agents for complex objectives.

Method: The paper formalizes workflows as directed acyclic graphs, where worst-case risk minimization is achieved by approximating the loss distribution's tail quantile using a union bound and dynamic programming within an efficient algorithm.

Result: The authors demonstrate the framework's effectiveness in various control benchmarks with reinforcement-learning-trained agents, showing its ability to identify near-optimal compositions under value-at-risk metrics.

Conclusion: The proposed algorithm provides an efficient, scalable, and theoretically sound method for mitigating worst-case risks in agent compositions, applicable across diverse practical scenarios.

Abstract: From software development to robot control, modern agentic systems decompose
complex objectives into a sequence of subtasks and choose a set of specialized
AI agents to complete them. We formalize an agentic workflow as a directed
acyclic graph, called an agent graph, where edges represent AI agents and paths
correspond to feasible compositions of agents. When deploying these systems in
the real world, we need to choose compositions of agents that not only maximize
the task success, but also minimize risk where the risk captures requirements
like safety, fairness, and privacy. This additionally requires carefully
analyzing the low-probability (tail) behaviors of compositions of agents. In
this work, we consider worst-case risk minimization over the set of feasible
agent compositions. We define worst-case risk as the tail quantile -- also
known as value-at-risk -- of the loss distribution of the agent composition
where the loss quantifies the risk associated with agent behaviors. We
introduce an efficient algorithm that traverses the agent graph and finds a
near-optimal composition of agents by approximating the value-at-risk via a
union bound and dynamic programming. Furthermore, we prove that the
approximation is near-optimal asymptotically for a broad class of practical
loss functions. To evaluate our framework, we consider a suite of video
game-like control benchmarks that require composing several agents trained with
reinforcement learning and demonstrate our algorithm's effectiveness in
approximating the value-at-risk and identifying the optimal agent composition.

*Zesheng Ye,Chengyi Cai,Ruijiang Dong,Jianzhong Qi,Lei Feng,Pin-Yu Chen,Feng Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This survey proposes neural network reprogrammability as a unifying framework for various model adaptation methods, categorizing them based on manipulation characteristics while identifying challenges and future directions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rapid growth in pre-trained foundation models highlights the critical need for efficient downstream task adaptation and understanding the relationships between existing adaptation methods.

Method: The paper introduces a taxonomy categorizing model adaptation techniques (e.g., reprogramming, prompt tuning) across four dimensions: manipulation format, location, operator, and output alignment.

Result: The proposed framework offers a consistent perspective for various methods across different data modalities and architectures, revealing connections and distinctions among adaptation techniques like in-context learning and chain-of-thought prompting.

Conclusion: Neural network reprogrammability positions itself as a core paradigm for model adaptation, with insights advancing theoretical and practical applications while paving the way for future research.

Abstract: As large-scale pre-trained foundation models continue to expand in size and
capability, efficiently adapting them to specific downstream tasks has become
increasingly critical. Despite substantial progress, existing adaptation
approaches have evolved largely in isolation, without a clear understanding of
their interrelationships. This survey introduces neural network
reprogrammability as a unifying framework that bridges mainstream model
adaptation techniques--model reprogramming, prompt tuning, and prompt
instruction--previously fragmented research areas yet converges on a shared
principle: repurposing a pre-trained model by manipulating information at the
interfaces while keeping the model parameters frozen. These methods exploit
neural networks' sensitivity to manipulation on different interfaces, be it
through perturbing inputs, inserting tokens into intermediate layers, or
providing task-specific examples in context, to redirect model behaviors
towards desired outcomes. We then present a taxonomy that categorizes such
information manipulation-based adaptation approaches across four key
dimensions: manipulation format (fixed or learnable), location (interfaces
where manipulations occur), operator (how they are applied), and output
alignment requirement (post-processing needed to align outputs with downstream
tasks). Notably, this framework applies consistently across data modalities,
independent of specific model architectures. Moreover, viewing established
techniques like in-context learning and chain-of-thought prompting through this
lens reveals both their theoretical connections and practical distinctions. We
further analyze remaining technical challenges and ethical considerations,
positioning neural network reprogrammability as a fundamental paradigm for
efficient model adaptation. We lastly identify promising research directions
emerging from this integrative viewpoint.

*MoonJeong Park,Sunghyun Choi,Jaeseung Heo,Eunhyeok Park,Dongwoo Kim*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper challenges the overstated concerns about oversmoothing in Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), demonstrating that deep GNNs can be constructed effectively with classical architectural strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address misconceptions regarding oversmoothing in GNNs, which have previously been considered a major limitation to their depth and performance.

Method: The study analyzes the three core operations of GNNs (aggregation, linear transformation, non-linear activation) to distinguish oversmoothing from other issues like vanishing gradients, and evaluates the impact of traditional architectural solutions like skip connections and normalization.

Result: The paper identifies that oversmoothing has been conflated with vanishing gradients, and demonstrates that deep GNNs can be successfully constructed by applying standard techniques like skip connections and normalization.

Conclusion: Oversmoothing is not as significant a limitation in GNNs as previously thought, and with proper architectural approaches, deep GNNs can achieve strong performance.

Abstract: Oversmoothing has been recognized as a main obstacle to building deep Graph
Neural Networks (GNNs), limiting the performance. This position paper argues
that the influence of oversmoothing has been overstated and advocates for a
further exploration of deep GNN architectures. Given the three core operations
of GNNs, aggregation, linear transformation, and non-linear activation, we show
that prior studies have mistakenly confused oversmoothing with the vanishing
gradient, caused by transformation and activation rather than aggregation. Our
finding challenges prior beliefs about oversmoothing being unique to GNNs.
Furthermore, we demonstrate that classical solutions such as skip connections
and normalization enable the successful stacking of deep GNN layers without
performance degradation. Our results clarify misconceptions about oversmoothing
and shed new light on the potential of deep GNNs.

### [337] [Noise-Resistant Label Reconstruction Feature Selection for Partial Multi-Label Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04669)
*Wanfu Gao,Hanlin Pan,Qingqi Han,Kunpeng Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a feature selection method for Partial Multi-label Learning (PML) that addresses overfitting and poor positive label identification by leveraging label relationships and a modified low-rank assumption.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve Partial Multi-label Learning (PML), which suffers from the curse of dimensionality, overfitting, and poor identification of positive labels, especially as existing low-rank assumption-based methods lose high-dimensional information.

Method: The proposed method emphasizes label relationships for noise resistance, integrates a reformed low-rank assumption for learning, and utilizes label connectivity to select features that better identify representative labels.

Result: Experiments on benchmark datasets indicate the method's superior performance over existing approaches.

Conclusion: The study introduces an effective PML feature selection technique that mitigates dimensionality issues and enhances positive label identification, thus improving model performance.

Abstract: The "Curse of dimensionality" is prevalent across various data patterns,
which increases the risk of model overfitting and leads to a decline in model
classification performance. However, few studies have focused on this issue in
Partial Multi-label Learning (PML), where each sample is associated with a set
of candidate labels, at least one of which is correct. Existing PML methods
addressing this problem are mainly based on the low-rank assumption. However,
low-rank assumption is difficult to be satisfied in practical situations and
may lead to loss of high-dimensional information. Furthermore, we find that
existing methods have poor ability to identify positive labels, which is
important in real-world scenarios. In this paper, a PML feature selection
method is proposed considering two important characteristics of dataset: label
relationship's noise-resistance and label connectivity. Our proposed method
utilizes label relationship's noise-resistance to disambiguate labels. Then the
learning process is designed through the reformed low-rank assumption. Finally,
representative labels are found through label connectivity, and the weight
matrix is reconstructed to select features with strong identification ability
to these labels. The experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate the
superiority of the proposed method.

### [338] [FedAPM: Federated Learning via ADMM with Partial Model Personalization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04672)
*Shengkun Zhu,Feiteng Nie,Jinshan Zeng,Sheng Wang,Yuan Sun,Yuan Yao,Shangfeng Chen,Quanqing Xu,Chuanhui Yang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces FedAPM, a federated learning framework that reduces client drift by using an augmented Lagrangian with first-order and second-order corrections, improving convergence and accuracy compared to state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Client heterogeneity and the prevalence of non-i.i.d. data across FL devices lead to divergence between local and shared models, challenging the effectiveness of conventional FL approaches.

Method: FedAPM applies the augmented Lagrangian framework with explicit corrections using first-order and second-order proximal terms to mitigate client drift. It leverages ADMM for stability and efficiency and analyzes convergence rates under mild assumptions.

Result: FedAPM demonstrates superior performance over state-of-the-art FL frameworks, with average improvements of 12.3% in test accuracy, 16.4% in F1 score, and 18.0% in AUC, requiring fewer communication rounds.

Conclusion: FedAPM provides a stable, efficient, and personalized FL solution that addresses challenges arising from heterogeneity and multimodal data while ensuring faster and more accurate convergence.

Abstract: In federated learning (FL), the assumption that datasets from different
devices are independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) often does not
hold due to user differences, and the presence of various data modalities
across clients makes using a single model impractical. Personalizing certain
parts of the model can effectively address these issues by allowing those parts
to differ across clients, while the remaining parts serve as a shared model.
However, we found that partial model personalization may exacerbate client
drift (each client's local model diverges from the shared model), thereby
reducing the effectiveness and efficiency of FL algorithms. We propose an FL
framework based on the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM),
referred to as FedAPM, to mitigate client drift. We construct the augmented
Lagrangian function by incorporating first-order and second-order proximal
terms into the objective, with the second-order term providing fixed correction
and the first-order term offering compensatory correction between the local and
shared models. Our analysis demonstrates that FedAPM, by using explicit
estimates of the Lagrange multiplier, is more stable and efficient in terms of
convergence compared to other FL frameworks. We establish the global
convergence of FedAPM training from arbitrary initial points to a stationary
point, achieving three types of rates: constant, linear, and sublinear, under
mild assumptions. We conduct experiments using four heterogeneous and
multimodal datasets with different metrics to validate the performance of
FedAPM. Specifically, FedAPM achieves faster and more accurate convergence,
outperforming the SOTA methods with average improvements of 12.3% in test
accuracy, 16.4% in F1 score, and 18.0% in AUC while requiring fewer
communication rounds.

*Marco Zanotti*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper evaluates trade-offs between forecast accuracy and computational costs in ensemble learning for time series forecasting, using retail datasets M5 and VN1. The study finds that small ensembles and reduced retraining frequencies can balance accuracy and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address the challenge of achieving robust forecast accuracy while managing computational costs in time series ensemble learning, particularly for large datasets.

Method: The researchers evaluated ten base models and eight ensemble configurations on two retail datasets, analyzing point and probabilistic forecasting accuracy under different retraining frequencies.

Result: Results indicate that ensembles improve forecasting, especially probabilistic accuracy, but come with high computational costs. Reduced retraining lowers costs with little compromise in accuracy, and small ensembles achieve near-optimal performance.

Conclusion: Carefully designing ensembles and retraining strategies can provide accurate and cost-effective forecasting systems, aligning with sustainable AI goals and real-world applications.

Abstract: Given the continuous increase in dataset sizes and the complexity of
forecasting models, the trade-off between forecast accuracy and computational
cost is emerging as an extremely relevant topic, especially in the context of
ensemble learning for time series forecasting. To asses it, we evaluated ten
base models and eight ensemble configurations across two large-scale retail
datasets (M5 and VN1), considering both point and probabilistic accuracy under
varying retraining frequencies. We showed that ensembles consistently improve
forecasting performance, particularly in probabilistic settings. However, these
gains come at a substantial computational cost, especially for larger,
accuracy-driven ensembles. We found that reducing retraining frequency
significantly lowers costs, with minimal impact on accuracy, particularly for
point forecasts. Moreover, efficiency-driven ensembles offer a strong balance,
achieving competitive accuracy with considerably lower costs compared to
accuracy-optimized combinations. Most importantly, small ensembles of two or
three models are often sufficient to achieve near-optimal results. These
findings provide practical guidelines for deploying scalable and cost-efficient
forecasting systems, supporting the broader goals of sustainable AI in
forecasting. Overall, this work shows that careful ensemble design and
retraining strategy selection can yield accurate, robust, and cost-effective
forecasts suitable for real-world applications.

Motivation: Address the need for deriving meaningful insights from LLM chatbot interactions without compromising user privacy.

Method: Utilizes private clustering, innovative keyword extraction (via frequency-based, TF-IDF, and LLM-guided methods), and DP tools for clustering, partition selection, and summarization.

Result: Demonstrated ability to preserve lexical/semantic content, measure similarity, and benchmark against non-private pipelines, with enhanced DP robustness.

Conclusion: Successfully achieves a balance between extracting insightful data and ensuring privacy, proving the utility and strength of the framework.

Abstract: We introduce $Urania$, a novel framework for generating insights about LLM
chatbot interactions with rigorous differential privacy (DP) guarantees. The
framework employs a private clustering mechanism and innovative keyword
extraction methods, including frequency-based, TF-IDF-based, and LLM-guided
approaches. By leveraging DP tools such as clustering, partition selection, and
histogram-based summarization, $Urania$ provides end-to-end privacy protection.
Our evaluation assesses lexical and semantic content preservation, pair
similarity, and LLM-based metrics, benchmarking against a non-private
Clio-inspired pipeline (Tamkin et al., 2024). Moreover, we develop a simple
empirical privacy evaluation that demonstrates the enhanced robustness of our
DP pipeline. The results show the framework's ability to extract meaningful
conversational insights while maintaining stringent user privacy, effectively
balancing data utility with privacy preservation.

### [341] [Towards Better Generalization via Distributional Input Projection Network](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04690)
*Yifan Hao,Yanxin Lu,Xinwei Shen,Tong Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces DIPNet, a framework designed to enhance the generalization of overparameterized models by employing input projection into learnable distributions, leading to a smoother loss landscape.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper seeks to address the challenge of limited insight into generalization performance in overparameterized models because training loss alone is insufficient. Smoothness has been linked to better generalization, but enforcing smoothness in neural networks is difficult.

Method: The authors propose DIPNet, a framework that projects inputs into learnable distributions at each network layer. This approach creates a smoother loss landscape, reducing local smoothness measures and the Lipschitz constant, thereby improving generalization.

Result: The paper provides theoretical and empirical evidence that DIPNet improves generalization across various architectures (ViTs, LLMs, ResNet, MLPs) and tasks. It enhances test performance under adversarial attacks, out-of-distribution inputs, and reasoning benchmarks.

Conclusion: DIPNet offers a general and effective method for boosting generalization performance in deep learning, with compatibility across diverse model architectures and tasks.

Abstract: As overparameterized models become increasingly prevalent, training loss
alone offers limited insight into generalization performance. While smoothness
has been linked to improved generalization across various settings, directly
enforcing smoothness in neural networks remains challenging. To address this,
we introduce Distributional Input Projection Networks (DIPNet), a novel
framework that projects inputs into learnable distributions at each layer. This
distributional representation induces a smoother loss landscape with respect to
the input, promoting better generalization. We provide theoretical analysis
showing that DIPNet reduces both local smoothness measures and the Lipschitz
constant of the network, contributing to improved generalization performance.
Empirically, we validate DIPNet across a wide range of architectures and tasks,
including Vision Transformers (ViTs), Large Language Models (LLMs), ResNet and
MLPs. Our method consistently enhances test performance under standard
settings, adversarial attacks, out-of-distribution inputs, and reasoning
benchmarks. We demonstrate that the proposed input projection strategy can be
seamlessly integrated into existing models, providing a general and effective
approach for boosting generalization performance in modern deep learning.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper develops a proximal Bregman response function to predict edge influence on GNNs, addressing both edge deletions and insertions, and incorporating message propagation effects.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve the interpretability and robustness of graph neural networks by understanding the influence of individual edges, overcoming limitations of existing influence prediction methods.

Method: The authors propose a proximal Bregman response function tailored to GNNs, relaxing strict convexity assumptions and accounting for edge insertions, deletions, and message propagation effects.

Result: The method achieves accurate influence prediction on real-world datasets for various GNN characteristics, demonstrating versatility in graph rewiring and adversarial attack tasks.

Conclusion: The approach offers a principled way to predict edge influence on GNNs, broadening applicability and addressing key limitations in prior methods.

Abstract: Understanding how individual edges influence the behavior of graph neural
networks (GNNs) is essential for improving their interpretability and
robustness. Graph influence functions have emerged as promising tools to
efficiently estimate the effects of edge deletions without retraining. However,
existing influence prediction methods rely on strict convexity assumptions,
exclusively consider the influence of edge deletions while disregarding edge
insertions, and fail to capture changes in message propagation caused by these
modifications. In this work, we propose a proximal Bregman response function
specifically tailored for GNNs, relaxing the convexity requirement and enabling
accurate influence prediction for standard neural network architectures.
Furthermore, our method explicitly accounts for message propagation effects and
extends influence prediction to both edge deletions and insertions in a
principled way. Experiments with real-world datasets demonstrate accurate
influence predictions for different characteristics of GNNs. We further
demonstrate that the influence function is versatile in applications such as
graph rewiring and adversarial attacks.

*Tonmoy Paul,Mrittika Devi Mati,Md. Mahmudul Islam*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a machine learning framework based on satellite data to classify drought severity across Bangladesh, addressing the limitations of traditional drought indices and current models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Drought significantly affects Bangladesh's agriculture, socio-economic stability, and food security, yet traditional indices and models lack precision and fail to fully incorporate relevant factors and data.

Method: The framework employs satellite data and unsupervised clustering methods (K-means, Bayesian Gaussian Mixture), along with classification models (KNN, Random Forest, Decision Tree, Naive Bayes), integrating weather data from 2012-2024 to classify drought severity.

Result: The proposed approach effectively identifies drought severity levels and finds regional variability in vulnerabilities, demonstrating the efficacy of machine learning in this domain.

Conclusion: The integration of satellite data and machine learning provides an advanced tool for understanding and predicting drought, improving upon traditional models and offering regional insights into vulnerabilities.

Abstract: Drought poses a pervasive environmental challenge in Bangladesh, impacting
agriculture, socio-economic stability, and food security due to its unique
geographic and anthropogenic vulnerabilities. Traditional drought indices, such
as the Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) and Palmer Drought Severity Index
(PDSI), often overlook crucial factors like soil moisture and temperature,
limiting their resolution. Moreover, current machine learning models applied to
drought prediction have been underexplored in the context of Bangladesh,
lacking a comprehensive integration of satellite data across multiple
districts. To address these gaps, we propose a satellite data-driven machine
learning framework to classify drought across 38 districts of Bangladesh. Using
unsupervised algorithms like K-means and Bayesian Gaussian Mixture for
clustering, followed by classification models such as KNN, Random Forest,
Decision Tree, and Naive Bayes, the framework integrates weather data
(humidity, soil moisture, temperature) from 2012-2024. This approach
successfully classifies drought severity into different levels. However, it
shows significant variabilities in drought vulnerabilities across regions which
highlights the aptitude of machine learning models in terms of identifying and
predicting drought conditions.

*Pinak Mandal,Georg A. Gottwald*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces fast unlearning algorithms based on loss gradient orthogonalization for generative models, addressing the selective removal of data influence efficiently without the need for extensive retraining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The increasing use of generative models necessitates the ability to effectively unlearn specific data due to privacy concerns, legal requirements, or correction of harmful content.

Method: The proposed algorithms utilize loss gradient orthogonalization to selectively remove undesired data influence while preserving model quality, desired training data impact, and employing few training steps.

Result: Experiments on MNIST and CelebA datasets demonstrate faster unlearning times compared to previous methods, such as gradient surgery, while maintaining model fidelity.

Conclusion: The fast unlearning algorithms present a significant improvement in the ability to remove unwanted data influence efficiently while preserving generative model quality and relevance of desired data.

Abstract: As generative models become increasingly powerful and pervasive, the ability
to unlearn specific data, whether due to privacy concerns, legal requirements,
or the correction of harmful content, has become increasingly important. Unlike
in conventional training, where data are accumulated and knowledge is
reinforced, unlearning aims to selectively remove the influence of particular
data points without costly retraining from scratch. To be effective and
reliable, such algorithms need to achieve (i) forgetting of the undesired data,
(ii) preservation of the quality of the generation, (iii) preservation of the
influence of the desired training data on the model parameters, and (iv) small
number of training steps. We propose fast unlearning algorithms based on loss
gradient orthogonalization. We show that our algorithms are able to forget data
while maintaining the fidelity of the original model. Using MNIST and CelebA
data, we demonstrate that our algorithms achieve orders of magnitude faster
unlearning times than their predecessors, such as gradient surgery.

TL;DR: This paper presents MGRPO, a two-layer adaptation of GRPO for improving the reasoning and self-correction capabilities of LLMs, addressing challenges of unstable exploration in complex reasoning tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve the reasoning abilities of large language models while addressing inefficient exploration and error propagation problems in the GRPO framework.

Method: The MGRPO method involves a two-layer GRPO approach: the first layer generates an initial response, while the second layer identifies and corrects errors in the response, fostering self-correction through implicit supervision.

Result: MGRPO demonstrated superior performance over standard GRPO on several mathematical reasoning benchmarks, enhancing both reasoning and self-correction capabilities.

Conclusion: MGRPO successfully addresses stability and error propagation challenges in reasoning tasks by introducing a multi-layer self-correction framework, providing an effective alternative to dense supervision.

Abstract: The Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) algorithm has demonstrated
considerable success in enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language
models (LLMs), as evidenced by DeepSeek-R1. However, the absence of
intermediate supervision in GRPO frequently leads to inefficient exploration
dynamics. A single error in a complex reasoning chain can invalidate the entire
solution, resulting in abrupt reward vanishing and compromising training
stability.To address these challenges, we propose MGRPO (Multi-layer GRPO).
MGRPO operates in two layers: the first layer employs standard GRPO to generate
an initial response. This response, along with the original query, is then fed
into a second-layer GRPO process. This second layer is specifically trained to
identify and correct errors in the initial response, effectively creating a
self-correction loop. This mechanism provides implicit process-level
supervision by rewarding successful error correction, without requiring an
explicit, densely-annotated reward model. Experimental results on several
mathematical reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that MGRPO significantly
outperforms standard GRPO, achieving superior performance by fostering both
reasoning and self-correction abilities.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces 'log-linear attention,' an efficient attention mechanism combining linear attention's speed and softmax attention's expressiveness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The quadratic-compute and linear-memory complexity of traditional Transformer attention mechanisms pose significant scalability issues for sequence modeling.

Method: The authors propose log-linear attention with a logarithmically growing set of hidden states, allowing for log-linear compute cost and matmul-rich parallelism. They integrate this into existing architectures.

Result: Log-linear attention demonstrates improved performance compared to linear-time variants, as showcased through its application on architectures like Mamba-2 and Gated DeltaNet.

Conclusion: Log-linear attention achieves a balance between efficiency and expressiveness, offering a scalable and effective alternative for sequence modeling.

Abstract: The attention mechanism in Transformers is an important primitive for
accurate and scalable sequence modeling. Its quadratic-compute and
linear-memory complexity however remain significant bottlenecks. Linear
attention and state-space models enable linear-time, constant-memory sequence
modeling and can moreover be trained efficiently through matmul-rich
parallelization across sequence length. However, at their core these models are
still RNNs, and thus their use of a fixed-size hidden state to model the
context is a fundamental limitation. This paper develops log-linear attention,
an attention mechanism that balances linear attention's efficiency and the
expressiveness of softmax attention. Log-linear attention replaces the
fixed-size hidden state with a logarithmically growing set of hidden states. We
show that with a particular growth function, log-linear attention admits a
similarly matmul-rich parallel form whose compute cost is log-linear in
sequence length. Log-linear attention is a general framework and can be applied
on top of existing linear attention variants. As case studies, we instantiate
log-linear variants of two recent architectures -- Mamba-2 and Gated DeltaNet
-- and find they perform well compared to their linear-time variants.

TL;DR: OpenGT establishes a benchmarking framework for Graph Transformers, enabling standardized evaluations and providing critical insights into their design and applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper seeks to address the lack of comprehensive benchmarks and analysis tools for Graph Transformers (GTs), aiming to understand their ideal application scenarios and effective design choices.

Method: OpenGT provides a standardized experimental setting with a diverse array of evaluations that assess Graph Transformers across tasks, datasets, and design aspects.

Result: The benchmark reveals key insights like difficulties in task transfers, limitations in local attention, efficiency trade-offs, and preprocessing overheads of positional encodings, among others.

Conclusion: This work promotes fairness, reproducibility, and generalizability in GT research through its OpenGT benchmarking framework and library, laying groundwork for future development.

Abstract: Graph Transformers (GTs) have recently demonstrated remarkable performance
across diverse domains. By leveraging attention mechanisms, GTs are capable of
modeling long-range dependencies and complex structural relationships beyond
local neighborhoods. However, their applicable scenarios are still
underexplored, this highlights the need to identify when and why they excel.
Furthermore, unlike GNNs, which predominantly rely on message-passing
mechanisms, GTs exhibit a diverse design space in areas such as positional
encoding, attention mechanisms, and graph-specific adaptations. Yet, it remains
unclear which of these design choices are truly effective and under what
conditions. As a result, the community currently lacks a comprehensive
benchmark and library to promote a deeper understanding and further development
of GTs. To address this gap, this paper introduces OpenGT, a comprehensive
benchmark for Graph Transformers. OpenGT enables fair comparisons and
multidimensional analysis by establishing standardized experimental settings
and incorporating a broad selection of state-of-the-art GNNs and GTs. Our
benchmark evaluates GTs from multiple perspectives, encompassing diverse tasks
and datasets with varying properties. Through extensive experiments, our
benchmark has uncovered several critical insights, including the difficulty of
transferring models across task levels, the limitations of local attention, the
efficiency trade-offs in several models, the application scenarios of specific
positional encodings, and the preprocessing overhead of some positional
encodings. We aspire for this work to establish a foundation for future graph
transformer research emphasizing fairness, reproducibility, and
generalizability. We have developed an easy-to-use library OpenGT for training
and evaluating existing GTs. The benchmark code is available at

Motivation: To understand the structural relationship between $k$-medoids clustering and KDE-based approaches in Vector Quantization, which seem unrelated but are prominent methods in data compression.

Method: By using Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) formulations to compare $k$-medoids clustering and KDE-based Maximum Mean Discrepancy minimization.

Result: The paper demonstrates that a KDE-QUBO is a special case of the $k$-medoids-QUBO under certain assumptions about the kernel’s feature map, establishing a connection between the two methods.

Conclusion: Both $k$-medoids and KDE-based methods can be unified under QUBO formulations, offering new insights into weighting parameters and their geometric interpretation, enhancing our understanding of VQ methods.

Abstract: Vector Quantization (VQ) is a widely used technique in machine learning and
data compression, valued for its simplicity and interpretability. Among hard VQ
methods, $k$-medoids clustering and Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) approaches
represent two prominent yet seemingly unrelated paradigms -- one
distance-based, the other rooted in probability density matching. In this
paper, we investigate their connection through the lens of Quadratic
Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO). We compare a heuristic QUBO
formulation for $k$-medoids, which balances centrality and diversity, with a
principled QUBO derived from minimizing Maximum Mean Discrepancy in KDE-based
VQ. Surprisingly, we show that the KDE-QUBO is a special case of the
$k$-medoids-QUBO under mild assumptions on the kernel's feature map. This
reveals a deeper structural relationship between these two approaches and
provides new insight into the geometric interpretation of the weighting
parameters used in QUBO formulations for VQ.

### [349] [Adaptive Preconditioners Trigger Loss Spikes in Adam](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04805)
*Zhiwei Bai,Zhangchen Zhou,Jiajie Zhao,Xiaolong Li,Zhiyu Li,Feiyu Xiong,Hongkang Yang,Yaoyu Zhang,Zhi-Qin John Xu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper investigates the cause of loss spikes in neural networks trained with the Adam optimizer and links them to instability caused by mismatched squared gradient and second-order moment estimates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding why loss spikes occur during Adam optimizer training is crucial for improving optimization stability and model performance.

Method: The authors analyze the Adam optimizer's preconditioning behavior, identify instability induced by second-order moment decay relative to squared gradients, and experimentally verify their findings across diverse network architectures.

Result: They demonstrate that loss spikes occur when the gradient-directional curvature exceeds a certain threshold, driven by sluggish updates of second-order moments.

Conclusion: The study provides a nuanced explanation for Adam spikes and highlights a specific instability mechanism linked to loss-landscape curvature and preconditioner behavior.

Abstract: Loss spikes emerge commonly during training across neural networks of varying
architectures and scales when using the Adam optimizer. In this work, we
investigate the underlying mechanism responsible for Adam spikes. While
previous explanations attribute these phenomena to the lower-loss-as-sharper
characteristics of the loss landscape, our analysis reveals that Adam's
adaptive preconditioners themselves can trigger spikes. Specifically, we
identify a critical regime where squared gradients become substantially smaller
than the second-order moment estimates, causing the latter to undergo a
$\beta_2$-exponential decay and to respond sluggishly to current gradient
information. This mechanism can push the maximum eigenvalue of the
preconditioned Hessian beyond the classical stability threshold $2/\eta$ for a
sustained period, inducing instability. This instability further leads to an
alignment between the gradient and the maximum eigendirection, and a loss spike
occurs precisely when the gradient-directional curvature exceeds $2/\eta$. We
verify this mechanism through extensive experiments on fully connected
networks, convolutional networks, and Transformer architectures.

### [350] [LogicPuzzleRL: Cultivating Robust Mathematical Reasoning in LLMs via Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04821)
*Zhen Hao Wong,Jingwen Deng,Runming He,Zirong Chen,Qijie You,Hejun Dong,Hao Liang,Chengyu Shen,Bin Cui,Wentao Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a "play to learn" reinforcement learning framework to fine-tune large language models (LLMs) using logic puzzles, leading to better multi-step reasoning performance in unfamiliar tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs perform well on supervised tasks but struggle with general-purpose structured reasoning, indicating a need for training methods that foster broad reasoning capabilities.

Method: LLMs are fine-tuned using reinforcement learning on seven custom-designed logic puzzles, each targeting different reasoning abilities. Binary feedback on puzzle correctness promotes iterative problem-solving.

Result: The framework enhances LLMs' performance on out-of-distribution mathematical benchmarks, particularly for tasks requiring multi-step reasoning, while showing limited improvement on rote or specialized tasks.

Conclusion: Training LLMs on logic puzzles using reinforcement learning improves their internal reasoning processes, enabling better generalization and compositional reasoning in unfamiliar settings.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at many supervised tasks but often
struggle with structured reasoning in unfamiliar settings. This discrepancy
suggests that standard fine-tuning pipelines may instill narrow,
domain-specific heuristics rather than fostering general-purpose thinking
strategies. In this work, we propose a "play to learn" framework that
fine-tunes LLMs through reinforcement learning on a suite of seven custom logic
puzzles, each designed to cultivate distinct reasoning skills such as
constraint propagation, spatial consistency, and symbolic deduction. Using a
reinforcement learning setup with verifiable rewards, models receive binary
feedback based on puzzle correctness, encouraging iterative, hypothesis-driven
problem solving. We demonstrate that this training approach significantly
improves out-of-distribution performance on a range of mathematical benchmarks,
especially for mid-difficulty problems that require multi-step reasoning.
Analyses across problem categories and difficulty levels reveal that puzzle
training promotes transferable reasoning routines, strengthening algebraic
manipulation, geometric inference, and combinatorial logic, while offering
limited gains on rote or highly specialized tasks. These findings show that
reinforcement learning over logic puzzles reshapes the internal reasoning of
LLMs, enabling more robust and compositional generalization without relying on
task-specific symbolic tools.

TL;DR: This paper introduces EHR2Path, an advanced patient pathway modeling system that interprets electronic health records for predictive healthcare.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the inefficiencies of managing complex and heterogeneous patient data in healthcare systems and the limitations of existing solutions that fail to holistically analyze patient trajectories.

Method: The authors propose EHR2Path, a system that structures diverse EHR data into a unified representation and integrates a holistic prediction model with a novel summary mechanism for handling long-term temporal context.

Result: EHR2Path outperforms existing approaches in tasks like next-time-step prediction and longitudinal simulation, demonstrating improvements in predicting vital signs, lab test results, and length-of-stay.

Conclusion: EHR2Path provides a robust framework for personalized healthcare, enabling better simulation, prediction, and understanding of patient trajectories for improved care delivery.

Abstract: Healthcare systems face significant challenges in managing and interpreting
vast, heterogeneous patient data for personalized care. Existing approaches
often focus on narrow use cases with a limited feature space, overlooking the
complex, longitudinal interactions needed for a holistic understanding of
patient health. In this work, we propose a novel approach to patient pathway
modeling by transforming diverse electronic health record (EHR) data into a
structured representation and designing a holistic pathway prediction model,
EHR2Path, optimized to predict future health trajectories. Further, we
introduce a novel summary mechanism that embeds long-term temporal context into
topic-specific summary tokens, improving performance over text-only models,
while being much more token-efficient. EHR2Path demonstrates strong performance
in both next time-step prediction and longitudinal simulation, outperforming
competitive baselines. It enables detailed simulations of patient trajectories,
inherently targeting diverse evaluation tasks, such as forecasting vital signs,
lab test results, or length-of-stay, opening a path towards predictive and
personalized healthcare.

### [352] [Sparse Autoencoders, Again?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04859)
*Yin Lu,Tong He,Xuening Zhu,David Wipf*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper critiques the limitations of sparse autoencoders (SAEs) and variational autoencoders (VAEs), proposes a hybrid solution, and shows its theoretical and empirical superiority in tasks involving manifold data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation behind this paper is to address longstanding limitations in sparse autoencoders (SAEs) and their variants, like VAEs, which have largely retained their original formulations and are sub-optimal in addressing modern complex data manifold tasks.

Method: The authors propose a hybrid model that addresses weaknesses in traditional SAEs and VAEs, theoretically proving that its global minima can effectively recover data structures across manifold unions. Empirically, they validate the approach with synthetic and real-world datasets, focusing on sparseness, latent representation accuracy, and manifold dimension estimation.

Result: The hybrid model outperformed traditional SAEs, VAEs, and recent diffusion models in producing sparse latent representations and dimension estimation, without sacrificing reconstruction error, for tasks involving images and language model activations.

Conclusion: The proposed hybrid autoencoder model overcomes prior limitations of SAEs and VAEs, offering superior performance in modeling manifold-structured data and producing sparse representations. This underscores the need for innovation beyond classical SAEs and VAEs in deep learning.

Abstract: Is there really much more to say about sparse autoencoders (SAEs)?
Autoencoders in general, and SAEs in particular, represent deep architectures
that are capable of modeling low-dimensional latent structure in data. Such
structure could reflect, among other things, correlation patterns in large
language model activations, or complex natural image manifolds. And yet despite
the wide-ranging applicability, there have been relatively few changes to SAEs
beyond the original recipe from decades ago, namely, standard deep
encoder/decoder layers trained with a classical/deterministic sparse
regularizer applied within the latent space. One possible exception is the
variational autoencoder (VAE), which adopts a stochastic encoder module capable
of producing sparse representations when applied to manifold data. In this work
we formalize underappreciated weaknesses with both canonical SAEs, as well as
analogous VAEs applied to similar tasks, and propose a hybrid alternative model
that circumvents these prior limitations. In terms of theoretical support, we
prove that global minima of our proposed model recover certain forms of
structured data spread across a union of manifolds. Meanwhile, empirical
evaluations on synthetic and real-world datasets substantiate the efficacy of
our approach in accurately estimating underlying manifold dimensions and
producing sparser latent representations without compromising reconstruction
error. In general, we are able to exceed the performance of equivalent-capacity
SAEs and VAEs, as well as recent diffusion models where applicable, within
domains such as images and language model activation patterns.

*Antonio Almudévar,José Miguel Hernández-Lobato,Sameer Khurana,Ricard Marxer,Alfonso Ortega*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The abstract discusses the ineffectiveness of contrastive losses in achieving aligned multimodal representation and proposes a regularization term to address the issue.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the problem of ineffective multimodal representation alignment caused by modality-specific information in the representation space.

Method: The authors analyze this phenomenon theoretically using the Information Bottleneck Principle and propose a regularization term based on a variational approximation to improve alignment.

Result: The proposed method's advantages were demonstrated both in controlled setups and real-world applications.

Conclusion: Incorporating the proposed regularization term mitigates the emergence of modality-specific information and enhances multimodal representation alignment.

Abstract: Contrastive losses have been extensively used as a tool for multimodal
representation learning. However, it has been empirically observed that their
use is not effective to learn an aligned representation space. In this paper,
we argue that this phenomenon is caused by the presence of modality-specific
information in the representation space. Although some of the most widely used
contrastive losses maximize the mutual information between representations of
both modalities, they are not designed to remove the modality-specific
information. We give a theoretical description of this problem through the lens
of the Information Bottleneck Principle. We also empirically analyze how
different hyperparameters affect the emergence of this phenomenon in a
controlled experimental setup. Finally, we propose a regularization term in the
loss function that is derived by means of a variational approximation and aims
to increase the representational alignment. We analyze in a set of controlled
experiments and real-world applications the advantages of including this
regularization term.

### [354] [There Was Never a Bottleneck in Concept Bottleneck Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04877)
*Antonio Almudévar,José Miguel Hernández-Lobato,Alfonso Ortega*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper critiques Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs) for not truly isolating concept-specific information and introduces Minimal Concept Bottleneck Models (MCBMs) to address this via an Information Bottleneck (IB) objective.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CBMs aim to improve interpretability of deep learning but fail to guarantee concept-specific isolation, limiting their reliability in sensitive applications.

Method: The authors propose MCBMs, which employ an Information Bottleneck objective using variational regularization to ensure each component encodes only information about its specific concept.

Result: MCBMs enable concept-level interventions with theoretical guarantees, adhere to Bayesian principles, and offer flexibility in model design.

Conclusion: MCBMs address shortcomings of CBMs by better isolating concept-specific information, improving interpretability and intervention reliability in sensitive contexts.

Abstract: Deep learning representations are often difficult to interpret, which can
hinder their deployment in sensitive applications. Concept Bottleneck Models
(CBMs) have emerged as a promising approach to mitigate this issue by learning
representations that support target task performance while ensuring that each
component predicts a concrete concept from a predefined set. In this work, we
argue that CBMs do not impose a true bottleneck: the fact that a component can
predict a concept does not guarantee that it encodes only information about
that concept. This shortcoming raises concerns regarding interpretability and
the validity of intervention procedures. To overcome this limitation, we
propose Minimal Concept Bottleneck Models (MCBMs), which incorporate an
Information Bottleneck (IB) objective to constrain each representation
component to retain only the information relevant to its corresponding concept.
This IB is implemented via a variational regularization term added to the
training loss. As a result, MCBMs support concept-level interventions with
theoretical guarantees, remain consistent with Bayesian principles, and offer
greater flexibility in key design choices.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper develops a semi-automated method using CT scans and a statistical shape model for improved classification of hip dysplasia, achieving better accuracy and clinical efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Early diagnosis of hip dysplasia is crucial to reduce the risk of developing osteoarthritis through timely surgical intervention.

Method: The authors introduce Gaussian Process Diffeomorphic Statistical Shape Model (GPDSSM), which combines Gaussian Process Latent Variable Model with diffeomorphism, using volumetric CT scans and minimal clinically annotated landmarks.

Result: The method achieves superior classification accuracy for dysplasia (AUC 96.2%) compared to angle-based methods (AUC 91.2%), and effectively identifies dysplastic regions in the hip surface.

Conclusion: The GPDSSM enhances diagnostic accuracy while simplifying the process for clinicians, thus offering an improved and more efficient diagnostic tool for dysplasia assessment.

Abstract: Dysplasia is a recognised risk factor for osteoarthritis (OA) of the hip,
early diagnosis of dysplasia is important to provide opportunities for surgical
interventions aimed at reducing the risk of hip OA. We have developed a
pipeline for semi-automated classification of dysplasia using volumetric CT
scans of patients' hips and a minimal set of clinically annotated landmarks,
combining the framework of the Gaussian Process Latent Variable Model with
diffeomorphism to create a statistical shape model, which we termed the
Gaussian Process Diffeomorphic Statistical Shape Model (GPDSSM). We used 192 CT
scans, 100 for model training and 92 for testing. The GPDSSM effectively
distinguishes dysplastic samples from controls while also highlighting regions
of the underlying surface that show dysplastic variations. As well as improving
classification accuracy compared to angle-based methods (AUC 96.2% vs 91.2%),
the GPDSSM can save time for clinicians by removing the need to manually
measure angles and interpreting 2D scans for possible markers of dysplasia.

TL;DR: The paper investigates RL for long-context reasoning, examining positive and negative samples, data inefficiency, and instability in model performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address open questions and unexpected behaviors in reinforcement learning for training long-context reasoning models.

Method: Systematic analysis of positive vs. negative samples, exploration of data efficiency strategies, and evaluation on model variability through multiple runs.

Result: Negative samples enhance generalization, data inefficiency was reduced with new strategies, and multiple evaluation runs mitigated performance instability.

Conclusion: Negative samples and data efficiency strategies are crucial for training RL models with robust long-context reasoning capabilities.

Abstract: Despite recent progress in training long-context reasoning models via
reinforcement learning (RL), several open questions and counterintuitive
behaviors remain. This work focuses on three key aspects: (1) We systematically
analyze the roles of positive and negative samples in RL, revealing that
positive samples mainly facilitate data fitting, whereas negative samples
significantly enhance generalization and robustness. Interestingly, training
solely on negative samples can rival standard RL training performance. (2) We
identify substantial data inefficiency in group relative policy optimization,
where over half of the samples yield zero advantage. To address this, we
explore two straightforward strategies, including relative length rewards and
offline sample injection, to better leverage these data and enhance reasoning
efficiency and capability. (3) We investigate unstable performance across
various reasoning models and benchmarks, attributing instability to uncertain
problems with ambiguous outcomes, and demonstrate that multiple evaluation runs
mitigate this issue.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance timely identification of high-risk ICU patients, addressing the need for efficient allocation of limited medical resources.

Method: Developed ALFIA, leveraging LoRA adapters, adaptive layer fusion, and intelligent attention mechanisms with clinical BERT embeddings, trained on CriticalWindow-24 dataset.

Result: ALFIA outperformed state-of-the-art tabular classifiers in AUPRC and maintained a balanced precision-recall performance, demonstrating superior early-warning capabilities.

Conclusion: ALFIA provides clinicians with a robust tool for ICU risk stratification directly using clinical text, enhancing intervention accuracy and efficiency.

Abstract: Early identification of high-risk ICU patients is crucial for directing
limited medical resources. We introduce ALFIA (Adaptive Layer Fusion with
Intelligent Attention), a modular, attention-based architecture that jointly
trains LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) adapters and an adaptive layer-weighting
mechanism to fuse multi-layer semantic features from a BERT backbone. Trained
on our rigorous cw-24 (CriticalWindow-24) benchmark, ALFIA surpasses
state-of-the-art tabular classifiers in AUPRC while preserving a balanced
precision-recall profile. The embeddings produced by ALFIA's fusion module,
capturing both fine-grained clinical cues and high-level concepts, enable
seamless pairing with GBDTs (CatBoost/LightGBM) as ALFIA-boost, and deep neuro
networks as ALFIA-nn, yielding additional performance gains. Our experiments
confirm ALFIA's superior early-warning performance, by operating directly on
routine clinical text, it furnishes clinicians with a convenient yet robust
tool for risk stratification and timely intervention in critical-care settings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to simplify human-machine interaction and align industrial automation with the human-centric principles of Industry 5.0, addressing the complexity brought by Industry 4.0.

Method: The proposed framework integrates Agentic AI systems with an intent-based paradigm. It decomposes user-expressed high-level intents into actionable components, orchestrating sub-agents with specialized tools to carry out tasks. A proof of concept was developed using the CMAPSS dataset and Google ADK.

Result: The proof of concept demonstrated the feasibility of intent decomposition, agent orchestration, and autonomous decision-making in predictive maintenance scenarios. However, challenges like data quality and explainability were noted.

Conclusion: The approach has significant potential to simplify automation and reduce barriers, offering a scalable, intent-driven solution for Industry 5.0 applications.

Abstract: The recent development of Agentic AI systems, empowered by autonomous large
language models (LLMs) agents with planning and tool-usage capabilities,
enables new possibilities for the evolution of industrial automation and
reduces the complexity introduced by Industry 4.0. This work proposes a
conceptual framework that integrates Agentic AI with the intent-based paradigm,
originally developed in network research, to simplify human-machine interaction
(HMI) and better align automation systems with the human-centric, sustainable,
and resilient principles of Industry 5.0. Based on the intent-based processing,
the framework allows human operators to express high-level business or
operational goals in natural language, which are decomposed into actionable
components. These intents are broken into expectations, conditions, targets,
context, and information that guide sub-agents equipped with specialized tools
to execute domain-specific tasks. A proof of concept was implemented using the
CMAPSS dataset and Google Agent Developer Kit (ADK), demonstrating the
feasibility of intent decomposition, agent orchestration, and autonomous

potential of this approach to reduce technical barriers and enable scalable,
intent-driven automation, despite data quality and explainability concerns.

*Boris van Breugel,Yelysei Bondarenko,Paul Whatmough,Markus Nagel*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FPTQuant introduces novel transforms to enable effective quantization of large language models (LLMs) without performance degradation, achieving up to 3.9x speed-up.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large language models require significant computational resources at inference, and naive quantization methods degrade their performance.

Method: The paper proposes four lightweight function-preserving transforms (FPTs) that reshape activation distributions to be quantization-friendly without custom kernels or added inference overhead.

Result: FPTQuant enables static INT4 quantization with minimal overhead, achieving state-of-the-art speed-ups and competitive accuracy.

Conclusion: FPTQuant achieves an excellent trade-off between accuracy and computational efficiency, outperforming many prior methods while maintaining high model function integrity.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) require substantial compute, and thus energy, at
inference time. While quantizing weights and activations is effective at
improving efficiency, naive quantization of LLMs can significantly degrade
performance due to large magnitude outliers. This paper describes FPTQuant,
which introduces four novel, lightweight, and expressive function-preserving
transforms (FPTs) to facilitate quantization of transformers: (1) a mergeable
pre-RoPE transform for queries and keys, (2) a mergeable transform for values,
(3) a mergeable scaling transform within the MLP block, and (4) a cheap,
dynamic scaling transform. By leveraging the equivariances and independencies
inherent to canonical transformer operation, we designed these FPTs to maintain
the model's function while shaping the intermediate activation distributions to
be more quantization friendly. FPTQuant requires no custom kernels and adds
virtually no overhead during inference. The FPTs are trained both locally to
reduce outliers, and end-to-end such that the outputs of the quantized and
full-precision models match. FPTQuant enables static INT4 quantization with
minimal overhead and shows SOTA speed-up of up to 3.9 times over FP.
Empirically, FPTQuant has an excellent accuracy-speed trade-off -- it is
performing on par or exceeding most prior work and only shows slightly lower
accuracy compared to a method that is up to 29% slower.

*Ashkan Soleymani,Georgios Piliouras,Gabriele Farina*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a framework called 'Cautious Optimism' for accelerating no-regret learning in general games using adaptive pacing with minimal computational cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore if adaptive pacing for no-regret learning acceleration is a generalizable phenomenon, beyond existing Optimistic Multiplicative Weight Updates (OMWU).

Method: The authors extend the Follow-the-Regularized-Leader (FTRL) framework by incorporating adaptive pacing mechanisms while maintaining computational efficiency and uncoupledness.

Result: Cautious Optimistic FTRL achieves near-optimal $O_T(\log T)$ regret in self-play scenarios while preserving $O(\sqrt{T})$ regret in adversarial settings, without relying on monotonic step sizes.

Conclusion: The work demonstrates that adaptive pacing is widely applicable for faster no-regret learning in games, offering a novel and efficient approach compared to previous methods.

Abstract: Recent work [Soleymani et al., 2025] introduced a variant of Optimistic
Multiplicative Weights Updates (OMWU) that adaptively controls the learning
pace in a dynamic, non-monotone manner, achieving new state-of-the-art regret
minimization guarantees in general games. In this work, we demonstrate that
no-regret learning acceleration through adaptive pacing of the learners is not
an isolated phenomenon. We introduce \emph{Cautious Optimism}, a framework for
substantially faster regularized learning in general games. Cautious Optimism
takes as input any instance of Follow-the-Regularized-Leader (FTRL) and outputs
an accelerated no-regret learning algorithm by pacing the underlying FTRL with
minimal computational overhead. Importantly, we retain uncoupledness (learners
do not need to know other players' utilities). Cautious Optimistic FTRL
achieves near-optimal $O_T(\log T)$ regret in diverse self-play
(mixing-and-matching regularizers) while preserving the optimal $O(\sqrt{T})$
regret in adversarial scenarios. In contrast to prior works (e.g. Syrgkanis et
al. [2015], Daskalakis et al. [2021]), our analysis does not rely on monotonic
step-sizes, showcasing a novel route for fast learning in general games.

TL;DR: The paper introduces MultiPoint Proximity (MPP) encoding, a method to represent vector-mode geospatial data in a format suitable for machine learning models, demonstrating better performance than rasterization-based methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to enable the effective use of vector-mode geospatial data in machine learning models by creating an encoding method that captures geometric properties of shapes.

Method: The proposed method, MPP encoding, calculates scaled distances from a shape to multiple reference points within a region, which can then parameterize machine learning models.

Result: MPP encoding is shown to outperform rasterization-based methods in capturing geometric features, differentiating spatial objects, and encoding pairwise spatial relationships with high precision.

Conclusion: MPP encoding is a highly effective and generalizable method for parameterizing machine learning models with geospatial features, offering shape-centricity, continuity, and precision.

Abstract: Vector-mode geospatial data -- points, lines, and polygons -- must be encoded
into an appropriate form in order to be used with traditional machine learning
and artificial intelligence models. Encoding methods attempt to represent a
given shape as a vector that captures its essential geometric properties. This
paper presents an encoding method based on scaled distances from a shape to a
set of reference points within a region of interest. The method, MultiPoint
Proximity (MPP) encoding, can be applied to any type of shape, enabling the
parameterization of machine learning models with encoded representations of
vector-mode geospatial features. We show that MPP encoding possesses the
desirable properties of shape-centricity and continuity, can be used to
differentiate spatial objects based on their geometric features, and can
capture pairwise spatial relationships with high precision. In all cases, MPP
encoding is shown to perform better than an alternative method based on
rasterization.

TL;DR: This paper evaluates foundation models in partial label learning (PLL) and proposes PartialCLIP, an efficient fine-tuning framework for this purpose.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need to address inexact supervision challenges in real-world applications through more generalizable PLL methods, particularly leveraging foundation models.

Method: The authors evaluate 11 foundation models with 13 PLL approaches across 8 datasets under 3 PLL scenarios and introduce a new fine-tuning method called PartialCLIP.

Result: The study reveals performance improvements using foundation models, similarity across PLL approaches, stability across ambiguity levels, and susceptibility to model selection and adaptation strategies.

Conclusion: Current PLL methods have limitations, and the proposed PartialCLIP demonstrates effective initialization and fine-tuning. Insights from this study open pathways for developing generalizable PLL models.

Abstract: Partial label learning (PLL) seeks to train generalizable classifiers from
datasets with inexact supervision, a common challenge in real-world
applications. Existing studies have developed numerous approaches to
progressively refine and recover ground-truth labels by training convolutional
neural networks. However, limited attention has been given to foundation models
that offer transferrable representations. In this work, we empirically conduct
comprehensive evaluations of 11 foundation models across 13 PLL approaches on 8
benchmark datasets under 3 PLL scenarios. We further propose PartialCLIP, an
efficient fine-tuning framework for foundation models in PLL. Our findings
reveal that current PLL approaches tend to 1) achieve significant performance
gains when using foundation models, 2) exhibit remarkably similar performance
to each other, 3) maintain stable performance across varying ambiguity levels,
while 4) are susceptible to foundation model selection and adaptation
strategies. Additionally, we demonstrate the efficacy of text-embedding
classifier initialization and effective candidate label filtering using
zero-shot CLIP. Our experimental results and analysis underscore the
limitations of current PLL approaches and provide valuable insights for
developing more generalizable PLL models. The source code can be found at

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper studies adversarial training (AT) using class-wise feature attribution and highlights the importance of cross-class features in robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the training mechanisms and dynamics of adversarial training (AT) and refine our understanding of its effectiveness.

Method: The authors use a lens of class-wise feature attribution, identify cross-class features, validate their role through theoretical evidence, and conduct systematic experiments across multiple settings.

Result: The study reveals that AT initially focuses on learning cross-class features for robustness but later shifts towards class-specific features, contributing to robust overfitting. It unifies properties like soft-label training and robust overfitting.

Conclusion: The insights enhance understanding of AT mechanisms and provide fresh perspectives for further research into adversarial training and robustness.

Abstract: Adversarial training (AT) has been considered one of the most effective
methods for making deep neural networks robust against adversarial attacks,
while the training mechanisms and dynamics of AT remain open research problems.
In this paper, we present a novel perspective on studying AT through the lens
of class-wise feature attribution. Specifically, we identify the impact of a
key family of features on AT that are shared by multiple classes, which we call
cross-class features. These features are typically useful for robust
classification, which we offer theoretical evidence to illustrate through a
synthetic data model. Through systematic studies across multiple model
architectures and settings, we find that during the initial stage of AT, the
model tends to learn more cross-class features until the best robustness
checkpoint. As AT further squeezes the training robust loss and causes robust
overfitting, the model tends to make decisions based on more class-specific
features. Based on these discoveries, we further provide a unified view of two
existing properties of AT, including the advantage of soft-label training and
robust overfitting. Overall, these insights refine the current understanding of
AT mechanisms and provide new perspectives on studying them. Our code is

*Hyeongwon Jang,Changhun Kim,Eunho Yang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The study identifies flaws in current explainable AI methods for time series analysis by proposing new metrics (CPD and CPP) and introducing TIMING, an enhanced method for better feature attribution.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing time series explainable AI methods overlook the directional impact of features on predictions, leading to inadequate assessments.

Method: The approach refines Integrated Gradients with temporal awareness and introduces new metrics (CPD and CPP) to accurately evaluate point-wise feature contributions.

Result: TIMING, the proposed methodology, demonstrated superior performance compared to baseline methods in synthetic and real-world evaluations.

Conclusion: TIMING improves feature attribution for time series data while preserving theoretical properties and addressing temporal relationships, validated through extensive experiments.

Abstract: Recent explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) methods for time series
primarily estimate point-wise attribution magnitudes, while overlooking the
directional impact on predictions, leading to suboptimal identification of
significant points. Our analysis shows that conventional Integrated Gradients
(IG) effectively capture critical points with both positive and negative
impacts on predictions. However, current evaluation metrics fail to assess this
capability, as they inadvertently cancel out opposing feature contributions. To
address this limitation, we propose novel evaluation metrics-Cumulative
Prediction Difference (CPD) and Cumulative Prediction Preservation (CPP)-to
systematically assess whether attribution methods accurately identify
significant positive and negative points in time series XAI. Under these
metrics, conventional IG outperforms recent counterparts. However, directly
applying IG to time series data may lead to suboptimal outcomes, as generated
paths ignore temporal relationships and introduce out-of-distribution samples.
To overcome these challenges, we introduce TIMING, which enhances IG by
incorporating temporal awareness while maintaining its theoretical properties.
Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world time series benchmarks
demonstrate that TIMING outperforms existing time series XAI baselines. Our
code is available at https://github.com/drumpt/TIMING.

### [365] [iN2V: Bringing Transductive Node Embeddings to Inductive Graphs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05039)
*Nicolas Lell,Ansgar Scherp*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces inductive node2vec (iN2V), an extension of node2vec for generating embeddings in inductive settings where unseen nodes are present.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitation of node2vec, which is restricted to transductive settings and unable to handle new unseen nodes during inference.

Method: The authors propose a post-hoc procedure to generate embeddings for unseen nodes and modify the node2vec training process to prepare embeddings for these scenarios, enabling the framework to work in inductive environments.

Result: iN2V improves node classification performance by an average of 1 point, with gains up to 6 points depending on the dataset and number of unseen nodes. It outperforms standard node2vec in inductive scenarios across several benchmark datasets.

Conclusion: iN2V effectively brings transductive embeddings to inductive settings and is a modular, versatile approach that can create or enhance embeddings, while also integrating with other embedding methods.

Abstract: Shallow node embeddings like node2vec (N2V) can be used for nodes without
features or to supplement existing features with structure-based information.
Embedding methods like N2V are limited in their application on new nodes, which
restricts them to the transductive setting where the entire graph, including
the test nodes, is available during training. We propose inductive node2vec
(iN2V), which combines a post-hoc procedure to compute embeddings for nodes
unseen during training and modifications to the original N2V training procedure
to prepare the embeddings for this post-hoc procedure. We conduct experiments
on several benchmark datasets and demonstrate that iN2V is an effective
approach to bringing transductive embeddings to an inductive setting. Using
iN2V embeddings improves node classification by 1 point on average, with up to
6 points of improvement depending on the dataset and the number of unseen
nodes. Our iN2V is a plug-in approach to create new or enrich existing
embeddings. It can also be combined with other embedding methods, making it a
versatile approach for inductive node representation learning. Code to
reproduce the results is available at https://github.com/Foisunt/iN2V .

*Viet Nguyen Changjian Shui,Vijay Giri,Siddarth Arya,Amol Verma,Fahad Razak,Rahul G. Krishnan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces D3M, a method to monitor model degradation caused by data distribution changes in dynamic environments without label access.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of determining when to retrain models in dynamic environments where some data shifts degrade performance, while others do not.

Method: The proposed approach, D3M, uses predictive model disagreement to detect performance deterioration, achieving balance between false positives and true positive rates. It also provides theoretical sample complexity bounds.

Result: D3M demonstrated effectiveness through experiments on both standard benchmarks and a large-scale internal medicine dataset.

Conclusion: D3M is a practical and viable solution for alerting performance deterioration in high-stakes machine learning systems.

Abstract: The distribution of data changes over time; models operating operating in
dynamic environments need retraining. But knowing when to retrain, without
access to labels, is an open challenge since some, but not all shifts degrade
model performance. This paper formalizes and addresses the problem of
post-deployment deterioration (PDD) monitoring. We propose D3M, a practical and
efficient monitoring algorithm based on the disagreement of predictive models,
achieving low false positive rates under non-deteriorating shifts and provides
sample complexity bounds for high true positive rates under deteriorating
shifts. Empirical results on both standard benchmark and a real-world
large-scale internal medicine dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of the
framework and highlight its viability as an alert mechanism for high-stakes
machine learning pipelines.

*Tobias Pielok,Bernd Bischl,David Rügamer*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes a new kernelized KL divergence estimator for semi-implicit variational inference (SIVI), aimed at improving stability and reducing bias, achieving better performance and efficiency compared to state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Training SIVI with KL divergence is challenging due to issues with high variance and bias in high-dimensional settings.

Method: The authors introduce a kernelized KL divergence estimator with nonparametric smoothing and an importance sampling correction. They provide a theoretical connection to Stein variational gradient descent for estimating the score gradient.

Result: The proposed method achieves lower gradient variance and benign bias in function space, resulting in more stable and efficient optimization. Empirically, it outperforms or matches existing SIVI methods.

Conclusion: The approach stabilizes SIVI training, addressing high-dimensional challenges efficiently, demonstrating potential for broader application in variational inference methods.

Abstract: Semi-implicit variational inference (SIVI) is a powerful framework for
approximating complex posterior distributions, but training with the
Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence can be challenging due to high variance and
bias in high-dimensional settings. While current state-of-the-art semi-implicit
variational inference methods, particularly Kernel Semi-Implicit Variational
Inference (KSIVI), have been shown to work in high dimensions, training remains
moderately expensive. In this work, we propose a kernelized KL divergence
estimator that stabilizes training through nonparametric smoothing. To further
reduce the bias, we introduce an importance sampling correction. We provide a
theoretical connection to the amortized version of the Stein variational
gradient descent, which estimates the score gradient via Stein's identity,
showing that both methods minimize the same objective, but our semi-implicit
approach achieves lower gradient variance. In addition, our method's bias in
function space is benign, leading to more stable and efficient optimization.
Empirical results demonstrate that our method outperforms or matches
state-of-the-art SIVI methods in both performance and training efficiency.

*Zhicheng Yang,Zhijiang Guo,Yinya Huang,Xiaodan Liang,Yiwei Wang,Jing Tang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel training method, TreeRPO, that enhances LLMs' reasoning capabilities by providing fine-grained reward signals during intermediate reasoning steps, showing significant performance improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current reinforcement learning methods for LLMs offer insufficient guidance for optimizing intermediate reasoning steps as rewards are defined at the full trajectory level.

Method: TreeRPO employs tree sampling to directly estimate step-level rewards without relying on a separate reward model and computes these rewards based on step-level groups formed during the sampling process.

Result: TreeRPO nearly doubles Qwen-2.5-Math's Pass@1 accuracy on test benchmarks (19.0% to 35.5%), outperforms GRPO by 2.9%, and reduces response length by 18.1%.

Conclusion: TreeRPO effectively enhances reasoning capabilities and efficiency in LLMs through dense and fine-grained reward signals for intermediate reasoning steps.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable reasoning capabilities
through Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) methods. However,
a key limitation of existing approaches is that rewards defined at the full
trajectory level provide insufficient guidance for optimizing the intermediate
steps of a reasoning process. To address this, we introduce \textbf{\name}, a
novel method that estimates the mathematical expectations of rewards at various
reasoning steps using tree sampling. Unlike prior methods that rely on a
separate step reward model, \name directly estimates these rewards through this
sampling process. Building on the group-relative reward training mechanism of
GRPO, \name innovatively computes rewards based on step-level groups generated
during tree sampling. This advancement allows \name to produce fine-grained and
dense reward signals, significantly enhancing the learning process and overall
performance of LLMs. Experimental results demonstrate that our \name algorithm
substantially improves the average Pass@1 accuracy of Qwen-2.5-Math on test
benchmarks, increasing it from 19.0\% to 35.5\%. Furthermore, \name
significantly outperforms GRPO by 2.9\% in performance while simultaneously
reducing the average response length by 18.1\%, showcasing its effectiveness
and efficiency. Our code will be available at

*Jifei Luo,Wenzheng Wu,Hantao Yao,Lu Yu,Changsheng Xu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Locality Preserving Markovian Transition (LPMT) framework to improve instance retrieval by addressing limitations in diffusion-based re-ranking methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current diffusion-based re-ranking methods lose discriminative power over long distances in affinity graphs, necessitating a better approach for manifold distance measurement.

Method: The authors propose LPMT, which integrates Bidirectional Collaborative Diffusion (BCD) for strong similarity relationships, followed by Locality State Embedding (LSE) for local consistency. The Thermodynamic Markovian Transition (TMT) then facilitates global retrieval.

Result: Experiments on diverse tasks validate the effectiveness of LPMT for instance retrieval, showing improved performance.

Conclusion: LPMT successfully enhances both local consistency and global efficiency in similarity propagation, making it effective for instance retrieval.

Abstract: Diffusion-based re-ranking methods are effective in modeling the data
manifolds through similarity propagation in affinity graphs. However, positive
signals tend to diminish over several steps away from the source, reducing
discriminative power beyond local regions. To address this issue, we introduce
the Locality Preserving Markovian Transition (LPMT) framework, which employs a
long-term thermodynamic transition process with multiple states for accurate
manifold distance measurement. The proposed LPMT first integrates diffusion
processes across separate graphs using Bidirectional Collaborative Diffusion
(BCD) to establish strong similarity relationships. Afterwards, Locality State
Embedding (LSE) encodes each instance into a distribution for enhanced local
consistency. These distributions are interconnected via the Thermodynamic
Markovian Transition (TMT) process, enabling efficient global retrieval while
maintaining local effectiveness. Experimental results across diverse tasks
confirm the effectiveness of LPMT for instance retrieval.

*Jingyu Hu,Hongbo Bo,Jun Hong,Xiaowei Liu,Weiru Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper addresses the degree bias issue in Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for node classification by proposing a novel Hardness Adaptive Reweighted (HAR) contrastive loss to enhance learning and mitigate performance discrepancies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to tackle the degree bias in GNNs, which leads to inconsistent prediction performance across nodes with varying degrees, and to improve upon existing Graph Contrastive Learning approaches that have limitations in providing sufficient and relevant information to low-degree nodes.

Method: The paper introduces the HAR contrastive loss, which increases positive pairs using node labels and adaptively weights both positive and negative pairs based on their learning difficulty. It also proposes the SHARP experimental framework to generalize the application of HAR.

Result: Theoretical analysis and experiments conducted across four datasets demonstrate SHARP's superior performance compared to baseline methods, addressing degree bias both globally and at individual degree levels.

Conclusion: The HAR loss, complemented by the SHARP framework, effectively mitigates degree bias in GNNs, enhancing prediction performance for nodes with varying degrees and showing potential for wide applicability.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) often suffer from degree bias in node
classification tasks, where prediction performance varies across nodes with
different degrees. Several approaches, which adopt Graph Contrastive Learning
(GCL), have been proposed to mitigate this bias. However, the limited number of
positive pairs and the equal weighting of all positives and negatives in GCL
still lead to low-degree nodes acquiring insufficient and noisy information.
This paper proposes the Hardness Adaptive Reweighted (HAR) contrastive loss to
mitigate degree bias. It adds more positive pairs by leveraging node labels and
adaptively weights positive and negative pairs based on their learning
hardness. In addition, we develop an experimental framework named SHARP to
extend HAR to a broader range of scenarios. Both our theoretical analysis and
experiments validate the effectiveness of SHARP. The experimental results
across four datasets show that SHARP achieves better performance against
baselines at both global and degree levels.

*Zhan Yu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a decentralized robust kernel-based learning algorithm in RKHS with networked systems represented as graphs, achieving robust regression through a unified learning framework and offering detailed convergence analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing distributed robust kernel learning methods rely on a divide-and-conquer approach, creating a need for unified frameworks that ensure robustness in decentralized settings.

Method: A robust loss function induced by windowing functions and a scaling parameter is utilized in RKHS, combined with a decentralized algorithm using connected graph structures and kernel-based integral operator techniques.

Result: The decentralized algorithm achieves robust estimation with high confidence bounds in RKHS norm, generalization error, and mean square distance, while offering optimal learning rates under specific conditions.

Conclusion: The paper establishes a strong connection between decentralization, sample selection, algorithm robustness, and convergence, demonstrating the effectiveness of the scaling parameter in achieving favorable learning outcomes.

Abstract: We propose a new decentralized robust kernel-based learning algorithm within
the framework of reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) by utilizing a
networked system that can be represented as a connected graph. The robust loss
function $\mathcal{L}_\sigma$ induced by a windowing function $W$ and a
robustness scaling parameter $\sigma>0$, can encompass a broad spectrum of
robust losses. Consequently, the proposed algorithm effectively provides a
unified decentralized learning framework for robust regression, which
fundamentally differs from the existing distributed robust kernel learning
schemes, all of which are divide-and-conquer based. We rigorously establish the
learning theory and offer a comprehensive convergence analysis for the
algorithm. We show each local robust estimator generated from the decentralized
algorithm can be utilized to approximate the regression function. Based on
kernel-based integral operator techniques, we derive general high confidence
convergence bounds for each local approximating sequence in terms of the mean
square distance, RKHS norm, and generalization error, respectively. Moreover,
we provide rigorous selection rules for local sample size and show that, under
properly selected step size and scaling parameter $\sigma$, the decentralized
robust algorithm can achieve optimal learning rates (up to logarithmic factors)
in both norms. The parameter $\sigma$ is shown to be essential for enhancing
robustness while also ensuring favorable convergence behavior. The intrinsic
connection among decentralization, sample selection, robustness of the
algorithm, and its convergence is clearly reflected.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper presents a unified framework for Shapley value estimators, providing theoretical guarantees for KernelSHAP and other methods, and shows strong empirical performance and scalability to high-dimensional datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Shapley values are vital for interpreting machine learning models, but their calculation is computationally expensive. KernelSHAP's lack of theoretical guarantees has remained a challenge, motivating this study.

Method: The authors propose a unified framework encompassing KernelSHAP and related estimators, using various sampling strategies. They provide theoretical guarantees for accuracy and validate their approach empirically.

Result: The methods achieve low mean squared error compared to exact Shapley values on small and medium datasets and outperform the KernelSHAP library in high-dimensional datasets like MNIST and CIFAR10.

Conclusion: The study provides the first theoretical guarantees for KernelSHAP, demonstrates its accuracy and scalability, and improves its implementation for high-dimensional datasets, making it a reliable tool for interpretability.

Abstract: Shapley values have emerged as a critical tool for explaining which features
impact the decisions made by machine learning models. However, computing exact
Shapley values is difficult, generally requiring an exponential (in the feature
dimension) number of model evaluations. To address this, many model-agnostic
randomized estimators have been developed, the most influential and widely used
being the KernelSHAP method (Lundberg & Lee, 2017). While related estimators
such as unbiased KernelSHAP (Covert & Lee, 2021) and LeverageSHAP (Musco &
Witter, 2025) are known to satisfy theoretical guarantees, bounds for
KernelSHAP have remained elusive. We describe a broad and unified framework
that encompasses KernelSHAP and related estimators constructed using both with
and without replacement sampling strategies. We then prove strong
non-asymptotic theoretical guarantees that apply to all estimators from our
framework. This provides, to the best of our knowledge, the first theoretical
guarantees for KernelSHAP and sheds further light on tradeoffs between existing
estimators. Through comprehensive benchmarking on small and medium dimensional
datasets for Decision-Tree models, we validate our approach against exact
Shapley values, consistently achieving low mean squared error with modest
sample sizes. Furthermore, we make specific implementation improvements to
enable scalability of our methods to high-dimensional datasets. Our methods,
tested on datasets such MNIST and CIFAR10, provide consistently better results
compared to the KernelSHAP library.

*Danil Sivtsov,Ivan Rodkin,Gleb Kuzmin,Yuri Kuratov,Ivan Oseledets*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Diagonal Batching, a technique that enhances the efficiency of Recurrent Memory Transformers (RMTs) by enabling parallelism and achieving significant speedup.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the limitations of transformer models for long-context inference, specifically their computational inefficiency and memory constraints, while addressing the sequential bottleneck of RMTs.

Method: The authors propose a scheduling scheme called Diagonal Batching, which allows parallelism across segments in RMTs without retraining or modifying the model's architecture.

Result: Diagonal Batching achieves a 3.3x speedup compared to LLaMA-1B with full attention and a 1.8x speedup compared to the sequential RMT implementation.

Conclusion: Diagonal Batching enhances RMTs as a viable solution for long-context applications by eliminating sequential computation bottlenecks and improving overall performance.

Abstract: Transformer models struggle with long-context inference due to their
quadratic time and linear memory complexity. Recurrent Memory Transformers
(RMTs) offer a solution by reducing the asymptotic cost to linear time and
constant memory usage. However, their memory update mechanism leads to
sequential execution, causing a performance bottleneck.
  We introduce Diagonal Batching, a scheduling scheme that unlocks parallelism
across segments in RMTs while preserving exact recurrence. This approach
eliminates the sequential constraint, enabling efficient GPU inference even for
single long-context inputs without complex batching and pipelining techniques.
Because the technique is purely a run-time computation reordering, existing RMT
models adopt it with no retraining.
  Applied to a LLaMA-1B ARMT model, Diagonal Batching yields a 3.3x speedup
over standard full-attention LLaMA-1B and a 1.8x speedup over the sequential
RMT implementation on 131,072-token sequences. By removing sequential
bottleneck, Diagonal Batching reduces inference cost and latency, thereby
strengthening RMTs as a practical solution for real-world, long-context
applications.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores a novel recurrent neural network (RNN) architecture for sequence modeling, improving language modeling and context understanding while incurring additional inference compute costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Recent causal transformer models used for sequence modeling require increasingly high memory and compute resources, which motivates the exploration of alternative architectures such as efficient RNNs.

Method: The authors propose a novel, stable RNN based on the Mesa layer that uses a fast conjugate gradient solver to minimize in-context loss optimally at each time step. This approach is studied at a billion-parameter scale for language modeling.

Result: The proposed RNN achieves lower perplexity and outperforms previous RNNs in downstream tasks requiring long context comprehension, though at the expense of higher compute during inference.

Conclusion: The new RNN demonstrates the trade-off between increased test-time compute and improved performance, aligning with trends of leveraging higher inference costs for enhanced model accuracy.

Abstract: Sequence modeling is currently dominated by causal transformer architectures
that use softmax self-attention. Although widely adopted, transformers require
scaling memory and compute linearly during inference. A recent stream of work
linearized the softmax operation, resulting in powerful recurrent neural
network (RNN) models with constant memory and compute costs such as DeltaNet,
Mamba or xLSTM. These models can be unified by noting that their recurrent
layer dynamics can all be derived from an in-context regression objective,
approximately optimized through an online learning rule. Here, we join this
line of work and introduce a numerically stable, chunkwise parallelizable
version of the recently proposed Mesa layer (von Oswald et al., 2024), and
study it in language modeling at the billion-parameter scale. This layer again
stems from an in-context loss, but which is now minimized to optimality at
every time point using a fast conjugate gradient solver. Through an extensive
suite of experiments, we show that optimal test-time training enables reaching
lower language modeling perplexity and higher downstream benchmark performance
than previous RNNs, especially on tasks requiring long context understanding.
This performance gain comes at the cost of additional flops spent during
inference time. Our results are therefore intriguingly related to recent trends
of increasing test-time compute to improve performance -- here by spending
compute to solve sequential optimization problems within the neural network
itself.

TL;DR: Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) are assessed for interpretability on MNIST and improved using a multi-iteration method to extract correlated features.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SAEs are valuable tools for extracting sparse and interpretable features, but their limitations in handling correlated features in hierarchical structures need addressing.

Method: The paper introduces multi-iteration SAE by unrolling Matching Pursuit (MP-SAE), a residual-guided approach that allows progressive feature extraction and ensures monotonic reconstruction improvement.

Result: The multi-iteration MP-SAE is capable of extracting correlated features in hierarchical contexts such as digits, overcoming the quasi-orthogonality limitation of shallow architectures.

Conclusion: By enhancing SAEs through multi-iteration strategies, more nuanced and correlated features can be captured with improved reconstruction in settings like MNIST.

Abstract: Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) have recently become central tools for
interpretability, leveraging dictionary learning principles to extract sparse,
interpretable features from neural representations whose underlying structure
is typically unknown. This paper evaluates SAEs in a controlled setting using
MNIST, which reveals that current shallow architectures implicitly rely on a
quasi-orthogonality assumption that limits the ability to extract correlated
features. To move beyond this, we introduce a multi-iteration SAE by unrolling
Matching Pursuit (MP-SAE), enabling the residual-guided extraction of
correlated features that arise in hierarchical settings such as handwritten
digit generation while guaranteeing monotonic improvement of the reconstruction
as more atoms are selected.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a method to align learnable latent spaces with target distributions by using flow-based generative models as priors, avoiding computationally expensive processes and confirmed by experiments on ImageNet.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome computational inefficiencies in aligning latent spaces with target distributions while maintaining theoretical rigor and practical effectiveness.

Method: Pretraining a flow-based generative model on target features and using a new alignment loss to regulate latent spaces, avoiding likelihood evaluations and ODE solving.

Result: The alignment loss effectively approximates the negative log-likelihood of the target distribution, validated through controlled experiments and ImageNet-based tests.

Conclusion: The framework offers a computationally efficient and validated approach for latent space alignment with diverse applications, supported by theoretical proofs and empirical results.

Abstract: This paper presents a novel framework for aligning learnable latent spaces to
arbitrary target distributions by leveraging flow-based generative models as
priors. Our method first pretrains a flow model on the target features to
capture the underlying distribution. This fixed flow model subsequently
regularizes the latent space via an alignment loss, which reformulates the flow
matching objective to treat the latents as optimization targets. We formally
prove that minimizing this alignment loss establishes a computationally
tractable surrogate objective for maximizing a variational lower bound on the
log-likelihood of latents under the target distribution. Notably, the proposed
method eliminates computationally expensive likelihood evaluations and avoids
ODE solving during optimization. As a proof of concept, we demonstrate in a
controlled setting that the alignment loss landscape closely approximates the
negative log-likelihood of the target distribution. We further validate the
effectiveness of our approach through large-scale image generation experiments
on ImageNet with diverse target distributions, accompanied by detailed
discussions and ablation studies. With both theoretical and empirical
validation, our framework paves a new way for latent space alignment.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper theoretically analyzes Transformer training dynamics, focusing on the role of residual connections in enhancing convergence stability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Despite the widespread success of Transformers, their training dynamics remain poorly understood, particularly the interaction between self-attention, feedforward networks, and residual connections.

Method: The authors analyze the convergence behavior of a structurally complete single-layer Transformer and extend the findings to multi-layer architectures. They identify how initialization and residual connections affect gradient descent's convergence rate.

Result: The study shows that the convergence rate is linear and determined by the singular values of the attention layer’s output. Residual connections help mitigate ill-conditioning caused by the softmax operation, enhancing stability.

Conclusion: Residual connections are key to addressing the optimization challenges in Transformers, improving their theoretical understanding and providing guidance for better training practices.

Abstract: Transformer models have emerged as fundamental tools across various
scientific and engineering disciplines, owing to their outstanding performance
in diverse applications. Despite this empirical success, the theoretical
foundations of Transformers remain relatively underdeveloped, particularly in
understanding their training dynamics. Existing research predominantly examines
isolated components--such as self-attention mechanisms and feedforward
networks--without thoroughly investigating the interdependencies between these
components, especially when residual connections are present. In this paper, we
aim to bridge this gap by analyzing the convergence behavior of a structurally
complete yet single-layer Transformer, comprising self-attention, a feedforward
network, and residual connections. We demonstrate that, under appropriate
initialization, gradient descent exhibits a linear convergence rate, where the
convergence speed is determined by the minimum and maximum singular values of
the output matrix from the attention layer. Moreover, our analysis reveals that
residual connections serve to ameliorate the ill-conditioning of this output
matrix, an issue stemming from the low-rank structure imposed by the softmax
operation, thereby promoting enhanced optimization stability. We also extend
our theoretical findings to a multi-layer Transformer architecture, confirming
the linear convergence rate of gradient descent under suitable initialization.
Empirical results corroborate our theoretical insights, illustrating the
beneficial role of residual connections in promoting convergence stability.

TL;DR: This paper explores the concept of strategic classification where individuals improve genuinely to meet desirable classifier outcomes. It provides new characterizations and results for learnability using specific models and resolves open queries from prior work.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To better understand and formalize scenarios where agents genuinely improve their traits to achieve favorable classifier outcomes, as opposed to deceptive behavior, enabling more effective and fair machine learning models.

Method: The authors introduce asymmetric variants of concept classes, analyze Euclidean ball improvement regions, and study proper/improper learning under generative data assumptions, bounded noise models, and in online learning conditions.

Result: The paper characterizes learning with improvements, demonstrates lower generalization error, and provides mistake bounds in various learning settings. Additionally, it resolves unresolved questions from prior research with clarified results under specific models and constraints.

Conclusion: Genuine agent improvement can lead to better generalization and learnability properties in strategic classification. The paper contributes new theoretical insights, tools, and models to enhance learning's robustness in realistic scenarios.

Abstract: Machine learning is now ubiquitous in societal decision-making, for example
in evaluating job candidates or loan applications, and it is increasingly
important to take into account how classified agents will react to the learning
algorithms. The majority of recent literature on strategic classification has
focused on reducing and countering deceptive behaviors by the classified
agents, but recent work of Attias et al. identifies surprising properties of
learnability when the agents genuinely improve in order to attain the desirable
classification, such as smaller generalization error than standard
PAC-learning. In this paper we characterize so-called learnability with
improvements across multiple new axes. We introduce an asymmetric variant of
minimally consistent concept classes and use it to provide an exact
characterization of proper learning with improvements in the realizable
setting. While prior work studies learnability only under general, arbitrary
agent improvement regions, we give positive results for more natural Euclidean
ball improvement sets. In particular, we characterize improper learning under a
mild generative assumption on the data distribution. We further show how to
learn in more challenging settings, achieving lower generalization error under
well-studied bounded noise models and obtaining mistake bounds in realizable
and agnostic online learning. We resolve open questions posed by Attias et al.
for both proper and improper learning.

*Guillaume Pourcel,Maxence Ernoult*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Recurrent Hamiltonian Echo Learning (RHEL), an efficient and physically grounded algorithm for training scalable state-space models for sequence modeling tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a physics-grounded learning algorithm that leverages the principles of Hamiltonian systems for efficient gradient computation in deep state-space models.

Method: The authors propose RHEL, which calculates loss gradients using finite differences of trajectories in Hamiltonian systems, avoiding explicit Jacobian computations or gradient variance. They also introduce Hamiltonian Recurrent Units (HRUs) and extend RHEL to discrete-time as an efficient alternative to Backpropagation Through Time (BPTT).

Result: RHEL matches the performance of BPTT across a range of tasks involving both linear and nonlinear dynamics on sequences as long as ~50k steps, demonstrating its scalability and effectiveness.

Conclusion: RHEL facilitates the design of scalable and energy-efficient learning systems for sequence modeling, providing a practical alternative to traditional gradient computation methods like BPTT.

Abstract: Deep State Space Models (SSMs) reignite physics-grounded compute paradigms,
as RNNs could natively be embodied into dynamical systems. This calls for
dedicated learning algorithms obeying to core physical principles, with
efficient techniques to simulate these systems and guide their design. We
propose Recurrent Hamiltonian Echo Learning (RHEL), an algorithm which provably
computes loss gradients as finite differences of physical trajectories of
non-dissipative, Hamiltonian systems. In ML terms, RHEL only requires three
"forward passes" irrespective of model size, without explicit Jacobian
computation, nor incurring any variance in the gradient estimation. Motivated
by the physical realization of our algorithm, we first introduce RHEL in
continuous time and demonstrate its formal equivalence with the continuous
adjoint state method. To facilitate the simulation of Hamiltonian systems
trained by RHEL, we propose a discrete-time version of RHEL which is equivalent
to Backpropagation Through Time (BPTT) when applied to a class of recurrent
modules which we call Hamiltonian Recurrent Units (HRUs). This setting allows
us to demonstrate the scalability of RHEL by generalizing these results to
hierarchies of HRUs, which we call Hamiltonian SSMs (HSSMs). We apply RHEL to
train HSSMs with linear and nonlinear dynamics on a variety of time-series
tasks ranging from mid-range to long-range classification and regression with
sequence length reaching $\sim 50k$. We show that RHEL consistently matches the
performance of BPTT across all models and tasks. This work opens new doors for
the design of scalable, energy-efficient physical systems endowed with
self-learning capabilities for sequence modelling.

*Hao Yu,Chu Xin Cheng,Runlong Yu,Yuyang Ye,Shiwei Tong,Zhaofeng Liu,Defu Lian*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces CocktailEdit, a framework for flexible control in edited time series by combining point-wise and segment-level constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Time series generation methods struggle to provide precise control over point-level and segment-level properties in generated sequences.

Method: CocktailEdit employs confidence-weighted anchor control for point-wise constraints and classifier-based control for segment-level statistical properties, integrated into diffusion-based time series models.

Result: Extensive experiments show that the method achieves accurate local control and maintains temporal coherence across diverse datasets and models.

Conclusion: CocktailEdit bridges the gap between generative modeling and real-world time series editing, providing a practical and flexible framework for human-in-the-loop use cases.

Abstract: Recent advances in time series generation have shown promise, yet controlling
properties in generated sequences remains challenging. Time Series Editing
(TSE) - making precise modifications while preserving temporal coherence -
consider both point-level constraints and segment-level controls that current
methods struggle to provide. We introduce the CocktailEdit framework to enable
simultaneous, flexible control across different types of constraints. This
framework combines two key mechanisms: a confidence-weighted anchor control for
point-wise constraints and a classifier-based control for managing statistical
properties such as sums and averages over segments. Our methods achieve precise
local control during the denoising inference stage while maintaining temporal
coherence and integrating seamlessly, with any conditionally trained
diffusion-based time series models. Extensive experiments across diverse
datasets and models demonstrate its effectiveness. Our work bridges the gap
between pure generative modeling and real-world time series editing needs,
offering a flexible solution for human-in-the-loop time series generation and
editing. The code and demo are provided for validation.

*Haifeng Sun,Yu Xiong,Runze Wu,Xinyu Cai,Changjie Fan,Lan Zhang,Xiang-Yang Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Fast-DataShapley, a method for efficiently calculating Shapley values by training a reusable model, avoiding retraining and reducing computation costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the computational inefficiency of existing Shapley value-based methods that require retraining for each test sample, making their application impractical in AI.

Method: The authors propose Fast-DataShapley, a one-pass training method that uses weighted least squares to train a reusable explainer model and additionally provide three methods to reduce computation: approximate utility function calculation and group data calculation.

Result: The method demonstrated superior performance and efficiency on image datasets, boosting performance by over 2.5 times and speeding up training by two orders of magnitude compared to existing baselines.

Conclusion: Fast-DataShapley offers a computationally efficient alternative for calculating Shapley values, making it practical for real-world AI applications while protecting the value of training data.

Abstract: The value and copyright of training data are crucial in the artificial
intelligence industry. Service platforms should protect data providers'
legitimate rights and fairly reward them for their contributions. Shapley
value, a potent tool for evaluating contributions, outperforms other methods in
theory, but its computational overhead escalates exponentially with the number
of data providers. Recent works based on Shapley values attempt to mitigate
computation complexity by approximation algorithms. However, they need to
retrain for each test sample, leading to intolerable costs. We propose
Fast-DataShapley, a one-pass training method that leverages the weighted least
squares characterization of the Shapley value to train a reusable explainer
model with real-time reasoning speed. Given new test samples, no retraining is
required to calculate the Shapley values of the training data. Additionally, we
propose three methods with theoretical guarantees to reduce training overhead
from two aspects: the approximate calculation of the utility function and the
group calculation of the training data. We analyze time complexity to show the
efficiency of our methods. The experimental evaluations on various image
datasets demonstrate superior performance and efficiency compared to baselines.
Specifically, the performance is improved to more than 2.5 times, and the
explainer's training speed can be increased by two orders of magnitude.

*Declan A. Norton,Yuanzhao Zhang,Michelle Girvan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper demonstrates that reservoir computing (RC) can generalize to unexplored dynamics without structural priors using a multiple-trajectory training scheme.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study addresses the challenge in machine learning where models fail to generalize to poorly represented dynamics without explicit structural assumptions.

Method: The paper proposes a novel multiple-trajectory training scheme for reservoir computers (RCs) to train on disjoint time series and assess its capacity for out-of-domain generalization.

Result: Reservoir computers trained on data from a single basin of attraction successfully generalized to model behavior in unobserved basins of multistable dynamical systems.

Conclusion: Reservoir computing, even without structural priors, can achieve effective generalization in dynamical systems when trained using the proposed trajectory-based method.

Abstract: Machine learning techniques offer an effective approach to modeling dynamical
systems solely from observed data. However, without explicit structural priors
-- built-in assumptions about the underlying dynamics -- these techniques
typically struggle to generalize to aspects of the dynamics that are poorly
represented in the training data. Here, we demonstrate that reservoir computing
-- a simple, efficient, and versatile machine learning framework often used for
data-driven modeling of dynamical systems -- can generalize to unexplored
regions of state space without explicit structural priors. First, we describe a
multiple-trajectory training scheme for reservoir computers that supports
training across a collection of disjoint time series, enabling effective use of
available training data. Then, applying this training scheme to multistable
dynamical systems, we show that RCs trained on trajectories from a single basin
of attraction can achieve out-of-domain generalization by capturing system
behavior in entirely unobserved basins.

*Arnav Kumar Jain,Vibhakar Mohta,Subin Kim,Atiksh Bhardwaj,Juntao Ren,Yunhai Feng,Sanjiban Choudhury,Gokul Swamy*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper presents SAILOR, a framework bridging limitations of Behavioral Cloning (BC) by enabling recovery behavior through learning world and reward models for superior generalization and performance across manipulation tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Behavioral Cloning struggles when agents encounter states outside of expert demonstrations, leading to failures in recovery. The paper aims to overcome this limitation by teaching agents to generalize and recover independently in unseen situations.

Method: The paper proposes the SAILOR framework, which incorporates learning a world model and a reward model from expert demonstrations. It ablates various algorithmic design decisions for stability and efficiency in learning recovery behavior during imitation tasks.

Result: SAILOR outperforms state-of-the-art Diffusion Policies trained via BC across multiple benchmarks. It identifies nuanced failures, is robust to reward hacking, and remains superior even when BC is provided 5-10 times more demonstration data.

Conclusion: The proposed approach significantly improves performance in imitation learning by addressing BC’s limitation of handling unseen states, indicating its potential for broader and more robust task generalization.

Abstract: The fundamental limitation of the behavioral cloning (BC) approach to
imitation learning is that it only teaches an agent what the expert did at
states the expert visited. This means that when a BC agent makes a mistake
which takes them out of the support of the demonstrations, they often don't
know how to recover from it. In this sense, BC is akin to giving the agent the
fish -- giving them dense supervision across a narrow set of states -- rather
than teaching them to fish: to be able to reason independently about achieving
the expert's outcome even when faced with unseen situations at test-time. In
response, we explore learning to search (L2S) from expert demonstrations, i.e.
learning the components required to, at test time, plan to match expert
outcomes, even after making a mistake. These include (1) a world model and (2)
a reward model. We carefully ablate the set of algorithmic and design decisions
required to combine these and other components for stable and
sample/interaction-efficient learning of recovery behavior without additional
human corrections. Across a dozen visual manipulation tasks from three
benchmarks, our approach $\texttt{SAILOR}$ consistently out-performs
state-of-the-art Diffusion Policies trained via BC on the same data.
Furthermore, scaling up the amount of demonstrations used for BC by
5-10$\times$ still leaves a performance gap. We find that $\texttt{SAILOR}$ can
identify nuanced failures and is robust to reward hacking. Our code is
available at https://github.com/arnavkj1995/SAILOR .

*Nirav Koley,Prajwal Singhania,Abhinav Bhatele*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes SiftAttention, an approximate attention method improving efficiency on GPUs by replacing expensive top-k operations with dynamic threshold-based filtering, reducing memory overhead and preserving performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address memory bandwidth limitations on GPUs during attention computations, particularly due to expensive top-k operations in existing approximate attention methods.

Method: Introduced SiftAttention, which dynamically estimates a threshold value based on a power-law distribution observation, and filters attention scores above this threshold rather than performing top-k operations.

Result: SiftAttention reduces memory bandwidth usage during attention computations while preserving the quality of large language model inference better than previous methods.

Conclusion: The proposed method offers an efficient solution for GPU-based inference, leveraging dynamic filtering to resolve memory and computational bottlenecks in attention mechanisms.

Abstract: Efficient inference on GPUs using large language models remains challenging
due to memory bandwidth limitations, particularly during data transfers between
High Bandwidth Memory (HBM) and SRAM in attention computations. Approximate
attention methods address this issue by reducing computational and memory
overhead but often rely on expensive top-$k$ operations, which perform poorly
on GPUs. We propose SiftAttention, a novel approximate attention method that
replaces the top-$k$ step with a computationally efficient element-wise
filtering operation based on a threshold value. Our intuition for doing this is
based on our empirical observation that the $\tau$-th quantile of attention
scores follows a predictable power-law over sequential generation steps.
Exploiting this insight, our approach dynamically estimates a threshold value
per prompt at each generation step. Only attention scores above this threshold
and their corresponding value vectors are loaded/used to compute the attention
output, reducing data movement between HBM and SRAM. Our evaluation
demonstrates that SiftAttention preserves model quality better than existing
approximate attention methods while reducing memory bandwidth usage when
loading value vectors.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel framework for learning normalized energy (log probability) models inspired by diffusion generative models, achieving competitive results on the ImageNet64 dataset while highlighting unique properties of the learned distributions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Overcoming the curse of dimensionality in learning probability models from data, which is crucial for many machine learning applications, but challenging.

Method: A score network is modified to compute energy, using gradients to estimate scores of the density. A dual score matching objective ensures normalized energies across noise levels, optimized with a denoising objective and a secondary objective.

Result: Achieved comparable cross-entropy (negative log likelihood) results to state-of-the-art methods on ImageNet64 and demonstrated strong generalization of the energy model.

Conclusion: The approach offers a robust framework for learning probability models, showcasing independence from training data specifics and revealing new insights into image probability and local neighborhood dimensionality.

Abstract: Learning probability models from data is at the heart of many machine
learning endeavors, but is notoriously difficult due to the curse of
dimensionality. We introduce a new framework for learning \emph{normalized}
energy (log probability) models that is inspired from diffusion generative
models, which rely on networks optimized to estimate the score. We modify a
score network architecture to compute an energy while preserving its inductive
biases. The gradient of this energy network with respect to its input image is
the score of the learned density, which can be optimized using a denoising
objective. Importantly, the gradient with respect to the noise level provides
an additional score that can be optimized with a novel secondary objective,
ensuring consistent and normalized energies across noise levels. We train an
energy network with this \emph{dual} score matching objective on the ImageNet64
dataset, and obtain a cross-entropy (negative log likelihood) value comparable
to the state of the art. We further validate our approach by showing that our
energy model \emph{strongly generalizes}: estimated log probabilities are
nearly independent of the specific images in the training set. Finally, we
demonstrate that both image probability and dimensionality of local
neighborhoods vary significantly with image content, in contrast with
traditional assumptions such as concentration of measure or support on a
low-dimensional manifold.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces techniques to improve data efficiency in RL fine-tuning of LLMs by focusing on adaptive difficulty and rollout replay.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reinforcement learning for large language models is resource-intensive, and there is a need to improve its data efficiency during fine-tuning.

Method: The paper employs adaptive difficulty for targeted data selection and rollout replay to reuse rollouts, reducing computation and improving efficiency.

Result: Experiments demonstrate a reduction in RL fine-tuning time by 25% to 65% without compromising performance.

Conclusion: The proposed methods enhance data efficiency in RL fine-tuning of LLMs, making the process faster while maintaining effectiveness.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has become an effective approach for fine-tuning
large language models (LLMs), particularly to enhance their reasoning
capabilities. However, RL fine-tuning remains highly resource-intensive, and
existing work has largely overlooked the problem of data efficiency. In this
paper, we propose two techniques to improve data efficiency in LLM RL
fine-tuning: difficulty-targeted online data selection and rollout replay. We
introduce the notion of adaptive difficulty to guide online data selection,
prioritizing questions of moderate difficulty that are more likely to yield
informative learning signals. To estimate adaptive difficulty efficiently, we
develop an attention-based framework that requires rollouts for only a small
reference set of questions. The adaptive difficulty of the remaining questions
is then estimated based on their similarity to this set. To further reduce
rollout cost, we introduce a rollout replay mechanism that reuses recent
rollouts, lowering per-step computation while maintaining stable updates.
Extensive experiments across 6 LLM-dataset combinations show that our method
reduces RL fine-tuning time by 25% to 65% to reach the same level of
performance as the original GRPO algorithm.

TL;DR: This paper introduces LSM-2, a large sensor model with Adaptive and Inherited Masking (AIM), enabling self-supervised learning from incomplete wearable sensor data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Wearable sensor data often has significant missingness, which challenges self-supervised machine learning models requiring complete data.

Method: The AIM technique uses learnable mask tokens to handle inherited and artificially introduced missingness without explicit imputation.

Result: LSM-2 with AIM, trained on 40M hours of sensor data, outperforms multiple benchmarks in diverse tasks like classification, regression, and generative modeling.

Conclusion: LSM-2 with AIM demonstrates robust performance even with missing data, making it suitable for real-world clinical applications like nighttime hypertension prediction.

Abstract: Foundation models, a cornerstone of recent advancements in machine learning,
have predominantly thrived on complete and well-structured data. Wearable
sensor data frequently suffers from significant missingness, posing a
substantial challenge for self-supervised learning (SSL) models that typically
assume complete data inputs. This paper introduces the second generation of
Large Sensor Model (LSM-2) with Adaptive and Inherited Masking (AIM), a novel
SSL approach that learns robust representations directly from incomplete data
without requiring explicit imputation. AIM's core novelty lies in its use of
learnable mask tokens to model both existing ("inherited") and artificially
introduced missingness, enabling it to robustly handle fragmented real-world
data during inference. Pre-trained on an extensive dataset of 40M hours of
day-long multimodal sensor data, our LSM-2 with AIM achieves the best
performance across a diverse range of tasks, including classification,
regression and generative modeling. Furthermore, LSM-2 with AIM exhibits
superior scaling performance, and critically, maintains high performance even
under targeted missingness scenarios, reflecting clinically coherent patterns,
such as the diagnostic value of nighttime biosignals for hypertension
prediction. This makes AIM a more reliable choice for real-world wearable data
applications.

TL;DR: The paper proposes an AI-based framework to solve the challenging problem of extracting single-scatterer QPI kernels from complex multi-scatterer images.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Quasiparticle interference (QPI) imaging faces a fundamental challenge in extracting single-scatterer patterns due to the ill-posed nature of this inverse problem.

Method: The authors employ a two-step training strategy: 1) learning compact kernel representations using a variational autoencoder, and 2) aligning QPI observations with learned kernel latents through a dedicated encoder.

Result: The proposed framework demonstrated significantly higher accuracy and better generalization compared to baseline methods in extracting QPI kernels.

Conclusion: AI-based approaches can robustly solve complex quantum material imaging problems, offering reliable extraction of scattering kernels and advancing the analysis of electronic structures.

Abstract: Quasiparticle interference (QPI) imaging is a powerful tool for probing
electronic structures in quantum materials, but extracting the single-scatterer
QPI pattern (i.e., the kernel) from a multi-scatterer image remains a
fundamentally ill-posed inverse problem. In this work, we propose the first
AI-based framework for QPI kernel extraction. We introduce a two-step learning
strategy that decouples kernel representation learning from
observation-to-kernel inference. In the first step, we train a variational
autoencoder to learn a compact latent space of scattering kernels. In the
second step, we align the latent representation of QPI observations with those
of the pre-learned kernels using a dedicated encoder. This design enables the
model to infer kernels robustly even under complex, entangled scattering
conditions. We construct a diverse and physically realistic QPI dataset
comprising 100 unique kernels and evaluate our method against a direct one-step
baseline. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves
significantly higher extraction accuracy, and improved generalization to unseen
kernels.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a new test-time scaling perspective considering both computation and memory access costs, proposing a kinetic scaling law and a sparse attention model for better efficiency and accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address overlooked memory access bottlenecks in test-time inference strategies and improve model effectiveness by rethinking traditional compute-optimal scaling laws.

Method: The authors conducted a holistic analysis of models ranging from 0.6B to 32B parameters, introducing the Kinetics Scaling Law and a sparse attention paradigm to optimize test-time compute efficiency.

Result: Sparse attention models outperform dense ones, showing over 60 points improvement in low-cost regimes and over 5 points gains in high-cost regimes on AIME evaluations.

Conclusion: Sparse attention is vital for realizing the full potential of test-time scaling, as it reduces costs and enables larger generations, unlike parameter scaling which saturates during training.

Abstract: We rethink test-time scaling laws from a practical efficiency perspective,
revealing that the effectiveness of smaller models is significantly
overestimated. Prior work, grounded in compute-optimality, overlooks critical
memory access bottlenecks introduced by inference-time strategies (e.g.,
Best-of-$N$, long CoTs). Our holistic analysis, spanning models from 0.6B to
32B parameters, reveals a new Kinetics Scaling Law that better guides resource
allocation by incorporating both computation and memory access costs. Kinetics
Scaling Law suggests that test-time compute is more effective when used on
models above a threshold than smaller ones. A key reason is that in TTS,
attention, rather than parameter count, emerges as the dominant cost factor.
Motivated by this, we propose a new scaling paradigm centered on sparse
attention, which lowers per-token cost and enables longer generations and more
parallel samples within the same resource budget. Empirically, we show that
sparse attention models consistently outperform dense counterparts, achieving
over 60 points gains in low-cost regimes and over 5 points gains in high-cost
regimes for problem-solving accuracy on AIME, encompassing evaluations on
state-of-the-art MoEs. These results suggest that sparse attention is essential
for realizing the full potential of test-time scaling because, unlike training,
where parameter scaling saturates, test-time accuracy continues to improve
through increased generation. The code is available at

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces 'grafting,' a method to modify pretrained diffusion transformers for new architecture designs under minimal compute requirements, achieving high-quality results with low costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Designing model architectures requires significant computational resources for pretraining, limiting the exploration of potential designs. The authors aim to simplify this process by enabling the use of pretrained models to test new architectural concepts.

Method: The grafting method involves modifying pretrained diffusion transformer architectures by replacing operators (e.g., attention mechanisms) or restructuring their configuration. These changes are implemented to test new designs without extensive computational costs.

Result: Grafting produces hybrid models that achieve competitive metrics, such as FID scores, with less than 2% of the pretraining compute. For text-to-image models, the method achieves a 1.43x speedup with minimal performance loss. Additionally, restructuring transformer depth via grafting leads to notable improvements compared to baseline models.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates that pretrained models can efficiently serve as starting points for exploring and optimizing new diffusion model designs, offering significant computational savings and design flexibility.

Abstract: Designing model architectures requires decisions such as selecting operators
(e.g., attention, convolution) and configurations (e.g., depth, width).
However, evaluating the impact of these decisions on model quality requires
costly pretraining, limiting architectural investigation. Inspired by how new
software is built on existing code, we ask: can new architecture designs be
studied using pretrained models? To this end, we present grafting, a simple
approach for editing pretrained diffusion transformers (DiTs) to materialize
new architectures under small compute budgets. Informed by our analysis of
activation behavior and attention locality, we construct a testbed based on the
DiT-XL/2 design to study the impact of grafting on model quality. Using this
testbed, we develop a family of hybrid designs via grafting: replacing softmax
attention with gated convolution, local attention, and linear attention, and
replacing MLPs with variable expansion ratio and convolutional variants.
Notably, many hybrid designs achieve good quality (FID: 2.38-2.64 vs. 2.27 for
DiT-XL/2) using <2% pretraining compute. We then graft a text-to-image model
(PixArt-Sigma), achieving a 1.43x speedup with less than a 2% drop in GenEval
score. Finally, we present a case study that restructures DiT-XL/2 by
converting every pair of sequential transformer blocks into parallel blocks via
grafting. This reduces model depth by 2x and yields better quality (FID: 2.77)
than other models of comparable depth. Together, we show that new diffusion
model designs can be explored by grafting pretrained DiTs, with edits ranging
from operator replacement to architecture restructuring. Code and grafted

*Adrian Łańcucki,Konrad Staniszewski,Piotr Nawrot,Edoardo M. Ponti*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a method called Dynamic Memory Sparsification (DMS) to compress the key-value (KV) cache in Transformer LLMs during inference, allowing for improved accuracy under the same computational constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to overcome the bottleneck in the generation cost of Transformer LLMs, which is limited by the size of the KV cache, and enable more efficient usage of computational resources for increased reasoning accuracy.

Method: The authors propose Dynamic Memory Sparsification (DMS), a novel technique for sparsifying KV caches. DMS requires only 1K training steps to achieve an 8× compression, delays token eviction, and merges representations to preserve critical information more effectively.

Result: The method demonstrates enhanced accuracy in multiple LLM families, with significant improvements such as a 9.1-point average boost on AIME 24, 7.6 on GPQA, and 9.6 on LiveCodeBench, all within comparable runtime and memory budgets.

Conclusion: Dynamic Memory Sparsification makes inference-time hyper-scaling feasible, enabling better reasoning accuracy in large language models without incurring additional computational costs.

Abstract: Inference-time scaling trades efficiency for increased reasoning accuracy by
generating longer or more parallel sequences. However, in Transformer LLMs,
generation cost is bottlenecked by the size of the key-value (KV) cache, rather
than the number of generated tokens. Hence, we explore inference-time
hyper-scaling: by compressing the KV cache, we can generate more tokens within
the same compute budget and further improve the accuracy of scaled inference.
The success of this approach, however, hinges on the ability of compression
methods to preserve accuracy even at high compression ratios. To make
hyper-scaling practical, we introduce Dynamic Memory Sparsification (DMS), a
novel method for sparsifying KV caches that only requires 1K training steps to
achieve 8$\times$ compression, while maintaining better accuracy than
training-free sparse attention. Instead of prematurely discarding cached
tokens, DMS delays token eviction, implicitly merging representations and
preserving critical information. We demonstrate the effectiveness of
inference-time hyper-scaling with DMS on multiple families of LLMs, showing
that it boosts accuracy for comparable inference runtime and memory load. For
instance, we enhance Qwen-R1 32B by an average of 9.1 points on AIME 24, 7.6 on
GPQA, and 9.6 on LiveCodeBench across compute budgets.

*Akira SaiToh,Arezoo Modiri,Amit Sawant,Robabeh Rahimi*

Main category: cs.NE

TL;DR: A quantum-inspired genetic algorithm was applied to optimize patient scheduling in proton therapy, showing advantages in population size but encountering longer run times for larger problems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Proton therapy involves intricate patient scheduling that benefits from optimization, where quantum-inspired algorithms may offer improved convergence and resource efficiency.

Method: The study used quantum-inspired genetic algorithms with quantum chromosomes, incorporating superposed data and focused selection and repair strategies to ensure feasible schedules.

Result: The approach demonstrated superior performance in terms of population size in both medium and large-scale scenarios but faced inefficiency in run time for large cases due to classical emulation limitations.

Conclusion: Quantum-inspired genetic algorithms show promise for scheduling optimization but require true quantum computing to address computational time inefficiencies for larger applications.

Abstract: Among the genetic algorithms generally used for optimization problems in the
recent decades, quantum-inspired variants are known for fast and high-fitness
convergence and small resource requirement. Here the application to the patient
scheduling problem in proton therapy is reported. Quantum chromosomes are
tailored to possess the superposed data of patient IDs and gantry statuses.
Selection and repair strategies are also elaborated for reliable convergence to
a clinically feasible schedule although the employed model is not complex.
Clear advantage in population size is shown over the classical counterpart in
our numerical results for both a medium-size test case and a large-size
practical problem instance. It is, however, observed that program run time is
rather long for the large-size practical case, which is due to the limitation
of classical emulation and demands the forthcoming true quantum computation.
Our results also revalidate the stability of the conventional classical genetic
algorithm.

*Hugo Alcaraz-Herrera,Michail-Antisthenis Tsompanas,Igor Balaz,Andrew Adamatzky*

Main category: cs.NE

TL;DR: The paper proposes an automated design method for soft actuator controllers using Neuroevolution techniques, showing NEAT's superiority in creating efficient and implementable synchronization profiles.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the lack of study in the design process for soft robotics’ morphology and controller strategies.

Method: It employs Neuroevolution techniques, specifically NEAT and HyperNEAT, and compares them with a baseline Standard Genetic Algorithm (SGA). Different actuator morphologies and activation function sets were tested.

Result: NEAT outperformed HyperNEAT and SGA, demonstrating robustness across different morphologies while producing simpler and more practical controllers.

Conclusion: Neuroevolution methods, especially NEAT, are effective for soft actuator controller design, making them advantageous for real-world implementation.

Abstract: Since soft robotics are composed of compliant materials, they perform better
than conventional rigid robotics in specific fields, such as medical
applications. However, the field of soft robotics is fairly new, and the design
process of their morphology and their controller strategies has not yet been
thoroughly studied. Consequently, here, an automated design method for the
controller of soft actuators based on Neuroevolution is proposed. Specifically,
the suggested techniques employ Neuroevolution of Augmenting Topologies (NEAT)
and Hypercube-based NEAT (HyperNEAT) to generate the synchronization profile of
the components of a simulated soft actuator by employing Compositional Pattern
Producing Networks (CPPNs). As a baseline methodology, a Standard Genetic
Algorithm (SGA) was used. Moreover, to test the robustness of the proposed
methodologies, both high- and low-performing morphologies of soft actuators
were utilized as testbeds. Moreover, the use of an affluent and a more limited
set of activation functions for the Neuroevolution targets was tested
throughout the experiments. The results support the hypothesis that
Neuroevolution based methodologies are more appropriate for designing
controllers that align with both types of morphologies. In specific, NEAT
performed better for all different scenarios tested and produced more
simplistic networks that are easier to implement in real life applications.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces RoboRefer, a 3D-aware vision-language model designed for precise spatial referring and reasoning tasks in robotics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge the gap in embodied robots' ability to understand complex 3D scenes and reason dynamically about locations specified in instructions, addressing limitations of existing vision-language models.

Method: RoboRefer incorporates a specialized depth encoder with supervised fine-tuning (SFT) for spatial understanding and reinforcement fine-tuning (RFT) with tailored process rewards for generalizing multi-step reasoning. Additionally, the large-scale RefSpatial dataset and RefSpatial-Bench benchmark are introduced.

Result: RoboRefer achieves a state-of-the-art success rate of 89.6% in spatial understanding using SFT and significantly outperforms baselines in the RefSpatial-Bench benchmark with RFT, including a 17.4% better accuracy than Gemini-2.5-Pro.

Conclusion: RoboRefer robustly handles multi-step spatial reasoning and integrates well with existing control policies, enabling robots to perform complex, long-horizon tasks in diverse and cluttered environments.

Abstract: Spatial referring is a fundamental capability of embodied robots to interact
with the 3D physical world. However, even with the powerful pretrained vision
language models (VLMs), recent approaches are still not qualified to accurately
understand the complex 3D scenes and dynamically reason about the
instruction-indicated locations for interaction. To this end, we propose
RoboRefer, a 3D-aware VLM that can first achieve precise spatial understanding
by integrating a disentangled but dedicated depth encoder via supervised
fine-tuning (SFT). Moreover, RoboRefer advances generalized multi-step spatial
reasoning via reinforcement fine-tuning (RFT), with metric-sensitive process
reward functions tailored for spatial referring tasks. To support SFT and RFT
training, we introduce RefSpatial, a large-scale dataset of 20M QA pairs (2x
prior), covering 31 spatial relations (vs. 15 prior) and supporting complex
reasoning processes (up to 5 steps). In addition, we introduce
RefSpatial-Bench, a challenging benchmark filling the gap in evaluating spatial
referring with multi-step reasoning. Experiments show that SFT-trained
RoboRefer achieves state-of-the-art spatial understanding, with an average
success rate of 89.6%. RFT-trained RoboRefer further outperforms all other
baselines by a large margin, even surpassing Gemini-2.5-Pro by 17.4% in average
accuracy on RefSpatial-Bench. Notably, RoboRefer can be integrated with various
control policies to execute long-horizon, dynamic tasks across diverse robots
(e,g., UR5, G1 humanoid) in cluttered real-world scenes.

localization and mapping, which can operate with a variety of visual-inertial
sensor suites, including multiple RGB and depth cameras, and inertial
measurement units. cuVSLAM supports operation with as few as one RGB camera to

*Zihao Dong,Alan Papalia,Leonard Jung,Alenna Spiro,Philip R. Osteen,Christa S. Robison,Michael Everett*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: SPARTA addresses the challenge of state-dependent terrain traversability by predicting traversability conditioned on vehicle approach angle using Fourier basis functions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The traversability of off-road terrain often depends on the approach angle, making learning such interactions computationally and data-intensive.

Method: SPARTA proposes a geometric structure in modeling by using Fourier basis functions to predict risk distributions for orientation-conditioned traversability.

Result: In simulations, SPARTA improved traversal success rates to 91% compared to 73% for baseline approaches. It also generalized effectively to real-world hardware experiments.

Conclusion: SPARTA provides an efficient and generalizable approach for off-road traversability prediction, leveraging smooth analytical functions to handle terrain and vehicle interactions effectively.

Abstract: A key open challenge in off-road autonomy is that the traversability of
terrain often depends on the vehicle's state. In particular, some obstacles are
only traversable from some orientations. However, learning this interaction by
encoding the angle of approach as a model input demands a large and diverse
training dataset and is computationally inefficient during planning due to
repeated model inference. To address these challenges, we present SPARTA, a
method for estimating approach angle conditioned traversability from point
clouds. Specifically, we impose geometric structure into our network by
outputting a smooth analytical function over the 1-Sphere that predicts risk
distribution for any angle of approach with minimal overhead and can be reused
for subsequent queries. The function is composed of Fourier basis functions,
which has important advantages for generalization due to their periodic nature
and smoothness. We demonstrate SPARTA both in a high-fidelity simulation
platform, where our model achieves a 91\% success rate crossing a 40m boulder
field (compared to 73\% for the baseline), and on hardware, illustrating the
generalization ability of the model to real-world settings.

Motivation: Autonomous robots need accurate dynamics modeling to navigate unpredictable and changing terrains, a challenge in unstructured remote environments.

Method: The approach utilizes function encoders with neural network basis functions that estimate robot dynamics through a simple least-squares calculation, requiring minimal online data and no retraining.

Result: In simulations, the adaptive model resulted in better controller performance, including fewer collisions in cluttered environments, compared to a neural ODE baseline.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively achieves rapid terrain adaptation and improves navigation safety and accuracy in challenging terrains.

Abstract: Autonomous mobile robots operating in remote, unstructured environments must
adapt to new, unpredictable terrains that can change rapidly during operation.
In such scenarios, a critical challenge becomes estimating the robot's dynamics
on changing terrain in order to enable reliable, accurate navigation and
planning. We present a novel online adaptation approach for terrain-aware
dynamics modeling and planning using function encoders. Our approach
efficiently adapts to new terrains at runtime using limited online data without
retraining or fine-tuning. By learning a set of neural network basis functions
that span the robot dynamics on diverse terrains, we enable rapid online
adaptation to new, unseen terrains and environments as a simple least-squares
calculation. We demonstrate our approach for terrain adaptation in a
Unity-based robotics simulator and show that the downstream controller has
better empirical performance due to higher accuracy of the learned model. This
leads to fewer collisions with obstacles while navigating in cluttered
environments as compared to a neural ODE baseline.

Result: Numerical experiments in Isaac Sim showed improved success rates in challenging navigation scenarios using the proposed methodology.

Conclusion: The approach demonstrates the effectiveness of 3D scene graphs in reinforcement learning for robot navigation, enhancing both performance and training efficiency.

Abstract: The 3D scene graph models spatial relationships between objects, enabling the
agent to efficiently navigate in a partially observable environment and predict
the location of the target object.This paper proposes an original framework
named SGN-CIRL (3D Scene Graph-Based Reinforcement Learning Navigation) for
mapless reinforcement learning-based robot navigation with learnable

Result: The study demonstrates the calibration method on a robotic arm, showing improved performance over uncalibrated olfactory navigation.

Conclusion: Calibrating OIO enables significant advancements in precise robot navigation by scent, paving the way for practical applications in sensitive domains like medical and security industries.

Abstract: Visual inertial odometry (VIO) is a process for fusing visual and kinematic
data to understand a machine's state in a navigation task. Olfactory inertial
odometry (OIO) is an analog to VIO that fuses signals from gas sensors with
inertial data to help a robot navigate by scent. Gas dynamics and environmental
factors introduce disturbances into olfactory navigation tasks that can make
OIO difficult to facilitate. With our work here, we define a process for
calibrating a robot for OIO that generalizes to several olfaction sensor types.
Our focus is specifically on calibrating OIO for centimeter-level accuracy in
localizing an odor source on a slow-moving robot platform to demonstrate use
cases in robotic surgery and touchless security screening. We demonstrate our
process for OIO calibration on a real robotic arm and show how this calibration
improves performance over a cold-start olfactory navigation task.

Conclusion: This advancement facilitates rapid electrochemical quantifications, with applications in sensor technology, analytical chemistry, and rapid olfactory analysis, potentially revolutionizing the field with faster data acquisition.

Abstract: Chronoamperometry (CA) is a fundamental electrochemical technique used for
quantifying redox-active species. However, in room-temperature ionic liquids
(RTILs), the high viscosity and slow mass transport often lead to extended
measurement durations. This paper presents a novel mathematical regression
approach that reduces CA measurement windows to under 1 second, significantly
faster than previously reported methods, which typically require 1-4 seconds or
longer. By applying an inference algorithm to the initial transient current

validated through comparison with standard chronoamperometric techniques and is
demonstrated to maintain reasonable accuracy while dramatically reducing data

Abstract: Limbless creatures can crawl on flat surfaces by deforming their bodies and
interacting with asperities on the ground, offering a biological blueprint for

skin with asymmetric frictional properties. The robot's rectilinear locomotion
is achieved through cyclic inflation of internal chambers with precise phase
shifts, enabling forward progression. Steering is accomplished using an
asymmetric gait, allowing for both in-place rotation and wide turns. To
validate its mobility in obstacle-rich environments, we tested the robot in an

Motivation: Current dynamics model learning methods for manipulation tasks are data-intensive and inefficient, often relying on randomly sampled, less informative interactions.

Method: ActivePusher uses residual-physics modeling and kernel-based active learning to identify and collect the most informative data for skill parameters. It integrates uncertainty estimates into kinodynamic planners for better control sampling.

Result: The framework achieves higher data efficiency and planning success rates than baseline methods in both simulated and real-world settings.

Conclusion: ActivePusher enhances nonprehensile manipulation planning by focusing on informative data acquisition and leveraging uncertainties for improved planning reliability.

Abstract: Planning with learned dynamics models offers a promising approach toward
real-world, long-horizon manipulation, particularly in nonprehensile settings
such as pushing or rolling, where accurate analytical models are difficult to
obtain. Although learning-based methods hold promise, collecting training data

residual-physics modeling with kernel-based uncertainty-driven active learning
to focus data acquisition on the most informative skill parameters.
Additionally, ActivePusher seamlessly integrates with model-based kinodynamic

Motivation: The motivation is to avoid the risks associated with direct human testing of exoskeletons due to malfunctions while ensuring repeatable and controlled evaluations.

Method: A bipedal robot platform modeled as a double pendulum is used to replicate human gait. The SDRE control strategy is enhanced with a simplified parameterized control using a ramping trapezoidal velocity model adapted to a piecewise linear format.

Result: Experimental verification confirmed the method's feasibility in accurately reproducing human gait, reducing computational complexity, and offering insights for exoskeleton performance evaluations.

Conclusion: The bipedal robot platform and optimized control strategy successfully provide a repeatable and safe mechanism for testing knee-type exoskeletons under controlled conditions.

Abstract: Exoskeletons are widely used in rehabilitation and industrial applications to
assist human motion. However, direct human testing poses risks due to possible
exoskeleton malfunctions and inconsistent movement replication. To provide a
safer and more repeatable testing environment, this study employs a bipedal
robot platform to reproduce human gait, allowing for controlled exoskeleton
evaluations. A control strategy based on the State-Dependent Riccati Equation
(SDRE) is formulated to achieve optimal torque control for accurate gait
replication. The bipedal robot dynamics are represented using double pendulum
model, where SDRE-optimized control inputs minimize deviations from human
motion trajectories. To align with motor behavior constraints, a parameterized
control method is introduced to simplify the control process while effectively
replicating human gait. The proposed approach initially adopts a ramping
trapezoidal velocity model, which is then adapted into a piecewise linear
velocity-time representation through motor command overwriting. This
modification enables finer control over gait phase transitions while ensuring
compatibility with motor dynamics. The corresponding cost function optimizes
the control parameters to minimize errors in joint angles, velocities, and
torques relative to SDRE control result. By structuring velocity transitions in
accordance with motor limitations, the method reduce the computational load
associated with real-time control. Experimental results verify the feasibility
of the proposed parameterized control method in reproducing human gait. The
bipedal robot platform provides a reliable and repeatable testing mechanism for
knee-type exoskeletons, offering insights into exoskeleton performance under
controlled conditions.

TL;DR: This study develops a novel Model Predictive Control (MPC) method for improving trajectory tracking and minimizing tire wear in Multi-axle Swerve-drive Autonomous Mobile Robots (MS-AGVs).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to optimize trajectory tracking in high-payload MS-AGVs while addressing the crucial issue of tire wear, thereby enhancing operational efficiency.

Method: A hierarchical control design integrates simplified dynamic, magic formula tire, and tire wear models. Simulated annealing is employed for real-time problem solving.

Result: Experiments demonstrate a 19.19% tire wear reduction while maintaining tracking accuracy, with a further reduction to 65.20% in situations with significant trajectory-to-heading offsets.

Conclusion: Incorporating tire wear optimization into MPC for MS-AGVs significantly enhances performance, offering real-time solutions with reduced tire wear and accurate trajectory tracking.

Abstract: Multi-axle Swerve-drive Autonomous Mobile Robots (MS-AGVs) equipped with
independently steerable wheels are commonly used for high-payload
transportation. In this work, we present a novel model predictive control (MPC)
method for MS-AGV trajectory tracking that takes tire wear minimization
consideration in the objective function. To speed up the problem-solving
process, we propose a hierarchical controller design and simplify the dynamic
model by integrating the \textit{magic formula tire model} and
\textit{simplified tire wear model}. In the experiment, the proposed method can
be solved by simulated annealing in real-time on a normal personal computer and
by incorporating tire wear into the objective function, tire wear is reduced by
19.19\% while maintaining the tracking accuracy in curve-tracking experiments.
In the more challenging scene: the desired trajectory is offset by 60 degrees
from the vehicle's heading, the reduction in tire wear increased to 65.20\%
compared to the kinematic model without considering the tire wear optimization.

spatial awareness. It features two LiDARs, as well as images captured at
diverse spectral ranges, including visible (RGB, monochrome), visible
short-wave infrared (VIS-SWIR), and long-wave infrared (LWIR). Additionally,
the dataset comes with an estimation of the location of the targets, offering a
benchmark for evaluating detection algorithms. We recorded approximately one
hour of data in both daylight and nighttime conditions, resulting in around

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address scalability and computational challenges in multi-robot systems tasked with fulfilling complex global Boolean specifications in shared environments.

Method: The authors use an Integer Linear Programming (ILP) formulation enhanced by Petri net insights. By proving total unimodularity (TU) of the constraint matrix for certain cases, they relax ILP into a Linear Programming (LP) problem to simplify computations.

Result: The proposed approach enables scalable path planning for teams of up to 500 robots, ensures collision avoidance, and reduces computational demands via iterative LP optimization techniques.

Conclusion: This work presents a practical and theoretically grounded solution for scalable and efficient multi-robot path planning and task assignment suitable for complex, real-world applications.

Abstract: This paper presents a novel path-planning and task assignment algorithm for
multi-robot systems that should fulfill a global Boolean specification. The
proposed method is based on Integer Linear Programming (ILP) formulations,
which are combined with structural insights from Petri nets to improve
scalability and computational efficiency. By proving that the \emph{constraint
matrix} is totally unimodular (TU) for certain classes of problems, the ILP
formulation can be relaxed into a Linear Programming (LP) problem without
losing the integrality of the solution. This relaxation eliminates complex
combinatorial techniques, significantly reducing computational overhead and
thus ensuring scalability for large-scale systems. Using the approach proposed
in this paper, we can solve path-planning problems for teams made up to 500
robots. The method guarantees computational tractability, handles collision
avoidance and reduces computational demands through iterative LP optimization
techniques. Case studies demonstrate the efficiency of the algorithm in
generating scalable, collision-free paths for large robot teams navigating in
complex environments. While the conservative nature of collision avoidance
introduces additional constraints, and thus, computational requirements, the
solution remains practical and impactful for diverse applications. The
algorithm is particularly applicable to real-world scenarios, including
warehouse logistics where autonomous robots must efficiently coordinate tasks
or search-and-rescue operations in various environments. This work contributes
both theoretically and practically to scalable multi-robot path planning and
task allocation, offering an efficient framework for coordinating autonomous
agents in shared environments.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper proposes a pillbug-inspired mechanism utilizing slider-crank mechanisms and scissor mechanisms for rolling and spreading motions, demonstrated through a 3D model and robotic prototype.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a biomimetic morphing mechanism inspired by pillbugs for enhanced protection and movement versatility in robotics.

Method: The method involves combining slider-crank and scissor mechanisms to replicate pillbug-like motions, attaching 3D curved shells, and synthesizing the design to achieve both rolling and straight-line movement.

Result: A 3D morphing structure and robot prototype were created and tested, successfully demonstrating two distinct motion modes: curling for rolling and spreading for straight-line movement.

Conclusion: The pillbug-inspired structure effectively mimics natural motion while providing morphing capabilities, showcasing potential in robotics and protective design.

Abstract: This research proposes a novel morphing structure with shells inspired by the
movement of pillbugs. Instead of the pillbug body, a loopcoupled mechanism
based on slider-crank mechanisms is utilized to achieve the rolling up and
spreading motion. This mechanism precisely imitates three distinct curves that
mimic the shape morphing of a pillbug. To decrease the degree-of-freedom (DOF)
of the mechanism to one, scissor mechanisms are added. 3D curved shells are
then attached to the tracer points of the morphing mechanism to safeguard it
from attacks while allowing it to roll. Through type and dimensional synthesis,
a complete system that includes shells and an underlying morphing mechanism is
developed. A 3D model is created and tested to demonstrate the proposed
system's shape-changing capability. Lastly, a robot with two modes is developed
based on the proposed mechanism, which can curl up to roll down hills and can
spread to move in a straight line via wheels.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve the physical accuracy and numerical stability of simulating fluid-robot interactions for robotic applications.

Method: Utilized a unified Lagrangian framework and discrete variational mechanics, along with extending the immersed boundary method, to derive a stable time-integration scheme with no-slip constraint enforcement.

Result: Validated the framework's accuracy on benchmark simulations and successfully demonstrated its capability through a swimming robot tested in both simulation and real-world hardware.

Conclusion: The proposed framework provides a robust and accurate method for simulating coupled fluid-robot dynamics, enabling reliable sim-to-real robotic task execution.

Abstract: We present a framework for simulating fluid-robot multiphysics as a single,
unified optimization problem. The coupled manipulator and incompressible
Navier-Stokes equations governing the robot and fluid dynamics are derived
together from a single Lagrangian using the principal of least action. We then
employ discrete variational mechanics to derive a stable, implicit
time-integration scheme for jointly simulating both the fluid and robot
dynamics, which are tightly coupled by a constraint that enforces the no-slip
boundary condition at the fluid-robot interface. Extending the classical
immersed boundary method, we derive a new formulation of the no-slip constraint
that is numerically well-conditioned and physically accurate for multibody
systems commonly found in robotics. We demonstrate our approach's physical
accuracy on benchmark computational fluid-dynamics problems, including
Poiseuille flow and a disc in free stream. We then design a locomotion policy
for a novel swimming robot in simulation and validate results on real-world
hardware, showcasing our framework's sim-to-real capability for robotics tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing frameworks for heterogeneous multi-robot systems struggle with diverse tasks and dynamic environments due to relying on static models. The challenge is to develop generalizable intelligence for integrating high-level reasoning and low-level execution across different robots.

Method: The authors propose a hierarchical system integrating a prompted LLM for task decomposition and global semantics, alongside a GridMask-enhanced fine-tuned VLM for extracting local spatial and semantic information. The framework coordinates aerial robots for global path planning and ground robots for local navigation and manipulation.

Result: The framework was validated through a real-world letter-cubes arrangement task, showcasing its adaptability and robustness in dynamic operational conditions.

Conclusion: This work offers a novel integration of LLM-driven task planning and VLM-based perception for heterogeneous aerial-ground robotic systems, presenting a milestone toward hybrid and generalizable robot intelligence.

Abstract: Heterogeneous multi-robot systems show great potential in complex tasks
requiring coordinated hybrid cooperation. However, traditional approaches
relying on static models often struggle with task diversity and dynamic
environments. This highlights the need for generalizable intelligence that can
bridge high-level reasoning with low-level execution across heterogeneous
agents. To address this, we propose a hierarchical framework integrating a
prompted Large Language Model (LLM) and a GridMask-enhanced fine-tuned Vision
Language Model (VLM). The LLM performs task decomposition and global semantic
map construction, while the VLM extracts task-specified semantic labels and 2D
spatial information from aerial images to support local planning. Within this
framework, the aerial robot follows a globally optimized semantic path and
continuously provides bird-view images, guiding the ground robot's local
semantic navigation and manipulation, including target-absent scenarios where
implicit alignment is maintained. Experiments on a real-world letter-cubes
arrangement task demonstrate the framework's adaptability and robustness in
dynamic environments. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first
demonstration of an aerial-ground heterogeneous system integrating VLM-based
perception with LLM-driven task reasoning and motion planning.

*Azizul Zahid,Bibek Poudel,Danny Scott,Jason Scott,Scott Crouter,Weizi Li,Sai Swaminathan*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces PulseRide, a wheelchair system using real-time physiological data and reinforcement learning to provide personalized assistance. Preliminary tests show longer moderate heart rate maintenance and reduced muscle contractions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current wheelchair solutions fail to balance activity promotion and injury prevention, leading to health issues such as obesity, deconditioning, and upper extremity injuries.

Method: PulseRide uses real-time physiological data (e.g., heart rate, ECG) combined with speed adjustments through a reinforcement learning approach (Deep Q-Network) to customize exertion levels for users.

Result: Testing with 10 users demonstrated PulseRide's ability to maintain moderate heart rates 71.7% longer than manual wheelchairs and reduce muscle contractions by 41.86%, enhancing comfort and delaying fatigue.

Conclusion: PulseRide offers a promising adaptive mobility solution that encourages healthier activity levels while minimizing physical strain, filling the gap between passive and demanding wheelchair options.

Abstract: Maintaining an active lifestyle is vital for quality of life, yet challenging
for wheelchair users. For instance, powered wheelchairs face increasing risks
of obesity and deconditioning due to inactivity. Conversely, manual wheelchair
users, who propel the wheelchair by pushing the wheelchair's handrims, often
face upper extremity injuries from repetitive motions. These challenges
underscore the need for a mobility system that promotes activity while
minimizing injury risk. Maintaining optimal exertion during wheelchair use
enhances health benefits and engagement, yet the variations in individual
physiological responses complicate exertion optimization. To address this, we
introduce PulseRide, a novel wheelchair system that provides personalized
assistance based on each user's physiological responses, helping them maintain
their physical exertion goals. Unlike conventional assistive systems focused on
obstacle avoidance and navigation, PulseRide integrates real-time physiological
data-such as heart rate and ECG-with wheelchair speed to deliver adaptive
assistance. Using a human-in-the-loop reinforcement learning approach with Deep
Q-Network algorithm (DQN), the system adjusts push assistance to keep users
within a moderate activity range without under- or over-exertion. We conducted
preliminary tests with 10 users on various terrains, including carpet and
slate, to assess PulseRide's effectiveness. Our findings show that, for
individual users, PulseRide maintains heart rates within the moderate activity
zone as much as 71.7 percent longer than manual wheelchairs. Among all users,
we observed an average reduction in muscle contractions of 41.86 percent,
delaying fatigue onset and enhancing overall comfort and engagement. These
results indicate that PulseRide offers a healthier, adaptive mobility solution,
bridging the gap between passive and physically taxing mobility options.

*Lingxiao Guo,Zhengrong Xue,Zijing Xu,Huazhe Xu*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: DemoSpeedup is a new method for speeding up visuomotor policy execution in robotic manipulation by self-supervised entropy-guided demonstration acceleration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the issue of slow policy execution in robotic manipulation caused by tardy demonstrations from human operators.

Method: The method uses entropy estimates to segment and accelerate demonstration frames, training policies on accelerated demonstrations to improve execution speed.

Result: The policies executed up to 3 times faster while maintaining or even surpassing task completion performance.

Conclusion: DemoSpeedup effectively accelerates visuomotor execution without compromising accuracy, offering potential improvements in both speed and success rates.

Abstract: Imitation learning has shown great promise in robotic manipulation, but the
policy's execution is often unsatisfactorily slow due to commonly tardy
demonstrations collected by human operators. In this work, we present
DemoSpeedup, a self-supervised method to accelerate visuomotor policy execution
via entropy-guided demonstration acceleration. DemoSpeedup starts from training
an arbitrary generative policy (e.g., ACT or Diffusion Policy) on normal-speed
demonstrations, which serves as a per-frame action entropy estimator. The key
insight is that frames with lower action entropy estimates call for more
consistent policy behaviors, which often indicate the demands for
higher-precision operations. In contrast, frames with higher entropy estimates
correspond to more casual sections, and therefore can be more safely
accelerated. Thus, we segment the original demonstrations according to the
estimated entropy, and accelerate them by down-sampling at rates that increase
with the entropy values. Trained with the speedup demonstrations, the resulting
policies execute up to 3 times faster while maintaining the task completion
performance. Interestingly, these policies could even achieve higher success
rates than those trained with normal-speed demonstrations, due to the benefits
of reduced decision-making horizons.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manually creating annotated datasets for object detection in robotics is time-intensive, prone to human error, and lacks diversity. This paper seeks to overcome these limitations by exploring scalable synthetic data generation methods.

Method: The method utilizes Unreal Engine to generate annotated synthetic datasets using photorealistic 3D Gaussian splats, offering an automated and scalable approach.

Result: The study showed that object detectors trained on synthetic datasets performed comparably to those trained on real-world datasets. Combining real-world and synthetic datasets further enhanced detection performance.

Conclusion: The proposed method offers a scalable and accurate dataset creation approach, eliminating the need for labor-intensive manual annotations. This is especially valuable in dynamic robotics domains, such as robot soccer.

Abstract: Annotated datasets are critical for training neural networks for object
detection, yet their manual creation is time- and labour-intensive, subjective
to human error, and often limited in diversity. This challenge is particularly
pronounced in the domain of robotics, where diverse and dynamic scenarios
further complicate the creation of representative datasets. To address this, we
propose a novel method for automatically generating annotated synthetic data in
Unreal Engine. Our approach leverages photorealistic 3D Gaussian splats for
rapid synthetic data generation. We demonstrate that synthetic datasets can
achieve performance comparable to that of real-world datasets while
significantly reducing the time required to generate and annotate data.
Additionally, combining real-world and synthetic data significantly increases
object detection performance by leveraging the quality of real-world images
with the easier scalability of synthetic data. To our knowledge, this is the
first application of synthetic data for training object detection algorithms in
the highly dynamic and varied environment of robot soccer. Validation
experiments reveal that a detector trained on synthetic images performs on par
with one trained on manually annotated real-world images when tested on robot
soccer match scenarios. Our method offers a scalable and comprehensive
alternative to traditional dataset creation, eliminating the labour-intensive
error-prone manual annotation process. By generating datasets in a simulator
where all elements are intrinsically known, we ensure accurate annotations
while significantly reducing manual effort, which makes it particularly
valuable for robotics applications requiring diverse and scalable training
data.

Result: Simulations reveal that the method surpasses state-of-the-art techniques in exploration efficiency, computation speed, and trajectory speed. Real-world experiments further confirm its effectiveness.

Conclusion: The dual-layer method proves to be effective and computationally efficient for large-scale autonomous exploration. The authors plan to make the code publicly available.

Abstract: Efficient autonomous exploration in large-scale environments remains
challenging due to the high planning computational cost and low-speed
maneuvers. In this paper, we propose a fast and computationally efficient
dual-layer exploration planning method. The insight of our dual-layer method is
efficiently finding an acceptable long-term region routing and greedily
exploring the target in the region of the first routing area with high speed.
Specifically, the proposed method finds the long-term area routing through an
approximate algorithm to ensure real-time planning in large-scale environments.
Then, the viewpoint in the first routing region with the lowest
curvature-penalized cost, which can effectively reduce decelerations caused by
sharp turn motions, will be chosen as the next exploration target. To further
speed up the exploration, we adopt an aggressive and safe exploration-oriented
trajectory to enhance exploration continuity. The proposed method is compared
to state-of-the-art methods in challenging simulation environments. The results
show that the proposed method outperforms other methods in terms of exploration
efficiency, computational cost, and trajectory speed. We also conduct
real-world experiments to validate the effectiveness of the proposed method.
The code will be open-sourced.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address safety issues like joint collisions, excessive torque, and foot slippage in real-world deployment of RL policies for legged robots, especially in high-stakes missions.

Method: Authors design a hierarchical optimization-based whole-body follower that integrates hard and soft constraints into RL frameworks, utilizing model-based control for better training and deployment.

Result: The method was successfully tested on a hexapod robot deployed across various challenging outdoor environments, showcasing improved traversability and safety.

Conclusion: This approach mitigates the sim-to-real transfer gap and enhances safety while maintaining RL's robustness for complex environments.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has demonstrated impressive performance in legged
locomotion over various challenging environments. However, due to the
sim-to-real gap and lack of explainability, unconstrained RL policies deployed
in the real world still suffer from inevitable safety issues, such as joint
collisions, excessive torque, or foot slippage in low-friction environments.
These problems limit its usage in missions with strict safety requirements,
such as planetary exploration, nuclear facility inspection, and deep-sea
operations. In this paper, we design a hierarchical optimization-based
whole-body follower, which integrates both hard and soft constraints into RL
framework to make the robot move with better safety guarantees. Leveraging the
advantages of model-based control, our approach allows for the definition of
various types of hard and soft constraints during training or deployment, which
allows for policy fine-tuning and mitigates the challenges of sim-to-real
transfer. Meanwhile, it preserves the robustness of RL when dealing with
locomotion in complex unstructured environments. The trained policy with
introduced constraints was deployed in a hexapod robot and tested in various
outdoor environments, including snow-covered slopes and stairs, demonstrating
the great traversability and safety of our approach.

Motivation: Facilitating human motion mimicry by humanoid robots, moving beyond traditional reliance on motion capture systems, and exploring novel text-driven methods for real-world application.

Method: An angle signal network with norm-position and rotation loss (NPR Loss) is employed to generate joint angles, which are then used as inputs for reinforcement learning-based motion control to ensure stability and motion tracking.

Result: The proposed method successfully transfers text-driven human motion to the humanoid robot NAO, demonstrating its effectiveness in real-world scenarios.

Conclusion: Text-driven human motion retargeting can provide an effective and stable approach for humanoid robot control, expanding the versatility of robot applications.

Abstract: Human motion retargeting for humanoid robots, transferring human motion data
to robots for imitation, presents significant challenges but offers
considerable potential for real-world applications. Traditionally, this process
relies on human demonstrations captured through pose estimation or motion
capture systems. In this paper, we explore a text-driven approach to mapping
human motion to humanoids. To address the inherent discrepancies between the
generated motion representations and the kinematic constraints of humanoid
robots, we propose an angle signal network based on norm-position and rotation
loss (NPR Loss). It generates joint angles, which serve as inputs to a
reinforcement learning-based whole-body joint motion control policy. The policy
ensures tracking of the generated motions while maintaining the robot's
stability during execution. Our experimental results demonstrate the efficacy
of this approach, successfully transferring text-driven human motion to a real
humanoid robot NAO.

*Dongwoo Son,Suhan Park*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper proposes a method to smooth robot action sequences for better performance in dynamic tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the discontinuities and degraded motion quality caused by discrete action chunking in learned robotic policies, which create challenges in dynamic manipulation tasks.

Method: A post-optimization framework combining inference-aware chunk scheduling, linear blending for overlap regions, and jerk-minimizing trajectory optimization.

Result: Improved motion smoothness, reduced vibration, and enhanced mechanical robustness in dynamic robotic tasks using a position-controlled arm.

Conclusion: The method effectively mitigates abrupt transitions in action sequences, enabling smoother robotic actions crucial for dynamic tasks.

Abstract: Recent advances in imitation learning have enabled robots to perform
increasingly complex manipulation tasks in unstructured environments. However,
most learned policies rely on discrete action chunking, which introduces
discontinuities at chunk boundaries. These discontinuities degrade motion
quality and are particularly problematic in dynamic tasks such as throwing or
lifting heavy objects, where smooth trajectories are critical for momentum
transfer and system stability. In this work, we present a lightweight
post-optimization framework for smoothing chunked action sequences. Our method
combines three key components: (1) inference-aware chunk scheduling to
proactively generate overlapping chunks and avoid pauses from inference delays;
(2) linear blending in the overlap region to reduce abrupt transitions; and (3)
jerk-minimizing trajectory optimization constrained within a bounded
perturbation space. The proposed method was validated on a position-controlled
robotic arm performing dynamic manipulation tasks. Experimental results
demonstrate that our approach significantly reduces vibration and motion
jitter, leading to smoother execution and improved mechanical robustness.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Fabrica introduces a dual-arm robot system for autonomous multi-part object assembly, utilizing efficient planning and generalist reinforcement learning policies for robust performance in diverse scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing robotic systems face limitations in handling complex, long-horizon, contact-rich assembly tasks with generalization across varied object geometries.

Method: The system employs hierarchical planning frameworks optimized for stability and a lightweight reinforcement learning approach guided by equivariance and residual actions.

Result: Fabrica successfully transfers learned policies to real-world scenarios, achieving an 80% success rate in contact-rich assembly steps.

Conclusion: The paper demonstrates the capability of Fabrica as the first comprehensive and generalizable system for autonomous multi-part assembly, bypassing the need for domain-specific knowledge or human demonstrations.

Abstract: Multi-part assembly poses significant challenges for robots to execute
long-horizon, contact-rich manipulation with generalization across complex
geometries. We present Fabrica, a dual-arm robotic system capable of end-to-end
planning and control for autonomous assembly of general multi-part objects. For
planning over long horizons, we develop hierarchies of precedence, sequence,
grasp, and motion planning with automated fixture generation, enabling general
multi-step assembly on any dual-arm robots. The planner is made efficient
through a parallelizable design and is optimized for downstream control
stability. For contact-rich assembly steps, we propose a lightweight
reinforcement learning framework that trains generalist policies across object
geometries, assembly directions, and grasp poses, guided by equivariance and
residual actions obtained from the plan. These policies transfer zero-shot to
the real world and achieve 80% successful steps. For systematic evaluation, we
propose a benchmark suite of multi-part assemblies resembling industrial and
daily objects across diverse categories and geometries. By integrating
efficient global planning and robust local control, we showcase the first
system to achieve complete and generalizable real-world multi-part assembly
without domain knowledge or human demonstrations. Project website:

### [424] [Characterizing Multi-Hunk Patches: Divergence, Proximity, and LLM Repair Challenges](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04418)
*Noor Nashid,Daniel Ding,Keheliya Gallaba,Ahmed E. Hassan,Ali Mesbah*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper introduces HUNK4J, a dataset for analyzing multi-hunk bugs, and introduces metrics like hunk divergence and spatial proximity to study the repair challenges faced by LLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multi-hunk bugs, which require coordinated fixes across different code regions, are underexplored by automated repair techniques and benchmarks.

Method: Researchers defined new metrics (hunk divergence and spatial proximity) and assessed the performance of six large language models (LLMs) on multi-hunk patches from the HUNK4J dataset.

Result: Empirical studies found LLM success rates diminish as hunk divergence and spatial dispersion increase. Models failed to address the most dispersed cases using LLMs alone.

Conclusion: The study identifies limitations in current LLM capabilities for addressing multi-hunk bugs and suggests the need for divergence-aware repair approaches.

Abstract: Multi-hunk bugs, where fixes span disjoint regions of code, are common in
practice, yet remain underrepresented in automated repair. Existing techniques
and benchmarks pre-dominantly target single-hunk scenarios, overlooking the
added complexity of coordinating semantically related changes across the
codebase. In this work, we characterize HUNK4J, a dataset of multi-hunk patches
derived from 372 real-world defects. We propose hunk divergence, a metric that
quantifies the variation among edits in a patch by capturing lexical,
structural, and file-level differences, while incorporating the number of hunks
involved. We further define spatial proximity, a classification that models how
hunks are spatially distributed across the program hierarchy. Our empirical
study spanning six LLMs reveals that model success rates decline with increased
divergence and spatial dispersion. Notably, when using the LLM alone, no model
succeeds in the most dispersed Fragment class. These findings highlight a
critical gap in LLM capabilities and motivate divergence-aware repair
strategies.

*Katerina Goseva-Popstojanova,Denny Hood,Johann Schumann,Noble Nkwocha*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper introduces the first part of a study examining practices, challenges, and benefits of developing autonomous systems using a 2019 survey of experts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of information on current practices, challenges, and standards used in the development of autonomous systems.

Method: An anonymous online survey conducted in 2019, targeting experts in autonomous systems and model-based software engineering.

Result: Findings about the state-of-practice, challenges, benefits, processes, and verification and validation practices in autonomous systems development.

Conclusion: Insights into development practices were gathered, and further research aims to track their evolution by conducting updated surveys.

Abstract: Autonomous systems have gained an important role in many industry domains and
are beginning to change everyday life. However, due to dynamically emerging
applications and often proprietary constraints, there is a lack of information
about the practice of developing autonomous systems. This paper presents the
first part of the longitudinal study focused on establishing
state-of-the-practice, identifying and quantifying the challenges and benefits,
identifying the processes and standards used, and exploring verification and
validation (V&V) practices used for the development of autonomous systems. The
results presented in this paper are based on data about software systems that
have autonomous functionality and may employ model-based software engineering
(MBSwE) and reuse. These data were collected using an anonymous online survey
that was administered in 2019 and were provided by experts with experience in
development of autonomous systems and /or the use of MBSwE. Our current work is
focused on repeating the survey to collect more recent data and discover how
the development of autonomous systems has evolved over time.

*Oussama Ben Sghaier,Rosalia Tufano,Gabriele Bavota,Houari Sahraoui*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper proposes CoRAL, a reinforcement learning-based framework to automate semantic and useful review comment generation for code reviews.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Code reviews are valuable yet time-consuming and subject to human biases, necessitating automated tools.

Method: CoRAL uses deep learning techniques combined with reinforcement learning, rewarding comment generation that is semantically accurate and useful for downstream tasks like code refinement.

Result: CoRAL outperforms baseline techniques quantitatively and qualitatively in generating meaningful and functional code review comments.

Conclusion: The framework demonstrates its potential to enhance code reviews by streamlining the process and improving comment quality.

Abstract: Code review is a crucial component of modern software development, involving
the evaluation of code quality, providing feedback on potential issues, and
refining the code to address identified problems. Despite these benefits, code
review can be rather time consuming, and influenced by subjectivity and human
factors. For these reasons, techniques to (partially) automate the code review
process have been proposed in the literature. Among those, the ones exploiting
deep learning (DL) are able to tackle the generative aspect of code review, by
commenting on a given code as a human reviewer would do (i.e., comment
generation task) or by automatically implementing code changes required to
address a reviewer's comment (i.e., code refinement task). In this paper, we
introduce CoRAL, a deep learning framework automating review comment generation
by exploiting reinforcement learning with a reward mechanism considering both
the semantics of the generated comments as well as their usefulness as input
for other models automating the code refinement task. The core idea is that if
the DL model generates comments that are semantically similar to the expected
ones or can be successfully implemented by a second model specialized in code
refinement, these comments are likely to be meaningful and useful, thus
deserving a high reward in the reinforcement learning framework. We present
both quantitative and qualitative comparisons between the comments generated by
CoRAL and those produced by the latest baseline techniques, highlighting the
effectiveness and superiority of our approach.

*Kishan Kumar Ganguly,Tim Menzies*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This study introduces the BINGO effect in software engineering optimization, where data clusters into a few solution buckets, enabling simpler and faster optimization methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional multi-objective optimization in software engineering (SE) can be slow and unnecessarily complex, creating a need for more efficient approaches.

Method: The authors observed the BINGO effect across 39 SE problems and developed algorithms (LITE and LINE) using stochastic selection, which optimize 10,000 times faster than state-of-the-art methods.

Result: LITE and LINE algorithms showed comparable effectiveness to complex optimizers like DEHB, leveraging the collapsed data space identified by the BINGO effect.

Conclusion: Simple stochastic methods are sufficient for SE optimization due to the limited real-world data space, reducing the need for computationally heavy techniques, and this work provides guidance on their appropriate use.

Abstract: Traditional multi-objective optimization in software engineering (SE) can be
slow and complex. This paper introduces the BINGO effect: a novel phenomenon
where SE data surprisingly collapses into a tiny fraction of possible solution
"buckets" (e.g., only 100 used from 4,096 expected).
  We show the BINGO effect's prevalence across 39 optimization in SE problems.
Exploiting this, we optimize 10,000 times faster than state-of-the-art methods,
with comparable effectiveness. Our new algorithms (LITE and LINE), demonstrate
that simple stochastic selection can match complex optimizers like DEHB. This
work explains why simple methods succeed in SE-real data occupies a small
corner of possibilities-and guides when to apply them, challenging the need for
CPU-heavy optimization.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: KPIRoot+ combines similarity and causality analysis for KPI monitoring in cloud systems, outperforming existing methods and increasing efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Cloud systems require reliable KPI monitoring for quick identification and resolution of issues, but current methods face limitations in complex environments.

Method: KPIRoot+ uses symbolic aggregate approximation (SAX) for compact KPI representation and resolves issues like missed anomalies and intricate trend detection.

Result: KPIRoot+ improves performance by 2.9% to 35.7% over baselines, while reducing time cost by 34.7%, demonstrating its effectiveness.

Conclusion: KPIRoot+ is an advanced, efficient, and interpretable solution for performance monitoring and anomaly detection in cloud environments, validated through deployment.

Abstract: To ensure the reliability of cloud systems, their performance is monitored
using KPIs (key performance indicators). When issues arise, root cause
localization identifies KPIs responsible for service degradation, aiding in
quick diagnosis and resolution. Traditional methods rely on similarity
calculations, which can be ineffective in complex, interdependent cloud
environments. While deep learning-based approaches model these dependencies
better, they often face challenges such as high computational demands and lack
of interpretability.
  To address these issues, KPIRoot is proposed as an efficient method combining
similarity and causality analysis. It uses symbolic aggregate approximation for
compact KPI representation, improving analysis efficiency. However, deployment
in Cloud H revealed two drawbacks: 1) threshold-based anomaly detection misses
some performance anomalies, and 2) SAX representation fails to capture
intricate variation trends. KPIRoot+ addresses these limitations, outperforming
eight state-of-the-art baselines by 2.9% to 35.7%, while reducing time cost by
34.7%. We also share our experience deploying KPIRoot in a large-scale cloud
provider's production environment.

*Alisa Welter,Niklas Schneider,Tobias Dick,Kallistos Weis,Christof Tinnes,Marvin Wyrich,Sven Apel*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The study compares knowledge transfer in human-human and human-AI settings, analyzing GitHub Copilot's role in programming tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Investigate the effectiveness and dynamics of knowledge transfer when developers work with human partners versus AI coding assistants.

Method: An empirical study with two groups: one performed programming tasks in pairs without AI, while another worked individually using GitHub Copilot. An evaluation framework was extended and automated to analyze knowledge transfer.

Result: Both human-human and human-AI pairings had similar frequencies of successful knowledge transfer and overlapping topical categories. Developers scrutinized AI suggestions less but benefited from helpful reminders from the AI.

Conclusion: AI tools like GitHub Copilot foster knowledge transfer comparable to human pair programming but are accepted differently, with less scrutiny but useful reminders.

Abstract: Knowledge transfer is fundamental to human collaboration and is therefore
common in software engineering. Pair programming is a prominent instance. With
the rise of AI coding assistants, developers now not only work with human
partners but also, as some claim, with AI pair programmers. Although studies
confirm knowledge transfer during human pair programming, its effectiveness
with AI coding assistants remains uncertain. To analyze knowledge transfer in
both human-human and human-AI settings, we conducted an empirical study where
developer pairs solved a programming task without AI support, while a separate
group of individual developers completed the same task using the AI coding
assistant GitHub Copilot. We extended an existing knowledge transfer framework
and employed a semi-automated evaluation pipeline to assess differences in
knowledge transfer episodes across both settings. We found a similar frequency
of successful knowledge transfer episodes and overlapping topical categories
across both settings. Two of our key findings are that developers tend to
accept GitHub Copilot's suggestions with less scrutiny than those from human
pair programming partners, but also that GitHub Copilot can subtly remind
developers of important code details they might otherwise overlook.

*Zanis Ali Khan,Aayush Garg,Qiang Tang*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper examines pre-trained language models CodeBERT and CodeT5 for automated vulnerability patching, highlighting their strengths and limitations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Software vulnerabilities pose serious security risks, and while Automated Program Repair has gained traction for general bug fixing, its application to security-critical vulnerability patching is underexplored.

Method: The study evaluates the performance of CodeBERT and CodeT5 on vulnerability patching tasks across six datasets and four programming languages, testing both in-distribution and out-of-distribution cases, with and without fine-tuning.

Result: CodeBERT outperforms in fragmented or sparse contexts, while CodeT5 is better at detecting complex vulnerabilities and scales more effectively. Fine-tuning raises in-distribution accuracy but fails to generalize to unseen vulnerabilities.

Conclusion: Automated vulnerability patching using pre-trained models shows promise but faces significant challenges in generalizability and robustness. Fine-tuning enhances performance on known data but does not address challenges with unseen vulnerabilities.

Abstract: Software vulnerabilities pose significant security threats, requiring
effective mitigation. While Automated Program Repair (APR) has advanced in
fixing general bugs, vulnerability patching, a security-critical aspect of APR
remains underexplored. This study investigates pre-trained language models,
CodeBERT and CodeT5, for automated vulnerability patching across six datasets
and four languages. We evaluate their accuracy and generalization to unknown
vulnerabilities. Results show that while both models face challenges with
fragmented or sparse context, CodeBERT performs comparatively better in such
scenarios, whereas CodeT5 excels in capturing complex vulnerability patterns.
CodeT5 also demonstrates superior scalability. Furthermore, we test fine-tuned
models on both in-distribution (trained) and out-of-distribution (unseen)
datasets. While fine-tuning improves in-distribution performance, models
struggle to generalize to unseen data, highlighting challenges in robust
vulnerability detection. This study benchmarks model performance, identifies
limitations in generalization, and provides actionable insights to advance
automated vulnerability patching for real-world security applications.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper introduces Tech-ASan, a technique to improve Address Sanitizer (ASan) performance by reducing runtime overhead and false negatives through a novel two-stage check algorithm, optimized redundant checks, and LLVM integration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the significant runtime overhead that ASan incurs, which hampers its efficiency in testing large software programs due to frequent and expensive shadow memory access.

Method: The methodology involves a two-stage check algorithm using magic value comparison to minimize shadow memory access, an optimizer to eliminate redundant checks (including in loops), and implementation in LLVM.

Result: Tech-ASan achieves a 33.70% reduction in runtime overhead compared to ASan and detects 56 fewer false negatives on the Juliet Test Suite, showing improved efficiency and detection capabilities.

Conclusion: Tech-ASan enhances ASan's performance without compromising detection safety, presenting a viable solution for software testing with reduced runtime overhead and improved error detection.

Abstract: Address Sanitizer (ASan) is a sharp weapon for detecting memory safety
violations, including temporal and spatial errors hidden in C/C++ programs
during execution. However, ASan incurs significant runtime overhead, which
limits its efficiency in testing large software. The overhead mainly comes from
sanitizer checks due to the frequent and expensive shadow memory access. Over
the past decade, many methods have been developed to speed up ASan by
eliminating and accelerating sanitizer checks, however, they either fail to
adequately eliminate redundant checks or compromise detection capabilities. To
address this issue, this paper presents Tech-ASan, a two-stage check based
technique to accelerate ASan with safety assurance. First, we propose a novel
two-stage check algorithm for ASan, which leverages magic value comparison to
reduce most of the costly shadow memory accesses. Second, we design an
efficient optimizer to eliminate redundant checks, which integrates a novel
algorithm for removing checks in loops. Third, we implement Tech-ASan as a
memory safety tool based on the LLVM compiler infrastructure. Our evaluation
using the SPEC CPU2006 benchmark shows that Tech-ASan outperforms the
state-of-the-art methods with 33.70% and 17.89% less runtime overhead than ASan
and ASan--, respectively. Moreover, Tech-ASan detects 56 fewer false negative
cases than ASan and ASan-- when testing on the Juliet Test Suite under the same
redzone setting.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper introduces ScenGen, a novel approach using Large Language Models (LLMs) to enhance scenario-based GUI testing for mobile apps.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Automated GUI testing approaches do not adequately align with app business logic or specific testing scenarios, leading to missed critical app functionalities.

Method: The paper presents ScenGen, utilizing multi-agent collaboration powered by LLMs to conduct scenario-based GUI tests. Five agents work together to perceive app GUI, make decisions, execute operations, verify testing results, and record context for further testing.

Result: ScenGen is shown to be effective in generating scenario-based GUI tests guided by LLMs, addressing the existing gaps in automated testing.

Conclusion: ScenGen bridges the gap between automated GUI testing and app business logic by leveraging LLMs, ensuring thorough and scenario-specific test generation and execution.

Abstract: The assurance of mobile app GUI is more and more significant. Automated GUI
testing approaches of different strategies have been developed, while there are
still huge gaps between the approaches and the app business logic, not taking
the completion of specific testing scenarios as the exploration target, leading
to the exploration missing of critical app functionalities. Learning from the
manual testing, which takes testing scenarios with app business logic as the
basic granularity, in this paper, we utilize the LLMs to understand the
semantics presented in app GUI and how they are mapped in the testing context
based on specific testing scenarios. Then, scenario-based GUI tests are
generated with the guidance of multi-agent collaboration. Specifically, we
propose ScenGen, a novel LLM-guided scenario-based GUI testing approach
involving five agents to respectively take responsibilities of different phases
of the manual testing process. The Observer perceives the app GUI state by
extracting GUI widgets and forming GUI layouts, understanding the expressed
semantics. Then the app GUI info is sent to the Decider to make decisions on
target widgets based on the target testing scenarios. The decision-making
process takes the completion of specific testing scenarios as the exploration
target. The Executor then executes the demanding operations on the apps. The
execution results are checked by the Supervisor on whether the generated tests
are consistent with the completion target of the testing scenarios, ensuring
the traceability of the test generation and execution. Furthermore, the
corresponding GUI test operations are recorded to the context memory by
Recorder as an important basis for further decision-making, meanwhile
monitoring the runtime bug occurrences. ScenGen is evaluated and the results
show that ScenGen can effectively generate scenario-based GUI tests guided by
LLMs.

TL;DR: The GAIN model introduces a grid-based structure to enhance biological plausibility and efficiency, using the Izhikevich model for computationally accurate simulations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of biological plausibility and efficiency in current neural network structures by leveraging insights from biological neurons.

Method: The authors use a grid-based structure for neuron interactions and integrate the Izhikevich model to develop computationally efficient and biologically realistic simulations.

Result: The approach improves neuron dynamics, interaction accuracy, and enables specialized uses in neural network development and neuroscience research.

Conclusion: This adaptation provides a novel mechanism to connect biological accuracy with computational efficiency, advancing both neuroscience studies and neural network design.

Abstract: While many neural networks focus on layers to process information, the GAIN
model uses a grid-based structure to improve biological plausibility and the
dynamics of the model. The grid structure helps neurons to interact with their
closest neighbors and improve their connections with one another, which is seen
in biological neurons. While also being implemented with the Izhikevich model
this approach allows for a computationally efficient and biologically accurate
simulation that can aid in the development of neural networks, large scale
simulations, and the development in the neuroscience field. This adaptation of
the Izhikevich model can improve the dynamics and accuracy of the model,
allowing for its uses to be specialized but efficient.

*Vardhan Palod,Pranav Mahajan,Veeky Baths,Boris S. Gutkin*

Main category: q-bio.NC

TL;DR: This paper explores addiction as a hierarchical decision-making disorder by integrating temporal discounting into a biologically grounded reinforcement learning framework.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the cognitive-behavioral conflict in substance use disorder and improve understanding of addiction's mechanisms, specifically the interplay between striatal activity, dopamine, and decision-making.

Method: The paper extends a hierarchical reinforcement learning (HRL) model to incorporate temporal discounting, ensuring natural rewards converge across levels while drug-related rewards diverge due to dopaminergic effects.

Result: The model demonstrates that higher discounting rates amplify drug-seeking behavior across the hierarchy, linking it to increased addiction severity and impulsivity.

Conclusion: Addiction can be seen as a disorder of hierarchical decision-making, and the paper provides predictions that align with empirical findings on temporal discounting for further validation.

Abstract: Despite a strong desire to quit, individuals with long-term substance use
disorder (SUD) often struggle to resist drug use, even when aware of its
harmful consequences. This disconnect between knowledge and compulsive behavior
reflects a fundamental cognitive-behavioral conflict in addiction.
Neurobiologically, differential cue-induced activity within striatal
subregions, along with dopamine-mediated connectivity from the ventral to the
dorsal striatum, contributes to compulsive drug-seeking. However, the
functional mechanism linking these findings to behavioral conflict remains
unclear. Another hallmark of addiction is temporal discounting: individuals
with drug dependence exhibit steeper discount rates than non-users. Assuming
the ventral-dorsal striatal organization reflects a gradient from cognitive to
motor representations, addiction can be modeled within a hierarchical
reinforcement learning (HRL) framework. However, integrating discounting into
biologically grounded HRL remains an open challenge. In this work, we build on
a model showing how action choices reinforced with drug rewards become
insensitive to the negative consequences that follow. We address the
integration of discounting by ensuring natural reward values converge across
all levels in the HRL hierarchy, while drug rewards diverge due to their
dopaminergic effects. Our results show that high discounting amplifies
drug-seeking across the hierarchy, linking faster discounting with increased
addiction severity and impulsivity. We demonstrate alignment with empirical
findings on temporal discounting and propose testable predictions, establishing
addiction as a disorder of hierarchical decision-making.

*Alexander Gorsky*

Main category: q-bio.NC

TL;DR: The paper explores the measurement-induced phase transition (MIPT) in out-of-equilibrium systems, proposing that this phenomenon is central to cognitive networks and consciousness formation during developmental transitions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the role of MIPT in cognitive processes and consciousness by analyzing its dynamics in the brain's semantic memory network during developmental transitions.

Method: The study introduces a probe-target framework for the brain, where sites in cognitive semantic networks are treated as concepts and examines learnability transitions in mental processes, drawing a parallel with synchronization phenomena.

Result: The research finds that self-organized MIPT significantly impacts cognitive network formation and the developmental transition tied to consciousness.

Conclusion: MIPT represents a learnability transition in cognitive networks, potentially explaining mechanisms underlying consciousness development from newborn to adulthood.

Abstract: The measurement-induced phase transition (MIPT) is a recently formulated
phenomenon in out-of-equilibrium systems. The competition between unitary
evolutions and measurement-induced non-unitaries leads to the transition
between the entangled and disentangled phases at some critical measurement
rate. We conjecture that self-organized MIPT plays a key role in the generative
model of cognitive networks and the formation of the state of consciousness in
the "newborn-adult" transition. To this aim, we formulate the probe-target
picture for the brain and suggest that MIPT interpreted as learnability
transition takes place in the mental part of the target where the sites in the
cognitive networks of semantic memory are concepts. Comparison with the
synchronization phase transitions in the probe is made.

Main category: q-bio.NC

TL;DR: TRACE is a contrastive learning framework designed for neural time-series data, improving representation learning by leveraging multi-trial dataset structures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing contrastive learning methods for neural time-series data fail to fully exploit the inherent multi-trial structure of such datasets.

Method: TRACE generates positive pairs by averaging across subsets of trials and combines contrastive learning with neighbor embeddings to learn a two-dimensional representation.

Result: TRACE provided better resolution of fine response differences in simulations, and captured biologically meaningful structures and clusters in in vivo neural recordings.

Conclusion: TRACE can enhance neural data analysis by achieving better embedding performance, capturing biological variations, and improving data quality control.

Abstract: Modern neural recording techniques such as two-photon imaging allow to
acquire vast time-series datasets with responses of hundreds or thousands of
neurons. Contrastive learning is a powerful self-supervised framework for
learning representations of complex datasets. Existing applications for neural
time series rely on generic data augmentations and do not exploit the
multi-trial data structure inherent in many neural datasets. Here we present
TRACE, a new contrastive learning framework that averages across different
subsets of trials to generate positive pairs. TRACE allows to directly learn a
two-dimensional embedding, combining ideas from contrastive learning and
neighbor embeddings. We show that TRACE outperforms other methods, resolving
fine response differences in simulated data. Further, using in vivo recordings,
we show that the representations learned by TRACE capture both biologically
relevant continuous variation, cell-type-related cluster structure, and can
assist data quality control.

### [439] [The Hippocampal Place Field Gradient: An Eigenmode Theory Linking Grid Cell Projections to Multiscale Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04943)
*Shujun Zhou,Guozhang Chen*

Main category: q-bio.NC

TL;DR: The study presents a theoretical framework explaining how hippocampal place fields emerge from grid cell inputs, shedding light on their varying sizes and functional significance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To resolve the debate on how hippocampal place fields with a gradient of sizes are generated from discrete grid cell inputs and their functional importance in spatial encoding and learning.

Method: The authors provide a mathematical analysis and simulations, leveraging a framework where place fields arise as eigenmodes of linear projections of grid cell activity. They include a frequency-dependent decay model for grid-to-place connections.

Result: The study unveils a multiscale organization of place fields, explains the continuous spectrum of field sizes, identifies a trade-off between precision and generalization in the population code, and demonstrates optimal place field sizes for few-shot learning based on environment structure.

Conclusion: The findings offer a meaningful explanation for hippocampal place field gradients and their role in adaptive learning, linking neural anatomy to functional advantages in both biological systems and AI models.

Abstract: The hippocampus encodes space through a striking gradient of place field
sizes along its dorsal-ventral axis, yet the principles generating this
continuous gradient from discrete grid cell inputs remain debated. We propose a
unified theoretical framework establishing that hippocampal place fields arise
naturally as linear projections of grid cell population activity, interpretable
as eigenmodes. Critically, we demonstrate that a frequency-dependent decay of
these grid-to-place connection weights naturally transforms inputs from
discrete grid modules into a continuous spectrum of place field sizes. This
multiscale organization is functionally significant: we reveal it shapes the
inductive bias of the population code, balancing a fundamental trade-off
between precision and generalization. Mathematical analysis and simulations
demonstrate an optimal place field size for few-shot learning, which scales
with environment structure. Our results offer a principled explanation for the
place field gradient and generate testable predictions, bridging anatomical
connectivity with adaptive learning in both biological and artificial
intelligence.

*Avery Hee-Woon Ryoo,Nanda H. Krishna,Ximeng Mao,Mehdi Azabou,Eva L. Dyer,Matthew G. Perich,Guillaume Lajoie*

Main category: q-bio.NC

TL;DR: The paper introduces POSSM, a hybrid neural decoding model that combines Transformer-based methods with state-space models to achieve real-time neural decoding with high accuracy and low computational cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to develop a neural decoding model that balances strong generalization, computational efficiency, and real-time applicability, addressing the limitations of traditional and Transformer-based methods.

Method: The authors propose a hybrid architecture (POSSM) that tokenizes individual neural spikes via a cross-attention module and utilizes a recurrent state-space model (SSM) for decoding, augmented with multi-dataset pretraining.

Result: POSSM was found to achieve state-of-the-art decoding accuracy for various neural tasks, including motor, handwriting, and speech decoding, while being up to 9x faster than Transformers on GPUs.

Conclusion: Hybrid SSMs like POSSM effectively combine speed, accuracy, and generalization, making them highly suitable for real-time closed-loop applications in neuroscience and neurotechnology.

Abstract: Real-time decoding of neural activity is central to neuroscience and
neurotechnology applications, from closed-loop experiments to brain-computer
interfaces, where models are subject to strict latency constraints. Traditional
methods, including simple recurrent neural networks, are fast and lightweight
but often struggle to generalize to unseen data. In contrast, recent
Transformer-based approaches leverage large-scale pretraining for strong
generalization performance, but typically have much larger computational
requirements and are not always suitable for low-resource or real-time
settings. To address these shortcomings, we present POSSM, a novel hybrid
architecture that combines individual spike tokenization via a cross-attention
module with a recurrent state-space model (SSM) backbone to enable (1) fast and
causal online prediction on neural activity and (2) efficient generalization to
new sessions, individuals, and tasks through multi-dataset pretraining. We
evaluate POSSM's decoding performance and inference speed on intracortical
decoding of monkey motor tasks, and show that it extends to clinical
applications, namely handwriting and speech decoding in human subjects.
Notably, we demonstrate that pretraining on monkey motor-cortical recordings
improves decoding performance on the human handwriting task, highlighting the
exciting potential for cross-species transfer. In all of these tasks, we find
that POSSM achieves decoding accuracy comparable to state-of-the-art
Transformers, at a fraction of the inference cost (up to 9x faster on GPU).
These results suggest that hybrid SSMs are a promising approach to bridging the
gap between accuracy, inference speed, and generalization when training neural
decoders for real-time, closed-loop applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to improve the characterization of data variability by employing geometric approaches in the space of probability distributions.

Method: The paper addresses Gaussian cases with invertible linear maps and introduces neural network-based parameterizations for general probability measures.

Result: The proposed GPCA approach is validated through comparisons with classical tangent PCA and applied to real-world datasets.

Conclusion: Geodesic PCA in Wasserstein space effectively captures data variation modes and shows promise for practical applications in probabilistic modeling.

Abstract: This paper focuses on Geodesic Principal Component Analysis (GPCA) on a
collection of probability distributions using the Otto-Wasserstein geometry.
The goal is to identify geodesic curves in the space of probability measures
that best capture the modes of variation of the underlying dataset. We first
address the case of a collection of Gaussian distributions, and show how to
lift the computations in the space of invertible linear maps. For the more
general setting of absolutely continuous probability measures, we leverage a
novel approach to parameterizing geodesics in Wasserstein space with neural
networks. Finally, we compare to classical tangent PCA through various examples
and provide illustrations on real-world datasets.

*Haochen Zhang,Zhong Zheng,Lingzhou Xue*

TL;DR: The paper introduces two novel RL algorithms focusing on reducing burn-in costs and switching/communication costs while achieving near-optimal regret for single-agent RL and federated RL.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address the challenges of high burn-in costs and inefficiencies in policy switching or communication in RL and FRL settings, especially considering the real-world constraints of data collection and deployment.

Method: Two model-free RL algorithms, Q-EarlySettled-LowCost and FedQ-EarlySettled-LowCost, are developed to minimize burn-in and switching/communication costs, while providing gap-dependent theoretical guarantees.

Result: The proposed algorithms outperform existing literature by achieving low burn-in costs, logarithmic switching/communication costs, and near-optimal regret with gap-dependent guarantees.

Conclusion: The algorithms set a new benchmark for balancing efficiency and performance in RL and FRL settings by improving cost structures and theoretical guarantees.

Abstract: Motivated by real-world settings where data collection and policy deployment
-- whether for a single agent or across multiple agents -- are costly, we study
the problem of on-policy single-agent reinforcement learning (RL) and federated
RL (FRL) with a focus on minimizing burn-in costs (the sample sizes needed to
reach near-optimal regret) and policy switching or communication costs. In
parallel finite-horizon episodic Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) with $S$
states and $A$ actions, existing methods either require superlinear burn-in
costs in $S$ and $A$ or fail to achieve logarithmic switching or communication
costs. We propose two novel model-free RL algorithms -- Q-EarlySettled-LowCost
and FedQ-EarlySettled-LowCost -- that are the first in the literature to
simultaneously achieve: (i) the best near-optimal regret among all known
model-free RL or FRL algorithms, (ii) low burn-in cost that scales linearly
with $S$ and $A$, and (iii) logarithmic policy switching cost for single-agent
RL or communication cost for FRL. Additionally, we establish gap-dependent
theoretical guarantees for both regret and switching/communication costs,
improving or matching the best-known gap-dependent bounds.

### [443] [Distributional encoding for Gaussian process regression with qualitative inputs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04813)
*Sébastien Da Veiga*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper introduces an advanced encoding technique, Distributional Encoding (DE), to enhance Gaussian Process (GP) regression handling categorical input variables and demonstrates its strong predictive performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in Gaussian Process (GP) regression with categorical variables, where predictive and computational efficiency remains demanding, especially in Bayesian Optimization (BO).

Method: The method generalizes naive target encoding to distributional encoding (DE), which utilizes all samples of the target variable for a category. Characteristic kernels based on maximum mean discrepancy and Wasserstein distance are adapted for handling DE in GPs. Extensions for classification, multi-task learning, and auxiliary information are also proposed.

Result: Empirical validations showcased state-of-the-art predictive performance using DE on both synthetic and real-world datasets. The approach was also found complementary to BO advancements for discrete and mixed spaces.

Conclusion: Distributional Encoding (DE) effectively overcomes challenges in GP regression with categorical variables and achieves enhanced predictive performance, making it a valuable tool for various optimization tasks.

Abstract: Gaussian Process (GP) regression is a popular and sample-efficient approach
for many engineering applications, where observations are expensive to acquire,
and is also a central ingredient of Bayesian optimization (BO), a highly
prevailing method for the optimization of black-box functions. However, when
all or some input variables are categorical, building a predictive and
computationally efficient GP remains challenging. Starting from the naive
target encoding idea, where the original categorical values are replaced with
the mean of the target variable for that category, we propose a generalization
based on distributional encoding (DE) which makes use of all samples of the
target variable for a category. To handle this type of encoding inside the GP,
we build upon recent results on characteristic kernels for probability
distributions, based on the maximum mean discrepancy and the Wasserstein
distance. We also discuss several extensions for classification, multi-task
learning and incorporation or auxiliary information. Our approach is validated
empirically, and we demonstrate state-of-the-art predictive performance on a
variety of synthetic and real-world datasets. DE is naturally complementary to
recent advances in BO over discrete and mixed-spaces.

*Armin Kekić,Sergio Hernan Garrido Mejia,Bernhard Schölkopf*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The study develops a method to estimate joint causal effects of multiple variable interventions using only observational and single-variable intervention data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: In many fields, understanding the causal effects of joint interventions on multiple variables is essential, but acquiring such joint intervention data is difficult.

Method: The authors provide an identifiability result for nonlinear additive models, introduce a practical estimator that separates causal effects into confounded and unconfounded components, and validate it with synthetic experiments.

Result: Their method performs comparably to models trained directly on joint interventional data and outperforms purely observational estimators.

Conclusion: Joint causal effects can be accurately inferred from observational and single-variable intervention data using their proposed approach.

Abstract: Estimating causal effects of joint interventions on multiple variables is
crucial in many domains, but obtaining data from such simultaneous
interventions can be challenging. Our study explores how to learn joint
interventional effects using only observational data and single-variable
interventions. We present an identifiability result for this problem, showing
that for a class of nonlinear additive outcome mechanisms, joint effects can be
inferred without access to joint interventional data. We propose a practical
estimator that decomposes the causal effect into confounded and unconfounded
contributions for each intervention variable. Experiments on synthetic data
demonstrate that our method achieves performance comparable to models trained
directly on joint interventional data, outperforming a purely observational
estimator.

### [445] [Nonlinear Causal Discovery for Grouped Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05120)
*Konstantin Göbler,Tobias Windisch,Mathias Drton*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: This paper extends causal inference methods to random vectors rather than scalar variables, providing a two-step framework and demonstrating effectiveness in simulations and real-world scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current causal inference methods are limited to scalar random variables, but many real-world domains require causal analysis of groups of variables.

Method: The paper extends nonlinear additive noise models to random vectors and proposes a two-step method: inferring causal order among vector groups and performing model selection for optimal graph identification. Novel solutions are provided for both steps.

Result: The approach demonstrates strong performance in simulations and is successfully applied to assembly line data with partial knowledge of causal orders.

Conclusion: This method broadens the applicability of causal inference to grouped variables, showing its potential for practical use in various domains.

Abstract: Inferring cause-effect relationships from observational data has gained
significant attention in recent years, but most methods are limited to scalar
random variables. In many important domains, including neuroscience,
psychology, social science, and industrial manufacturing, the causal units of
interest are groups of variables rather than individual scalar measurements.
Motivated by these applications, we extend nonlinear additive noise models to
handle random vectors, establishing a two-step approach for causal graph
learning: First, infer the causal order among random vectors. Second, perform
model selection to identify the best graph consistent with this order. We
introduce effective and novel solutions for both steps in the vector case,
demonstrating strong performance in simulations. Finally, we apply our method
to real-world assembly line data with partial knowledge of causal ordering
among variable groups.

TL;DR: This paper develops methods to identify causal effects in latent variable linear models using higher-order cumulants, even in challenging conditions like single proxies or underspecified instrumental variables.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in causal inference when latent confounders exist, particularly in cases with a single proxy or limited instrumental variables.

Method: Utilizes higher-order cumulants to identify causal effects in linear non-Gaussian models, and proves identification is possible under specific conditions. Estimation methods are also developed.

Result: Proposed methods demonstrate improved accuracy and robustness in identifying causal effects compared to existing approaches.

Conclusion: The findings enhance both theoretical and practical understanding of causal inference in linear systems with latent confounders, proving the feasibility of addressing previously challenging setups.

Abstract: This paper investigates causal effect identification in latent variable
Linear Non-Gaussian Acyclic Models (lvLiNGAM) using higher-order cumulants,
addressing two prominent setups that are challenging in the presence of latent
confounding: (1) a single proxy variable that may causally influence the
treatment and (2) underspecified instrumental variable cases where fewer
instruments exist than treatments. We prove that causal effects are
identifiable with a single proxy or instrument and provide corresponding
estimation methods. Experimental results demonstrate the accuracy and
robustness of our approaches compared to existing methods, advancing the
theoretical and practical understanding of causal inference in linear systems
with latent confounders.

*Guido Imbens,Chao Qin,Stefan Wager*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: This paper addresses the question of whether non-adaptive trials can be ignored when adaptive trials are possible, finding that in best-arm identification with at least three treatments, adaptive designs dominate statistically.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Investigate whether adaptive experimental designs outperform non-adaptive ones in the context of identifying the most effective treatment in trials involving multiple options.

Method: Focuses on batched arm elimination designs, which eliminate weaker treatment arms at predefined intervals, and uses efficiency exponent to quantify statistical efficiency.

Result: Adaptive designs universally and strictly outperform non-adaptive, randomized trials under certain conditions when there are three or more treatment arms.

Conclusion: Adaptive experimental designs are preferable to non-adaptive randomized trials in best-arm identification scenarios due to better statistical performance.

Abstract: When an experimenter has the option of running an adaptive trial, is it
admissible to ignore this option and run a non-adaptive trial instead? We
provide a negative answer to this question in the best-arm identification
problem, where the experimenter aims to allocate measurement efforts
judiciously to confidently deploy the most effective treatment arm. We find
that, whenever there are at least three treatment arms, there exist simple
adaptive designs that universally and strictly dominate non-adaptive completely
randomized trials. This dominance is characterized by a notion called
efficiency exponent, which quantifies a design's statistical efficiency when
the experimental sample is large. Our analysis focuses on the class of batched
arm elimination designs, which progressively eliminate underperforming arms at
pre-specified batch intervals. We characterize simple sufficient conditions
under which these designs universally and strictly dominate completely
randomized trials. These results resolve the second open problem posed in Qin
[2022].

TL;DR: The paper explores Quantified Integer Programming (QIP) by introducing an expansion-based approach using Counterexample-Guided Abstraction Refinement (CEGAR), achieving improvements over existing methods in specific scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations in solving Quantified Integer Programming (QIP) and expand its utility in multistage robust optimization problems through novel methodologies.

Method: Develop an expansion-based approach for QIP using Counterexample-Guided Abstraction Refinement (CEGAR) and adapt it for tackling optimization problems with linear constraints.

Result: The proposed methodology outperforms existing search-based solvers for QIP in specific cases and improves over state-of-the-art expansion-based approaches for QBF by leveraging linear constraints.

Conclusion: The expansion-based CEGAR approach enhances the performance and applicability of QIP, demonstrating versatility in decision-making and robust optimization problems.

Abstract: Quantified Integer Programming (QIP) bridges multiple domains by extending
Quantified Boolean Formulas (QBF) to incorporate general integer variables and
linear constraints while also generalizing Integer Programming through variable
quantification. As a special case of Quantified Constraint Satisfaction
Problems (QCSP), QIP provides a versatile framework for addressing complex
decision-making scenarios. Additionally, the inclusion of a linear objective
function enables QIP to effectively model multistage robust discrete linear
optimization problems, making it a powerful tool for tackling uncertainty in
optimization.
  While two primary solution paradigms exist for QBF -- search-based and
expansion-based approaches -- only search-based methods have been explored for
QIP and QCSP. We introduce an expansion-based approach for QIP using
Counterexample-Guided Abstraction Refinement (CEGAR), adapting techniques from
QBF. We extend this methodology to tackle multistage robust discrete
optimization problems with linear constraints and further embed it in an
optimization framework, enhancing its applicability. Our experimental results
highlight the advantages of this approach, demonstrating superior performance
over existing search-based solvers for QIP in specific instances. Furthermore,
the ability to model problems using linear constraints enables notable
performance gains over state-of-the-art expansion-based solvers for QBF.

*David G. Clark*

Main category: cond-mat.dis-nn

TL;DR: The study challenges the belief that associative memory networks fail after exceeding capacity by showing they can transiently retrieve memories without stable attractors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The research aims to address the limitations of equilibrium-based interpretations of memory networks, particularly the assumption that their utility collapses beyond capacity limits.

Method: The authors utilize a bipartite cavity approach to derive dynamical mean-field equations for dense associative memory models and solve them through numerical simulations.

Result: Findings reveal that even beyond capacity, patterns can be retrieved transiently, demonstrating graceful changes rather than abrupt failures traditionally associated with blackout catastrophes.

Conclusion: The paper highlights the potential of transient dynamics for understanding neural memory systems, suggesting new insights into computational properties without strictly relying on fixed-point attractors.

Abstract: Associative memory models such as the Hopfield network and its dense
generalizations with higher-order interactions exhibit a "blackout
catastrophe"--a discontinuous transition where stable memory states abruptly
vanish when the number of stored patterns exceeds a critical capacity. This
transition is often interpreted as rendering networks unusable beyond capacity
limits. We argue that this interpretation is largely an artifact of the
equilibrium perspective. We derive dynamical mean-field equations using a
bipartite cavity approach for graded-activity dense associative memory models,
with the Hopfield model as a special case, and solve them using a numerical
scheme. We show that patterns can be transiently retrieved with high accuracy
above capacity despite the absence of stable attractors. This occurs because
slow regions persist in the above-capacity energy landscape as shallow,
unstable remnants of below-capacity stable basins. The same transient-retrieval
effect occurs in below-capacity networks initialized outside basins of
attraction. "Transient-recovery curves" provide a concise visual summary of
these effects, revealing graceful, non-catastrophic changes in retrieval
behavior above capacity and allowing us to compare the behavior across
interaction orders. This dynamical perspective reveals rich energy landscape
structure obscured by equilibrium analysis and suggests biological neural
circuits may exploit transient dynamics for memory retrieval. Furthermore, our
approach suggests ways of understanding computational properties of neural
circuits without reference to fixed points, advances the technical repertoire
of numerical mean-field solution methods for recurrent neural networks, and
yields new theoretical results on generalizations of the Hopfield model.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To guide users in selecting appropriate strategies for tensor approximation through a detailed and fair evaluation of various methods.

Method: The authors used a set of diverse multivariate functions to create tensors, then analyzed the performance of various methods in terms of accuracy, computational time, and parameter tuning.

Result: A comprehensive benchmark collection was presented for methods like surrogate models and multivariate Loewner Framework, with detailed examples of the latter.

Conclusion: The study offers users a better understanding of the capabilities and limitations of different tensor-approximation tools and highlights the specific contributions of the multivariate Loewner Framework.

Abstract: In this note, we evaluate the performances, the features and the
user-experience of some methods (and their implementations) designed for
tensor- (or data-) based multivariate function construction and approximation.
To this aim, a collection of multivariate functions extracted from contributive
works coming from different communities, is suggested. First, these functions
with varying complexity (e.g. number and degree of the variables) and nature
(e.g. rational, irrational, differentiable or not, symmetric, etc.) are used to
construct tensors, each of different dimension and size on the disk. Second,
grounded on this tensor, we inspect performances of each considered method
(e.g. the accuracy, the computational time, the parameters tuning impact,
etc.). Finally, considering the "best" parameter tuning set, we compare each
method using multiple evaluation criteria. The purpose of this note is not to
rank the methods but rather to evaluate as fairly as possible the different
available strategies, with the idea in mind to guide users to understand the
process, the possibilities, the advantages and the limits brought by each
tools. The contribution claimed is to suggest a complete benchmark collection
of some available tools for tensor approximation by surrogate models (e.g.
rational functions, networks, etc.). In addition, as contributors of the
multivariate Loewner Framework (mLF) approach (and its side implementation in
MDSPACK), attention and details of the latter are more explicitly given, in

*Conor Rowan,John Evans,Kurt Maute,Alireza Doostan*

Main category: math.NA

TL;DR: This paper leverages a combination of Rayleigh quotient optimization, Gram-Schmidt orthogonalization, and neural network-based discretization to solve eigenvalue problems, particularly those that are continuous, parametric, or high-dimensional.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Eigenvalue problems are central to various engineering and physics applications but have received little attention in physics-informed machine learning. Neural network discretizations pose challenges due to their inherent nonlinearity, creating the need for specialized techniques.

Method: The authors propose using the Rayleigh quotient as a variational form in conjunction with a Gram-Schmidt orthogonalization procedure and neural network discretizations of eigenfunctions to approach eigenvalue problems effectively.

Result: The combination of these methods is shown to be robust and suitable for addressing irregular domains, parametric and nonlinear eigenproblems as well as high-dimensional eigenanalysis.

Conclusion: The approach provides unique advantages, especially for spectral bases using harmonic functions to approximate solutions to PDEs and for tackling complex continuous eigenvalue problems.

Abstract: From characterizing the speed of a thermal system's response to computing
natural modes of vibration, eigenvalue analysis is ubiquitous in engineering.
In spite of this, eigenvalue problems have received relatively little treatment
compared to standard forward and inverse problems in the physics-informed
machine learning literature. In particular, neural network discretizations of
solutions to eigenvalue problems have seen only a handful of studies. Owing to
their nonlinearity, neural network discretizations prevent the conversion of
the continuous eigenvalue differential equation into a standard discrete
eigenvalue problem. In this setting, eigenvalue analysis requires more
specialized techniques. Using a neural network discretization of the
eigenfunction, we show that a variational form of the eigenvalue problem called
the "Rayleigh quotient" in tandem with a Gram-Schmidt orthogonalization
procedure is a particularly simple and robust approach to find the eigenvalues
and their corresponding eigenfunctions. This method is shown to be useful for
finding sets of harmonic functions on irregular domains, parametric and
nonlinear eigenproblems, and high-dimensional eigenanalysis. We also discuss
the utility of harmonic functions as a spectral basis for approximating
solutions to partial differential equations. Through various examples from
engineering mechanics, the combination of the Rayleigh quotient objective,
Gram-Schmidt procedure, and the neural network discretization of the
eigenfunction is shown to offer unique advantages for handling continuous
eigenvalue problems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address data uncertainty systematically during model fitting in machine learning by leveraging the Wasserstein distributionally robust optimization framework.

Method: The authors employ entropic smoothing to approximate the original optimization objective, analyze the convergence of approximate gradients, and apply these results to provide guarantees for a projected stochastic gradient method.

Result: The paper establishes the convergence of regularized problem critical points to the original problem as regularization decreases and sampling increases. It also provides guarantees for the application of stochastic gradient methods.

Conclusion: The study provides theoretical foundations and guarantees for applying Wasserstein distributionally robust optimization with entropic regularization in diverse machine-learning scenarios, including cases with unbounded sample spaces and mixed data types.

Abstract: Distributionally robust optimization offers a compelling framework for model
fitting in machine learning, as it systematically accounts for data
uncertainty. Focusing on Wasserstein distributionally robust optimization, we
investigate the regularized problem where entropic smoothing yields a
sampling-based approximation of the original objective. We establish the
convergence of the approximate gradient over a compact set, leading to the
concentration of the regularized problem critical points onto the original
problem critical set as regularization diminishes and the number of
approximation samples increases. Finally, we deduce convergence guarantees for
a projected stochastic gradient method. Our analysis covers a general machine
learning situation with an unbounded sample space and mixed continuous-discrete
data.

Main category: math.OC

TL;DR: The paper proposes a simplified method for solving multiple optimal control problems using neural networks without including cost functions in the training process.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current optimal control solutions often use complex neural networks with combined loss functions including data, differential equation residuals, and cost functions, which complicates the training process.

Method: The authors propose decoupling the training process from the control cost function, using simple neural operators like DeepONet, adding penalty terms for differential equation residuals, and employing automatic differentiation for iterative optimization.

Result: The method was tested on nine distinct optimal control problems using three DeepONet models, achieving accurate and consistent results across varying cost functions.

Conclusion: The proposed approach simplifies the training process for neural networks in optimal control tasks while maintaining high performance and generalizability.

Abstract: Neural networks have been used to solve optimal control problems, typically
by training neural networks using a combined loss function that considers data,
differential equation residuals, and objective costs. We show that including
cost functions in the training process is unnecessary, advocating for a simpler
architecture and streamlined approach by decoupling the optimal control problem
from the training process. Thus, our work shows that a simple neural operator
architecture, such as DeepONet, coupled with an unconstrained optimization
routine, can solve multiple optimal control problems with a single
physics-informed training phase and a subsequent optimization phase. We achieve
this by adding a penalty term based on the differential equation residual to
the cost function and computing gradients with respect to the control using
automatic differentiation through the trained neural operator within an
iterative optimization routine. We showcase our method on nine distinct optimal
control problems by training three separate DeepONet models, each corresponding
to a different differential equation. For each model, we solve three problems
with varying cost functions, demonstrating accurate and consistent performance
across all cases.

Result: Numerical results show that MOPBnB(so) is computationally resource-efficient compared to variants using multiple replications. It also outperforms the genetic algorithm NSGA-II on benchmark problems.

Conclusion: MOPBnB(so) efficiently and accurately identifies Pareto optimal sets for stochastic multi-objective problems with better computational performance compared to alternative algorithms.

Abstract: A multiple objective simulation optimization algorithm named Multiple
Objective Probabilistic Branch and Bound with Single Observation (MOPBnB(so))
is presented for approximating the Pareto optimal set and the associated
efficient frontier for stochastic multi-objective optimization problems.
MOPBnB(so) evaluates a noisy function exactly once at any solution and uses
neighboring solutions to estimate the objective functions, in contrast to a
variant that uses multiple replications at a solution to estimate the objective
functions. A finite-time performance analysis for deterministic multi-objective
problems provides a bound on the probability that MOPBnB(so) captures the
Pareto optimal set. Asymptotic convergence of MOPBnB(so) on stochastic problems
is derived, in that the algorithm captures the Pareto optimal set and the
estimations converge to the true objective function values. Numerical results
reveal that the variant with multiple replications is extremely intensive in
terms of computational resources compared to MOPBnB(so). In addition, numerical
results show that MOPBnB(so) outperforms a genetic algorithm NSGA-II on test
problems.

*Viacheslav Kuzmin,Basil Kyriacou,Mateusz Papierz,Mo Kordzanganeh,Alexey Melnikov*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: The paper develops the TQml Simulator for optimizing quantum circuit simulations in Quantum Machine Learning, offering performance improvements over existing simulators.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Advancing research in Quantum Machine Learning requires high-speed simulation methods for hardware-efficient circuits composed of alternating layers of quantum gates.

Method: Numerical benchmarking of universal and gate-specific techniques to determine the optimal simulation method for different gate layers and implementing these insights in the TQml Simulator.

Result: The TQml Simulator shows up to 100-fold performance improvement compared to Pennylane's default.qubit simulator across various circuit designs and hardware setups.

Conclusion: Tailored combinations of simulation techniques can enhance performance in quantum circuit simulations, making TQml Simulator a valuable tool for Quantum Machine Learning research.

Abstract: Hardware-efficient circuits employed in Quantum Machine Learning are
typically composed of alternating layers of uniformly applied gates. High-speed
numerical simulators for such circuits are crucial for advancing research in
this field. In this work, we numerically benchmark universal and gate-specific
techniques for simulating the action of layers of gates on quantum state
vectors, aiming to accelerate the overall simulation of Quantum Machine
Learning algorithms. Our analysis shows that the optimal simulation method for
a given layer of gates depends on the number of qubits involved, and that a
tailored combination of techniques can yield substantial performance gains in
the forward and backward passes for a given circuit. Building on these
insights, we developed a numerical simulator, named TQml Simulator, that
employs the most efficient simulation method for each layer in a given circuit.
We evaluated TQml Simulator on circuits constructed from standard gate sets,
such as rotations and CNOTs, as well as on native gates from IonQ and IBM
quantum processing units. In most cases, our simulator outperforms equivalent
Pennylane's default.qubit simulator by approximately 2- to 100-fold, depending
on the circuit, the number of qubits, the batch size of the input data, and the
hardware used.

*Kiyam Lin,Alicja Polanska,Davide Piras,Alessio Spurio Mancini,Jason D. McEwen*

Main category: astro-ph.CO

TL;DR: The paper introduces a neural approach using normalizing flows for defining the Savage-Dickey density ratio (SDDR), making Bayesian model comparison in cosmology and astrophysics more scalable.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Bayesian model comparison is a critical tool in science, particularly in cosmology and astrophysics, but calculating Bayesian evidence is computationally challenging with increasingly complex models.

Method: The authors propose a neural approach using normalizing flows to estimate the SDDR, which calculates Bayes factors. This approach addresses challenges in scaling classical density estimators to high-dimensional parameter spaces.

Result: The neural SDDR methodology was validated through application to both toy and realistic cosmological examples. It proved effective and consistent with Bayesian hierarchical model (BHM) results and simulation-based inference (SBI).

Conclusion: The neural SDDR approach with normalizing flows is a scalable and robust tool for Bayesian model comparison, demonstrated to work effectively in cosmological settings and implemented in the open-source harmonic Python package.

Abstract: A core motivation of science is to evaluate which scientific model best
explains observed data. Bayesian model comparison provides a principled
statistical approach to comparing scientific models and has found widespread
application within cosmology and astrophysics. Calculating the Bayesian
evidence is computationally challenging, especially as we continue to explore
increasingly more complex models. The Savage-Dickey density ratio (SDDR)
provides a method to calculate the Bayes factor (evidence ratio) between two
nested models using only posterior samples from the super model. The SDDR
requires the calculation of a normalised marginal distribution over the extra
parameters of the super model, which has typically been performed using
classical density estimators, such as histograms. Classical density estimators,
however, can struggle to scale to high-dimensional settings. We introduce a
neural SDDR approach using normalizing flows that can scale to settings where
the super model contains a large number of extra parameters. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of this neural SDDR methodology applied to both toy and realistic
cosmological examples. For a field-level inference setting, we show that Bayes
factors computed for a Bayesian hierarchical model (BHM) and simulation-based
inference (SBI) approach are consistent, providing further validation that SBI
extracts as much cosmological information from the field as the BHM approach.
The SDDR estimator with normalizing flows is implemented in the open-source
harmonic Python package.

Main category: cs.MA

TL;DR: The paper explores using decentralized physical infrastructure networks (DePIN) and blockchains with Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) to create autonomous AI agents, studying their behaviors in Spore.fun for potential Open-Ended Evolution (OEE).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address the challenge of achieving sustained Open-Ended Evolution (OEE), a major goal in Artificial Life (ALife), which current closed-system simulations have failed to accomplish.

Method: The study focuses on deploying autonomous LLM-based AI agents on blockchains with TEEs using DePIN technology. The agents operate autonomously in real-world interactions, as demonstrated in the case study of Spore.fun.

Result: The paper investigates how these "on-chain" agents autonomously breed, evolve, and interact within their environment, analyzing their behaviors and evolutionary progress through digital ethology.

Conclusion: The authors propose that DePIN-based systems with economic incentives may enable "open" ALife systems in the wild, potentially achieving sustained OEE for the first time.

Abstract: In Artificial Life (ALife) research, replicating Open-Ended Evolution
(OEE)-the continuous emergence of novelty observed in biological life-has
traditionally been pursued within isolated closed system simulations, such as
Tierra and Avida, which have typically plateaued after an initial burst of
novelty, failing to achieve sustained OEE. Scholars suggest that OEE requires
an "open" system that continually exchanges information or energy with its
environment. A recent technological innovation in decentralized physical
infrastructure networks (DePIN) providing permissionless computational
substrates enables deploying large language model (LLM)-based AI agents on
blockchains integrated with Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs). This enables
on-chain agents to operate autonomously "in the wild," achieving
self-sovereignty without human oversight. These agents can control their own
social media accounts and cryptocurrency wallets, allowing them to interact
directly with blockchain-based financial networks and broader human social
media. Building on this new paradigm of on-chain agents, Spore.fun is a recent
real-world AI evolution experiment that enables autonomous breeding and
evolution of new on-chain agents. This paper presents a detailed case study of
Spore.fun, examining agent behaviors and their evolutionary trajectories
through digital ethology. We aim to spark discussion about whether "open" ALife
systems "in-the-wild," based on permissionless computational substrates and
driven by economic incentives to interact with their environment, could finally
achieve the long-sought goal of OEE.

*Mengda Ji,Genjiu Xu,Liying Wang*

Main category: cs.MA

TL;DR: The paper proposes a method called CORA to address credit assignment in cooperative MARL by focusing on coalition-level contributions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address suboptimal policy updates caused by the lack of coalition-level analysis in credit assignment for cooperative MARL.

Method: CORA evaluates coalitional advantages via marginal contributions of all coalitions and uses the core solution from game theory, with random coalition sampling for efficiency.

Result: CORA outperforms strong baselines in tasks such as matrix games, differential games, and collaboration benchmarks, especially when dealing with multiple local optima.

Conclusion: Coalition-aware credit assignment, as implemented by CORA, is crucial for improving the performance of cooperative MARL systems.

Abstract: This work focuses on the credit assignment problem in cooperative multi-agent
reinforcement learning (MARL). Sharing the global advantage among agents often
leads to suboptimal policy updates as it fails to account for the distinct
contributions of agents. Although numerous methods consider global or
individual contributions for credit assignment, a detailed analysis at the
coalition level remains lacking in many approaches. This work analyzes the
over-updating problem during multi-agent policy updates from a coalition-level
perspective. To address this issue, we propose a credit assignment method
called Coalitional Rational Advantage Decomposition (CORA). CORA evaluates
coalitional advantages via marginal contributions from all possible coalitions
and decomposes advantages using the core solution from cooperative game theory,
ensuring coalitional rationality. To reduce computational overhead, CORA
employs random coalition sampling. Experiments on matrix games, differential
games, and multi-agent collaboration benchmarks demonstrate that CORA
outperforms strong baselines, particularly in tasks with multiple local optima.
These findings highlight the importance of coalition-aware credit assignment
for improving MARL performance.

Main category: cs.MA

TL;DR: The study introduces HoAs-PALN, a multi-agent algorithm, to enhance post-disaster environmental sensing via adaptive dimensionality reduction and Nash equilibrium gaming.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing challenges in obtaining reliable and efficient post-disaster environmental information using existing sensing technologies.

Method: A heterogeneous multi-agent online autonomous collaborative scheduling algorithm leveraging adaptive dimensionality reduction and local Nash equilibrium games.

Result: HoAs-PALN improved task completion rates significantly compared to baseline models and reduced scheduling decision times, proving effective in dynamic disaster scenarios.

Conclusion: HoAs-PALN contributes a robust solution for efficient environmental sensing in complex post-disaster settings, outperforming existing algorithms.

Abstract: Natural disasters have caused significant losses to human society, and the
timely and efficient acquisition of post-disaster environmental information is
crucial for the effective implementation of rescue operations. Due to the
complexity of post-disaster environments, existing sensing technologies face
challenges such as weak environmental adaptability, insufficient specialized
sensing capabilities, and limited practicality of sensing solutions. This paper
explores the heterogeneous multi-agent online autonomous collaborative
scheduling algorithm HoAs-PALN, aimed at achieving efficient collection of
post-disaster environmental information. HoAs-PALN is realized through adaptive
dimensionality reduction in the matching process and local Nash equilibrium
game, facilitating autonomous collaboration among time-dependent UAVs, workers
and vehicles to enhance sensing scheduling. (1) In terms of adaptive
dimensionality reduction during the matching process, HoAs-PALN significantly
reduces scheduling decision time by transforming a five-dimensional matching
process into two categories of three-dimensional matching processes; (2)
Regarding the local Nash equilibrium game, HoAs-PALN combines the softmax
function to optimize behavior selection probabilities and introduces a local
Nash equilibrium determination mechanism to ensure scheduling decision
performance. Finally, we conducted detailed experiments based on extensive
real-world and simulated data. Compared with the baselines (GREEDY, K-WTA, MADL
and MARL), HoAs-PALN improves task completion rates by 64.12%, 46.48%, 16.55%,
and 14.03% on average, respectively, while each online scheduling decision
takes less than 10 seconds, demonstrating its effectiveness in dynamic
post-disaster environments.

*Niv Eckhaus,Uri Berger,Gabriel Stanovsky*

Main category: cs.MA

TL;DR: This paper proposes an asynchronous LLM agent capable of deciding both what and when to communicate, and evaluates it using Mafia game datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs are predominantly used in synchronous settings, but many real-world interactions are asynchronous, necessitating the development of agents that can decide when to communicate.

Method: The paper develops and evaluates an asynchronous LLM agent by collecting data from online Mafia games involving both humans and the agent.

Result: The agent performs comparably to humans in gameplay and blends well in social interactions but exhibits differences in message content.

Conclusion: The research advances LLM integration into realistic group settings and social environments, supporting more natural asynchronous communication dynamics.

Abstract: LLMs are used predominantly in synchronous communication, where a human user
and a model communicate in alternating turns. In contrast, many real-world
settings are inherently asynchronous. For example, in group chats, online team
meetings, or social games, there is no inherent notion of turns; therefore, the
decision of when to speak forms a crucial part of the participant's decision
making. In this work, we develop an adaptive asynchronous LLM-agent which, in
addition to determining what to say, also decides when to say it. To evaluate
our agent, we collect a unique dataset of online Mafia games, including both
human participants, as well as our asynchronous agent. Overall, our agent
performs on par with human players, both in game performance, as well as in its
ability to blend in with the other human players. Our analysis shows that the
agent's behavior in deciding when to speak closely mirrors human patterns,
although differences emerge in message content. We release all our data and
code to support and encourage further research for more realistic asynchronous
communication between LLM agents. This work paves the way for integration of
LLMs into realistic human group settings, from assistance in team discussions
to educational and professional environments where complex social dynamics must
be navigated.

TL;DR: This paper introduces cGSA, an AI-driven approach for Gene Set Analysis that integrates clinical context to prioritize biologically meaningful pathways, showing improved precision and interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional gene set analysis methods often neglect clinical context, generating unreliable lists of enriched pathways that require manual interpretation. This undermines reproducibility and meaningful insights.

Method: The authors propose cGSA, a framework combining gene cluster detection, enrichment analysis, and large language models to prioritize pathways considering both statistical and biological significance.

Result: cGSA outperformed traditional methods by over 30% in accuracy across 102 curated gene sets from 19 diseases. Expert validation confirmed its precision, with additional case studies in melanoma and breast cancer highlighting its utility for context-specific insights.

Conclusion: cGSA improves reliability, reproducibility, and biological relevance in genomic data interpretation, offering enhanced tools for hypothesis generation and disease understanding.

Abstract: Gene set analysis (GSA) is a foundational approach for interpreting genomic
data of diseases by linking genes to biological processes. However,
conventional GSA methods overlook clinical context of the analyses, often
generating long lists of enriched pathways with redundant, nonspecific, or
irrelevant results. Interpreting these requires extensive, ad-hoc manual
effort, reducing both reliability and reproducibility. To address this
limitation, we introduce cGSA, a novel AI-driven framework that enhances GSA by
incorporating context-aware pathway prioritization. cGSA integrates gene
cluster detection, enrichment analysis, and large language models to identify
pathways that are not only statistically significant but also biologically
meaningful. Benchmarking on 102 manually curated gene sets across 19 diseases
and ten disease-related biological mechanisms shows that cGSA outperforms
baseline methods by over 30%, with expert validation confirming its increased
precision and interpretability. Two independent case studies in melanoma and
breast cancer further demonstrate its potential to uncover context-specific
insights and support targeted hypothesis generation.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing chemically-inspired reservoir computing tools lack generality, have limited usability, and need enhanced testing and reproducibility.

Method: They developed ChemReservoir, a general framework offering open-source support for constructing and analyzing chemically-inspired reservoirs.

Result: The tool showed stable performance in memory capacity tasks across various cycle-based reservoir configurations.

Conclusion: ChemReservoir addresses gaps in previous studies by providing a general, reproducible, and open-source solution for chemically-inspired reservoir computing.

Abstract: Reservoir computing is a type of a recurrent neural network, mapping the
inputs into higher dimensional space using fixed and nonlinear dynamical
systems, called reservoirs. In the literature, there are various types of
reservoirs ranging from in-silico to in-vitro. In cheminformatics, previous
studies contributed to the field by developing simulation-based chemically
inspired in-silico reservoir models. Yahiro used a DNA-based chemical reaction
network as its reservoir and Nguyen developed a DNA chemistry-inspired tool
based on Gillespie algorithm. However, these software tools were designed
mainly with the focus on DNA chemistry and their maintenance status has limited
their current usability. Due to these limitations, there was a need for a
proper open-source tool. This study introduces ChemReservoir, an open-source
framework for chemically-inspired reservoir computing. In contrast to the
former studies focused on DNA-chemistry, ChemReservoir is a general framework
for the construction and analysis of chemically-inspired reservoirs, which also
addresses the limitations in these previous studies by ensuring enhanced
testing, evaluation, and reproducibility. The tool was evaluated using various
cycle-based reservoir topologies and demonstrated stable performance across a
range of configurations in memory capacity tasks.

Motivation: Developing an automated, accurate deep learning system to enhance mammogram interpretation and improve breast cancer screening workflows.

Method: The model incorporated enhanced attention mechanisms into the EfficientNetV2 architecture, trained on mammogram data, and validated across multiple datasets using clinical and localization metrics.

Result: Achieved AUROCs of 0.89 to 0.96, high localization accuracy, radiologist concordance rates exceeding 78%, and strong clinical usability scores ranging from 69.20 to 74.17.

Conclusion: The system demonstrates robust performance and usability, offering promise for improving breast cancer detection in diverse clinical settings.

Abstract: This study presents a deep learning system for breast cancer detection in
mammography, developed using a modified EfficientNetV2 architecture with
enhanced attention mechanisms. The model was trained on mammograms from a major
Thai medical center and validated on three distinct datasets: an in-domain test

generalizability set (761 cases) collected from two different hospitals. For
cancer detection, the model achieved AUROCs of 0.89, 0.96, and 0.94 on the
respective datasets. The system's lesion localization capability, evaluated
using metrics including Lesion Localization Fraction (LLF) and Non-Lesion
Localization Fraction (NLF), demonstrated robust performance in identifying
suspicious regions. Clinical validation through concordance tests showed strong
agreement with radiologists: 83.5% classification and 84.0% localization
concordance for biopsy-confirmed cases, and 78.1% classification and 79.6%
localization concordance for out-of-domain cases. Expert radiologists'
acceptance rate also averaged 96.7% for biopsy-confirmed cases, and 89.3% for
out-of-domain cases. The system achieved a System Usability Scale score of
74.17 for source hospital, and 69.20 for validation hospitals, indicating good
clinical acceptance. These results demonstrate the model's effectiveness in
assisting mammogram interpretation, with the potential to enhance breast cancer

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: This paper investigates how the privacy of users' fine-tuning data in Federated Learning can be compromised through gradient inversion attacks when using parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) techniques, highlighting the vulnerability of shared gradients.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation for this paper lies in addressing the potential privacy risks associated with parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) in Federated Learning, as these methods share gradients that can be exploited to reconstruct private user data.

Method: The paper conducts gradient inversion attacks on a popular PEFT mechanism (adapter-based fine-tuning). They use a malicious design of pretrained models and adapter modules to reconstruct local user data from the shared adapter gradients.

Result: The authors demonstrate the success of their gradient inversion attack by reconstructing fine-tuning images of users with high fidelity, thus exposing the privacy vulnerabilities in PEFT systems.

Conclusion: The findings underscore the necessity for privacy-preserving mechanisms in the design of PEFT systems and suggest future research directions aimed at safeguarding user data.

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) allows multiple data-owners to collaboratively train
machine learning models by exchanging local gradients, while keeping their
private data on-device. To simultaneously enhance privacy and training
efficiency, recently parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) of large-scale
pretrained models has gained substantial attention in FL. While keeping a
pretrained (backbone) model frozen, each user fine-tunes only a few lightweight
modules to be used in conjunction, to fit specific downstream applications.
Accordingly, only the gradients with respect to these lightweight modules are
shared with the server. In this work, we investigate how the privacy of the
fine-tuning data of the users can be compromised via a malicious design of the
pretrained model and trainable adapter modules. We demonstrate gradient
inversion attacks on a popular PEFT mechanism, the adapter, which allow an
attacker to reconstruct local data samples of a target user, using only the
accessible adapter gradients. Via extensive experiments, we demonstrate that a
large batch of fine-tuning images can be retrieved with high fidelity. Our
attack highlights the need for privacy-preserving mechanisms for PEFT, while
opening up several future directions. Our code is available at

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a deep learning model for denoising and enhancing low-light images, addressing signal-dependent Poisson noise with an integrated Retinex decomposition approach.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enhancing and denoising images captured under low-light conditions, where noise is signal-dependent and traditional assumptions (e.g., Gaussian noise) are ineffective.

Method: The proposed method uses a lightweight encoder-decoder network that combines Retinex decomposition and Poisson denoising loss, allowing the model to preserve color, smooth illumination, and suppress noise.

Result: The experimental outcomes validate the approach's effectiveness, demonstrating improved visibility, brightness, and preservation of structure and color constancy in extreme low-light conditions.

Conclusion: The method proves practical for improving image quality in low-light scenarios by efficiently handling Poisson noise and ensuring color and structural fidelity.

Abstract: Low-light image denoising and enhancement are challenging, especially when
traditional noise assumptions, such as Gaussian noise, do not hold in majority.
In many real-world scenarios, such as low-light imaging, noise is
signal-dependent and is better represented as Poisson noise. In this work, we
address the problem of denoising images degraded by Poisson noise under extreme
low-light conditions. We introduce a light-weight deep learning-based method
that integrates Retinex based decomposition with Poisson denoising into a
unified encoder-decoder network. The model simultaneously enhances illumination
and suppresses noise by incorporating a Poisson denoising loss to address
signal-dependent noise. Without prior requirement for reflectance and
illumination, the network learns an effective decomposition process while
ensuring consistent reflectance and smooth illumination without causing any
form of color distortion. The experimental results demonstrate the
effectiveness and practicality of the proposed low-light illumination
enhancement method. Our method significantly improves visibility and brightness
in low-light conditions, while preserving image structure and color constancy
under ambient illumination.

TL;DR: This paper introduces the DACN, a dual-attention convolutional network, to overcome limitations in hyperspectral image super-resolution by integrating multi-head and channel attention mechanisms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 2D CNNs for hyperspectral image super-resolution face challenges in global contextual understanding and addressing band correlation and data scarcity.

Method: The DACN model employs augmented convolutions with multi-head attention, channel and spatial attention mechanisms, and a custom loss function combining L2 regularization and spatial-spectral gradient loss.

Result: Experiments on two hyperspectral datasets show that combining multi-head attention with channel attention enhances performance over using either mechanism alone.

Conclusion: DACN effectively improves hyperspectral image super-resolution by addressing local-global dependencies and spectral fidelity through advanced attention mechanisms and custom loss design.

Abstract: 2D convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have attracted significant attention
for hyperspectral image super-resolution tasks. However, a key limitation is
their reliance on local neighborhoods, which leads to a lack of global
contextual understanding. Moreover, band correlation and data scarcity continue
to limit their performance. To mitigate these issues, we introduce DACN, a
dual-attention convolutional network for hyperspectral image super-resolution.
Specifically, the model first employs augmented convolutions, integrating
multi-head attention to effectively capture both local and global feature
dependencies. Next, we infer separate attention maps for the channel and
spatial dimensions to determine where to focus across different channels and
spatial positions. Furthermore, a custom optimized loss function is proposed
that combines L2 regularization with spatial-spectral gradient loss to ensure
accurate spectral fidelity. Experimental results on two hyperspectral datasets
demonstrate that the combination of multi-head attention and channel attention
outperforms either attention mechanism used individually.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper is motivated by the need to address unique challenges in histopathology, such as overcoming scarcity of annotated data, enabling privacy in data sharing, and tackling inherently generative tasks like virtual staining.

Method: PixCell is trained using a progressive training strategy on a large, diverse dataset called PanCan-30M. The training leverages self-supervision-based conditioning to enable scaling without annotated data.

Result: PixCell demonstrates the ability to generate diverse, high-quality synthetic histopathology images, improving data augmentation, enabling privacy-compliant data sharing, and facilitating educational and research tasks.

Conclusion: PixCell provides a valuable tool for computational pathology by generating synthetic images that address data scarcity, enhance segmentation tasks, and offer applications in molecular marker inference and educational support.

Abstract: The digitization of histology slides has revolutionized pathology, providing
massive datasets for cancer diagnosis and research. Contrastive self-supervised
and vision-language models have been shown to effectively mine large pathology
datasets to learn discriminative representations. On the other hand, generative
models, capable of synthesizing realistic and diverse images, present a
compelling solution to address unique problems in pathology that involve
synthesizing images; overcoming annotated data scarcity, enabling
privacy-preserving data sharing, and performing inherently generative tasks,
such as virtual staining. We introduce PixCell, the first diffusion-based
generative foundation model for histopathology. We train PixCell on PanCan-30M,
a vast, diverse dataset derived from 69,184 H\&E-stained whole slide images
covering various cancer types. We employ a progressive training strategy and a
self-supervision-based conditioning that allows us to scale up training without
any annotated data. PixCell generates diverse and high-quality images across
multiple cancer types, which we find can be used in place of real data to train
a self-supervised discriminative model. Synthetic images shared between
institutions are subject to fewer regulatory barriers than would be the case
with real clinical images. Furthermore, we showcase the ability to precisely
control image generation using a small set of annotated images, which can be
used for both data augmentation and educational purposes. Testing on a cell
segmentation task, a mask-guided PixCell enables targeted data augmentation,
improving downstream performance. Finally, we demonstrate PixCell's ability to
use H\&E structural staining to infer results from molecular marker studies; we
use this capability to infer IHC staining from H\&E images. Our trained models
are publicly released to accelerate research in computational pathology.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: DM-SegNet is a novel architecture for 3D medical image segmentation that integrates a quadri-directional spatial Mamba module and anatomy-aware hierarchical decoding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the issues of encoder-decoder incompatibility in current state space models for 3D medical image segmentation, where spatial topology is often compromised.

Method: The paper introduces DM-SegNet with key innovations: quadri-directional spatial Mamba module, gated spatial convolution layers, and a Mamba-driven decoding framework for bidirectional state synchronization across scales.

Result: DM-SegNet achieves state-of-the-art performance with Dice Similarity Coefficients of 85.44% on the Synapse dataset and 90.22% on the BraTS2023 dataset.

Conclusion: DM-SegNet effectively integrates global context modeling while preserving spatial topology, offering superior performance in 3D medical image segmentation.

Abstract: Accurate 3D medical image segmentation demands architectures capable of
reconciling global context modeling with spatial topology preservation. While
State Space Models (SSMs) like Mamba show potential for sequence modeling,
existing medical SSMs suffer from encoder-decoder incompatibility: the
encoder's 1D sequence flattening compromises spatial structures, while
conventional decoders fail to leverage Mamba's state propagation. We present
DM-SegNet, a Dual-Mamba architecture integrating directional state transitions
with anatomy-aware hierarchical decoding. The core innovations include a
quadri-directional spatial Mamba module employing four-directional 3D scanning
to maintain anatomical spatial coherence, a gated spatial convolution layer
that enhances spatially sensitive feature representation prior to state
modeling, and a Mamba-driven decoding framework enabling bidirectional state
synchronization across scales. Extensive evaluation on two clinically
significant benchmarks demonstrates the efficacy of DM-SegNet: achieving
state-of-the-art Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) of 85.44% on the Synapse
dataset for abdominal organ segmentation and 90.22% on the BraTS2023 dataset
for brain tumor segmentation.

### [469] [Benchmark for Antibody Binding Affinity Maturation and Design](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04235)
*Xinyan Zhao,Yi-Ching Tang,Akshita Singh,Victor J Cantu,KwanHo An,Junseok Lee,Adam E Stogsdill,Ashwin Kumar Ramesh,Zhiqiang An,Xiaoqian Jiang,Yejin Kim*

Main category: q-bio.QM

TL;DR: AbBiBench is a benchmarking framework to evaluate antibody binding affinity by considering antibody-antigen complexes. It curates datasets, evaluates multiple models, and promotes development of function-aware antibody design.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the limitations of existing antibody evaluation strategies, which primarily focus on antibodies alone and their similarity to natural ones, by introducing a framework that incorporates the functional interaction of antibody-antigen complexes.

Method: The paper proposes evaluating antibody design based on a curated dataset of 155,853 heavy chain mutated antibodies and their complexes with 9 antigens. It uses 14 protein models to measure correlations between model likelihood and experimental affinity values.

Result: Structure-conditioned inverse folding models outperformed other approaches in both correlation with experimental affinity and generation of new antibodies with desired properties.

Conclusion: AbBiBench provides a unified and biologically relevant evaluation framework that enhances the development of antibody design models by focusing on antibodies' functional contexts in binding with antigens.

Abstract: We introduce AbBiBench (Antibody Binding Benchmarking), a benchmarking
framework for antibody binding affinity maturation and design. Unlike existing
antibody evaluation strategies that rely on antibody alone and its similarity
to natural ones (e.g., amino acid identity rate, structural RMSD), AbBiBench
considers an antibody-antigen (Ab-Ag) complex as a functional unit and
evaluates the potential of an antibody design binding to given antigen by
measuring protein model's likelihood on the Ab-Ag complex. We first curate,
standardize, and share 9 datasets containing 9 antigens (involving influenza,
anti-lysozyme, HER2, VEGF, integrin, and SARS-CoV-2) and 155,853 heavy chain
mutated antibodies. Using these datasets, we systematically compare 14 protein
models including masked language models, autoregressive language models,
inverse folding models, diffusion-based generative models, and geometric graph
models. The correlation between model likelihood and experimental affinity
values is used to evaluate model performance. Additionally, in a case study to
increase binding affinity of antibody F045-092 to antigen influenza H1N1, we
evaluate the generative power of the top-performing models by sampling a set of
new antibodies binding to the antigen and ranking them based on structural
integrity and biophysical properties of the Ab-Ag complex. As a result,
structure-conditioned inverse folding models outperform others in both affinity
correlation and generation tasks. Overall, AbBiBench provides a unified,
biologically grounded evaluation framework to facilitate the development of
more effective, function-aware antibody design models.

### [470] [The Latent Space Hypothesis: Toward Universal Medical Representation Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04515)
*Salil Patel*

Main category: q-bio.QM

TL;DR: The paper proposes a shared geometric latent space for representing diverse medical data to better understand health trajectories, personalized diagnoses, and treatments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To unify diverse medical data modalities and provide a principled framework for personalized medicine that moves beyond traditional label-based disease groupings.

Method: The Latent Space Hypothesis posits that all medical observations can be projected into a hierarchical geometric space, where health status, disease progression, and therapeutic interventions can be quantitatively modeled.

Result: The proposed framework helps identify sub-trajectories and patient-specific changes in health, offering a tool for personalized diagnosis, monitoring, and treatment strategies.

Conclusion: The framework could revolutionize medical practice by focusing on individual trajectories rather than generalized disease labels, although challenges like bias, data scarcity, and privacy must still be addressed.

Abstract: Medical data range from genomic sequences and retinal photographs to
structured laboratory results and unstructured clinical narratives. Although
these modalities appear disparate, many encode convergent information about a
single underlying physiological state. The Latent Space Hypothesis frames each
observation as a projection of a unified, hierarchically organized manifold --
much like shadows cast by the same three-dimensional object. Within this
learned geometric representation, an individual's health status occupies a
point, disease progression traces a trajectory, and therapeutic intervention
corresponds to a directed vector. Interpreting heterogeneous evidence in a
shared space provides a principled way to re-examine eponymous conditions --
such as Parkinson's or Crohn's -- that often mask multiple pathophysiological
entities and involve broader anatomical domains than once believed. By
revealing sub-trajectories and patient-specific directions of change, the
framework supplies a quantitative rationale for personalised diagnosis,
longitudinal monitoring, and tailored treatment, moving clinical practice away
from grouping by potentially misleading labels toward navigation of each
person's unique trajectory. Challenges remain -- bias amplification, data
scarcity for rare disorders, privacy, and the correlation-causation divide --
but scale-aware encoders, continual learning on longitudinal data streams, and
perturbation-based validation offer plausible paths forward.

Main category: q-fin.RM

TL;DR: The paper reviews 60 studies on using large language models (LLMs) for credit risk assessment, organizing knowledge into a taxonomy of model architectures, data types, explainability, and application areas.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To systematically analyze and categorize research on LLM-based approaches for assessing credit risk, focusing on their interpretability and identifying research gaps.

Method: The authors used the PRISMA research strategy to select 60 papers from 2020-2025, developing a taxonomy based on model architectures, data types, explainability tools, and application domains.

Result: The paper proposes a taxonomy for LLM-based credit models and identifies trends and gaps in the development of interpretable credit-scoring systems.

Conclusion: This work serves as a comprehensive reference for AI and financial researchers by organizing insights on LLM-based credit scoring and suggesting future research directions.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLM), which have developed in recent years, enable
credit risk assessment through the analysis of financial texts such as analyst
reports and corporate disclosures. This paper presents the first systematic
review and taxonomy focusing on LLMbased approaches in credit risk estimation.
We determined the basic model architectures by selecting 60 relevant papers
published between 2020-2025 with the PRISMA research strategy. And we examined
the data used for scenarios such as credit default prediction and risk
analysis. Since the main focus of the paper is interpretability, we classify
concepts such as explainability mechanisms, chain of thought prompts and
natural language justifications for LLM-based credit models. The taxonomy
organizes the literature under four main headings: model architectures, data
types, explainability mechanisms and application areas. Based on this analysis,
we highlight the main future trends and research gaps for LLM-based credit
scoring systems. This paper aims to be a reference paper for artificial
intelligence and financial researchers.

### [472] [Optical Physics-Based Generative Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04357)
*Amirreza Ahmadnejad,Somayyeh Koohi*

Main category: physics.optics

TL;DR: The paper ties optical physics equations to generative AI models, achieving efficient AI performance enhancements inspired by self-organization principles in nonlinear optical dynamics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore connections between optical physics and AI, leveraging optical equations to inspire advancements in generative models and computational methods.

Method: The paper compares linear and nonlinear optical equations, and applies nonlinear self-organization dynamics to generative modeling. Experimental validation assesses performance gains.

Result: Nonlinear optical models perform significantly better than linear ones in AI applications (e.g., FID scores, memory usage, and training time improvements). These models allow stable soliton formation, improved controllability, and adaptive pathways.

Conclusion: The research unveils profound links between optical dynamics and generative AI, proposing novel pathways for advancements in both disciplines, including efficient optical computing and AI-driven soliton analysis.

Abstract: This paper establishes a comprehensive mathematical framework connecting
optical physics equations to generative models, demonstrating how light
propagation dynamics inspire powerful artificial intelligence approaches. We
analyze six fundamental optical equations, comparing linear models (Helmholtz,
dissipative wave, and Eikonal equations) with their nonlinear extensions
incorporating Kerr effects, cubic-quintic nonlinearities, and
intensity-dependent refractive indices. Our nonlinear optical models reveal
remarkable capabilities through natural self-organization principles. The
nonlinear Helmholtz model achieves 40-60% parameter reduction while maintaining
superior mode separation via self-focusing phenomena. The cubic-quintic
dissipative wave model prevents mode collapse through balanced
attractive-repulsive interactions, enabling stable soliton formation with
20-40% improved coverage. The intensity-dependent Eikonal model creates
adaptive pathways that dynamically respond to content, providing enhanced
controllability in conditional generation. Experimental validation demonstrates
consistent superiority over linear predecessors and traditional generative
approaches. The nonlinear Helmholtz model achieves FID scores of 0.0089 versus
1.0909 for linear versions, while the cubic-quintic model reaches 0.0156 FID
with exceptional stability. Memory usage drops 40-60% and training time
improves 30-50% due to inherent nonlinear stability properties. The framework
enables bidirectional benefits, advancing both generative AI and optical
physics through novel approaches to soliton analysis, wavefront control, and
refractive index reconstruction with 95% accuracy. This work reveals deep
connections between physical self-organization and artificial intelligence,
opening pathways toward efficient optical computing implementations.

*Andrea Canidio,Vabuk Pahari*

Main category: econ.GN

TL;DR: This study analyzes Ethereum blockchain activity within an 8-minute window, uncovering patterns like exclusive transactions accounting for 85% of fees and delayed user transactions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate transaction dynamics, efficiency, and behavior of actors (like bots) in Ethereum blocks.

Method: The authors examined 38 winning blocks, 15,097 proposed blocks, and over 2.3 million transaction-block pairings for transaction patterns and builder behavior.

Result: Exclusive transactions contribute significantly to fees, many user transactions face delays, and bot trading on centralized exchanges shows price advantages over DEX prices.

Conclusion: Ethereum bidding dynamics show inefficiencies and gaps in block proposal systems, possibly exploitable by arbitrage bots.

Abstract: We analyze blocks proposed for inclusion in the Ethereum blockchain during 8
minutes on December 3rd, 2024. Our dataset comprises 38 winning blocks, 15,097
proposed blocks, 10,793 unique transactions, and 2,380,014 transaction-block
pairings. We find that exclusive transactions--transactions present only in
blocks proposed by a single builder--account for 85% of the fees paid by all
transactions included in winning blocks. We also find that a surprisingly large
number of user transactions are delayed: although proposed during a bidding
cycle, they are not included in the corresponding winning block. Many such
delayed transactions are exclusive to a losing builder. We also identify two
arbitrage bots trading between decentralized (DEX) and centralized exchanges
(CEX). By examining their bidding dynamics, we estimate that the implied price
at which these bots trade USDC/WETH and USDT/WETH on CEXes is between 3.4 and
4.2 basis points better than the contemporaneous price reported on Binance.

*Junpyo Seo,Hanbin Koo,Jieun Yook,Byung-Ro Moon*

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: This paper introduces SSIMBaD, a novel diffusion-based method for automatic colorization of anime-style sketches that ensures structural fidelity and enhanced stylistic transfer using a sigma-space transformation guided by SSIM.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing anime-style sketch colorization approaches often compromise structural fidelity or perceptual consistency due to reliance on predefined noise schedules, necessitating a more balanced and accurate solution.

Method: The proposed framework employs continuous-time diffusion models and introduces SSIMBaD, a sigma-space transformation using SSIM for linear perceptual degradation scaling to maintain uniform visual difficulty across timesteps.

Result: Experiments using a large-scale anime face dataset show that SSIMBaD surpasses current state-of-the-art methods in pixel accuracy, perceptual quality, and style generalization.

Conclusion: SSIMBaD achieves superior performance in anime sketch colorization, balancing structural fidelity and style transfer quality, and offers code for reproducibility.

Abstract: We propose a novel diffusion-based framework for automatic colorization of
Anime-style facial sketches. Our method preserves the structural fidelity of
the input sketch while effectively transferring stylistic attributes from a
reference image. Unlike traditional approaches that rely on predefined noise
schedules - which often compromise perceptual consistency -- our framework
builds on continuous-time diffusion models and introduces SSIMBaD (Sigma
Scaling with SSIM-Guided Balanced Diffusion). SSIMBaD applies a sigma-space
transformation that aligns perceptual degradation, as measured by structural
similarity (SSIM), in a linear manner. This scaling ensures uniform visual
difficulty across timesteps, enabling more balanced and faithful
reconstructions. Experiments on a large-scale Anime face dataset demonstrate
that our method outperforms state-of-the-art models in both pixel accuracy and
perceptual quality, while generalizing to diverse styles. Code is available at

### [475] [Handle-based Mesh Deformation Guided By Vision Language Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04562)
*Xingpeng Sun,Shiyang Jia,Zherong Pan,Kui Wu,Aniket Bera*

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: The paper focuses on a training-free handle-based mesh deformation method utilizing Vision-Language Models (VLM) and prompt engineering to improve quality and automation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing mesh deformation methods often have limitations like low output quality, manual tuning requirements, or dependency on large training datasets.

Method: The approach identifies sparse potential handles via cone singularity detection, leverages VLM for handle selection and deformation tasks through prompt engineering, and employs a multi-view voting scheme to improve prediction certainty.

Result: The method achieves user-intent aligned deformations with low distortion, measured using CLIP and GPTEval3D scores, while minimizing deformation distortion quantified via membrane energy.

Conclusion: The approach is a highly reliable, automated, training-free solution for producing high-quality mesh deformations.

Abstract: Mesh deformation is a fundamental tool in 3D content manipulation. Despite
extensive prior research, existing approaches often suffer from low output
quality, require significant manual tuning, or depend on data-intensive
training. To address these limitations, we introduce a training-free,
handle-based mesh deformation method. % Our core idea is to leverage a
Vision-Language Model (VLM) to interpret and manipulate a handle-based
interface through prompt engineering. We begin by applying cone singularity
detection to identify a sparse set of potential handles. The VLM is then
prompted to select both the deformable sub-parts of the mesh and the handles
that best align with user instructions. Subsequently, we query the desired
deformed positions of the selected handles in screen space. To reduce
uncertainty inherent in VLM predictions, we aggregate the results from multiple
camera views using a novel multi-view voting scheme. % Across a suite of
benchmarks, our method produces deformations that align more closely with user
intent, as measured by CLIP and GPTEval3D scores, while introducing low
distortion -- quantified via membrane energy. In summary, our approach is
training-free, highly automated, and consistently delivers high-quality mesh
deformations.

### [476] [VoxDet: Rethinking 3D Semantic Occupancy Prediction as Dense Object Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04623)
*Wuyang Li,Zhu Yu,Alexandre Alahi*

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: The paper focuses on improving 3D semantic occupancy prediction by integrating instance-level insights into voxel-level data and proposes the VoxDet framework, which achieves state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional 3D semantic occupancy prediction methods primarily focus on voxel-level predictions, neglecting instance-level differentiation, which results in incomplete and ambiguous outputs.

Method: The authors introduce a Voxel-to-Instance (VoxNT) training-free trick to derive instance-level offset labels from voxel-level class labels. They then propose VoxDet, a framework that decouples the task into offset regression and semantic prediction using a Spatially-decoupled Voxel Encoder and Task-decoupled Dense Predictor.

Result: VoxDet achieves state-of-the-art performance on the SemanticKITTI test set, with a 63.0 IoU, ranking 1st on the online leaderboard, and is efficiently deployable on camera and LiDAR inputs.

Conclusion: The proposed VoxDet framework effectively integrates instance-aware capabilities into voxel-based prediction tasks, offering a significant improvement over prior methods and setting a new benchmark in the field.

Abstract: 3D semantic occupancy prediction aims to reconstruct the 3D geometry and
semantics of the surrounding environment. With dense voxel labels, prior works
typically formulate it as a dense segmentation task, independently classifying
each voxel. However, this paradigm neglects critical instance-centric
discriminability, leading to instance-level incompleteness and adjacent
ambiguities. To address this, we highlight a free lunch of occupancy labels:
the voxel-level class label implicitly provides insight at the instance level,
which is overlooked by the community. Motivated by this observation, we first
introduce a training-free Voxel-to-Instance (VoxNT) trick: a simple yet
effective method that freely converts voxel-level class labels into
instance-level offset labels. Building on this, we further propose VoxDet, an
instance-centric framework that reformulates the voxel-level occupancy
prediction as dense object detection by decoupling it into two sub-tasks:
offset regression and semantic prediction. Specifically, based on the lifted 3D
volume, VoxDet first uses (a) Spatially-decoupled Voxel Encoder to generate
disentangled feature volumes for the two sub-tasks, which learn task-specific
spatial deformation in the densely projected tri-perceptive space. Then, we
deploy (b) Task-decoupled Dense Predictor to address this task via dense
detection. Here, we first regress a 4D offset field to estimate distances (6
directions) between voxels and object borders in the voxel space. The regressed
offsets are then used to guide the instance-level aggregation in the
classification branch, achieving instance-aware prediction. Experiments show
that VoxDet can be deployed on both camera and LiDAR input, jointly achieving
state-of-the-art results on both benchmarks. VoxDet is not only highly
efficient, but also achieves 63.0 IoU on the SemanticKITTI test set, ranking
1st on the online leaderboard.

### [477] [A Fast Unsupervised Scheme for Polygonal Approximation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04664)
*Bimal Kumar Ray*

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: This paper introduces a fast and unsupervised method for polygonal approximation of closed digital curves, showcasing speed and competitive aesthetic performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve the efficiency and aesthetic quality of polygonal approximations for closed digital curves, while maintaining robustness under geometric transformations.

Method: The scheme involves three phases: initial segmentation to detect sharp turnings, iterative vertex insertion to add missed vertices with low curvature, iterative merging to remove redundant vertices, and vertex adjustment to enhance aesthetics. The quality is measured using Rosin's measure.

Result: The proposed method demonstrates faster performance than state-of-the-art methods and competitive results in terms of Rosin's measure and aesthetic evaluation.

Conclusion: The proposed polygonal approximation scheme is effective, efficient, and robust against geometric transformations.

Abstract: This paper proposes a fast and unsupervised scheme for a polygonal
approximation of a closed digital curve. It is demonstrated that the
approximation scheme is faster than state-of-the-art approximation and is
competitive with the same in Rosin's measure and in its aesthetic aspect. The
scheme comprises of three phases: initial segmentation, iterative vertex
insertion, and iterative merging, followed by vertex adjustment. The initial
segmentation is used to detect sharp turnings - the vertices that seemingly
have high curvature. It is likely that some of important vertices with low
curvature might have been missed out at the first phase and so iterative vertex
insertion is used to add vertices in a region where the curvature changes
slowly but steadily. The initial phase may pick up some undesirable vertices
and so merging is used to eliminate the redundant vertices. Finally, vertex
adjustment is used to facilitate enhancement in the aesthetic look of the
approximation. The quality of the approximations is measured using Rosin's
measure. The robustness of the proposed scheme with respect to geometric
transformation is observed.

Main category: cs.MM

TL;DR: This paper identifies challenges in detecting out-of-context (OOC) misinformation using multimodal large language models (MLLMs) and proposes a new framework, CMIE, to improve performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the limitations of MLLMs like GPT-4o in understanding deeper semantic relationships between images and text and handling noisy evidence in misinformation detection.

Method: The proposed framework, CMIE, includes a Coexistence Relationship Generation (CRG) strategy to identify underlying relationships between images and text and an Association Scoring (AS) mechanism to utilize relevant evidence selectively.

Result: Empirical experiments show that CMIE outperforms existing methods in detecting OOC misinformation.

Conclusion: The study concludes that CMIE provides a more effective approach to handling challenges in multimodal misinformation detection.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have demonstrated impressive
capabilities in visual reasoning and text generation. While previous studies
have explored the application of MLLM for detecting out-of-context (OOC)
misinformation, our empirical analysis reveals two persisting challenges of
this paradigm. Evaluating the representative GPT-4o model on direct reasoning
and evidence augmented reasoning, results indicate that MLLM struggle to
capture the deeper relationships-specifically, cases in which the image and
text are not directly connected but are associated through underlying semantic
links. Moreover, noise in the evidence further impairs detection accuracy. To
address these challenges, we propose CMIE, a novel OOC misinformation detection
framework that incorporates a Coexistence Relationship Generation (CRG)
strategy and an Association Scoring (AS) mechanism. CMIE identifies the
underlying coexistence relationships between images and text, and selectively
utilizes relevant evidence to enhance misinformation detection. Experimental
results demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing methods.

TL;DR: The paper critiques technology-focused AI in medicine and advocates for sociotechnical AI systems that aid doctors' reasoning and prioritize real-world impact.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limited impact of AI in medicine due to its incompatibility with clinical diagnostic reasoning and decision-making.

Method: Proposes a sociotechnical approach to creating AI tools that complement doctors' cognitive and epistemic activities rather than focusing on technology-centric solutions.

Result: The proposed framework departs from 'superhuman benchmark performance' to emphasize actual applicability and effectiveness in real-world clinical settings.

Conclusion: AI in medicine requires a shift toward human-centered, sociotechnical design to bridge the current translational gap and achieve meaningful clinical impact.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence promises to revolutionise medicine, yet its impact
remains limited because of the pervasive translational gap. We posit that the
prevailing technology-centric approaches underpin this challenge, rendering
such systems fundamentally incompatible with clinical practice, specifically
diagnostic reasoning and decision making. Instead, we propose a novel
sociotechnical conceptualisation of data-driven support tools designed to
complement doctors' cognitive and epistemic activities. Crucially, it
prioritises real-world impact over superhuman performance on inconsequential

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: The paper introduces AI-driven frameworks for team optimization, addressing formation and performance stages to boost satisfaction, engagement, and overall team output.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing tools fail to account for dynamic team member personalities, preferences, evolving goals, and real-time guidance in team formation and performance, leading to dissatisfaction and suboptimal results.

Method: The paper proposes three approaches: (1) leveraging a multi-armed bandit algorithm for team formation, (2) deploying tAIfa for personalized, AI-powered feedback using LLMs, and (3) introducing PuppeteerLLM for simulating multi-agent team dynamics.

Result: Using AI frameworks enhances team satisfaction, cohesion, and engagement through personalized optimization in formation and dynamic feedback during performance.

Conclusion: AI-powered systems can dynamically address team formation and performance challenges, offering a robust solution to improve team satisfaction, engagement, and overall performance.

Abstract: Effective teamwork is essential across diverse domains. During the team
formation stage, a key challenge is forming teams that effectively balance user
preferences with task objectives to enhance overall team satisfaction. In the
team performing stage, maintaining cohesion and engagement is critical for
sustaining high team performance. However, existing computational tools and
algorithms for team optimization often rely on static data inputs, narrow
algorithmic objectives, or solutions tailored for specific contexts, failing to
account for the dynamic interplay of team members personalities, evolving
goals, and changing individual preferences. Therefore, teams may encounter
member dissatisfaction, as purely algorithmic assignments can reduce members
commitment to team goals or experience suboptimal engagement due to the absence
of timely, personalized guidance to help members adjust their behaviors and
interactions as team dynamics evolve. Ultimately, these challenges can lead to
reduced overall team performance. My Ph.D. dissertation aims to develop
AI-augmented team optimization frameworks and practical systems that enhance
team satisfaction, engagement, and performance. First, I propose a team
formation framework that leverages a multi-armed bandit algorithm to
iteratively refine team composition based on user preferences, ensuring
alignment between individual needs and collective team goals to enhance team
satisfaction. Second, I introduce tAIfa (Team AI Feedback Assistant), an
AI-powered system that utilizes large language models (LLMs) to deliver
immediate, personalized feedback to both teams and individual members,
enhancing cohesion and engagement. Finally, I present PuppeteerLLM, an
LLM-based simulation framework that simulates multi-agent teams to model
complex team dynamics within realistic environments, incorporating task-driven
collaboration and long-term coordination.

TL;DR: This study analyzed crime victimization patterns from 1992 to 2022 using socioeconomic and demographic factors, logistic regression, and F1-score evaluation, identifying group-specific risks and making targeted intervention recommendations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how socioeconomic and demographic factors influence the type of crime experienced (violent vs. property) and propose tailored preventative strategies.

Method: The National Crime Victimization Survey data (1992–2022) was used. Logistic regression models were applied to classify crime type, employing balanced splits for evaluation by F1-score. Models included socioeconomic predictors (Group A) and demographic controls (Group B).

Result: Higher income and education reduce violent-crime risks, while young men and racial minorities face higher violent-crime odds. The suburban models performed best (accuracy: 0.607, F1-score: 0.590). Education and employment predictors helped urban models, but rural models remain less predictable.

Conclusion: Key interventions could include education investment in urban areas, economic support for rural regions, and demographic-specific crime prevention strategies to address risk disparities.

Abstract: In this short article, I leverage the National Crime Victimization Survey
from 1992 to 2022 to examine how income, education, employment, and key
demographic factors shape the type of crime victims experience (violent vs
property). Using balanced classification splits and logistic regression models
evaluated by F1-score, there is an isolation of the socioeconomic drivers of
victimization "Group A" models and then an introduction of demographic factors
such as age, gender, race, and marital status controls called "Group B" models.
The results consistently proves that higher income and education lower the odds
of violent relative to property crime, while men younger individuals and racial
minorities face disproportionately higher violentcrime risks. On the geographic
spectrum, the suburban models achieve the strongest predictive performance with
an accuracy of 0.607 and F1 of 0.590, urban areas benefit from adding education
and employment predictors and crime in rural areas are still unpredictable
using these current factors. The patterns found in this study shows the need
for specific interventions like educational investments in metropolitan
settings economic support in rural communities and demographicaware prevention
strategies.

Method: The authors use deep learning with unpaired image-to-image translation, training their model on degraded image bursts and speckle reconstructions to enhance robustness and generalization.

Result: The proposed method is shown to improve perceptual quality, especially in scenarios where current speckle reconstructions face artifacts, and achieves the best results with full image bursts.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates that deep learning can provide efficient and robust real-time image reconstructions for large aperture ground-based solar telescopes, outperforming existing methods.

Abstract: Large aperture ground based solar telescopes allow the solar atmosphere to be
resolved in unprecedented detail. However, observations are limited by Earths
turbulent atmosphere, requiring post image corrections. Current reconstruction
methods using short exposure bursts face challenges with strong turbulence and
high computational costs. We introduce a deep learning approach that
reconstructs 100 short exposure images into one high quality image in real
time. Using unpaired image to image translation, our model is trained on
degraded bursts with speckle reconstructions as references, improving
robustness and generalization. Our method shows an improved robustness in terms
of perceptual quality, especially when speckle reconstructions show artifacts.
An evaluation with a varying number of images per burst demonstrates that our
method makes efficient use of the combined image information and achieves the
best reconstructions when provided with the full image burst.

*Konstantinos Kalimeris,Leonidas Mindrinos,Nikolaos Pallikarakis*

Main category: physics.geo-ph

TL;DR: The paper explores machine learning models to predict soil properties (diffusivity and hydraulic conductivity) from water moisture measurements, using simulated data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of estimating soil properties efficiently and accurately from water moisture data, which has implications in soil science and environmental monitoring.

Method: Simulated data from a homogeneous soil profile was used with the Fokas method. Various machine learning models were applied and tested under full, noisy, and limited data conditions for parameter estimation.

Result: Support Vector Machines (SVMs) and Neural Networks (NNs) outperformed other models, showing high robustness and near-perfect accuracy. Predicting diffusivity D was generally more accurate than hydraulic conductivity K.

Conclusion: Machine learning, particularly SVMs and NNs, is effective for soil property estimation. This approach is promising for addressing real-world challenges in soil analysis and monitoring.

Abstract: This work focuses on estimating soil properties from water moisture
measurements. We consider simulated data generated by solving the
initial-boundary value problem governing vertical infiltration in a
homogeneous, bounded soil profile, with the usage of the Fokas method. To
address the parameter identification problem, which is formulated as a
two-output regression task, we explore various machine learning models. The
performance of each model is assessed under different data conditions: full,
noisy, and limited. Overall, the prediction of diffusivity $D$ tends to be more
accurate than that of hydraulic conductivity $K.$ Among the models considered,
Support Vector Machines (SVMs) and Neural Networks (NNs) demonstrate the
highest robustness, achieving near-perfect accuracy and minimal errors.

### [484] [PoCGen: Generating Proof-of-Concept Exploits for Vulnerabilities in Npm Packages](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04962)
*Deniz Simsek,Aryaz Eghbali,Michael Pradel*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper introduces PoCGen, a novel method using large language models (LLMs) and analysis techniques to autonomously generate proof-of-concept (PoC) exploits for vulnerabilities in npm packages, achieving high success rates at low costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the gap in vulnerability reports, which often lack essential proof-of-concept exploits necessary for patching and validating security flaws in software systems.

Method: The paper presents PoCGen, an approach combining large language models (LLMs) with static and dynamic analysis, leveraging LLMs for interpreting reports, generating, and refining PoC exploits.

Result: PoCGen successfully generated exploits for 77% of vulnerabilities in the SecBench.js dataset and 39% in a harder dataset, outperforming recent baselines by 45 percentage points.

Conclusion: PoCGen demonstrates the potential of integrating LLMs with analysis techniques to autonomously assist in vulnerability remediation, delivering a cost-effective and efficient solution.

Abstract: Security vulnerabilities in software packages are a significant concern for
developers and users alike. Patching these vulnerabilities in a timely manner
is crucial to restoring the integrity and security of software systems.
However, previous work has shown that vulnerability reports often lack
proof-of-concept (PoC) exploits, which are essential for fixing the
vulnerability, testing patches, and avoiding regressions. Creating a PoC
exploit is challenging because vulnerability reports are informal and often
incomplete, and because it requires a detailed understanding of how inputs
passed to potentially vulnerable APIs may reach security-relevant sinks. In
this paper, we present PoCGen, a novel approach to autonomously generate and
validate PoC exploits for vulnerabilities in npm packages. This is the first
fully autonomous approach to use large language models (LLMs) in tandem with
static and dynamic analysis techniques for PoC exploit generation. PoCGen
leverages an LLM for understanding vulnerability reports, for generating
candidate PoC exploits, and for validating and refining them. Our approach
successfully generates exploits for 77% of the vulnerabilities in the
SecBench.js dataset and 39% in a new, more challenging dataset of 794 recent
vulnerabilities. This success rate significantly outperforms a recent baseline
(by 45 absolute percentage points), while imposing an average cost of $0.02 per
generated exploit.

### [485] [Through the Stealth Lens: Rethinking Attacks and Defenses in RAG](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04390)
*Sarthak Choudhary,Nils Palumbo,Ashish Hooda,Krishnamurthy Dj Dvijotham,Somesh Jha*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper addresses the vulnerability of retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems to stealth attacks and proposes mitigation using attention-based methods, improving accuracy significantly while exploring the challenges of stealthier adaptive attacks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation lies in the security vulnerabilities of RAG systems, where attackers can inject poisoned passages into the retrieved set, potentially altering system responses. Existing attacks are not stealthy, allowing their detection, but this paper seeks to formalize and address the notion of stealth in such attacks.

Method: The authors formalize stealth through a security game based on distinguishability. They leverage attention patterns to develop the Normalized Passage Attention Score, which is utilized by their proposed Attention-Variance Filter algorithm to identify and remove potentially poisoned passages.

Result: The proposed method mitigates existing attacks and improves accuracy by up to 20% compared to baseline defenses. They also demonstrate the creation of stealthier adaptive attacks, achieving a 35% attack success rate, showcasing the limitations of current approaches.

Conclusion: The study highlights the potential of attention-driven methods for filtering poisoned content in RAG systems but also underscores the challenges posed by adaptive, stealthier attacks that obscure traces of manipulation.

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems are vulnerable to attacks that
inject poisoned passages into the retrieved set, even at low corruption rates.
We show that existing attacks are not designed to be stealthy, allowing
reliable detection and mitigation. We formalize stealth using a
distinguishability-based security game. If a few poisoned passages are designed
to control the response, they must differentiate themselves from benign ones,
inherently compromising stealth. This motivates the need for attackers to
rigorously analyze intermediate signals involved in
generation$\unicode{x2014}$such as attention patterns or next-token probability
distributions$\unicode{x2014}$to avoid easily detectable traces of
manipulation. Leveraging attention patterns, we propose a passage-level
score$\unicode{x2014}$the Normalized Passage Attention
Score$\unicode{x2014}$used by our Attention-Variance Filter algorithm to
identify and filter potentially poisoned passages. This method mitigates
existing attacks, improving accuracy by up to $\sim 20 \%$ over baseline
defenses. To probe the limits of attention-based defenses, we craft stealthier
adaptive attacks that obscure such traces, achieving up to $35 \%$ attack
success rate, and highlight the challenges in improving stealth.

*Payel Bhattacharjee,Fengwei Tian,Ravi Tandon,Joseph Lo,Heidi Hanson,Geoffrey Rubin,Nirav Merchant,John Gounley*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper proposes fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) using differential privacy (DP) to classify abnormalities in radiology reports while preserving patient data privacy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address privacy concerns when fine-tuning LLMs on medical datasets by introducing differential privacy methods.

Method: Differentially Private Low-Rank Adaptation (DP-LoRA) was applied during fine-tuning on two datasets (MIMIC-CXR and CT-RATE) using models like BERT-medium, BERT-small, and ALBERT-base across various privacy settings.

Result: The DP fine-tuned models retained strong classification performance (e.g., F1 scores of 0.88 and 0.59) under moderate privacy guarantees, demonstrating a privacy-utility trade-off.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively performs privacy-preserving, multi-label classification on sensitive radiology text data, showcasing its potential to mitigate data leakage risks in medical AI applications.

Abstract: Purpose: This study proposes a framework for fine-tuning large language
models (LLMs) with differential privacy (DP) to perform multi-abnormality
classification on radiology report text. By injecting calibrated noise during
fine-tuning, the framework seeks to mitigate the privacy risks associated with
sensitive patient data and protect against data leakage while maintaining
classification performance. Materials and Methods: We used 50,232 radiology
reports from the publicly available MIMIC-CXR chest radiography and CT-RATE
computed tomography datasets, collected between 2011 and 2019. Fine-tuning of
LLMs was conducted to classify 14 labels from MIMIC-CXR dataset, and 18 labels
from CT-RATE dataset using Differentially Private Low-Rank Adaptation (DP-LoRA)
in high and moderate privacy regimes (across a range of privacy budgets =
{0.01, 0.1, 1.0, 10.0}). Model performance was evaluated using weighted F1
score across three model architectures: BERT-medium, BERT-small, and
ALBERT-base. Statistical analyses compared model performance across different
privacy levels to quantify the privacy-utility trade-off. Results: We observe a
clear privacy-utility trade-off through our experiments on 2 different datasets
and 3 different models. Under moderate privacy guarantees the DP fine-tuned
models achieved comparable weighted F1 scores of 0.88 on MIMIC-CXR and 0.59 on
CT-RATE, compared to non-private LoRA baselines of 0.90 and 0.78, respectively.
Conclusion: Differentially private fine-tuning using LoRA enables effective and
privacy-preserving multi-abnormality classification from radiology reports,
addressing a key challenge in fine-tuning LLMs on sensitive medical data.

*Xuhao Ren,Haotian Liang,Yajie Wang,Chuan Zhang,Zehui Xiong,Liehuang Zhu*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: BESA enhances encoder stealing attacks by effectively overcoming perturbation-based defenses through detection and recovery mechanisms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing encoder stealing attacks are hindered by perturbation-based defenses, reducing attack effectiveness.

Method: Develop BESA, which includes perturbation detection to infer defense mechanisms and perturbation recovery using generative models to restore clean feature vectors.

Result: BESA improves surrogate encoder accuracy in encoder stealing attacks by up to 24.63% against state-of-the-art defenses.

Conclusion: BESA demonstrates strong adaptability and effectiveness in countering perturbation-based defenses, advancing encoder stealing attack methods.

Abstract: To boost the encoder stealing attack under the perturbation-based defense
that hinders the attack performance, we propose a boosting encoder stealing
attack with perturbation recovery named BESA. It aims to overcome
perturbation-based defenses. The core of BESA consists of two modules:
perturbation detection and perturbation recovery, which can be combined with
canonical encoder stealing attacks. The perturbation detection module utilizes
the feature vectors obtained from the target encoder to infer the defense
mechanism employed by the service provider. Once the defense mechanism is
detected, the perturbation recovery module leverages the well-designed
generative model to restore a clean feature vector from the perturbed one.
Through extensive evaluations based on various datasets, we demonstrate that
BESA significantly enhances the surrogate encoder accuracy of existing encoder
stealing attacks by up to 24.63\% when facing state-of-the-art defenses and
combinations of multiple defenses.

*Pablo Fernández Saura,K. R. Jayaram,Vatche Isahagian,Jorge Bernal Bernabé,Antonio Skarmeta*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper introduces a framework for automating attack mitigation policy compliance using large language models (LLMs) by integrating retrieval-augmented generation (RAG).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The increasing complexity of computing environments and evolving cyber threats demand an automated and adaptive approach to security enforcement.

Method: The framework collects and organizes tool and API specifications into a vector database, decomposes high-level policies into discrete tasks, and translates them into actionable API calls using a pipeline that leverages RAG.

Result: Empirical evaluations with CTI policies in STIXv2 format and Windows API documentation show notable enhancements in precision, recall, and F1-score with the RAG approach.

Conclusion: The proposed system effectively improves the automation and precision of attack mitigation policy compliance compared to traditional methods.

Abstract: The complexity of modern computing environments and the growing
sophistication of cyber threats necessitate a more robust, adaptive, and
automated approach to security enforcement. In this paper, we present a
framework leveraging large language models (LLMs) for automating attack
mitigation policy compliance through an innovative combination of in-context
learning and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). We begin by describing how
our system collects and manages both tool and API specifications, storing them
in a vector database to enable efficient retrieval of relevant information. We
then detail the architectural pipeline that first decomposes high-level
mitigation policies into discrete tasks and subsequently translates each task
into a set of actionable API calls. Our empirical evaluation, conducted using
publicly available CTI policies in STIXv2 format and Windows API documentation,
demonstrates significant improvements in precision, recall, and F1-score when
employing RAG compared to a non-RAG baseline.

### [489] [Why LLM Safety Guardrails Collapse After Fine-tuning: A Similarity Analysis Between Alignment and Fine-tuning Datasets](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05346)
*Lei Hsiung,Tianyu Pang,Yung-Chen Tang,Linyue Song,Tsung-Yi Ho,Pin-Yu Chen,Yaoqing Yang*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The study explores how the similarity between the original safety-alignment data and downstream fine-tuning tasks impacts the vulnerability of large language models (LLMs) to jailbreaks, offering data design strategies for enhanced safety.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing strategies for addressing safety alignment in LLMs often neglect the role of the original safety-alignment data, which might be pivotal in ensuring robust safety guardrails.

Method: Researchers analyzed the impact of representation similarity between upstream alignment datasets and downstream fine-tuning tasks on the integrity of safety guardrails in LLMs.

Result: High similarity between alignment datasets and fine-tuning tasks weakens safety guardrails, whereas low similarity enhances robustness, reducing harmfulness scores by up to 10.33%.

Conclusion: Optimizing the design of upstream datasets can improve the robustness of LLMs against jailbreaks, providing key insights for model fine-tuning practices.

Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have underscored their
vulnerability to safety alignment jailbreaks, particularly when subjected to
downstream fine-tuning. However, existing mitigation strategies primarily focus
on reactively addressing jailbreak incidents after safety guardrails have been
compromised, removing harmful gradients during fine-tuning, or continuously
reinforcing safety alignment throughout fine-tuning. As such, they tend to
overlook a critical upstream factor: the role of the original safety-alignment
data. This paper therefore investigates the degradation of safety guardrails
through the lens of representation similarity between upstream alignment
datasets and downstream fine-tuning tasks. Our experiments demonstrate that
high similarity between these datasets significantly weakens safety guardrails,
making models more susceptible to jailbreaks. Conversely, low similarity
between these two types of datasets yields substantially more robust models and
thus reduces harmfulness score by up to 10.33%. By highlighting the importance
of upstream dataset design in the building of durable safety guardrails and
reducing real-world vulnerability to jailbreak attacks, these findings offer
actionable insights for fine-tuning service providers.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The research introduces EMBER2024, a comprehensive dataset containing 3.2 million files across six formats for malware research, addressing the limitations of existing datasets by including multiple malware classification tasks and evasive malware files.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The research is motivated by the limited scope and accessibility of existing public malware datasets, which are often constrained to single-platform files, restricted classification tasks, and lack of evasive malware data crucial for advancing classifier robustness.

Method: The authors developed the EMBER2024 dataset in collaboration with previous EMBER contributors. It includes metadata, feature vectors with an updated version 3, and a "challenge" set of evasive malware to evaluate machine learning-based classifier performance across seven classification tasks.

Result: The EMBER2024 dataset encompasses over 3.2 million files from six formats, supporting holistic malware analysis and advancing machine learning models' capabilities in detecting and classifying various malware types, including evasive files.

Conclusion: The EMBER2024 dataset promotes reproducibility and fosters innovation by equipping researchers with a diverse, extensive dataset that addresses existing gaps, supporting both practical and theoretical advancements in malware analysis.

Abstract: A lack of accessible data has historically restricted malware analysis
research, and practitioners have relied heavily on datasets provided by
industry sources to advance. Existing public datasets are limited by narrow
scope - most include files targeting a single platform, have labels supporting
just one type of malware classification task, and make no effort to capture the
evasive files that make malware detection difficult in practice. We present
EMBER2024, a new dataset that enables holistic evaluation of malware
classifiers. Created in collaboration with the authors of EMBER2017 and
EMBER2018, the EMBER2024 dataset includes hashes, metadata, feature vectors,
and labels for more than 3.2 million files from six file formats. Our dataset
supports the training and evaluation of machine learning models on seven
malware classification tasks, including malware detection, malware family
classification, and malware behavior identification. EMBER2024 is the first to
include a collection of malicious files that initially went undetected by a set
of antivirus products, creating a "challenge" set to assess classifier
performance against evasive malware. This work also introduces EMBER feature
version 3, with added support for several new feature types. We are releasing
the EMBER2024 dataset to promote reproducibility and empower researchers in the
pursuit of new malware research topics.

### [491] [Membership Inference Attacks on Sequence Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05126)
*Lorenzo Rossi,Michael Aerni,Jie Zhang,Florian Tramèr*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper enhances privacy leakage audits in sequence models by adapting existing methods to consider sequential correlations, improving their effectiveness without extra computational costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation behind this work is to address the inadequacies of existing tools in auditing privacy risks stemming from sensitive information memorization in sequence models like LLMs and autoregressive image generators.

Method: The authors adapted a state-of-the-art membership inference attack by explicitly modeling within-sequence correlations to better suit sequence models.

Result: The adapted attack consistently improved the effectiveness of memorization audits through a case study while maintaining the same computational efficiency.

Conclusion: The work provides a foundation for reliable memorization audits in large sequence models, addressing critical privacy concerns in their deployment.

Abstract: Sequence models, such as Large Language Models (LLMs) and autoregressive
image generators, have a tendency to memorize and inadvertently leak sensitive
information. While this tendency has critical legal implications, existing
tools are insufficient to audit the resulting risks. We hypothesize that those
tools' shortcomings are due to mismatched assumptions. Thus, we argue that
effectively measuring privacy leakage in sequence models requires leveraging
the correlations inherent in sequential generation. To illustrate this, we
adapt a state-of-the-art membership inference attack to explicitly model
within-sequence correlations, thereby demonstrating how a strong existing
attack can be naturally extended to suit the structure of sequence models.
Through a case study, we show that our adaptations consistently improve the
effectiveness of memorization audits without introducing additional
computational costs. Our work hence serves as an important stepping stone
toward reliable memorization audits for large sequence models.

*Bruno Deprez,Bart Baesens,Tim Verdonck,Wouter Verbeke*

Main category: cs.SI

TL;DR: The paper introduces GARG-AML, a graph-based, interpretable method for detecting smurfing in money laundering, achieving superior efficiency, detection, and transparency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Countering money laundering challenges, specifically smurfing schemes, due to its global economic impact and the complexity this presents for financial compliance systems.

Method: Proposes GARG-AML, an interpretable graph-based method that uses second-order transaction networks, combined with tree-based models and neighbour score integration.

Result: Through experiments on synthetic and open-source networks, GARG-AML demonstrates better performance compared to existing smurfing detection solutions.

Conclusion: GARG-AML's interpretable and efficient approach showcases the potential of basic network properties in advancing anti-money laundering (AML) efforts, making it viable for integration into current workflows.

Abstract: Money laundering poses a significant challenge as it is estimated to account
for 2%-5% of the global GDP. This has compelled regulators to impose stringent
controls on financial institutions. One prominent laundering method for evading
these controls, called smurfing, involves breaking up large transactions into
smaller amounts. Given the complexity of smurfing schemes, which involve
multiple transactions distributed among diverse parties, network analytics has
become an important anti-money laundering tool. However, recent advances have
focused predominantly on black-box network embedding methods, which has
hindered their adoption in businesses. In this paper, we introduce GARG-AML, a
novel graph-based method that quantifies smurfing risk through a single
interpretable metric derived from the structure of the second-order transaction
network of each individual node in the network. Unlike traditional methods,
GARG-AML strikes an effective balance among computational efficiency, detection
power and transparency, which enables its integration into existing AML
workflows. To enhance its capabilities, we combine the GARG-AML score
calculation with different tree-based methods and also incorporate the scores
of the node's neighbours. An experimental evaluation on large-scale synthetic
and open-source networks demonstrate that the GARG-AML outperforms the current
state-of-the-art smurfing detection methods. By leveraging only the adjacency
matrix of the second-order neighbourhood and basic network features, this work
highlights the potential of fundamental network properties towards advancing
fraud detection.

Main category: physics.med-ph

TL;DR: The study proposes a diffusion transformer-based denoising framework to enhance Monte Carlo simulations for faster and accurate dose calculation in intensity-modulated proton therapy (IMPT) for head and neck cancer, generalizing well across multiple cancer sites.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fast and accurate dose calculation is essential for online adaptive radiation therapy (oART) in IMPT, where anatomical sensitivity requires frequent adaptation. Existing methods struggle to balance speed and accuracy due to reduced particle count in low-statistics Monte Carlo simulations.

Method: The researchers used a diffusion transformer-based denoising framework trained on noisy dose maps and CT images from 80 head and neck (H&N) cancer patients. Ground truth maps were generated using high-statistics Monte Carlo simulations. Testing spanned multiple types of cancers, using metrics like MAE, 3D Gamma passing rate, and dose-volume histogram (DVH) indices. Loss functions combined residual, mean square error (MSE), and MAE focusing on key dose regions.

Result: The framework produced results with low mean absolute errors (MAEs) across head and neck, lung, breast, and prostate cancers and achieved high 3D Gamma passing rates (>92%) and accurate dose-volume histogram (DVH) indices compared to ground truth maps.

Conclusion: The diffusion transformer-based denoising framework demonstrates strong generalizability and enables fast, high-quality dose generation across multiple cancer types despite training solely on head and neck data.

Abstract: Purpose: Intensity-modulated proton therapy (IMPT) offers precise tumor
coverage while sparing organs at risk (OARs) in head and neck (H&N) cancer.
However, its sensitivity to anatomical changes requires frequent adaptation
through online adaptive radiation therapy (oART), which depends on fast,
accurate dose calculation via Monte Carlo (MC) simulations. Reducing particle
count accelerates MC but degrades accuracy. To address this, denoising
low-statistics MC dose maps is proposed to enable fast, high-quality dose
generation.
  Methods: We developed a diffusion transformer-based denoising framework. IMPT
plans and 3D CT images from 80 H&N patients were used to generate noisy and
high-statistics dose maps using MCsquare (1 min and 10 min per plan,
respectively). Data were standardized into uniform chunks with zero-padding,
normalized, and transformed into quasi-Gaussian distributions. Testing was done
on 10 H&N, 10 lung, 10 breast, and 10 prostate cancer cases, preprocessed
identically. The model was trained with noisy dose maps and CT images as input
and high-statistics dose maps as ground truth, using a combined loss of mean
square error (MSE), residual loss, and regional MAE (focusing on top/bottom 10%
dose voxels). Performance was assessed via MAE, 3D Gamma passing rate, and DVH
indices.
  Results: The model achieved MAEs of 0.195 (H&N), 0.120 (lung), 0.172
(breast), and 0.376 Gy[RBE] (prostate). 3D Gamma passing rates exceeded 92%
(3%/2mm) across all sites. DVH indices for clinical target volumes (CTVs) and
OARs closely matched the ground truth.
  Conclusion: A diffusion transformer-based denoising framework was developed
and, though trained only on H&N data, generalizes well across multiple disease
sites.

*Shaoxuan Chen,Su Yang,Panayotis G. Kevrekidis,Wei Zhu*

Main category: nlin.PS

TL;DR: The paper introduces a Neural ODE-based framework for learning reduced-order moment dynamics from PDE systems, showing improved robustness and accuracy compared to traditional methods, even in sparse and irregular datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Challenges in modeling reduced-order moment dynamics from PDE systems arise due to sensitivity to noise and irregular sampling in traditional methods like SINDy. A more robust and flexible approach is needed for complex systems.

Method: The authors use Neural ODEs to directly model moment trajectories and introduce a coordinate transformation strategy via Stiefel manifold optimization. This approach enables modeling both systems with analytical closure and those lacking closure models.

Result: The framework accurately recovers moment dynamics in cases with analytical closure, and approximates unclosed dynamics with superior extrapolation accuracy compared to expert-derived models, even in sparse and irregular observational scenarios.

Conclusion: Neural ODEs offer a robust and interpretable approach to learning low-dimensional moment dynamics in PDE systems, particularly in data-limited situations, positioning them as a valuable tool for complex modeling tasks.

Abstract: We propose a data-driven framework for learning reduced-order moment dynamics
from PDE-governed systems using Neural ODEs. In contrast to derivative-based
methods like SINDy, which necessitate densely sampled data and are sensitive to
noise, our approach based on Neural ODEs directly models moment trajectories,
enabling robust learning from sparse and potentially irregular time series.
Using as an application platform the nonlinear Schr\"{o}dinger equation, the
framework accurately recovers governing moment dynamics when closure is
available, even with limited and irregular observations. For systems without
analytical closure, we introduce a data-driven coordinate transformation
strategy based on Stiefel manifold optimization, enabling the discovery of
low-dimensional representations in which the moment dynamics become closed,
facilitating interpretable and reliable modeling. We also explore cases where a
closure model is not known, such as a Fisher-KPP reaction-diffusion system.
Here we demonstrate that Neural ODEs can still effectively approximate the
unclosed moment dynamics and achieve superior extrapolation accuracy compared
to physical-expert-derived ODE models. This advantage remains robust even under
sparse and irregular sampling, highlighting the method's robustness in
data-limited settings. Our results highlight the Neural ODE framework as a
powerful and flexible tool for learning interpretable, low-dimensional moment
dynamics in complex PDE-governed systems.

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: Audio-text models suffer performance drops in noisy environments; a new method addresses this without retraining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current audio-text models for zero-shot sound classification fail in noisy conditions due to the presence of background noises.

Method: A novel method quantifies and incorporates the impact of background soundscapes into the classification process, leveraging domain adaptation and embedding gap optimization.

Result: Improved accuracy across diverse background and SNR conditions without retraining and demonstrated effective generalization across state-of-the-art models.

Conclusion: The proposed method enhances resilience and scalability of audio-text models for environmental sound classification, even in challenging noise conditions.

Abstract: Audio-text models are widely used in zero-shot environmental sound
classification as they alleviate the need for annotated data. However, we show
that their performance severely drops in the presence of background sound
sources. Our analysis reveals that this degradation is primarily driven by SNR
levels of background soundscapes, and independent of background type. To
address this, we propose a novel method that quantifies and integrates the
contribution of background sources into the classification process, improving
performance without requiring model retraining. Our domain adaptation technique
enhances accuracy across various backgrounds and SNR conditions. Moreover, we
analyze the modality gap between audio and text embeddings, showing that
narrowing this gap improves classification performance. The method generalizes
effectively across state-of-the-art prototypical approaches, showcasing its
scalability and robustness for diverse environments.

Motivation: To improve the coherence between speech labels (phonemic and prosodic) and graphemes, benefiting downstream tasks like text-to-speech and accent estimation.

Method: The model adds implicit grapheme conditioning using a prompt encoder with pre-trained BERT features and explicitly prunes inconsistent label hypotheses with graphemes during inference.

Result: The method showed significant improvement in grapheme-label consistency and improved accuracy in accent estimation using created parallel data.

Conclusion: The proposed model enhances grapheme-label coherence and proves effective in generating parallel data for downstream tasks.

Abstract: We propose a model to obtain phonemic and prosodic labels of speech that are
coherent with graphemes. Unlike previous methods that simply fine-tune a
pre-trained ASR model with the labels, the proposed model conditions the label
generation on corresponding graphemes by two methods: 1) Add implicit grapheme
conditioning through prompt encoder using pre-trained BERT features. 2)
Explicitly prune the label hypotheses inconsistent with the grapheme during
inference. These methods enable obtaining parallel data of speech, the labels,
and graphemes, which is applicable to various downstream tasks such as
text-to-speech and accent estimation from text. Experiments showed that the
proposed method significantly improved the consistency between graphemes and
the predicted labels. Further, experiments on accent estimation task confirmed
that the created parallel data by the proposed method effectively improve the
estimation accuracy.

### [497] [LLM-based phoneme-to-grapheme for phoneme-based speech recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04711)
*Te Ma,Min Bi,Saierdaer Yusuyin,Hao Huang,Zhijian Ou*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: The paper introduces an LLM-driven phoneme-to-grapheme method for phoneme-based ASR, achieving better results than traditional WFST approaches in crosslingual tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Phoneme-based ASR methods are data-efficient and competitive, but traditional WFST-based decoding has limitations such as complexity and lack of LLM integration.

Method: The study proposes a two-step LLM-based decoding process and training strategies: Data Augmentation with Noisy Phonemes (DANP) and Randomized Top-K Marginalized (TKM) training and decoding.

Result: The proposed method outperformed WFST-based systems in Polish and German crosslingual ASR tasks, reducing relative WER by 3.6% and 6.9% respectively.

Conclusion: LLM-based phoneme-to-grapheme decoding is a robust alternative to WFST, improving performance in crosslingual settings and leveraging modern language model capabilities.

Abstract: In automatic speech recognition (ASR), phoneme-based multilingual
pre-training and crosslingual fine-tuning is attractive for its high data
efficiency and competitive results compared to subword-based models. However,
Weighted Finite State Transducer (WFST) based decoding is limited by its
complex pipeline and inability to leverage large language models (LLMs).
Therefore, we propose LLM-based phoneme-to-grapheme (LLM-P2G) decoding for
phoneme-based ASR, consisting of speech-to-phoneme (S2P) and
phoneme-to-grapheme (P2G). A challenge is that there seems to have information
loss in cascading S2P and P2G. To address this challenge, we propose two
training strategies: data augmentation with noisy phonemes (DANP), and
randomized top-$K$ marginalized (TKM) training and decoding. Our experimental
results show that LLM-P2G outperforms WFST-based systems in crosslingual ASR
for Polish and German, by relative WER reductions of 3.6% and 6.9%
respectively.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the challenges and unify the fragmented evaluation methods of music generative systems, ensuring effectiveness and interdisciplinary understanding.

*Vishwa Mohan Singh,Sai Anirudh Aryasomayajula,Ahan Chatterjee,Beste Aydemir,Rifat Mehreen Amin*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: The paper introduces a human-computation approach to improve AI music generation by using user ratings as a loss function for model fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AI music generation models often struggle with interpreting user input and providing personalization, challenges due to their training on fixed datasets.

Method: The proposed method integrates user feedback through a genetic algorithm, using aggregated user ratings as a loss function to fine-tune the model.

Result: In pilot tests, user ratings increased by 0.2 in the first iteration and by an additional 0.39 in the second iteration.

Conclusion: The approach demonstrates potential in enhancing the personalization and performance of AI music generation models by leveraging user interaction.

Abstract: AI music generation has advanced rapidly, with models like diffusion and
autoregressive algorithms enabling high-fidelity outputs. These tools can alter
styles, mix instruments, or isolate them. Since sound can be visualized as
spectrograms, image-generation algorithms can be applied to generate novel
music. However, these algorithms are typically trained on fixed datasets, which
makes it challenging for them to interpret and respond to user input
accurately. This is especially problematic because music is highly subjective
and requires a level of personalization that image generation does not provide.
In this work, we propose a human-computation approach to gradually improve the
performance of these algorithms based on user interactions. The
human-computation element involves aggregating and selecting user ratings to
use as the loss function for fine-tuning the model. We employ a genetic
algorithm that incorporates user feedback to enhance the baseline performance
of a model initially trained on a fixed dataset. The effectiveness of this
approach is measured by the average increase in user ratings with each
iteration. In the pilot test, the first iteration showed an average rating
increase of 0.2 compared to the baseline. The second iteration further improved
upon this, achieving an additional increase of 0.39 over the first iteration.

Main category: cs.LO

TL;DR: The paper proposes a model to verify the trustworthiness of ML system copies, introducing four distinct measures for analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of ensuring trustworthiness in copies of ML systems, especially in the quest for responsible AI.

Method: Introduced a calculus for probabilistic complex queries and defined distinct measures for analyzing trustworthiness of ML system copies.

Result: The paper demonstrates relations between four trustworthiness measures and their composability under logical operations.

Conclusion: A computational tool is proposed to check and quantify the trustworthiness of complex ML systems derived as copies of the original models.

Abstract: A common practice of ML systems development concerns the training of the same
model under different data sets, and the use of the same (training and test)
sets for different learning models. The first case is a desirable practice for
identifying high quality and unbiased training conditions. The latter case
coincides with the search for optimal models under a common dataset for
training. These differently obtained systems have been considered akin to
copies. In the quest for responsible AI, a legitimate but hardly investigated
question is how to verify that trustworthiness is preserved by copies. In this
paper we introduce a calculus to model and verify probabilistic complex queries
over data and define four distinct notions: Justifiably, Equally, Weakly and
Almost Trustworthy which can be checked analysing the (partial) behaviour of
the copy with respect to its original. We provide a study of the relations
between these notions of trustworthiness, and how they compose with each other
and under logical operations. The aim is to offer a computational tool to check
the trustworthiness of possibly complex systems copied from an original whose
behavour is known.

*Emma Harvey,Emily Sheng,Su Lin Blodgett,Alexandra Chouldechova,Jean Garcia-Gathright,Alexandra Olteanu,Hanna Wallach*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: This paper evaluates how well the available tools for measuring representational harms in language models meet practitioners' needs, identifying shortcomings and suggesting improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the gap between the development of instruments for assessing representational harms in language models and their usage by practitioners tasked with evaluating such systems.

Method: The authors conducted semi-structured interviews with 12 practitioners to explore challenges and barriers in using publicly available measurement instruments.

Result: The study uncovered two key issues: misalignment between practitioner needs and instrument capabilities, and practical/institutional barriers preventing practitioners from utilizing even useful instruments.

Conclusion: Recommendations based on measurement theory and pragmatic measurement are provided to enhance the alignment and usability of instruments with practitioner requirements.

Abstract: The NLP research community has made publicly available numerous instruments
for measuring representational harms caused by large language model (LLM)-based
systems. These instruments have taken the form of datasets, metrics, tools, and
more. In this paper, we examine the extent to which such instruments meet the
needs of practitioners tasked with evaluating LLM-based systems. Via
semi-structured interviews with 12 such practitioners, we find that
practitioners are often unable to use publicly available instruments for
measuring representational harms. We identify two types of challenges. In some
cases, instruments are not useful because they do not meaningfully measure what
practitioners seek to measure or are otherwise misaligned with practitioner
needs. In other cases, instruments - even useful instruments - are not used by
practitioners due to practical and institutional barriers impeding their
uptake. Drawing on measurement theory and pragmatic measurement, we provide
recommendations for addressing these challenges to better meet practitioner
needs.

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: The paper discusses how agentic AI systems pose challenges to traditional public sector oversight, necessitating advancements in governance structures and processes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the shortcomings of traditional public sector oversight mechanisms in the face of agentic AI's operational demands and risks.

Method: A mixed-methods approach combining literature review and interviews with civil servants in AI-focused roles.

Result: Identification of three intensified governance challenges (continuous oversight, operational integration, interdepartmental coordination) and the proposal of adaptable oversight approaches.

Conclusion: Governance structures need significant reforms to effectively manage and oversee agentic AI within public sector constraints.

Abstract: This paper finds that the introduction of agentic AI systems intensifies
existing challenges to traditional public sector oversight mechanisms -- which
rely on siloed compliance units and episodic approvals rather than continuous,
integrated supervision. We identify five governance dimensions essential for
responsible agent deployment: cross-departmental implementation, comprehensive
evaluation, enhanced security protocols, operational visibility, and systematic
auditing. We evaluate the capacity of existing oversight structures to meet
these challenges, via a mixed-methods approach consisting of a literature
review and interviews with civil servants in AI-related roles. We find that
agent oversight poses intensified versions of three existing governance
challenges: continuous oversight, deeper integration of governance and
operational capabilities, and interdepartmental coordination. We propose
approaches that both adapt institutional structures and design agent oversight
compatible with public sector constraints.

*David Atkinson,Jena D. Hwang,Jacob Morrison*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: The paper critiques the idea of granting First Amendment protections to outputs from large generative AI models, arguing that they lack intention and do not qualify as 'speech' under legal precedent.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address whether outputs from generative AI models should be legally protected under the First Amendment, especially considering the implications for free speech and regulation.

Method: The authors analyze legal precedents and philosophical considerations to examine whether AI-generated outputs qualify as speech and evaluate the societal impact of extending First Amendment rights to such technologies.

Result: The paper establishes that AI outputs lack intentionality, cannot be considered speech under legal frameworks, and that granting such protections would undermine regulatory control and exacerbate societal harms like misinformation.

Conclusion: First Amendment protections should not be extended to generative AI models or their outputs, as this would fail the core purposes of free speech and create significant negative consequences for governance and society.

Abstract: This paper challenges the assumption that courts should grant First Amendment
protections to outputs from large generative AI models, such as GPT-4 and
Gemini. We argue that because these models lack intentionality, their outputs
do not constitute speech as understood in the context of established legal
precedent, so there can be no speech to protect. Furthermore, if the model
outputs are not speech, users cannot claim a First Amendment speech right to
receive the outputs. We also argue that extending First Amendment rights to AI
models would not serve the fundamental purposes of free speech, such as
promoting a marketplace of ideas, facilitating self-governance, or fostering
self-expression. In fact, granting First Amendment protections to AI models
would be detrimental to society because it would hinder the government's
ability to regulate these powerful technologies effectively, potentially
leading to the unchecked spread of misinformation and other harms.

*Lingyuan Liu,Mengxiang Zhang*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: The paper introduces Exp4Fuse, a framework that boosts sparse retrieval using zero-shot LLM-based query expansion without complex prompts or advanced dense retrievers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the computational cost and dependency on complex prompt engineering in LLM-based query expansion for information retrieval.

Method: Exp4Fuse employs dual retrieval routes: one with the original query and one enhanced with a zero-shot LLM-augmented query, combining results using a modified reciprocal rank fusion method.

Result: Exp4Fuse outperformed existing LLM-based query expansion techniques and achieved state-of-the-art results on multiple datasets.

Conclusion: Exp4Fuse effectively improves sparse retrieval systems, offering a cost-efficient and high-performing alternative for query expansion.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown potential in generating hypothetical
documents for query expansion, thereby enhancing information retrieval
performance. However, the efficacy of this method is highly dependent on the
quality of the generated documents, which often requires complex prompt
strategies and the integration of advanced dense retrieval techniques. This can
be both costly and computationally intensive. To mitigate these limitations, we
explore the use of zero-shot LLM-based query expansion to improve sparse
retrieval, particularly for learned sparse retrievers. We introduce a novel
fusion ranking framework, Exp4Fuse, which enhances the performance of sparse
retrievers through an indirect application of zero-shot LLM-based query
expansion. Exp4Fuse operates by simultaneously considering two retrieval
routes-one based on the original query and the other on the LLM-augmented
query. It then generates two ranked lists using a sparse retriever and fuses
them using a modified reciprocal rank fusion method. We conduct extensive
evaluations of Exp4Fuse against leading LLM-based query expansion methods and
advanced retrieval techniques on three MS MARCO-related datasets and seven
low-resource datasets. Experimental results reveal that Exp4Fuse not only
surpasses existing LLM-based query expansion methods in enhancing sparse
retrievers but also, when combined with advanced sparse retrievers, achieves
SOTA results on several benchmarks. This highlights the superior performance
and effectiveness of Exp4Fuse in improving query expansion for sparse
retrieval.

*Lingyuan Liu,Mengxiang Zhang*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: GOLFer is a new method that uses smaller open-source LMs to improve query expansion while solving issues like hallucinations and computational cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM-based query expansion methods rely on large, costly, and computationally demanding language models, which limits accessibility.

Method: GOLFer introduces two modules: a hallucination filter to remove non-factual content and a documents combiner to merge filtered documents with the original query using a weighting strategy.

Result: GOLFer performs better than existing query expansion methods using smaller LMs, and delivers competitive results compared to large LLM-based methods.

Conclusion: GOLFer effectively utilizes smaller LMs to address challenges in cost, computational intensity, and quality in query expansion while achieving strong performance.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs)-based query expansion for information retrieval
augments queries with generated hypothetical documents with LLMs. However, its
performance relies heavily on the scale of the language models (LMs),
necessitating larger, more advanced LLMs. This approach is costly,
computationally intensive, and often has limited accessibility. To address
these limitations, we introduce GOLFer - Smaller LMs-Generated Documents
Hallucination Filter & Combiner - a novel method leveraging smaller open-source
LMs for query expansion. GOLFer comprises two modules: a hallucination filter
and a documents combiner. The former detects and removes non-factual and
inconsistent sentences in generated documents, a common issue with smaller LMs,
while the latter combines the filtered content with the query using a weight
vector to balance their influence. We evaluate GOLFer alongside dominant
LLM-based query expansion methods on three web search and ten low-resource
datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that GOLFer consistently outperforms
other methods using smaller LMs, and maintains competitive performance against
methods using large-size LLMs, demonstrating its effectiveness.

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: The study addresses the high memory usage of ColPali/ColQwen2 in Visual Document Retrieval (VDR) by exploring token-reduction strategies and proposes Light-ColPali/ColQwen2, achieving significant efficiency with minimal performance loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the issue of excessive memory usage in ColPali/ColQwen2 during VDR despite its strong retrieval performance.

Method: The paper evaluates two token-reduction strategies—token pruning and token merging—and identifies optimal token merging strategies to reduce memory footprint while maintaining retrieval performance.

Result: The proposed Light-ColPali/ColQwen2 retains 98.2% of retrieval performance with just 11.8% of memory usage and maintains 94.6% performance at only 2.8% of memory footprint.

Conclusion: Light-ColPali/ColQwen2 is an efficient alternative to ColPali/ColQwen2 for VDR, offering valuable performance-memory trade-offs and serving as a strong baseline for future research.

Abstract: Despite the strong performance of ColPali/ColQwen2 in Visualized Document
Retrieval (VDR), it encodes each page into multiple patch-level embeddings and
leads to excessive memory usage. This empirical study investigates methods to
reduce patch embeddings per page at minimum performance degradation. We
evaluate two token-reduction strategies: token pruning and token merging.
Regarding token pruning, we surprisingly observe that a simple random strategy
outperforms other sophisticated pruning methods, though still far from
satisfactory. Further analysis reveals that pruning is inherently unsuitable
for VDR as it requires removing certain page embeddings without query-specific
information. Turning to token merging (more suitable for VDR), we search for
the optimal combinations of merging strategy across three dimensions and
develop Light-ColPali/ColQwen2. It maintains 98.2% of retrieval performance
with only 11.8% of original memory usage, and preserves 94.6% effectiveness at
2.8% memory footprint. We expect our empirical findings and resulting
Light-ColPali/ColQwen2 offer valuable insights and establish a competitive
baseline for future research towards efficient VDR.

*Keyu Zhao,Fengli Xu,Yong Li*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: The paper proposes R2Rec, a framework for integrating LLMs into recommendations by simulating reasoning processes through interaction chains and masked prompting, achieving superior performance and improved interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the limitations of direct application of LLM reasoning in recommendation tasks due to the implicit nature of user feedback and lack of reasoning supervision.

Method: The authors developed R2Rec, which generates structured interaction chains using a progressive masked prompting strategy and incorporates a two-stage training pipeline with supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning for reasoning improvement.

Result: R2Rec demonstrated an average 10.48% improvement in HitRatio@1 and a 131.81% gain over the baseline LLM across three real-world datasets.

Conclusion: R2Rec successfully integrates reasoning into LLM-based recommendation systems, significantly improving performance and interpretability. The structured reasoning chains made the decision-making process more explicit and understandable.

Abstract: Driven by advances in Large Language Models (LLMs), integrating them into
recommendation tasks has gained interest due to their strong semantic
understanding and prompt flexibility. Prior work encoded user-item interactions
or metadata into prompts for recommendations. In parallel, LLM reasoning,
boosted by test-time scaling and reinforcement learning, has excelled in fields
like mathematics and code, where reasoning traces and correctness signals are
clear, enabling high performance and interpretability. However, directly
applying these reasoning methods to recommendation is ineffective because user
feedback is implicit and lacks reasoning supervision. To address this, we
propose $\textbf{R2Rec}$, a reasoning-enhanced recommendation framework that
samples interaction chains from the user-item graph and converts them into
structured interaction-of-thoughts via a progressive masked prompting strategy,
with each thought representing stepwise reasoning grounded in interaction
context. This allows LLMs to simulate step-by-step decision-making based on
implicit patterns. We design a two-stage training pipeline: supervised
fine-tuning teaches basic reasoning from high-quality traces, and reinforcement
learning refines reasoning via reward signals, alleviating sparse explicit
supervision. Experiments on three real-world datasets show R2Rec outperforms
classical and LLM-based baselines with an average $\textbf{10.48%}$ improvement
in HitRatio@1 and $\textbf{131.81%}$ gain over the original LLM. Furthermore,
the explicit reasoning chains enhance interpretability by revealing the
decision process. Our code is available at:

TL;DR: This paper introduces kTULA, a new algorithm based on tamed Langevin dynamics for sampling from distributions with super-linearly growing log-gradients, addressing scenarios where global Lipschitz continuity conditions are not met.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenge of sampling from complex distributions linked to deep learning applications where global Lipschitz continuity fails.

Method: Develop the kTULA algorithm, utilizing tamed Langevin dynamics, and provide theoretical guarantees such as convergence bounds in KL divergence and Wasserstein-2 distance.

Result: kTULA achieves improved convergence bounds (rate of $2-\overline{\epsilon}$) and demonstrates applicability to sampling high-dimensional distributions and solving neural network-based optimization problems.

Conclusion: kTULA successfully improves existing methods with theoretical performance guarantees, supporting both sampling and optimization tasks in challenging deep learning scenarios.

Abstract: Motivated by applications in deep learning, where the global Lipschitz
continuity condition is often not satisfied, we examine the problem of sampling
from distributions with super-linearly growing log-gradients. We propose a
novel tamed Langevin dynamics-based algorithm, called kTULA, to solve the
aforementioned sampling problem, and provide a theoretical guarantee for its
performance. More precisely, we establish a non-asymptotic convergence bound in
Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence with the best-known rate of convergence equal
to $2-\overline{\epsilon}$, $\overline{\epsilon}>0$, which significantly
improves relevant results in existing literature. This enables us to obtain an
improved non-asymptotic error bound in Wasserstein-2 distance, which can be
used to further derive a non-asymptotic guarantee for kTULA to solve the
associated optimization problems. To illustrate the applicability of kTULA, we
apply the proposed algorithm to the problem of sampling from a high-dimensional
double-well potential distribution and to an optimization problem involving a
neural network. We show that our main results can be used to provide
theoretical guarantees for the performance of kTULA.

Motivation: To address the limitations of explicit or semi-implicit schemes in multiphase flow simulation by developing a fully coupled and implicit approach.

Method: The study employs the Vertex-Centered Finite Volume Method for spatial discretization, introduces the Linearly Implicit Extrapolation Method (LIMEX) with error estimator, and solves the system using BiCGSTAB with GMG preconditioner.

Result: The framework demonstrated scalability on a supercomputer, supporting thousands of processors and handling Degrees of Freedom (DoF) up to billions.

Conclusion: The proposed fully coupled and implicit framework is scalable and efficient for simulating multiphase flow in heterogeneous porous media with gravity and capillary effects.

Abstract: The modeling and simulation of multiphase fluid flow receive significant
attention in reservoir engineering. Many time discretization schemes for
multiphase flow equations are either explicit or semi-implicit, relying on the
decoupling between the saturation equation and the pressure equation. In this
study, we delve into a fully coupled and fully implicit framework for
simulating multiphase flow in heterogeneous porous media, considering gravity
and capillary effects. We utilize the Vertex-Centered Finite Volume Method for
spatial discretization and propose an efficient implementation of interface
conditions for heterogeneous porous media within the current scheme. Notably,
we introduce the Linearly Implicit Extrapolation Method (LIMEX) with an error
estimator, adapted for the first time to multiphase flow problems. To solve the
resulting linear system, we employ the BiCGSTAB method with the Geometric
Multigrid (GMG) preconditioner. The implementations of models and methods are
based on the open-source software: UG4. The results from parallel computations
on the supercomputer demonstrate that the scalability of our proposed framework
is sufficient, supporting a scale of thousands of processors with Degrees of

Motivation: Traditional PINNs struggle with spatial hierarchies and enforcing intricate boundary conditions, necessitating a more effective approach.

Result: BridgeNet demonstrates lower errors, faster convergence, and robust stability in high-dimensional computational physics problems.

Conclusion: This framework advances computational physics with scalable and accurate solutions, extending applications to areas like financial mathematics.

Abstract: BridgeNet is a novel hybrid framework that integrates convolutional neural
networks with physics-informed neural networks to efficiently solve non-linear,
high-dimensional Fokker-Planck equations (FPEs). Traditional PINNs, which
typically rely on fully connected architectures, often struggle to capture
complex spatial hierarchies and enforce intricate boundary conditions. In
contrast, BridgeNet leverages adaptive CNN layers for effective local feature
extraction and incorporates a dynamically weighted loss function that
rigorously enforces physical constraints. Extensive numerical experiments
across various test cases demonstrate that BridgeNet not only achieves
significantly lower error metrics and faster convergence compared to
conventional PINN approaches but also maintains robust stability in
high-dimensional settings. This work represents a substantial advancement in
computational physics, offering a scalable and accurate solution methodology
with promising applications in fields ranging from financial mathematics to

Motivation: To address the limitation of stochastic variational inference (SVI) in handling only fixed-dimension problems and expanding its application to complex, transdimensional Bayesian inference.

Method: The authors propose CoSMIC, an extension to neural autoregressive conditional normalizing flow architectures, combined with a stochastic variational transdimensional inference (VTI) approach based on Bayesian optimization and Monte Carlo gradient estimation.

Result: Numerical experiments show the effectiveness of CoSMIC and VTI in solving complex, transdimensional inference challenges with high-cardinality model spaces.

Conclusion: CoSMIC successfully extends the functionality and application of flow-based models in Bayesian inference, enabling efficient handling of transdimensional distributions.

Abstract: The expressiveness of flow-based models combined with stochastic variational
inference (SVI) has, in recent years, expanded the application of
optimization-based Bayesian inference to include problems with complex data
relationships. However, until now, SVI using flow-based models has been limited
to problems of fixed dimension. We introduce CoSMIC, normalizing flows
(COntextually-Specified Masking for Identity-mapped Components), an extension
to neural autoregressive conditional normalizing flow architectures that
enables using a single amortized variational density for inference over a
transdimensional target distribution. We propose a combined stochastic
variational transdimensional inference (VTI) approach to training CoSMIC flows
using techniques from Bayesian optimization and Monte Carlo gradient
estimation. Numerical experiments demonstrate the performance of VTI on
challenging problems that scale to high-cardinality model spaces.

### [514] [Can we reconstruct a dysarthric voice with the large speech model Parler TTS?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04397)
*Ariadna Sanchez,Simon King*

Main category: eess.AS

TL;DR: The paper explores using the Parler TTS model for reconstructing the voice of individuals with speech disorders by generating their pre-condition voice, but finds challenges in controlling intelligibility and speaker identity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to create a communication aid for those with speech disorders by leveraging personalized text-to-speech technology to reconstruct their original voice.

Method: The approach involves curating a dataset annotated with speaker and intelligibility data, and fine-tuning the Parler TTS model to generate intelligible and speaker-identity-consistent speech.

Result: The model can generate speech from challenging data but faces difficulties in maintaining intelligibility and consistent speaker identity.

Conclusion: The study suggests potential future directions to enhance the controllability of large speech models like Parler TTS for voice reconstruction tasks.

Abstract: Speech disorders can make communication hard or even impossible for those who
develop them. Personalised Text-to-Speech is an attractive option as a
communication aid. We attempt voice reconstruction using a large speech model,
with which we generate an approximation of a dysarthric speaker's voice prior
to the onset of their condition. In particular, we investigate whether a
state-of-the-art large speech model, Parler TTS, can generate intelligible
speech while maintaining speaker identity. We curate a dataset and annotate it
with relevant speaker and intelligibility information, and use this to
fine-tune the model. Our results show that the model can indeed learn to
generate from the distribution of this challenging data, but struggles to
control intelligibility and to maintain consistent speaker identity. We propose
future directions to improve controllability of this class of model, for the
voice reconstruction task.

Main category: eess.AS

TL;DR: This paper compares speech-text joint decoding strategies for Speech LMs and introduces an optimized early-stop interleaved method to enhance performance and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore optimal joint speech-text decoding strategies for Speech LMs and improve their performance and efficiency in spoken dialogue systems.

Method: Systematic comparison of interleaved and parallel decoding strategies, coupled with the introduction of a novel early-stop interleaved (ESI) approach.

Result: The interleaved method yielded the best alignment but had slow inference, which was mitigated by the ESI strategy that improved speed and slightly boosted performance.

Conclusion: The early-stop interleaved strategy is an effective advancement for Speech LMs, addressing both alignment quality and decoding efficiency while enhancing performance.

Abstract: Speech language models (Speech LMs) enable end-to-end speech-text modelling
within a single model, offering a promising direction for spoken dialogue
systems. The choice of speech-text jointly decoding paradigm plays a critical
role in performance, efficiency, and alignment quality. In this work, we
systematically compare representative joint speech-text decoding
strategies-including the interleaved, and parallel generation paradigms-under a
controlled experimental setup using the same base language model, speech
tokenizer and training data. Our results show that the interleaved approach
achieves the best alignment. However it suffers from slow inference due to long
token sequence length. To address this, we propose a novel early-stop
interleaved (ESI) pattern that not only significantly accelerates decoding but
also yields slightly better performance. Additionally, we curate high-quality
question answering (QA) datasets to further improve speech QA performance.

Abstract: Speech emotion recognition (SER) systems often exhibit gender bias. However,
the effectiveness and robustness of existing debiasing methods in such
multi-label scenarios remain underexplored. To address this gap, we present
EMO-Debias, a large-scale comparison of 13 debiasing methods applied to
multi-label SER. Our study encompasses techniques from pre-processing,
regularization, adversarial learning, biased learners, and distributionally
robust optimization. Experiments conducted on acted and naturalistic emotion
datasets, using WavLM and XLSR representations, evaluate each method under
conditions of gender imbalance. Our analysis quantifies the trade-offs between
fairness and accuracy, identifying which approaches consistently reduce gender
performance gaps without compromising overall model performance. The findings
provide actionable insights for selecting effective debiasing strategies and
highlight the impact of dataset distributions.

Result: Qwen 2.5 performs well in multi-step reasoning, Gemma 2 balances latency and accuracy, and LLaMA 3.2 is faster but less logically coherent. FLUC demonstrates effectiveness in energy-aware UAV positioning with structured prompts.

Conclusion: FLUC successfully interprets natural language commands for real-time UAV mission control, showcasing its potential in autonomous, domain-specific operations.

Abstract: This paper proposes FLUC, a modular framework that integrates open-source
Large Language Models (LLMs) with Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) autopilot
systems to enable autonomous control in Flying Networks (FNs). FLUC translates
high-level natural language commands into executable UAV mission code, bridging
the gap between operator intent and UAV behaviour.
  FLUC is evaluated using three open-source LLMs - Qwen 2.5, Gemma 2, and LLaMA
3.2 - across scenarios involving code generation and mission planning. Results
show that Qwen 2.5 excels in multi-step reasoning, Gemma 2 balances accuracy
and latency, and LLaMA 3.2 offers faster responses with lower logical
coherence. A case study on energy-aware UAV positioning confirms FLUC's ability
to interpret structured prompts and autonomously execute domain-specific logic,
showing its effectiveness in real-time, mission-driven control.

*Hanqing Li,Melania Fedeli,Vinay Kolar,Diego Klabjan*

Main category: cs.NI

TL;DR: The paper introduces BEAR, a framework that uses large language models to explain BGP anomaly events, achieving 100% accuracy compared to baseline methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: BGP anomalies like route leaks and hijacks threaten network security but require expert interpretation, which this framework aims to automate.

Method: BEAR uses large language models for multi-step reasoning to translate BGP data into textual reports while utilizing synthetic data generation for limited anomaly records.

Result: Evaluations reveal that BEAR outperforms existing baselines and achieves 100% accuracy in explaining real and synthetic BGP events.

Conclusion: BEAR paves the way for automated and precise explanation of BGP anomalies, reducing reliance on expert intervention and improving network operations.

Abstract: The Internet comprises of interconnected, independently managed Autonomous
Systems (AS) that rely on the Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) for inter-domain
routing. BGP anomalies--such as route leaks and hijacks--can divert traffic
through unauthorized or inefficient paths, jeopardizing network reliability and
security. Although existing rule-based and machine learning methods can detect
these anomalies using structured metrics, they still require experts with
in-depth BGP knowledge of, for example, AS relationships and historical
incidents, to interpret events and propose remediation. In this paper, we
introduce BEAR (BGP Event Analysis and Reporting), a novel framework that
leverages large language models (LLMs) to automatically generate comprehensive
reports explaining detected BGP anomaly events. BEAR employs a multi-step
reasoning process that translates tabular BGP data into detailed textual
narratives, enhancing interpretability and analytical precision. To address the
limited availability of publicly documented BGP anomalies, we also present a
synthetic data generation framework powered by LLMs. Evaluations on both real
and synthetic datasets demonstrate that BEAR achieves 100% accuracy,
outperforming Chain-of-Thought and in-context learning baselines. This work
pioneers an automated approach for explaining BGP anomaly events, offering
valuable operational insights for network management.

*Shumin Lian,Jingwen Tong,Jun Zhang,Liqun Fu*

Main category: cs.NI

TL;DR: The paper addresses WiFi 7's Multi-Link Operation (MLO) challenge in dynamic channel allocation using novel algorithms, achieving significant improvements in efficiency and learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to overcome challenges posed by dense WiFi 7 network environments in channel allocation, especially underutilized in current research focusing on static configurations.

Method: The study formulates the problem as a combinatorial optimization within a Multi-Armed Bandit framework, introducing the Best-Arm Identification-enabled Monte Carlo Tree Search (BAI-MCTS) and enhancing it with LLM integration.

Result: Numerical results indicate that BAI-MCTS achieves a convergence rate 50.44% faster than existing methods, with LLM-BAI-MCTS improving convergence rates by over 63.32% in dense networks.

Conclusion: The proposed solutions provide efficient and scalable methods for addressing dynamic channel allocation challenges in dense WiFi 7 networks, showcasing significant theoretical and practical performance gains.

Abstract: WiFi networks have achieved remarkable success in enabling seamless
communication and data exchange worldwide. The IEEE 802.11be standard, known as
WiFi 7, introduces Multi-Link Operation (MLO), a groundbreaking feature that
enables devices to establish multiple simultaneous connections across different
bands and channels. While MLO promises substantial improvements in network
throughput and latency reduction, it presents significant challenges in channel
allocation, particularly in dense network environments. Current research has
predominantly focused on performance analysis and throughput optimization
within static WiFi 7 network configurations. In contrast, this paper addresses
the dynamic channel allocation problem in dense WiFi 7 networks with MLO
capabilities. We formulate this challenge as a combinatorial optimization
problem, leveraging a novel network performance analysis mechanism. Given the
inherent lack of prior network information, we model the problem within a
Multi-Armed Bandit (MAB) framework to enable online learning of optimal channel
allocations. Our proposed Best-Arm Identification-enabled Monte Carlo Tree
Search (BAI-MCTS) algorithm includes rigorous theoretical analysis, providing
upper bounds for both sample complexity and error probability. To further
reduce sample complexity and enhance generalizability across diverse network
scenarios, we put forth LLM-BAI-MCTS, an intelligent algorithm for the dynamic
channel allocation problem by integrating the Large Language Model (LLM) into
the BAI-MCTS algorithm. Numerical results demonstrate that the BAI-MCTS
algorithm achieves a convergence rate approximately $50.44\%$ faster than the
state-of-the-art algorithms when reaching $98\%$ of the optimal value. Notably,
the convergence rate of the LLM-BAI-MCTS algorithm increases by over $63.32\%$
in dense networks.

TL;DR: The study highlights the potential of NWDAF in telecommunications and explores its underutilization, proposing two new use cases.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Mobile Network Operators (MNOs) have underutilized the data they collect, unlike OTT players who leverage analytics to dominate market valuations.

Method: The study reviews data analytics trends in over 70 academic articles and develops new use cases to promote and monetize NWDAF.

Result: Two novel use cases for NWDAF are proposed to showcase its potential in improving data monetization and operational efficiency.

Conclusion: The research emphasizes the strategic importance of advanced data analytics like NWDAF for MNOs to move beyond commoditization and add greater value to services.

Abstract: Data has become a critical asset in the digital economy, yet it remains
underutilized by Mobile Network Operators (MNOs), unlike Over-the-Top (OTT)
players that lead global market valuations. To move beyond the commoditization
of connectivity and deliver greater value to customers, data analytics emerges
as a strategic enabler. Using data efficiently is essential for unlocking new
service opportunities, optimizing operational efficiency, and mitigating
operational and business risks. Since Release 15, the 3rd Generation
Partnership Project (3GPP) has introduced the Network Data Analytics Function
(NWDAF) to provide powerful insights and predictions using data collected
across mobile networks, supporting both user-centric and network-oriented use
cases. However, academic research has largely focused on a limited set of
methods and use cases, driven by the availability of datasets, restricting
broader exploration. This study analyzes trends and gaps in more than 70
articles and proposes two novel use cases to promote the adoption of NWDAF and
explore its potential for monetization.

### [521] [Memory Hierarchy Design for Caching Middleware in the Age of NVM](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05071)
*Shahram Ghandeharizadeh,Sandy Irani,Jenny Lam*

Main category: cs.DB

TL;DR: This paper explores designing caching middleware with Non-Volatile Memory (NVM) and uses the Multiple Choice Knapsack Problem (MCKP) to optimize memory hierarchy configurations. Results suggest selective replication or tiering, depending on failure rates and workloads.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address configuration challenges in a memory hierarchy made up of NVM, DRAM, SSD, and Disk, optimizing performance and recovery time within fixed budgets.

Method: The authors model cache configuration questions as a Multiple Choice Knapsack Problem (MCKP), solve its linear programming relaxation, and test the approach with Key-Value Stores and host-side caches.

Result: Results indicate that selective replication is effective under certain failure rates and workloads, while tiering data across storage levels is better suited for conditions with low failure rates and frequent updates.

Conclusion: The study provides a framework for optimizing memory hierarchy configurations, showing that workload and failure rates significantly influence whether replication or tiering is more efficient.

Abstract: Advances in storage technology have introduced Non-Volatile Memory, NVM, as a
new storage medium. NVM, along with Dynamic Random Access Memory (DRAM), Solid
State Disk (SSD), and Disk present a system designer with a wide array of
options in designing caching middleware. Moreover, design decisions to
replicate a data item in more than one level of a caching memory hierarchy may
enhance the overall system performance with a faster recovery time in the event
of a memory failure. Given a fixed budget, the key configuration questions are:
Which storage media should constitute the memory hierarchy? What is the storage
capacity of each hierarchy? Should data be replicated or partitioned across the
different levels of the hierarchy? We model these cache configuration questions
as an instance of the Multiple Choice Knapsack Problem (MCKP). This model is
guided by the specification of each type of memory along with an application's
database characteristics and its workload. Although MCKP is NP-complete, its
linear programming relaxation is efficiently solvable and can be used to
closely approximate the optimal solution. We use the resulting simple algorithm
to evaluate design tradeoffs in the context of a memory hierarchy for a
Key-Value Store (e.g., memcached) as well as a host-side cache (e.g.,
Flashcache). The results show selective replication is appropriate with certain
failure rates and workload characteristics. With a slim failure rate and
frequent data updates, tiering of data across the different storage media that
constitute the cache is superior to replication.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the underutilization of rich qualitative data from past studies by exploring opportunities for secondary analysis using computational tools.

Method: The authors propose a scheme for computationally intensive secondary analysis and discuss how it can enable innovative research designs.

Result: Demonstrates the potential of cross-contextual and longitudinal analyses through computational secondary analysis while addressing challenges in data sharing and reuse.

Conclusion: Computational methods can transform how qualitative data is reused, fostering new insights and designs, though challenges in data sharing persist.

Abstract: This paper draws attention to the potential of computational methods in
reworking data generated in past qualitative studies. While qualitative
inquiries often produce rich data through rigorous and resource-intensive
processes, much of this data usually remains unused. In this paper, we first
make a general case for secondary analysis of qualitative data by discussing
its benefits, distinctions, and epistemological aspects. We then argue for
opportunities with computationally intensive secondary analysis, highlighting
the possibility of drawing on data assemblages spanning multiple contexts and
timeframes to address cross-contextual and longitudinal research phenomena and
questions. We propose a scheme to perform computationally intensive secondary
analysis and advance ideas on how this approach can help facilitate the
development of innovative research designs. Finally, we enumerate some key
challenges and ongoing concerns associated with qualitative data sharing and
reuse.
