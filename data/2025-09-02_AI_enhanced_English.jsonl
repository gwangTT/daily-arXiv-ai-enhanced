The unit test generator is\ntrained to maximize a discrimination reward, which reflects its ability to\nproduce tests that expose faults in the code generator's solutions, and the\ncode generator is trained to maximize a code reward, which reflects its ability\nto produce solutions that pass the unit tests generated by the test generator.\nIn our experiments, we demonstrate that unit tests generated by Qwen3-4B\ntrained via UTRL show higher quality compared to unit tests generated by the\nsame model trained via supervised fine-tuning on human-written ground-truth\nunit tests, yielding code evaluations that more closely align with those\ninduced by the ground-truth tests.

Traditional HMR methods are\ndesigned to be user-agnostic and optimized for generalization. While these\nmethods often refine poses using constraints derived from the 2D image to\nimprove alignment, this process compromises 3D accuracy by failing to jointly\naccount for person-specific body shapes and the plausibility of 3D poses. In\ncontrast, our pipeline decouples this process by first calibrating the user's\nbody shape and then employing a personalized pose fitting process conditioned\non that shape. To achieve this, we develop a body shape-conditioned 3D pose\nprior, implemented as a Point Diffusion Transformer, which iteratively guides\nthe pose fitting via a Point Distillation Sampling loss. This learned 3D pose\nprior effectively mitigates errors arising from an over-reliance on 2D\nconstraints.

Furthermore, our method is highly data-efficient,\nrequiring only synthetic data for training, and serves as a versatile\nplug-and-play module that can be seamlessly integrated with existing 3D pose\nestimators to enhance their performance.
