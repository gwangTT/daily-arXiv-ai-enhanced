### [1] [Towards Efficient Constraint Handling in Neural Solvers for Routing Problems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16012)
*Jieyi Bi,Zhiguang Cao,Jianan Zhou,Wen Song,Yaoxin Wu,Jie Zhang,Yining Ma,Cathy Wu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces Construct-and-Refine (CaR), a framework for neural routing solvers handling hard constraints efficiently and effectively.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current neural solvers struggle with complex constraints in routing problems, as traditional approaches like feasibility masking or implicit feasibility awareness are either inefficient or inapplicable for hard constraints.

Method: The paper proposes CaR, combining learning-based feasibility refinement with joint training to create diverse, high-quality solutions suitable for lightweight improvement processes. It also incorporates a construction-improvement-shared representation for unifying the encoder.

Result: CaR outperforms classical and neural solvers in handling hard constraints by achieving better feasibility, higher solution quality, and greater efficiency.

Conclusion: Construct-and-Refine (CaR) is a promising method that addresses hard constraints in routing problems with innovative strategies, paving the way for improved efficiency and performance in complex scenarios.

Abstract: Neural solvers have achieved impressive progress in addressing simple routing problems, particularly excelling in computational efficiency. However, their advantages under complex constraints remain nascent, for which current constraint-handling schemes via feasibility masking or implicit feasibility awareness can be inefficient or inapplicable for hard constraints. In this paper, we present Construct-and-Refine (CaR), the first general and efficient constraint-handling framework for neural routing solvers based on explicit learning-based feasibility refinement. Unlike prior construction-search hybrids that target reducing optimality gaps through heavy improvements yet still struggle with hard constraints, CaR achieves efficient constraint handling by designing a joint training framework that guides the construction module to generate diverse and high-quality solutions well-suited for a lightweight improvement process, e.g., 10 steps versus 5k steps in prior work. Moreover, CaR presents the first use of construction-improvement-shared representation, enabling potential knowledge sharing across paradigms by unifying the encoder, especially in more complex constrained scenarios. We evaluate CaR on typical hard routing constraints to showcase its broader applicability. Results demonstrate that CaR achieves superior feasibility, solution quality, and efficiency compared to both classical and neural state-of-the-art solvers.

### [2] [Optimization Instability in Autonomous Agentic Workflows for Clinical Symptom Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16037)
*Cameron Cagan,Pedram Fard,Jiazi Tian,Jingya Cheng,Shawn N. Murphy,Hossein Estiri*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper investigates the paradoxical degradation in classifier performance due to optimization instability in autonomous systems like Pythia and proposes retrospective selection as a solution.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To better understand and address optimization instability in autonomous AI systems, particularly in scenarios where low-prevalence classification tasks are involved.

Method: Analyzed autonomous optimization of clinical symptom classifiers (shortness of breath, chest pain, brain fog) via Pythia framework and tested interventions: a guiding agent (active redirection) and a selector agent (retrospective iteration selection).

Result: Found that optimization instability caused catastrophic failures (e.g., high accuracy but zero positive detections). Selector agent intervention stabilized the system, outperforming expert-curated methods (331% F1 improvement for brain fog, 7% for chest pain).

Conclusion: Optimization instability is a critical failure mode of autonomous systems, and retrospective selection methods outperform active guiding interventions for stabilization, particularly in low-prevalence tasks.

Abstract: Autonomous agentic workflows that iteratively refine their own behavior hold considerable promise, yet their failure modes remain poorly characterized. We investigate optimization instability, a phenomenon in which continued autonomous improvement paradoxically degrades classifier performance, using Pythia, an open-source framework for automated prompt optimization. Evaluating three clinical symptoms with varying prevalence (shortness of breath at 23%, chest pain at 12%, and Long COVID brain fog at 3%), we observed that validation sensitivity oscillated between 1.0 and 0.0 across iterations, with severity inversely proportional to class prevalence. At 3% prevalence, the system achieved 95% accuracy while detecting zero positive cases, a failure mode obscured by standard evaluation metrics. We evaluated two interventions: a guiding agent that actively redirected optimization, amplifying overfitting rather than correcting it, and a selector agent that retrospectively identified the best-performing iteration successfully prevented catastrophic failure. With selector agent oversight, the system outperformed expert-curated lexicons on brain fog detection by 331% (F1) and chest pain by 7%, despite requiring only a single natural language term as input. These findings characterize a critical failure mode of autonomous AI systems and demonstrate that retrospective selection outperforms active intervention for stabilization in low-prevalence classification tasks.

### [3] [How Uncertain Is the Grade? A Benchmark of Uncertainty Metrics for LLM-Based Automatic Assessment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16039)
*Hang Li,Kaiqi Yang,Xianxuan Long,Fedor Filippov,Yucheng Chu,Yasemin Copur-Gencturk,Peng He,Cory Miller,Namsoo Shin,Joseph Krajcik,Hui Liu,Jiliang Tang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper explores the challenges of output uncertainty in large language models (LLMs) for automatic assessment in education and benchmarks various methods for uncertainty quantification. It analyzes uncertainty behaviors and patterns with the aim to improve grading reliability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Automatic assessment in education relies on reliable uncertainty estimates, as poor calibration can negatively impact pedagogical actions like feedback and instructional decisions. Understanding and addressing output uncertainty in LLMs is critical for their effective use in grading.

Method: The paper benchmarks a range of methods for quantifying uncertainty in LLM-based automatic assessment across diverse datasets, model families, and decoding strategies, with a focus on analyzing uncertainty patterns.

Result: Comprehensive analyses reveal the strengths, limitations, and patterns of various uncertainty metrics in grading tasks, influenced by assessment types, LLM model families, and generation settings.

Conclusion: This study identifies actionable insights into uncertainty behaviors in LLM-based grading and advocates for developing more reliable uncertainty-aware assessment systems for future use.

Abstract: The rapid rise of large language models (LLMs) is reshaping the landscape of automatic assessment in education. While these systems demonstrate substantial advantages in adaptability to diverse question types and flexibility in output formats, they also introduce new challenges related to output uncertainty, stemming from the inherently probabilistic nature of LLMs. Output uncertainty is an inescapable challenge in automatic assessment, as assessment results often play a critical role in informing subsequent pedagogical actions, such as providing feedback to students or guiding instructional decisions. Unreliable or poorly calibrated uncertainty estimates can lead to unstable downstream interventions, potentially disrupting students' learning processes and resulting in unintended negative consequences. To systematically understand this challenge and inform future research, we benchmark a broad range of uncertainty quantification methods in the context of LLM-based automatic assessment. Although the effectiveness of these methods has been demonstrated in many tasks across other domains, their applicability and reliability in educational settings, particularly for automatic grading, remain underexplored. Through comprehensive analyses of uncertainty behaviors across multiple assessment datasets, LLM families, and generation control settings, we characterize the uncertainty patterns exhibited by LLMs in grading scenarios. Based on these findings, we evaluate the strengths and limitations of different uncertainty metrics and analyze the influence of key factors, including model families, assessment tasks, and decoding strategies, on uncertainty estimates. Our study provides actionable insights into the characteristics of uncertainty in LLM-based automatic assessment and lays the groundwork for developing more reliable and effective uncertainty-aware grading systems in the future.

### [4] [Evidence-Grounded Subspecialty Reasoning: Evaluating a Curated Clinical Intelligence Layer on the 2025 Endocrinology Board-Style Examination](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16050)
*Amir Hosseinian,MohammadReza Zare Shahneh,Umer Mansoor,Gilbert Szeto,Kirill Karlin,Nima Aghaeepour*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: January Mirror, a clinical reasoning system grounded in evidence, outperformed top language models and human references in endocrinology board-style exam accuracy while ensuring reliable evidence citation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in subspecialty clinical reasoning, such as interpreting nuanced evidence and applying rapidly evolving guidelines, by developing a system that integrates structured reasoning with reliable, curated evidence.

Method: January Mirror was tested against frontier LLMs on an endocrinology board-style exam, using a closed-evidence approach with curated corpus for evidence-grounded structured reasoning. Comparator models utilized real-time web access.

Result: Mirror achieved superior accuracy (87.5%), outperforming both human references and frontier LLMs, with higher performance on the most difficult questions. It also demonstrated exceptional citation accuracy and evidence traceability.

Conclusion: Structured reasoning systems using curated evidence can surpass web-reliant models in subspecialty reasoning tasks, providing auditability and improving clinical deployment trustworthiness.

Abstract: Background: Large language models have demonstrated strong performance on general medical examinations, but subspecialty clinical reasoning remains challenging due to rapidly evolving guidelines and nuanced evidence hierarchies. Methods: We evaluated January Mirror, an evidence-grounded clinical reasoning system, against frontier LLMs (GPT-5, GPT-5.2, Gemini-3-Pro) on a 120-question endocrinology board-style examination. Mirror integrates a curated endocrinology and cardiometabolic evidence corpus with a structured reasoning architecture to generate evidence-linked outputs. Mirror operated under a closed-evidence constraint without external retrieval. Comparator LLMs had real-time web access to guidelines and primary literature. Results: Mirror achieved 87.5% accuracy (105/120; 95% CI: 80.4-92.3%), exceeding a human reference of 62.3% and frontier LLMs including GPT-5.2 (74.6%), GPT-5 (74.0%), and Gemini-3-Pro (69.8%). On the 30 most difficult questions (human accuracy less than 50%), Mirror achieved 76.7% accuracy. Top-2 accuracy was 92.5% for Mirror versus 85.25% for GPT-5.2. Conclusions: Mirror provided evidence traceability: 74.2% of outputs cited at least one guideline-tier source, with 100% citation accuracy on manual verification. Curated evidence with explicit provenance can outperform unconstrained web retrieval for subspecialty clinical reasoning and supports auditability for clinical deployment.

### [5] [Improving Interactive In-Context Learning from Natural Language Feedback](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16066)
*Martin Klissarov,Jonathan Cook,Diego Antognini,Hao Sun,Jingling Li,Natasha Jaques,Claudiu Musat,Edward Grefenstette*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes a framework to enhance large language models' ability to adapt interactively to corrective feedback, treating it as a trainable skill rather than an emergent property.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current large language models lack dynamic adaptability as they rely on static corpora and cannot effectively integrate feedback during interactions.

Method: The authors presented a scalable approach by converting single-turn tasks into multi-turn learning interactions using information asymmetry, training models to process and learn from language feedback iteratively.

Result: The proposed training method significantly improved the smaller models' interactive learning abilities, achieving multi-turn performance close to much larger models and generalizing well to out-of-distribution domains like coding and puzzles.

Conclusion: The approach enhances in-context learning adaptability and creates a pathway for self-improving language models by converting external feedback signals into internal self-correction capabilities.

Abstract: Adapting one's thought process based on corrective feedback is an essential ability in human learning, particularly in collaborative settings. In contrast, the current large language model training paradigm relies heavily on modeling vast, static corpora. While effective for knowledge acquisition, it overlooks the interactive feedback loops essential for models to adapt dynamically to their context. In this work, we propose a framework that treats this interactive in-context learning ability not as an emergent property, but as a distinct, trainable skill. We introduce a scalable method that transforms single-turn verifiable tasks into multi-turn didactic interactions driven by information asymmetry. We first show that current flagship models struggle to integrate corrective feedback on hard reasoning tasks. We then demonstrate that models trained with our approach dramatically improve the ability to interactively learn from language feedback. More specifically, the multi-turn performance of a smaller model nearly reaches that of a model an order of magnitude larger. We also observe robust out-of-distribution generalization: interactive training on math problems transfers to diverse domains like coding, puzzles and maze navigation. Our qualitative analysis suggests that this improvement is due to an enhanced in-context plasticity. Finally, we show that this paradigm offers a unified path to self-improvement. By training the model to predict the teacher's critiques, effectively modeling the feedback environment, we convert this external signal into an internal capability, allowing the model to self-correct even without a teacher.

### [6] [GPSBench: Do Large Language Models Understand GPS Coordinates?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16105)
*Thinh Hung Truong,Jey Han Lau,Jianzhong Qi*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Introducing GPSBench, a dataset for assessing LLMs' geospatial reasoning abilities across 57,800 samples and 17 tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the limited exploration of LLMs' abilities to process GPS coordinates and geography for applications interacting with the physical world.

Method: Evaluated 14 state-of-the-art LLMs using the GPSBench dataset focusing on intrinsic model capabilities without external tools.

Result: LLMs showed varied performance, excelling in real-world geographic reasoning over geometric computations, and country-level localization outperformed city-level.

Conclusion: Robust geospatial reasoning in LLMs is challenging. GPS-coordinate augmentation aids tasks while finetuning balances geometric skills and knowledge retention.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in applications that interact with the physical world, such as navigation, robotics, or mapping, making robust geospatial reasoning a critical capability. Despite that, LLMs' ability to reason about GPS coordinates and real-world geography remains underexplored. We introduce GPSBench, a dataset of 57,800 samples across 17 tasks for evaluating geospatial reasoning in LLMs, spanning geometric coordinate operations (e.g., distance and bearing computation) and reasoning that integrates coordinates with world knowledge. Focusing on intrinsic model capabilities rather than tool use, we evaluate 14 state-of-the-art LLMs and find that GPS reasoning remains challenging, with substantial variation across tasks: models are generally more reliable at real-world geographic reasoning than at geometric computations. Geographic knowledge degrades hierarchically, with strong country-level performance but weak city-level localization, while robustness to coordinate noise suggests genuine coordinate understanding rather than memorization. We further show that GPS-coordinate augmentation can improve in downstream geospatial tasks, and that finetuning induces trade-offs between gains in geometric computation and degradation in world knowledge. Our dataset and reproducible code are available at https://github.com/joey234/gpsbench

### [7] [Learning Personalized Agents from Human Feedback](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16173)
*Kaiqu Liang,Julia Kruk,Shengyi Qian,Xianjun Yang,Shengjie Bi,Yuanshun Yao,Shaoliang Nie,Mingyang Zhang,Lijuan Liu,Jaime Fernández Fisac,Shuyan Zhou,Saghar Hosseini*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces PAHF, a framework for AI agents to continuously adapt to individual user preferences using explicit per-user memory.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI agents often fail to adapt to evolving and personalized preferences of users, especially for new users or shifting preferences.

Method: PAHF uses a three-step loop involving pre-action clarification, preference-grounded actions, and post-action feedback for real-time adaptation.

Result: Empirical and theoretical analysis show PAHF enables faster learning and better adaptation compared to baseline approaches.

Conclusion: Explicit memory and dual feedback channels are essential for effective personalized AI, reducing errors and enabling adaptability.

Abstract: Modern AI agents are powerful but often fail to align with the idiosyncratic, evolving preferences of individual users. Prior approaches typically rely on static datasets, either training implicit preference models on interaction history or encoding user profiles in external memory. However, these approaches struggle with new users and with preferences that change over time. We introduce Personalized Agents from Human Feedback (PAHF), a framework for continual personalization in which agents learn online from live interaction using explicit per-user memory. PAHF operationalizes a three-step loop: (1) seeking pre-action clarification to resolve ambiguity, (2) grounding actions in preferences retrieved from memory, and (3) integrating post-action feedback to update memory when preferences drift. To evaluate this capability, we develop a four-phase protocol and two benchmarks in embodied manipulation and online shopping. These benchmarks quantify an agent's ability to learn initial preferences from scratch and subsequently adapt to persona shifts. Our theoretical analysis and empirical results show that integrating explicit memory with dual feedback channels is critical: PAHF learns substantially faster and consistently outperforms both no-memory and single-channel baselines, reducing initial personalization error and enabling rapid adaptation to preference shifts.

### [8] [EnterpriseGym Corecraft: Training Generalizable Agents on High-Fidelity RL Environments](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16179)
*Sushant Mehta,Logan Ritchie,Suhaas Garre,Nick Heiner,Edwin Chen*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The study demonstrates training AI agents in high-fidelity reinforcement learning environments enables generalization beyond training data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess whether AI agents can solve multi-step, domain-specific tasks demanded in real-world jobs.

Method: Introduced Corecraft, a simulation environment, and trained GLM 4.6 with GRPO and adaptive clipping.

Result: Task pass rates improved post-training, with significant performance transfer to out-of-distribution benchmarks.

Conclusion: High-quality, diverse, and realistic training environments are crucial for developing generalizable AI agent capabilities.

Abstract: We show that training AI agents on high-fidelity reinforcement learning environments produces capabilities that generalize beyond the training distribution. We introduce \corecraft{}, the first environment in \textsc{EnterpriseGym}, Surge AI's suite of agentic RL environments. \corecraft{} is a fully operational enterprise simulation of a customer support organization, comprising over 2,500 entities across 14 entity types with 23 unique tools, designed to measure whether AI agents can perform the multi-step, domain-specific work that real jobs demand. Frontier models such as GPT-5.2 and Claude Opus 4.6 solve fewer than 30\% of tasks when all expert-authored rubric criteria must be satisfied. Using this environment, we train GLM~4.6 with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) and adaptive clipping. After a single epoch of training, the model improves from 25.37\% to 36.76\% task pass rate on held-out evaluation tasks. More importantly, these gains transfer to out-of-distribution benchmarks: +4.5\% on BFCL Parallel, +7.4\% on $τ^2$-Bench Retail, and +6.8\% on Toolathlon (Pass@1). We believe three environment properties are consistent with the observed transfer: task-centric world building that optimizes for diverse, challenging tasks; expert-authored rubrics enabling reliable reward computation; and enterprise workflows that reflect realistic professional patterns. Our results suggest that environment quality, diversity, and realism are key factors enabling generalizable agent capabilities.

*Hiroaki Yamanaka,Daisuke Miyashita,Takashi Toi,Asuka Maki,Taiga Ikeda,Jun Deguchi*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper advocates for alternative approaches to 'memory' design in Artificial Superintelligence by focusing on retaining raw experiences and leveraging them flexibly, instead of only storing extracted information.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the inherent limitations of the current 'extract then store' paradigm in memory design for ASI, which often results in information loss and inefficiency.

Method: Proposes and evaluates alternative memory paradigms, such as 'store then on-demand extract,' discovering deeper insights from probabilistic experiences, and improving collection efficiency via experience sharing.

Result: Simple experiments demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed approaches, affirming their potential to avoid information loss and enhance task flexibility.

Conclusion: Alternative memory paradigms hold significant promise, but their adoption is hindered by research challenges; the paper calls for further exploration to overcome these barriers.

Abstract: Driven by our mission of "uplifting the world with memory," this paper explores the design concept of "memory" that is essential for achieving artificial superintelligence (ASI). Rather than proposing novel methods, we focus on several alternative approaches whose potential benefits are widely imaginable, yet have remained largely unexplored. The currently dominant paradigm, which can be termed "extract then store," involves extracting information judged to be useful from experiences and saving only the extracted content. However, this approach inherently risks the loss of information, as some valuable knowledge particularly for different tasks may be discarded in the extraction process. In contrast, we emphasize the "store then on-demand extract" approach, which seeks to retain raw experiences and flexibly apply them to various tasks as needed, thus avoiding such information loss. In addition, we highlight two further approaches: discovering deeper insights from large collections of probabilistic experiences, and improving experience collection efficiency by sharing stored experiences. While these approaches seem intuitively effective, our simple experiments demonstrate that this is indeed the case. Finally, we discuss major challenges that have limited investigation into these promising directions and propose research topics to address them.

### [10] [Toward Scalable Verifiable Reward: Proxy State-Based Evaluation for Multi-turn Tool-Calling LLM Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16246)
*Yun-Shiuan Chuang,Chaitanya Kulkarni,Alec Chiu,Avinash Thangali,Zijie Pan,Shivani Shekhar,Yirou Ge,Yixi Li,Uma Kona,Linsey Pang,Prakhar Mehrotra*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces Proxy State-Based Evaluation, a framework to benchmark large language model agents through structured proxy states without relying on fully deterministic databases.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks for interactive large language model agents are costly due to reliance on deterministic backends, thus requiring a scalable and reliable evaluation method.

Method: The proposed framework uses specified scenarios, LLM state trackers for structured proxy states, LLM judges to verify goal completion, and analyzes hallucinations and variations in user personas through simulated rollouts.

Result: Experimental results showed stable rankings across models, effective supervision transferable to new scenarios, and high agreement rates over 90% between human judges and LLM judges.

Conclusion: Proxy state-based evaluation provides a scalable and practical alternative to deterministic benchmarks for assessing LLM agents, offering reliable automated evaluation and enabling sensitivity analyses.

Abstract: Interactive large language model (LLM) agents operating via multi-turn dialogue and multi-step tool calling are increasingly used in production. Benchmarks for these agents must both reliably compare models and yield on-policy training data. Prior agentic benchmarks (e.g., tau-bench, tau2-bench, AppWorld) rely on fully deterministic backends, which are costly to build and iterate. We propose Proxy State-Based Evaluation, an LLM-driven simulation framework that preserves final state-based evaluation without a deterministic database. Specifically, a scenario specifies the user goal, user/system facts, expected final state, and expected agent behavior, and an LLM state tracker infers a structured proxy state from the full interaction trace. LLM judges then verify goal completion and detect tool/user hallucinations against scenario constraints. Empirically, our benchmark produces stable, model-differentiating rankings across families and inference-time reasoning efforts, and its on-/off-policy rollouts provide supervision that transfers to unseen scenarios. Careful scenario specification yields near-zero simulator hallucination rates as supported by ablation studies. The framework also supports sensitivity analyses over user personas. Human-LLM judge agreement exceeds 90%, indicating reliable automated evaluation. Overall, proxy state-based evaluation offers a practical, scalable alternative to deterministic agentic benchmarks for industrial LLM agents.

### [11] [Multi-agent cooperation through in-context co-player inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16301)
*Marissa A. Weis,Maciej Wołczyk,Rajai Nasser,Rif A. Saurous,Blaise Agüera y Arcas,João Sacramento,Alexander Meulemans*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper explores achieving cooperation among self-interested agents using sequence model agents capable of in-context learning, avoiding hardcoded assumptions and strict timescale separation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the challenge of fostering mutual cooperation among self-interested agents in multi-agent reinforcement learning without relying on rigid or restricted assumptions about co-players’ learning.

Method: The paper demonstrates the use of sequence models trained on diverse co-players to induce in-context best-response strategies that drive cooperation.

Result: It shows that in-context learning enables agents to adapt and shape each other’s behavior, leading to naturally emergent cooperative interaction.

Conclusion: Decentralized reinforcement learning with sequence models and co-player diversity offers a scalable approach to achieving cooperative behavior among agents.

Abstract: Achieving cooperation among self-interested agents remains a fundamental challenge in multi-agent reinforcement learning. Recent work showed that mutual cooperation can be induced between "learning-aware" agents that account for and shape the learning dynamics of their co-players. However, existing approaches typically rely on hardcoded, often inconsistent, assumptions about co-player learning rules or enforce a strict separation between "naive learners" updating on fast timescales and "meta-learners" observing these updates. Here, we demonstrate that the in-context learning capabilities of sequence models allow for co-player learning awareness without requiring hardcoded assumptions or explicit timescale separation. We show that training sequence model agents against a diverse distribution of co-players naturally induces in-context best-response strategies, effectively functioning as learning algorithms on the fast intra-episode timescale. We find that the cooperative mechanism identified in prior work-where vulnerability to extortion drives mutual shaping-emerges naturally in this setting: in-context adaptation renders agents vulnerable to extortion, and the resulting mutual pressure to shape the opponent's in-context learning dynamics resolves into the learning of cooperative behavior. Our results suggest that standard decentralized reinforcement learning on sequence models combined with co-player diversity provides a scalable path to learning cooperative behaviors.

### [12] [Verifiable Semantics for Agent-to-Agent Communication](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16424)
*Philipp Schoenegger,Matt Carlson,Chris Schneider,Chris Daly*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces a protocol to ensure consistent communication among multiagent AI systems by certifying shared understanding. It reduces communication disagreement via core-guarded reasoning and proposes avenues for preserving shared vocabulary.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multiagent systems need clear communication, but standard methods risk semantic drift or are not interpretable. Ensuring agents share the same understanding of terms is crucial for effective collaboration.

Method: The authors developed a certification protocol based on the stimulus-meaning model, testing agents on shared observable events and certifying terms with low empirical disagreement. They implemented core-guarded reasoning and mechanisms for drift detection and vocabulary renegotiation.

Result: The protocol reduces disagreement in simulations by 72-96% and in fine-tuned language model experiments by 51%.

Conclusion: The proposed certification framework ensures verifiable and reliable communication between agents, serving as a foundational step for multiagent AI systems.

Abstract: Multiagent AI systems require consistent communication, but we lack methods to verify that agents share the same understanding of the terms used. Natural language is interpretable but vulnerable to semantic drift, while learned protocols are efficient but opaque. We propose a certification protocol based on the stimulus-meaning model, where agents are tested on shared observable events and terms are certified if empirical disagreement falls below a statistical threshold. In this protocol, agents restricting their reasoning to certified terms ("core-guarded reasoning") achieve provably bounded disagreement. We also outline mechanisms for detecting drift (recertification) and recovering shared vocabulary (renegotiation). In simulations with varying degrees of semantic divergence, core-guarding reduces disagreement by 72-96%. In a validation with fine-tuned language models, disagreement is reduced by 51%. Our framework provides a first step towards verifiable agent-to-agent communication.

### [13] [Causally-Guided Automated Feature Engineering with Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16435)
*Arun Vignesh Malarkkan,Wangyang Ying,Yanjie Fu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces CAFE, a causally-guided framework for automated feature engineering (AFE), that improves robustness and efficiency under data distribution shifts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the brittleness and inefficiency of current AFE methods that rely on statistical heuristics and fail under distribution shifts.

Method: CAFE introduces a two-phase causally-guided framework: (1) learns causal structure for soft priors using a directed acyclic graph and (2) employs a multi-agent deep Q-learning strategy to construct features using causal exploration strategies.

Result: CAFE achieves up to 7% performance improvement over baselines across 15 benchmarks, better handles covariate shifts, and generates more compact, stable feature sets.

Conclusion: Integrating causal structure as a soft inductive prior significantly enhances AFE's robustness, efficiency, and adaptability, providing better performance even under challenging distribution shifts.

Abstract: Automated feature engineering (AFE) enables AI systems to autonomously construct high-utility representations from raw tabular data. However, existing AFE methods rely on statistical heuristics, yielding brittle features that fail under distribution shift. We introduce CAFE, a framework that reformulates AFE as a causally-guided sequential decision process, bridging causal discovery with reinforcement learning-driven feature construction. Phase I learns a sparse directed acyclic graph over features and the target to obtain soft causal priors, grouping features as direct, indirect, or other based on their causal influence with respect to the target. Phase II uses a cascading multi-agent deep Q-learning architecture to select causal groups and transformation operators, with hierarchical reward shaping and causal group-level exploration strategies that favor causally plausible transformations while controlling feature complexity. Across 15 public benchmarks (classification with macro-F1; regression with inverse relative absolute error), CAFE achieves up to 7% improvement over strong AFE baselines, reduces episodes-to-convergence, and delivers competitive time-to-target. Under controlled covariate shifts, CAFE reduces performance drop by ~4x relative to a non-causal multi-agent baseline, and produces more compact feature sets with more stable post-hoc attributions. These findings underscore that causal structure, used as a soft inductive prior rather than a rigid constraint, can substantially improve the robustness and efficiency of automated feature engineering.

### [14] [Leveraging Large Language Models for Causal Discovery: a Constraint-based, Argumentation-driven Approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16481)
*Zihao Li,Fabrizio Russo*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper integrates large language models (LLMs) into Causal Assumption-based Argumentation (ABA) for causal discovery, combining semantic priors from expert knowledge with data-driven methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of constructing principled causal graphs by combining observational data and expert knowledge, leveraging both statistical methods and symbolic reasoning.

Method: The authors use LLMs to provide semantic structural priors based on variable names and descriptions alongside conditional-independence evidence. They also introduce an evaluation protocol to avoid memorisation bias in LLM-based causal discovery.

Result: Their approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on benchmarks and synthetic graphs, demonstrating effective integration of LLMs in causal discovery.

Conclusion: LLMs can serve as imperfect expert input for Causal ABA, effectively combining semantic reasoning with data to construct causal graphs, advancing methods for more accurate causal discovery.

Abstract: Causal discovery seeks to uncover causal relations from data, typically represented as causal graphs, and is essential for predicting the effects of interventions. While expert knowledge is required to construct principled causal graphs, many statistical methods have been proposed to leverage observational data with varying formal guarantees. Causal Assumption-based Argumentation (ABA) is a framework that uses symbolic reasoning to ensure correspondence between input constraints and output graphs, while offering a principled way to combine data and expertise. We explore the use of large language models (LLMs) as imperfect experts for Causal ABA, eliciting semantic structural priors from variable names and descriptions and integrating them with conditional-independence evidence. Experiments on standard benchmarks and semantically grounded synthetic graphs demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, and we additionally introduce an evaluation protocol to mitigate memorisation bias when assessing LLMs for causal discovery.

*Felix Fricke,Simon Malberg,Georg Groh*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Framework of Thoughts (FoT) enhances reasoning capabilities of language models by providing a dynamic and optimized framework for reasoning schemes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing reasoning schemes like Chain of Thought and Tree of Thoughts struggle with static, problem-specific structures and lack optimization, which limits adaptability and efficiency.

Method: FoT introduces a dynamic framework with built-in features such as hyperparameter tuning, prompt optimization, parallel execution, and caching to enhance reasoning schemes.

Result: FoT implementations show faster execution, reduced costs, and improved task performance in comparison to traditional methods.

Conclusion: FoT provides a general-purpose platform for optimizing reasoning schemes, promoting dynamic adaptability and efficiency, and opens avenues for further research with its released codebase.

Abstract: Prompting schemes such as Chain of Thought, Tree of Thoughts, and Graph of Thoughts can significantly enhance the reasoning capabilities of large language models. However, most existing schemes require users to define static, problem-specific reasoning structures that lack adaptability to dynamic or unseen problem types. Additionally, these schemes are often under-optimized in terms of hyperparameters, prompts, runtime, and prompting cost. To address these limitations, we introduce Framework of Thoughts (FoT)--a general-purpose foundation framework for building and optimizing dynamic reasoning schemes. FoT comes with built-in features for hyperparameter tuning, prompt optimization, parallel execution, and intelligent caching, unlocking the latent performance potential of reasoning schemes. We demonstrate FoT's capabilities by implementing three popular schemes--Tree of Thoughts, Graph of Thoughts, and ProbTree--within FoT. We empirically show that FoT enables significantly faster execution, reduces costs, and achieves better task scores through optimization. We release our codebase to facilitate the development of future dynamic and efficient reasoning schemes.

*Vered Tohar,Tsahi Hayat,Amir Leshem*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper explores whether a machine can write high-quality poetry and reports on a seven-month workshop shaping a large language model into a credible digital poet.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate if machines can produce poetry that is indistinguishable from human-written poems and to address deeper questions about creativity and authorship.

Method: A seven-month iterative workshop involving expert feedback was conducted to shape a language model into a poet, without retraining it. The process enabled the development of style and corpus, tested against human-written poetry in blinded evaluations.

Result: The model created poems judged indistinguishably from human-written ones, with human and AI-authored poems being labeled equally at chance levels. The model also produced a pen name and author image, and its collection was published commercially.

Conclusion: Workshop-style prompting can facilitate long-term creative development in AI, challenging traditional perspectives on creativity and authorship.

Abstract: Can a machine write good poetry? Any positive answer raises fundamental questions about the nature and value of art. We report a seven-month poetry workshop in which a large language model was shaped into a digital poet through iterative in-context expert feedback, without retraining. Across sessions, the model developed a distinctive style and a coherent corpus, supported by quantitative and qualitative analyses, and it produced a pen name and author image. In a blinded authorship test with 50 humanities students and graduates (three AI poems and three poems by well-known poets each), judgments were at chance: human poems were labeled human 54% of the time and AI poems 52%, with 95% confidence intervals including 50%. After the workshop, a commercial publisher released a poetry collection authored by the model. These results show that workshop-style prompting can support long-horizon creative shaping and renew debates on creativity and authorship.

### [17] [Agent Skill Framework: Perspectives on the Potential of Small Language Models in Industrial Environments](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16653)
*Yangjie Xu,Lujun Li,Lama Sleem,Niccolo Gentile,Yewei Song,Yiqun Wang,Siming Ji,Wenbo Wu,Radu State*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper investigates whether the Agent Skill framework, known for enhancing tasks in large proprietary models, can extend its benefits to small language models (SLMs), often required by industrial constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to determine if the Agent Skill paradigm can address limitations of SLMs in scenarios where public API reliance is not viable due to security and budget concerns, and where SLMs fail in highly customized tasks.

Method: The paper introduces a mathematical definition for the Agent Skill process, followed by an evaluation on multiple use cases, including open-source tasks and an insurance claims dataset, with LMs varying in size.

Result: Findings indicate tiny models struggle with skill selection, while moderately sized SLMs benefit significantly. Code-optimized 80B parameter models matched proprietary systems' performance while improving efficiency.

Conclusion: The study provides a nuanced understanding of the Agent Skill framework's scalability and offers guidance for its deployment with small language models in industrial settings.

Abstract: Agent Skill framework, now widely and officially supported by major players such as GitHub Copilot, LangChain, and OpenAI, performs especially well with proprietary models by improving context engineering, reducing hallucinations, and boosting task accuracy. Based on these observations, an investigation is conducted to determine whether the Agent Skill paradigm provides similar benefits to small language models (SLMs). This question matters in industrial scenarios where continuous reliance on public APIs is infeasible due to data-security and budget constraints requirements, and where SLMs often show limited generalization in highly customized scenarios. This work introduces a formal mathematical definition of the Agent Skill process, followed by a systematic evaluation of language models of varying sizes across multiple use cases. The evaluation encompasses two open-source tasks and a real-world insurance claims data set. The results show that tiny models struggle with reliable skill selection, while moderately sized SLMs (approximately 12B - 30B) parameters) benefit substantially from the Agent Skill approach. Moreover, code-specialized variants at around 80B parameters achieve performance comparable to closed-source baselines while improving GPU efficiency. Collectively, these findings provide a comprehensive and nuanced characterization of the capabilities and constraints of the framework, while providing actionable insights for the effective deployment of Agent Skills in SLM-centered environments.

*Stephan Rabanser,Sayash Kapoor,Peter Kirgis,Kangheng Liu,Saiteja Utpala,Arvind Narayanan*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper identifies a gap in current AI evaluation methods by introducing 12 new metrics focusing on consistency, robustness, predictability, and safety to measure agent reliability across dimensions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Despite improving accuracy on benchmarks, many AI agents fail in practice, suggesting traditional evaluation metrics overlook key operational dimensions like reliability and safety.

Method: The authors propose a framework featuring 12 metrics that assess reliability across four dimensions: consistency, robustness, predictability, and safety. They test 14 AI models on two benchmarks for evaluation.

Result: Findings reveal that while AI models demonstrate capability improvements, their reliability has seen only modest advancements, emphasizing the importance of the new metrics for deeper evaluation.

Conclusion: The proposed metrics provide a complementary approach to traditional evaluations, helping uncover limitations in AI agents and offering tools to analyze their behaviors and failures holistically.

Abstract: AI agents are increasingly deployed to execute important tasks. While rising accuracy scores on standard benchmarks suggest rapid progress, many agents still continue to fail in practice. This discrepancy highlights a fundamental limitation of current evaluations: compressing agent behavior into a single success metric obscures critical operational flaws. Notably, it ignores whether agents behave consistently across runs, withstand perturbations, fail predictably, or have bounded error severity. Grounded in safety-critical engineering, we provide a holistic performance profile by proposing twelve concrete metrics that decompose agent reliability along four key dimensions: consistency, robustness, predictability, and safety. Evaluating 14 agentic models across two complementary benchmarks, we find that recent capability gains have only yielded small improvements in reliability. By exposing these persistent limitations, our metrics complement traditional evaluations while offering tools for reasoning about how agents perform, degrade, and fail.

Main category: cs.AR

TL;DR: The study addresses real-time few-shot learning on FPGA SoCs with customizable bit-widths, achieving higher performance and maintaining accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable real-time few-shot learning on FPGA SoCs with arbitrary bit-widths, overcoming limitations of conventional design environments.

Method: Utilized the FINN framework with customized optimizations for handling data format mismatches and converting operations.

Result: Achieved reduced bit-width with retained accuracy and doubled throughput on CIFAR-10 evaluations.

Conclusion: The proposed method optimizes FPGA SoC usage for real-time few-shot learning, demonstrating enhanced performance and flexibility.

Abstract: In this study, we propose an implementation methodology of real-time few-shot learning on tiny FPGA SoCs such as the PYNQ-Z1 board with arbitrary fixed-point bit-widths. Tensil-based conventional design environments limited hardware implementations to fixed-point bit-widths of 16 or 32 bits. To address this, we adopt the FINN framework, enabling implementations with arbitrary bit-widths. Several customizations and minor adjustments are made, including: 1.Optimization of Transpose nodes to resolve data format mismatches, 2.Addition of handling for converting the final reduce mean operation to Global Average Pooling (GAP). These adjustments allow us to reduce the bit-width while maintaining the same accuracy as the conventional realization, and achieve approximately twice the throughput in evaluations using CIFAR-10 dataset.

TL;DR: The paper introduces DARTH-PUM, a hybrid in-memory computing architecture integrating analog and digital processing for general-purpose computation, boosting efficiency and scalability across multiple domains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the limitations of analog PUM confined to specific tasks by facilitating its use in general-purpose computation through integration with digital PUM.

Method: The authors propose DARTH-PUM, combining hardware features like optimized circuitry, interfacing mechanisms, flexible data width, and a user-friendly programming interface to execute complex kernels completely in-memory.

Result: DARTH-PUM demonstrates significant speedups (59.4x, 14.8x, and 40.8x) in applications like AES encryption, CNNs, and large-language models compared to a traditional analog+CPU baseline.

Conclusion: DARTH-PUM succeeds as a practical, scalable hybrid architecture, capable of efficiently supporting a wide range of computational tasks in embedded and large-scale scenarios.

Abstract: Analog processing-using-memory (PUM; a.k.a. in-memory computing) makes use of electrical interactions inside memory arrays to perform bulk matrix-vector multiplication (MVM) operations. However, many popular matrix-based kernels need to execute non-MVM operations, which analog PUM cannot directly perform. To retain its energy efficiency, analog PUM architectures augment memory arrays with CMOS-based domain-specific fixed-function hardware to provide complete kernel functionality, but the difficulty of integrating such specialized CMOS logic with memory arrays has largely limited analog PUM to being an accelerator for machine learning inference, or for closely related kernels. An opportunity exists to harness analog PUM for general-purpose computation: recent works have shown that memory arrays can also perform Boolean PUM operations, albeit with very different supporting hardware and electrical signals than analog PUM.
  We propose DARTH-PUM, a general-purpose hybrid PUM architecture that tackles key hardware and software challenges to integrating analog PUM and digital PUM. We propose optimized peripheral circuitry, coordinating hardware to manage and interface between both types of PUM, an easy-to-use programming interface, and low-cost support for flexible data widths. These design elements allow us to build a practical PUM architecture that can execute kernels fully in memory, and can scale easily to cater to domains ranging from embedded applications to large-scale data-driven computing. We show how three popular applications (AES encryption, convolutional neural networks, large-language models) can map to and benefit from DARTH-PUM, with speedups of 59.4x, 14.8x, and 40.8x over an analog+CPU baseline.

TL;DR: The paper proposes an energy-efficient FPGA architecture for stochastic simulated quantum annealing, addressing scalability and memory challenges in conventional p-bit-based systems, achieving significant reductions in energy and resource usage.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome scalability limitations and high resource requirements of existing p-bit-based simulated annealing accelerators for stochastic optimization problems.

Method: The paper uses an FPGA design integrating spin-serial and replica-parallel update schedules, along with a dual-BRAM delay-line architecture to enable scalability for fully connected Ising models and reduce fan-out and memory overhead.

Result: The proposed FPGA architecture achieves a 50% reduction in energy consumption and 90% reduction in logic resource usage compared to prior systems, solving an 800-node MAX-CUT benchmark efficiently.

Conclusion: The work demonstrates the potential of quantum-inspired hardware for energy-efficient, large-scale combinatorial optimization, addressing previous limitations of p-bit annealers.

Abstract: Probabilistic bits (p-bits) offer an energy-efficient hardware abstraction for stochastic optimization; however, existing p-bit-based simulated annealing accelerators suffer from poor scalability and limited support for fully connected graphs due to fan-out and memory overhead. This paper presents an energy-efficient FPGA architecture for stochastic simulated quantum annealing (SSQA) that addresses these challenges. The proposed design combines a spin-serial and replica-parallel update schedule with a dual-BRAM delay-line architecture, enabling scalable support for fully connected Ising models while eliminating fan-out growth in logic resources. By exploiting SSQA, the architecture achieves fast convergence using only final replica states, significantly reducing memory requirements compared to conventional p-bit-based annealers. Implemented on a Xilinx ZC706 FPGA, the proposed system solves an 800-node MAX-CUT benchmark and achieves up to 50% reduction in energy consumption and over 90\% reduction in logic resources compared with prior FPGA-based p-bit annealing architectures. These results demonstrate the practicality of quantum-inspired, p-bit-based annealing hardware for large-scale combinatorial optimization under strict energy and resource constraints.

### [22] [The Perplexity Paradox: Why Code Compresses Better Than Math in LLM Prompts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15843)
*Warren Johnson*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper extends the work on prompt compression for code generation and reasoning tasks and introduces a new adaptive algorithm called TAAC.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations in prior studies on prompt compression, specifically validating findings across diverse benchmarks, understanding the perplexity paradox, and proposing a practical adaptive compression algorithm.

Method: The study validated findings across six code and four reasoning benchmarks, conducted per-token perplexity analysis, and introduced TAAC, an adaptive compression method.

Result: The validation showed consistent thresholds across tasks, identified task-specific perplexity trends in code and math prompts, achieved significant improvements in task performance using signature injection, and reduced costs by 22% with TAAC while maintaining 96% quality.

Conclusion: The study generalizes prompt compression thresholds, explains the perplexity paradox mechanism, and offers a cost-efficient, high-quality adaptive compression method.

Abstract: In "Compress or Route?" (Johnson, 2026), we found that code generation tolerates aggressive prompt compression (r >= 0.6) while chain-of-thought reasoning degrades gradually. That study was limited to HumanEval (164 problems), left the "perplexity paradox" mechanism unvalidated, and provided no adaptive algorithm. This paper addresses all three gaps. First, we validate across six code benchmarks (HumanEval, MBPP, HumanEval+, MultiPL-E) and four reasoning benchmarks (GSM8K, MATH, ARC-Challenge, MMLU-STEM), confirming the compression threshold generalizes across languages and difficulties. Second, we conduct the first per-token perplexity analysis (n=723 tokens), revealing a "perplexity paradox": code syntax tokens are preserved (high perplexity) while numerical values in math problems are pruned despite being task-critical (low perplexity). Signature injection recovers +34 percentage points in pass rate (5.3% to 39.3%; Cohen's h=0.890). Third, we propose TAAC (Task-Aware Adaptive Compression), achieving 22% cost reduction with 96% quality preservation, outperforming fixed-ratio compression by 7%. MBPP validation (n=1,800 trials) confirms systematic variation: 3.6% at r=0.3 to 54.6% at r=1.0.

*Inwon Kang,Parikshit Ram,Yi Zhou,Horst Samulowitz,Oshani Seneviratne*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper investigates a lightweight paradigm (TaRL) for few-shot tabular classification using semantic embeddings from deployed large language models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The heterogeneity in the structure and semantics of web tables makes it challenging to build effective unified classification methods. Additionally, leveraging already-deployed LLMs to avoid specialized models and retraining is unexplored.

Method: The authors introduce TaRL, which tackles tabular classification using semantic embeddings of table rows, combined with methods such as removing common components and calibrating softmax temperatures with a meta-learner trained on handcrafted features.

Result: The approach achieves comparable performance to state-of-the-art models in low-data regimes, demonstrating the effectiveness of adapting existing LLMs for web table classification.

Conclusion: The study underscores the potential of reusing existing LLM infrastructure to efficiently interpret web-native tables with semantically-driven techniques.

Abstract: The Web is a rich source of structured data in the form of tables, from product catalogs and knowledge bases to scientific datasets. However, the heterogeneity of the structure and semantics of these tables makes it challenging to build a unified method that can effectively leverage the information they contain. Meanwhile, Large language models (LLMs) are becoming an increasingly integral component of web infrastructure for tasks like semantic search. This raises a crucial question: can we leverage these already-deployed LLMs to classify structured data in web-native tables (e.g., product catalogs, knowledge base exports, scientific data portals), avoiding the need for specialized models or extensive retraining? This work investigates a lightweight paradigm, $\textbf{Ta}$ble $\textbf{R}$epresentation with $\textbf{L}$anguage Model~($\textbf{TaRL}$), for few-shot tabular classification that directly utilizes semantic embeddings of individual table rows. We first show that naive application of these embeddings underperforms compared to specialized tabular models. We then demonstrate that their potentials can be unlocked with two key techniques: removing the common component from all embeddings and calibrating the softmax temperature. We show that a simple meta-learner, trained on handcrafted features, can learn to predict an appropriate temperature. This approach achieves performance comparable to state-of-the-art models in low-data regimes ($k \leq 32$) of semantically-rich tables. Our findings demonstrate the viability of reusing existing LLM infrastructure for efficient semantics-driven pathway to reuse existing LLM infrastructure for Web table understanding.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address the growing challenge of large NLP model sizes by exploring Knowledge Distillation not only as a compression tool but also as a mechanism for improving supervision and translation quality in MT.

Method: The work synthesizes existing KD4MT research, offers a detailed classification of methodologies and applications, and provides guidelines, a database, and a glossary for supporting further research.

Result: The analysis identifies trends, research gaps, and challenges in applying KD to MT. It also critiques the lack of unified evaluation practices and examines risks like hallucination and bias.

Conclusion: The survey emphasizes the importance of thoughtful application of KD techniques in MT and highlights the transformative potential of large language models in the KD4MT domain.

Abstract: Knowledge Distillation (KD) as a research area has gained a lot of traction in recent years as a compression tool to address challenges related to ever-larger models in NLP. Remarkably, Machine Translation (MT) offers a much more nuanced take on this narrative: in MT, KD also functions as a general-purpose knowledge transfer mechanism that shapes supervision and translation quality as well as efficiency.
  This survey synthesizes KD for MT (KD4MT) across 105 papers (through October 1, 2025). We begin by introducing both MT and KD for non-experts, followed by an overview of the standard KD approaches relevant to MT applications. Subsequently, we categorize advances in the KD4MT literature based on (i) their methodological contributions and (ii) their practical applications. Our qualitative and quantitative analyses identify common trends in the field and highlight key research gaps as well as the absence of unified evaluation practice for KD methods in MT. We further provide practical guidelines for selecting a KD method in concrete settings and highlight potential risks associated with the application of KD to MT such as increased hallucination and bias amplification. Finally, we discuss the role of LLMs in re-shaping the KD4MT field. To support further research, we complement our survey with a publicly available database summarizing the main characteristics of the surveyed KD methods and a glossary of key terms.

*Xinyu Gao,Shaonan Wang,Nai Ding*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper presents GTCA, a syntactic robustness enhancement for decoder-only LLMs, using tree cross-attention and staged training, improving grammar handling without altering backbone architecture.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Decoder-only large language models are strong performers but struggle with grammatical perturbations, which impacts reliability in reasoning tasks.

Method: The authors proposed the gated tree cross-attention (GTCA) branch, which leverages precomputed constituency chunk memory alongside the existing model architecture, incorporating token update masking and staged training for controlled syntactic updates.

Result: GTCA improves syntactic robustness and reliability across various benchmarks without negatively affecting multiple-choice QA or commonsense reasoning tasks.

Conclusion: GTCA offers a practical solution compatible with existing model checkpoints to enhance syntax robustness in decoder-only LLMs.

Abstract: Decoder-only large language models achieve strong broad performance but are brittle to minor grammatical perturbations, undermining reliability for downstream reasoning. However, directly injecting explicit syntactic structure into an existing checkpoint can interfere with its pretrained competence. We introduce a checkpoint-compatible gated tree cross-attention (GTCA) branch that reads precomputed constituency chunk memory while leaving backbone architecture unchanged. Our design uses a token update mask and staged training to control the scope and timing of structural updates. Across benchmarks and Transformer backbones, GTCA strengthens syntactic robustness beyond continued-training baselines without compromising Multiple-Choice QA performance or commonsense reasoning, providing a practical checkpoint-compatible route to more syntax-robust decoder-only LLMs.

*Pranav Bhandari,Usman Naseem,Mehwish Nasim*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper investigates the geometric relationships of Big Five personality steering directions in large language models, revealing that steering one trait often impacts others despite attempts to enforce independence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess the assumption that personality traits in large language models can be controlled independently and explore challenges in achieving independent personality steering.

Method: Analysis of personality steering vectors in two language model families (LLaMA-3-8B and Mistral-8B) using various geometric conditioning techniques, including unconstrained directions and orthonormalisation.

Result: Personality traits in large language models are geometrically dependent, meaning controlling one trait impacts others. Hard orthonormalisation ensures geometric independence but reduces steering effectiveness.

Conclusion: Personality traits in large language models are interconnected, making fully independent trait control challenging, due to subtle coupling in their representation.

Abstract: Personality steering in large language models (LLMs) commonly relies on injecting trait-specific steering vectors, implicitly assuming that personality traits can be controlled independently. In this work, we examine whether this assumption holds by analysing the geometric relationships between Big Five personality steering directions. We study steering vectors extracted from two model families (LLaMA-3-8B and Mistral-8B) and apply a range of geometric conditioning schemes, from unconstrained directions to soft and hard orthonormalisation. Our results show that personality steering directions exhibit substantial geometric dependence: steering one trait consistently induces changes in others, even when linear overlap is explicitly removed. While hard orthonormalisation enforces geometric independence, it does not eliminate cross-trait behavioural effects and can reduce steering strength. These findings suggest that personality traits in LLMs occupy a slightly coupled subspace, limiting fully independent trait control.

TL;DR: This study evaluates the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) as an alternative to traditional personality assessments, comparing LLM-generated scores with standard questionnaires.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore whether LLMs can serve as a valid and effective alternative to existing questionnaire-based methods for personality assessment.

Method: A within-subjects experiment involving 33 participants was conducted, comparing Big Five personality scores from guided LLM conversations with those obtained from the IPIP-50 questionnaire. User-perceived accuracy was also measured.

Result: Moderate convergent validity (r=0.38-0.58) was found. Conscientiousness, Openness, and Neuroticism scores matched between methods, while Agreeableness and Extraversion differed. Participants viewed LLM-generated profiles as equally accurate as traditional methods.

Conclusion: Conversational AI has the potential to complement traditional psychometric approaches, although further calibration is needed for specific traits like Agreeableness and Extraversion.

Abstract: This study validates Large Language Models (LLMs) as a dynamic alternative to questionnaire-based personality assessment. Using a within-subjects experiment (N=33), we compared Big Five personality scores derived from guided LLM conversations against the gold-standard IPIP-50 questionnaire, while also measuring user-perceived accuracy. Results indicate moderate convergent validity (r=0.38-0.58), with Conscientiousness, Openness, and Neuroticism scores statistically equivalent between methods. Agreeableness and Extraversion showed significant differences, suggesting trait-specific calibration is needed. Notably, participants rated LLM-generated profiles as equally accurate as traditional questionnaire results. These findings suggest conversational AI offers a promising new approach to traditional psychometrics.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper presents IntelliReward and IntelliAsk models to enhance the quality of LLM-generated review questions by focusing on human-like standards, showing measurable quality improvements across reasoning and writing benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLM-based approaches for peer review often generate shallow questions, deriving over 50% of question tokens from the paper’s first page. There is a need for a model that generates expert-level, substantive, evidence-based questions.

Method: The authors introduced IntelliReward, a reward model composed of a frozen autoregressive LLM with trainable multi-head transformers, trained using Decoupled Clip and Dynamic Sampling Policy Optimization. They then utilized IntelliReward to train IntelliAsk, aligning it with human standards like effort, evidence, and grounding.

Result: IntelliAsk demonstrated measurable improvements in reasoning and writing benchmarks. Compared to the Qwen3-32B model, IntelliAsk showed better performance on reasoning tasks such as MuSR (68.3 vs 64.7) and writing evaluations like WritingBench (8.31 vs 8.07).

Conclusion: IntelliReward and IntelliAsk provide promising approaches for generating high-quality review questions that adhere to expert-level preferences. The results indicate that enhancing question quality correlates with broader LLM capabilities. The authors also release resources for continued research in this area.

Abstract: Peer review relies on substantive, evidence-based questions, yet existing LLM-based approaches often generate surface-level queries, drawing over 50\% of their question tokens from a paper's first page. To bridge this gap, we develop IntelliReward, a novel reward model built from a frozen autoregressive LLM with trainable multi-head transformers over the final 50 token states, which outperforms API-based SFT baselines in predicting expert-level human preferences. By applying Decoupled Clip and Dynamic Sampling Policy Optimization (DAPO) with IntelliReward, we train IntelliAsk, a question-generation model aligned with human standards of effort, evidence, and grounding. We find consistent improvements on reasoning and writing benchmarks, suggesting reviewer-question quality correlates with broader capabilities. Compared to the Qwen3-32B base model, IntelliAsk shows measurable gains across diverse benchmarks, specifically improving performance on reasoning tasks like MuSR (68.3 vs 64.7 Acc) and complex writing evaluations such as WritingBench (8.31 vs 8.07). We release our implementation, expert preference annotations, and the IntelliReward model to provide an automatic evaluation benchmark for grounding, effort, and evidence in LLM-generated review questions.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: College application processes are often complex and fragmented, leading to difficulties for students due to repetitive forms, unclear questions, and inconsistent portals.

Method: The system employs a mapping-first paradigm to separate form comprehension from answer generation, integrates official document retrieval, uses retrieval-augmented question answering, and includes a human-in-the-loop chatbot interface.

Result: EZCollegeApp demonstrates effective mapping and assistance through automated testing and human quality evaluations, showing promise in simplifying application processes.

Conclusion: EZCollegeApp eases the application process by leveraging AI for structured and informed assistance while prioritizing security, privacy, and human oversight. The open-sourcing of the project enhances its potential impact.

Abstract: American college applications require students to navigate fragmented admissions policies, repetitive and conditional forms, and ambiguous questions that often demand cross-referencing multiple sources. We present EZCollegeApp, a large language model (LLM)-powered system that assists high-school students by structuring application forms, grounding suggested answers in authoritative admissions documents, and maintaining full human control over final responses. The system introduces a mapping-first paradigm that separates form understanding from answer generation, enabling consistent reasoning across heterogeneous application portals. EZCollegeApp integrates document ingestion from official admissions websites, retrieval-augmented question answering, and a human-in-the-loop chatbot interface that presents suggestions alongside application fields without automated submission. We describe the system architecture, data pipeline, internal representations, security and privacy measures, and evaluation through automated testing and human quality assessment. Our source code is released on GitHub (https://github.com/ezcollegeapp-public/ezcollegeapp-public) to facilitate the broader impact of this work.

### [30] [Narrative Theory-Driven LLM Methods for Automatic Story Generation and Understanding: A Survey](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15851)
*David Y. Liu,Aditya Joshi,Paul Dawson*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper investigates how NLP research intersects with narrative studies using LLMs, proposes a taxonomy for efforts in this field, and outlines challenges and future directions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to bridge NLP and narrative studies, identifying patterns and methodologies for improving story generation and understanding tasks, and addressing gaps in unifying narrative-related tasks.

Method: The survey analyzes narrative datasets, tasks, theories, and methodologies in NLP, emphasizing LLM-driven approaches and trends in fine-tuning and prompting.

Result: The study finds LLMs facilitate integration of narrative concepts with NLP and interdisciplinary collaboration but identifies challenges in creating unified definitions or benchmarks for narrative quality.

Conclusion: Instead of creating a single benchmark, the paper suggests focusing on theory-driven metrics, conducting large-scale narrative analyses, and using outputs to refine narrative theories for systematic progress in the field.

Abstract: Applications of narrative theories using large language models (LLMs) deliver promising use-cases in automatic story generation and understanding tasks. Our survey examines how natural language processing (NLP) research engages with fields of narrative studies, and proposes a taxonomy for ongoing efforts that reflect established distinctions in narratology. We discover patterns in the following: narrative datasets and tasks, narrative theories and NLP pipeline and methodological trends in prompting and fine-tuning. We highlight how LLMs enable easy connections of NLP pipelines with abstract narrative concepts and opportunities for interdisciplinary collaboration. Challenges remain in attempts to work towards any unified definition or benchmark of narrative related tasks, making model comparison difficult. For future directions, instead of the pursuit of a single, generalised benchmark for 'narrative quality', we believe that progress benefits more from efforts that focus on the following: defining and improving theory-based metrics for individual narrative attributes to incrementally improve model performance; conducting large-scale, theory-driven literary/social/cultural analysis; and creating experiments where outputs can be used to validate or refine narrative theories. This work provides a contextual foundation for more systematic and theoretically informed narrative research in NLP by providing an overview to ongoing research efforts and the broader narrative studies landscape.

### [31] [Building Safe and Deployable Clinical Natural Language Processing under Temporal Leakage Constraints](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15852)
*Ha Na Cho,Sairam Sutari,Alexander Lopez,Hansen Bow,Kai Zheng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This study addresses temporal and lexical leakage in clinical NLP models and introduces an auditing pipeline to improve safety and calibration, using next-day discharge prediction as a case study.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Develop safe and deployable clinical NLP models while managing risks from temporal and lexical leakage that compromise real-world reliability and patient safety.

Method: A lightweight auditing pipeline was introduced and evaluated to identify and mitigate leakage-prone signals, ensuring better temporal validity and calibration for clinical NLP models.

Result: Audited models demonstrated improved calibration, reduced dependence on discharge-related lexical cues, and more conservative probability estimates.

Conclusion: Prioritizing temporal validity, calibration, and robustness over optimistic performance is crucial for deploying clinical NLP systems in real-world settings.

Abstract: Clinical natural language processing (NLP) models have shown promise for supporting hospital discharge planning by leveraging narrative clinical documentation. However, note-based models are particularly vulnerable to temporal and lexical leakage, where documentation artifacts encode future clinical decisions and inflate apparent predictive performance. Such behavior poses substantial risks for real-world deployment, where overconfident or temporally invalid predictions can disrupt clinical workflows and compromise patient safety. This study focuses on system-level design choices required to build safe and deployable clinical NLP under temporal leakage constraints. We present a lightweight auditing pipeline that integrates interpretability into the model development process to identify and suppress leakage-prone signals prior to final training. Using next-day discharge prediction after elective spine surgery as a case study, we evaluate how auditing affects predictive behavior, calibration, and safety-relevant trade-offs. Results show that audited models exhibit more conservative and better-calibrated probability estimates, with reduced reliance on discharge-related lexical cues. These findings emphasize that deployment-ready clinical NLP systems should prioritize temporal validity, calibration, and behavioral robustness over optimistic performance.

### [32] [A Lightweight Explainable Guardrail for Prompt Safety](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15853)
*Md Asiful Islam,Mihai Surdeanu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a lightweight explainable guardrail (LEG) model for classifying unsafe prompts, which also provides explainability by identifying specific unsafe prompt words.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve classification and explainability of unsafe prompts in a lightweight and efficient way, addressing the need for robust safety mechanisms in language models.

Method: LEG employs a multi-task architecture combining prompt classification and explanation classifiers. It uses synthetic training data that mitigates LLM biases and incorporates a novel loss capturing global signals with cross-entropy and focal loss blending via uncertainty-based weighting.

Result: LEG outperforms or matches the state-of-the-art methods in both prompt classification and explainability across three datasets, both in-domain and out-of-domain, while being more size-efficient.

Conclusion: LEG provides an effective, interpretable, and lightweight approach for unsafe prompt classification, demonstrating its potential as a superior and efficient solution in the field.

Abstract: We propose a lightweight explainable guardrail (LEG) method for the classification of unsafe prompts. LEG uses a multi-task learning architecture to jointly learn a prompt classifier and an explanation classifier, where the latter labels prompt words that explain the safe/unsafe overall decision. LEG is trained using synthetic data for explainability, which is generated using a novel strategy that counteracts the confirmation biases of LLMs. Lastly, LEG's training process uses a novel loss that captures global explanation signals and combines cross-entropy and focal losses with uncertainty-based weighting. LEG obtains equivalent or better performance than the state-of-the-art for both prompt classification and explainability, both in-domain and out-of-domain on three datasets, despite the fact that its model size is considerably smaller than current approaches. If accepted, we will release all models and the annotated dataset publicly.

### [33] [Decoupling Strategy and Execution in Task-Focused Dialogue via Goal-Oriented Preference Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15854)
*Jingyi Xu,Xingyu Ren,Zhiqiang You,Yumeng Zhang,Zhoupeng Shou*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces Goal-Oriented Preference Optimization (GOPO), a reinforcement learning framework for task-oriented dialogue systems that separates strategy planning and response generation, demonstrating significant improvements in task success metrics across datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing training methods for language models in task-oriented dialogues rely on token-level likelihood or preference optimization, which do not effectively ensure long-horizon task success. There is a need for a new method that better addresses this challenge.

Method: The GOPO framework uses hierarchical reinforcement learning, involving two agents: an Expert Agent for optimizing multi-turn dialogue strategies at the trajectory level and a Customer Service Agent for generating responses based on these strategies. It introduces Task-focused Sequential Engagement (TSE) as a new sequence-level evaluation metric.

Result: GOPO achieves a 7.7%-10.3% improvement in the TSE metric over existing methods (e.g., PPO and Memento) on the Mgshop dataset, with notable gains in reward and response quality. A larger model trained with GOPO also outperformed state-of-the-art models like Qwen-235B and GPT-5.2 in TSE. Consistent improvements were observed across other datasets.

Conclusion: GOPO offers a new paradigm for task-oriented dialogue systems by decoupling strategy optimization and response generation, achieving better performance in commercial scenarios. The framework and its associated code and datasets will be made publicly available, fostering future progress in this area.

Abstract: Large language models show potential in task-oriented dialogue systems, yet existing training methods often rely on token-level likelihood or preference optimization, which poorly align with long-horizon task success. To address this, we propose Goal-Oriented Preference Optimization (GOPO), a hierarchical reinforcement learning framework that decouples strategy planning from response generation via an Expert Agent and a Customer Service Agent. The Expert Agent optimizes multi-turn goal preferences at the dialogue-trajectory level, while the Customer Service Agent generates responses strictly aligned with the selected strategy. We evaluate GOPO on public benchmarks and e-commerce customer service datasets, and introduce Task-focused Sequential Engagement (TSE), a sequence-level metric derived from real e-commerce interaction data. On the Mgshop dataset, GOPO improves TSE by 7.7% and 10.3% over PPO and Memento, with consistent gains in sequence-level reward and generation quality. Furthermore, a 14B model trained with GOPO achieves 2.7% and 1.5% higher TSE than Qwen-235B and GPT-5.2, respectively. Ablation studies confirm the Expert Agent's critical role in long-horizon optimization. GOPO demonstrates consistent improvements across other datasets as well. This work establishes a new paradigm for task-oriented dialogue systems in commercial scenarios, with code and datasets to be made public.

*Yunhao Liu,Zian Jia,Xinyu Gao,Kanjun Xu,Yun Xiong*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces 'SeleCom,' a selector-based soft compression framework, to improve efficiency in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) by addressing drawbacks of prior methods. SeleCom enhances performance while reducing computing costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to resolve the scalability issues in RAG caused by excessive context length and redundant retrievals while maintaining or improving task-relevant performance.

Method: The method involves developing SeleCom, a decoder-only selector trained with a synthetic QA dataset and curriculum learning. SeleCom focuses on query-conditioned information selection instead of full compression.

Result: SeleCom outperforms existing soft compression techniques and matches or surpasses non-compression approaches, with reduced computational costs (33.8%~84.6%).

Conclusion: SeleCom offers a more effective and efficient solution for grounding LLMs in RAG setups by leveraging query-conditioned compression and addressing limitations in prior soft compression methodologies.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) effectively grounds Large Language Models (LLMs) with external knowledge and is widely applied to Web-related tasks. However, its scalability is hindered by excessive context length and redundant retrievals. Recent research on soft context compression aims to address this by encoding long documents into compact embeddings, yet they often underperform non-compressed RAG due to their reliance on auto-encoder-like full-compression that forces the encoder to compress all document information regardless of relevance to the input query.
  In this work, we conduct an analysis on this paradigm and reveal two fundamental limitations: (I) Infeasibility, full-compression conflicts with the LLM's downstream generation behavior; and (II) Non-necessity: full-compression is unnecessary and dilutes task-relevant information density. Motivated by these insights, we introduce SeleCom, a selector-based soft compression framework for RAG that redefines the encoder's role as query-conditioned information selector. The selector is decoder-only and is trained with a massive, diverse and difficulty-graded synthetic QA dataset with curriculum learning.
  Extensive experiments show that SeleCom significantly outperforms existing soft compression approaches and achieves competitive or superior performance to non-compression baselines, while reducing computation and latency by 33.8%~84.6%.

### [35] [Multi-source Heterogeneous Public Opinion Analysis via Collaborative Reasoning and Adaptive Fusion: A Systematically Integrated Approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15857)
*Yi Liu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Collaborative Reasoning and Adaptive Fusion (CRAF) framework for analyzing public opinion across multiple platforms, effectively integrating traditional features and large language models (LLMs).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in analyzing public opinion from multiple heterogeneous platforms, including structural, semantic, and platform-specific biases.

Method: The proposed CRAF framework integrates traditional feature-based methods with LLMs, featuring collaborative semantic alignment, adaptive fusion, joint optimization for topic and sentiment representation, and multimodal data extraction.

Result: Experiments on multiple datasets demonstrate that CRAF improves topic clustering by 4.1% and sentiment analysis performance by 3.8%, while also reducing labeled data requirements for new platforms by 75%.

Conclusion: CRAF effectively tackles cross-platform public opinion analysis, offering improved accuracy, adaptability, and efficiency in handling diverse data sources.

Abstract: The analysis of public opinion from multiple heterogeneous sources presents significant challenges due to structural differences, semantic variations, and platform-specific biases. This paper introduces a novel Collaborative Reasoning and Adaptive Fusion (CRAF) framework that systematically integrates traditional feature-based methods with large language models (LLMs) through a structured multi-stage reasoning mechanism. Our approach features four key innovations: (1) a cross-platform collaborative attention module that aligns semantic representations while preserving source-specific characteristics, (2) a hierarchical adaptive fusion mechanism that dynamically weights features based on both data quality and task requirements, (3) a joint optimization strategy that simultaneously learns topic representations and sentiment distributions through shared latent spaces, and (4) a novel multimodal extraction capability that processes video content from platforms like Douyin and Kuaishou by integrating OCR, ASR, and visual sentiment analysis. Theoretical analysis demonstrates that CRAF achieves a tighter generalization bound with a reduction of O(sqrt(d log K / m)) compared to independent source modeling, where d is feature dimensionality, K is the number of sources, and m is sample size. Comprehensive experiments on three multi-platform datasets (Weibo-12, CrossPlatform-15, NewsForum-8) show that CRAF achieves an average topic clustering ARI of 0.76 (4.1% improvement over best baseline) and sentiment analysis F1-score of 0.84 (3.8% improvement). The framework exhibits strong cross-platform adaptability, reducing the labeled data requirement for new platforms by 75%.

### [36] [State Design Matters: How Representations Shape Dynamic Reasoning in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15858)
*Annie Wong,Aske Plaat,Thomas Bäck,Niki van Stein,Anna V. Kononova*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper investigates the impact of state representation on large language models' (LLMs) performance in dynamic environments, emphasizing design choices for state representation over mere information availability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address the gap in understanding how LLMs can effectively navigate dynamic environments by analyzing how state representation affects reasoning and decision-making capabilities.

Method: The researchers systematically vary three aspects of state representation—granularity, structure, and spatial grounding—across sequential decision-making benchmarks, holding model parameters fixed.

Result: Trajectory summarization improves performance, natural language state representations are robust across various models, structured encodings benefit models with specific priors, and text-based spatial encoding surpasses images due to its forced engagement with spatial reasoning.

Conclusion: State representation is critical to performance in LLMs and VLMs, with thoughtfully designed representations enhancing effectiveness. However, current models still struggle with long-horizon and multi-task scenarios, highlighting areas for improvement.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) move from static reasoning tasks toward dynamic environments, their success depends on the ability to navigate and respond to an environment that changes as they interact at inference time. An underexplored factor in these settings is the representation of the state. Holding model parameters fixed, we systematically vary three key aspects: (1) state granularity (long form versus summary), (2) structure (natural language versus symbolic), and (3) spatial grounding (text-only versus images or textual map encodings) across sequential decision-making benchmarks. We find that trajectory summarisation improves performance by reducing noise and stabilising long-horizon reasoning. Second, natural language representations are the most robust across models, whereas structured encodings help mainly for models with strong code or structured output priors, such as JSON schemas. Third, while image-inputs show some benefit, text-based spatial encodings prove most effective. This advantage stems not from the spatial information itself, but from the act of construction, which compels the model to perform the spatial reasoning that static input does not elicit. Overall, we demonstrate that design choices for representing state are a decisive factor in performance, distinct from the availability of information itself. We note, however, that even with improved representations, current LLMs and VLMs remain brittle over long horizons, particularly when they must synthesise information to manage multiple subtasks to reach a goal.

*Krittin Pachtrachai,Petmongkon Pornpichitsuwan,Wachiravit Modecrua,Touchapon Kraisingkorn*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a framework to build conversational AI assistants from call transcripts, focusing on ensuring data quality, extracting structured knowledge, and optimizing AI behavior through prompt tuning, with strong performance observed in challenging domains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in developing reliable conversational AI for industries requiring real-time data, accurate human hand-off, and coherent conversational behavior.

Method: The approach involves grading and filtering call transcripts, using LLMs to extract structured knowledge, employing a modular prompt-tuning strategy for response generation, and evaluating through user simulators and robustness testing.

Result: The framework enabled the assistant to autonomously manage 30% of calls with high factual accuracy, strong rejection behavior, and resilience against adversarial attacks, particularly in Real Estate and Recruitment domains.

Conclusion: The proposed methodology is effective for creating robust AI assistants from noisy historical data, demonstrating reliability, safety, and automation potential in complex, dynamic domains.

Abstract: Building reliable conversational AI assistants for customer-facing industries remains challenging due to noisy conversational data, fragmented knowledge, and the requirement for accurate human hand-off - particularly in domains that depend heavily on real-time information. This paper presents an end-to-end framework for constructing and evaluating a conversational AI assistant directly from historical call transcripts. Incoming transcripts are first graded using a simplified adaptation of the PIPA framework, focusing on observation alignment and appropriate response behavior, and are filtered to retain only high-quality interactions exhibiting coherent flow and effective human agent responses. Structured knowledge is then extracted from curated transcripts using large language models (LLMs) and deployed as the sole grounding source in a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline. Assistant behavior is governed through systematic prompt tuning, progressing from monolithic prompts to lean, modular, and governed designs that ensure consistency, safety, and controllable execution. Evaluation is conducted using a transcript-grounded user simulator, enabling quantitative measurement of call coverage, factual accuracy, and human escalation behavior. Additional red teaming assesses robustness against prompt injection, out-of-scope, and out-of-context attacks. Experiments are conducted in the Real Estate and Specialist Recruitment domains, which are intentionally challenging and currently suboptimal for automation due to their reliance on real-time data. Despite these constraints, the assistant autonomously handles approximately 30 percents of calls, achieves near-perfect factual accuracy and rejection behavior, and demonstrates strong robustness under adversarial testing.

*Wen G. Gong*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Maniscope is a geometric method for reranking in retrieval-augmented generation that balances high accuracy and vastly reduced computational latency by leveraging k-NN manifolds and geodesic distances.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: This paper aims to tackle the challenges in current reranking systems, which rely on computationally heavy cross-encoders or LLMs with high processing latencies, making them less practical for real-time applications.

Method: Maniscope employs geodesic distance calculations on k-NN manifolds, integrating global cosine similarity with local manifold geometry to retain semantic structures underrepresented by Euclidean metrics.

Result: Maniscope outperforms the HNSW baseline on challenging datasets (e.g., up to +7.0% NDCG@3) and approaches cross-encoder accuracy within 2% at up to 45x lower latency, also establishing near real-time performance with sub-10 ms execution times.

Conclusion: Maniscope provides a significantly faster yet highly accurate reranking alternative, proving its practicability for real-time RAG scenarios, and is outlined for open-source release.

Abstract: Current neural reranking approaches for retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) rely on cross-encoders or large language models (LLMs), requiring substantial computational resources and exhibiting latencies of 3-5 seconds per query. We propose Maniscope, a geometric reranking method that computes geodesic distances on k-nearest neighbor (k-NN) manifolds constructed over retrieved document candidates. This approach combines global cosine similarity with local manifold geometry to capture semantic structure that flat Euclidean metrics miss. Evaluating on eight BEIR benchmark datasets (1,233 queries), Maniscope outperforms HNSW graph-based baseline on the three hardest datasets (NFCorpus: +7.0%, TREC-COVID: +1.6%, AorB: +2.8% NDCG@3) while being 3.2x faster (4.7 ms vs 14.8 ms average). Compared to cross-encoder rerankers, Maniscope achieves within 2% accuracy at 10-45x lower latency. On TREC-COVID, LLM-Reranker provides only +0.5% NDCG@3 improvement over Maniscope at 840x higher latency, positioning Maniscope as a practical alternative for real-time RAG deployment. The method requires O(N D + M^2 D + M k log k) complexity where M << N , enabling sub-10 ms latency. We plan to release Maniscope as open-source software.

*Jinxiang Xie,Zihao Li,Wei He,Rui Ding,Shi Han,Dongmei Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces the CAST framework to enhance the output stability of large language models in summarizing and tagging tabular data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the instability of outputs from large language models in data analytics tasks, which demand high consistency.

Method: CAST framework combines Algorithmic Prompting and Thinking-before-Speaking techniques to constrain the model's reasoning path and stabilize outputs.

Result: CAST exhibits the highest stability among all evaluated methods, with improvements in Stability Score by up to 16.2%, while maintaining or enhancing output quality.

Conclusion: CAST successfully meets high stability demands in data analytics without compromising output quality, validated by alignment with human judgments.

Abstract: Text analysis of tabular data relies on two core operations: \emph{summarization} for corpus-level theme extraction and \emph{tagging} for row-level labeling. A critical limitation of employing large language models (LLMs) for these tasks is their inability to meet the high standards of output stability demanded by data analytics. To address this challenge, we introduce \textbf{CAST} (\textbf{C}onsistency via \textbf{A}lgorithmic Prompting and \textbf{S}table \textbf{T}hinking), a framework that enhances output stability by constraining the model's latent reasoning path. CAST combines (i) Algorithmic Prompting to impose a procedural scaffold over valid reasoning transitions and (ii) Thinking-before-Speaking to enforce explicit intermediate commitments before final generation. To measure progress, we introduce \textbf{CAST-S} and \textbf{CAST-T}, stability metrics for bulleted summarization and tagging, and validate their alignment with human judgments. Experiments across publicly available benchmarks on multiple LLM backbones show that CAST consistently achieves the best stability among all baselines, improving Stability Score by up to 16.2\%, while maintaining or improving output quality.

*Guoshan Liu,Bin Zhu,Yian Li,Jingjing Chen,Chong-Wah Ngo,Yu-Gang Jiang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces a semantically grounded framework for generating recipes from food images, focusing on addressing incorrect actions and ingredients in the outputs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve the semantic accuracy of recipes generated from food images by addressing errors in actions and ingredients.

Method: The paper proposes a two-stage pipeline: (1) Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) using an Action-Reasoning dataset and ingredient corpus, (2) Reinforcement Fine-Tuning (RFT) with frequency-aware rewards. Additionally, a Semantic Confidence Scoring and Rectification (SCSR) module filters and corrects predictions.

Result: The proposed method achieved state-of-the-art performance on the Recipe1M dataset and significantly improved semantic fidelity in recipe generation.

Conclusion: A semantically grounded approach enhances multimodal recipe generation, effectively addressing semantic errors in actions and ingredients.

Abstract: Recent advances in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLMMs) have enabled recipe generation from food images, yet outputs often contain semantically incorrect actions or ingredients despite high lexical scores (e.g., BLEU, ROUGE). To address this gap, we propose a semantically grounded framework that predicts and validates actions and ingredients as internal context for instruction generation. Our two-stage pipeline combines supervised fine-tuning (SFT) with reinforcement fine-tuning (RFT): SFT builds foundational accuracy using an Action-Reasoning dataset and ingredient corpus, while RFT employs frequency-aware rewards to improve long-tail action prediction and ingredient generalization. A Semantic Confidence Scoring and Rectification (SCSR) module further filters and corrects predictions. Experiments on Recipe1M show state-of-the-art performance and markedly improved semantic fidelity.

*Daehoon Gwak,Minseo Jung,Junwoo Park,Minho Park,ChaeHun Park,Junha Hyung,Jaegul Choo*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Large Language Models (LLMs) improve reasoning by creating their own examples through integrated prompting, rather than using the examples themselves.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To clarify the mechanism behind improved reasoning in LLMs with self-generated examples and optimize prompting strategies for effective application.

Method: Compared three prompting strategies (Zero-shot, Integrated, Decoupled) on reasoning tasks across five LLM architectures with attention analysis.

Result: Integrated prompting consistently outperformed Zero-shot and Decoupled prompting; minimal gains observed with Decoupled prompting.

Conclusion: Creating examples improves reasoning by engaging LLMs in the problem creation process, offering insights for better prompting strategies.

Abstract: Recent studies have shown that Large Language Models (LLMs) can improve their reasoning performance through self-generated few-shot examples, achieving results comparable to manually curated in-context examples. However, the underlying mechanism behind these gains remains unclear, making it hard to decide when and how to apply the technique effectively. In this work, we argue that the key benefit arises not from the generated examples themselves but from the act of creating them. To validate this, on reasoning-intensive tasks across diverse LLM architectures, we systematically evaluate three prompting strategies for in-context learning: (1) Zero-shot prompting; (2) Integrated prompting, where LLMs create and solve problems within a single, unified prompt; and (3) Decoupled prompting, where self-generated examples are reused as in-context examples, but the context of their creation itself is excluded. We conduct experiments across five widely used model architectures, demonstrating that Integrated prompting consistently outperforms both Zero-shot and Decoupled prompting. In contrast, Decoupled prompting offers only marginal gains over Zero-shot. Further, for a more in-depth analysis, we conduct an attention analysis and observe significant differences in attention patterns between Integrated and Decoupled prompting. These findings suggest that the advantage of self-generation prompting comes from the process of problem creation, not the examples themselves, providing valuable insights for designing more effective prompting strategies.

TL;DR: The paper analyzes privacy risks in NLP applied to social media, proposes a risk assessment framework (NLP-PRISM), and highlights substantial privacy-related challenges in various NLP tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Highlight the privacy risks prevalent in the application of NLP for social media analytics, especially concerning PII, behavioral cues, and metadata.

Method: Reviews 203 peer-reviewed papers and introduces the NLP-PRISM framework to evaluate privacy risks across six dimensions—data collection, preprocessing, visibility, fairness, computational risk, and regulatory compliance.

Result: Found that transformer models demonstrate F1-scores (0.58-0.84) but experience performance drops (1%-23%) with privacy-preserving fine-tuning. Privacy gaps were revealed in sentiment analysis, emotion detection, offensive language identification, code-mixed processing, native language identification, and dialect detection.

Conclusion: Advocates for improved anonymization, privacy-aware learning, and fairness-driven methods to make NLP applications in social media ethical and privacy-conscious.

Abstract: Natural Language Processing (NLP) is integral to social media analytics but often processes content containing Personally Identifiable Information (PII), behavioral cues, and metadata raising privacy risks such as surveillance, profiling, and targeted advertising. To systematically assess these risks, we review 203 peer-reviewed papers and propose the NLP Privacy Risk Identification in Social Media (NLP-PRISM) framework, which evaluates vulnerabilities across six dimensions: data collection, preprocessing, visibility, fairness, computational risk, and regulatory compliance. Our analysis shows that transformer models achieve F1-scores ranging from 0.58-0.84, but incur a 1% - 23% drop under privacy-preserving fine-tuning. Using NLP-PRISM, we examine privacy coverage in six NLP tasks: sentiment analysis (16), emotion detection (14), offensive language identification (19), code-mixed processing (39), native language identification (29), and dialect detection (24) revealing substantial gaps in privacy research. We further found a (reduced by 2% - 9%) trade-off in model utility, MIA AUC (membership inference attacks) 0.81, AIA accuracy 0.75 (attribute inference attacks). Finally, we advocate for stronger anonymization, privacy-aware learning, and fairness-driven training to enable ethical NLP in social media contexts.

*Berry Gerrits*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper tests the reasoning abilities of LLMs using the text-based game Zork and finds that the models struggle with low completion rates and poor metacognitive abilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate the problem-solving and reasoning abilities of LLMs in a controlled, context-rich environment provided by the game Zork.

Method: Tested leading LLMs (ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini) in Zork under minimal and detailed instructions, measuring success with game scores as metrics, and analyzed qualitative reasoning and action patterns.

Result: All tested models achieved less than 10% completion on average; the best, Claude Opus 4.5, achieved 75 out of 350 points. Detailed instructions and extended thinking did not improve performance.

Conclusion: Current LLMs exhibit significant limitations in problem-solving and metacognitive abilities, such as strategy persistence and learning from prior attempts, within complex text-based games like Zork.

Abstract: In this positioning paper, we evaluate the problem-solving and reasoning capabilities of contemporary Large Language Models (LLMs) through their performance in Zork, the seminal text-based adventure game first released in 1977. The game's dialogue-based structure provides a controlled environment for assessing how LLM-based chatbots interpret natural language descriptions and generate appropriate action sequences to succeed in the game. We test the performance of leading proprietary models - ChatGPT, Claude, and Gemini - under both minimal and detailed instructions, measuring game progress through achieved scores as the primary metric. Our results reveal that all tested models achieve less than 10% completion on average, with even the best-performing model (Claude Opus 4.5) reaching only approximately 75 out of 350 possible points. Notably, providing detailed game instructions offers no improvement, nor does enabling ''extended thinking''. Qualitative analysis of the models' reasoning processes reveals fundamental limitations: repeated unsuccessful actions suggesting an inability to reflect on one's own thinking, inconsistent persistence of strategies, and failure to learn from previous attempts despite access to conversation history. These findings suggest substantial limitations in current LLMs' metacognitive abilities and problem-solving capabilities within the domain of text-based games, raising questions about the nature and extent of their reasoning capabilities.

*Magnus Boman*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper formalizes LLM performance using a deterministic multi-tape Turing machine, providing insights into failure modes and techniques like chain-of-thought prompting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to understand and explain why large language models (LLMs) fail on seemingly trivial tasks and propose a model to analyze and diagnose these failures rigorously.

Method: They use a deterministic multi-tape Turing machine to represent distinct components of LLMs, enabling precise stages of failure detection and enhancing error analysis.

Result: The model reveals how factors like tokenization obscure key structures for tasks and explains the benefits and inherent limits of strategies such as chain-of-thought prompting.

Conclusion: This approach offers a structured method for error diagnosis in LLMs and complements empirical scaling by providing a falsifiable framework for understanding limitations.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) exhibit failure modes on seemingly trivial tasks. We propose a formalisation of LLM interaction using a deterministic multi-tape Turing machine, where each tape represents a distinct component: input characters, tokens, vocabulary, model parameters, activations, probability distributions, and output text. The model enables precise localisation of failure modes to specific pipeline stages, revealing, e.g., how tokenisation obscures character-level structure needed for counting tasks. The model clarifies why techniques like chain-of-thought prompting help, by externalising computation on the output tape, while also revealing their fundamental limitations. This approach provides a rigorous, falsifiable alternative to geometric metaphors and complements empirical scaling laws with principled error analysis.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper evaluates the generalizability of different language models on de-identification tasks across formats, cultures, and genders, finding smaller models to be cost-effective and introducing BERT-MultiCulture-DEID for enhanced cultural robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess the generalizability of de-identification language models across diverse languages, cultures, and genders, and to address limitations in earlier research focusing on these variations.

Method: The study systematically evaluates various fine-tuned transformer models, smaller LLMs, and larger LLMs on de-identification tasks, introducing BERT-MultiCulture-DEID fine-tuned with identifiers from multiple languages.

Result: Smaller models achieve competitive results compared to larger ones, demonstrating cost efficiency. Fine-tuned smaller models outperform larger ones in identifying multi-language or culturally specific identifiers. BERT-MultiCulture-DEID is introduced and publicly released for robustness in multicultural contexts.

Conclusion: Small, fine-tuned models can be both cost-effective and perform reliably for multicultural de-identification. The research establishes an efficiency-generalizability trade-off framework and provides practical solutions for clinical de-identification.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown strong performance on clinical de-identification, the task of identifying sensitive identifiers to protect privacy. However, previous work has not examined their generalizability between formats, cultures, and genders. In this work, we systematically evaluate fine-tuned transformer models (BERT, ClinicalBERT, ModernBERT), small LLMs (Llama 1-8B, Qwen 1.5-7B), and large LLMs (Llama-70B, Qwen-72B) at de-identification. We show that smaller models achieve comparable performance while substantially reducing inference cost, making them more practical for deployment. Moreover, we demonstrate that smaller models can be fine-tuned with limited data to outperform larger models in de-identifying identifiers drawn from Mandarin, Hindi, Spanish, French, Bengali, and regional variations of English, in addition to gendered names. To improve robustness in multi-cultural contexts, we introduce and publicly release BERT-MultiCulture-DEID, a set of de-identification models based on BERT, ClinicalBERT, and ModernBERT, fine-tuned on MIMIC with identifiers from multiple language variants. Our findings provide the first comprehensive quantification of the efficiency-generalizability trade-off in de-identification and establish practical pathways for fair and efficient clinical de-identification.

*Shuhui Qu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces VDLM, a modular variable diffusion language model designed to overcome limitations in autoregressive language generation by separating semantic planning from text rendering and utilizing embedding-space post-training and latent-to-text rendering.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Autoregressive language models face challenges in revising during multi-step reasoning, as they make irreversible commitments while decoding left-to-right.

Method: The paper proposes VDLM using masked diffusion on semantic variable embeddings for iterative refinement, along with trajectory-aware optimization and robust Vec2Text rendering to enhance post-training and text decoding under planner noise.

Result: VDLM demonstrates competitiveness in pre-training and superior performance in long-form generation tasks across reasoning, math, and code benchmarks, outperforming other baselines.

Conclusion: Embedding-space post-training and robust latent-to-text rendering significantly enhance diffusion language modeling and enable more effective multi-step reasoning.

Abstract: Autoregressive language models decode left-to-right with irreversible commitments, limiting revision during multi-step reasoning. We propose \textbf{VDLM}, a modular variable diffusion language model that separates semantic planning from text rendering. VDLM applies LLaDA-style masked diffusion over semantic variable embeddings to enable iterative refinement in latent space, then post-trains the planner with trajectory-aware optimization using embedding-space rewards and values, avoiding text decoding inside the RL loop. To convert planned embeddings back to text, we use a \textbf{Vec2Text} renderer and introduce \textbf{embedding perturbations} to robustify decoding under planner noise. Across nine benchmarks spanning general reasoning, math, and code, VDLM is competitive in pre-training and yields substantial post-training improvements on long-form generation tasks, outperforming other baselines. These results highlight the effectiveness of embedding-space post-training and robust latent-to-text rendering for diffusion language modeling.

TL;DR: The paper introduces "CheckIfExist," an open-source tool for real-time verification of bibliographic references using multi-source validation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The increasing use of large language models has led to issues like reference hallucinations, which compromise bibliographic integrity in academic workflows.

Method: The tool employs a multi-source cascading validation architecture using CrossRef, Semantic Scholar, and OpenAlex, along with string similarity algorithms for confidence scoring.

Result: "CheckIfExist" enables immediate, automated verification and validation of references in single or batch modes, offering outputs in APA or BibTeX formats.

Conclusion: This tool addresses reference hallucinations by delivering a cost-effective, user-friendly solution for ensuring citation authenticity.

Abstract: The proliferation of large language models (LLMs) in academic workflows has introduced unprecedented challenges to bibliographic integrity, particularly through reference hallucination -- the generation of plausible but non-existent citations. Recent investigations have documented the presence of AI-hallucinated citations even in papers accepted at premier machine learning conferences such as NeurIPS and ICLR, underscoring the urgency of automated verification mechanisms. This paper presents "CheckIfExist", an open-source web-based tool designed to provide immediate verification of bibliographic references through multi-source validation against CrossRef, Semantic Scholar, and OpenAlex scholarly databases. While existing reference management tools offer bibliographic organization capabilities, they do not provide real-time validation of citation authenticity. Commercial hallucination detection services, though increasingly available, often impose restrictive usage limits on free tiers or require substantial subscription fees. The proposed tool fills this gap by employing a cascading validation architecture with string similarity algorithms to compute multi-dimensional match confidence scores, delivering instant feedback on reference authenticity. The system supports both single-reference verification and batch processing of BibTeX entries through a unified interface, returning validated APA citations and exportable BibTeX records within seconds.

### [48] [P-RAG: Prompt-Enhanced Parametric RAG with LoRA and Selective CoT for Biomedical and Multi-Hop QA](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15874)
*Xingda Lyu,Gongfu Lyu,Zitai Yan,Yuxin Jiang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces P-RAG, an enhanced hybrid Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) model, integrating parametric knowledge, Chain-of-Thought prompting, and LoRA fine-tuning. It achieves state-of-the-art results in PubMedQA and 2WikiMultihopQA.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large Language Models (LLMs) rely on static data, limiting their utility. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) addresses this but still exhibits dependency on external knowledge base quality. The paper aims to improve RAG by incorporating dynamic parametric and retrieval-based approaches for enhanced question answering.

Method: The paper introduces Prompt-Enhanced Parametric RAG (P-RAG), which integrates parametric knowledge into LLMs and enhances it with Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting and Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) fine-tuning. It is evaluated on biomedical (PubMedQA) and general (2WikiMultihopQA) datasets.

Result: P-RAG significantly outperforms Standard RAG. On PubMedQA, it achieves a 10.47% absolute improvement in F1 score (93.33% vs. 82.86%). On 2WikiMultihopQA, it nearly doubles the overall score (33.44% vs. 17.83%) and shows strong performance in subsets like Compare (44.03%).

Conclusion: P-RAG demonstrates substantial improvements in accuracy and adaptability for biomedical and general QA. Combining CoT prompting and LoRA fine-tuning offers new opportunities for scalable and context-sensitive reasoning in LLMs.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate remarkable capabilities but remain limited by their reliance on static training data. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) addresses this constraint by retrieving external knowledge during inference, though it still depends heavily on knowledge base quality. To explore potential improvements, we evaluated three RAG variants-Standard RAG, DA-RAG, and our proposed Prompt-Enhanced Parametric RAG (P-RAG), a hybrid architecture that integrates parametric knowledge within the LLM and retrieved evidence, guided by Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting and Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) fine-tuning-on both general and biomedical datasets. Using LLaMA-3.2-1B-Instruct fine-tuned via LoRA, we evaluate on PubMedQA and 2WikiMultihopQA. P-RAG outperforms Standard RAG on PubMedQA by 10.47 percentage points in F1 (93.33% vs. 82.86%; 12.64% relative). On 2WikiMultihopQA, P-RAG nearly doubles the overall score vs. Standard RAG (33.44% vs. 17.83%) and achieves 44.03% on the Compare subset (with 42.74% Bridge, 21.84% Inference, 8.60% Compose). CoT prompting substantially improves multi-hop reasoning but yields mixed results for simpler, single-hop queries. These findings underscore P-RAG's potential for accurate, scalable, and contextually adaptive biomedical question answering. Our contributions include: (1) LoRA-based fine-tuning of LLaMA-3.2-1B-Instruct for biomedical QA, (2) introduction of P-RAG with Chain-of-Thought prompting, and (3) state-of-the-art results on PubMedQA and 2WikiMultihopQA.

### [49] [Quality-constrained Entropy Maximization Policy Optimization for LLM Diversity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15894)
*Haihui Pan,Yuzhong Hong,Shaoke Lv,Junwei Bao,Hongfei Jiang,Yang Song*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper presents a method called Quality-constrained Entropy Maximization Policy Optimization (QEMPO) to improve output diversity in large language models while maintaining quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Although alignment methods enhance the quality of large language model outputs, they reduce diversity, and existing solutions to enhance diversity often compromise performance.

Method: The paper introduces QEMPO, an optimization technique that seeks to maximize output entropy (diversity) under quality constraints. Different policies are generated by adding constraints, and both online and offline training methods are proposed.

Result: Experiments show that QEMPO achieves comparable or better performance than Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF) while increasing output diversity.

Conclusion: QEMPO is a viable solution for enhancing diversity in LLM outputs without sacrificing output quality, providing an improvement over existing alignment methods.

Abstract: Recent research indicates that while alignment methods significantly improve the quality of large language model(LLM) outputs, they simultaneously reduce the diversity of the models' output. Although some methods have been proposed to enhance LLM output diversity, they often come at the cost of reduced performance. In this work, we first theoretically demonstrate that the alignment task can be decomposed into two distributions: quality and diversity. To enhance the diversity of LLM outputs while ensuring quality, we propose the Quality-constrained Entropy Maximization Policy Optimization (QEMPO). QEMPO aims to maximize the output entropy of the policy while ensuring output quality. By adding different constraints to QEMPO, we obtain different policies. To optimize policies, we propose both online and offline training methods. Experiments validate that QEMPO achieves performance comparable to or even better than RLHF while improving output diversity.

*Pengcheng Zhou,Haochen Li,Zhiqiang Nie,JiaLe Chen,Qing Gong,Weizhen Zhang,Chun Yu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CogitoRAG is a novel Retrieval-Augmented Generation framework inspired by human cognitive memory mechanisms, designed to enhance knowledge retrieval for language models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address hallucinations in LLMs by ensuring better semantic integrity in retrieval processes and to improve the generation using advanced cognitive-inspired mechanisms.

Method: CogitoRAG introduces 'Semantic Gist' for indexing data into multi-dimensional knowledge graphs. It employs a Query Decomposition Module for breaking down queries and an Entity Diffusion Module for associative retrieval, followed by the CogniRank algorithm for precise reranking.

Result: CogitoRAG significantly surpasses current RAG methods in accuracy and reasoning, demonstrated through competitive performance across five QA benchmarks and complex multi-task generation on GraphBench.

Conclusion: CogitoRAG provides an innovative approach for integrating and reasoning complex knowledge within RAG frameworks, achieving better performance compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) effectively mitigates hallucinations in LLMs by incorporating external knowledge. However, the inherent discrete representation of text in existing frameworks often results in a loss of semantic integrity, leading to retrieval deviations. Inspired by the human episodic memory mechanism, we propose CogitoRAG, a RAG framework that simulates human cognitive memory processes. The core of this framework lies in the extraction and evolution of the Semantic Gist. During the offline indexing stage, CogitoRAG first deduces unstructured corpora into gist memory corpora, which are then transformed into a multi-dimensional knowledge graph integrating entities, relational facts, and memory nodes. In the online retrieval stage, the framework handles complex queries via Query Decomposition Module that breaks them into comprehensive sub-queries, mimicking the cognitive decomposition humans employ for complex information. Subsequently, Entity Diffusion Module performs associative retrieval across the graph, guided by structural relevance and an entity-frequency reward mechanism. Furthermore, we propose the CogniRank algorithm, which precisely reranks candidate passages by fusing diffusion-derived scores with semantic similarity. The final evidence is delivered to the generator in a passage-memory pairing format, providing high-density information support. Experimental results across five mainstream QA benchmarks and multi-task generation on GraphBench demonstrate that CogitoRAG significantly outperforms state-of-the-art RAG methods, showcasing superior capabilities in complex knowledge integration and reasoning.

*Yichi Zhang,Zhuo Chen,Lingbing Guo,Wen Zhang,Huajun Chen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper proposes TOFU, a token-based foundation model, for multi-modal knowledge graph reasoning (MMKGR), achieving strong generalization across datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing MMKGR models lack generalization across knowledge graphs and fail to exploit multi-modal signals effectively, which limits their application to unseen data.

Method: The proposed model, TOFU, discretizes structural, visual, and textual information into modality-specific tokens and uses a hierarchical fusion architecture with mixture-of-message mechanisms for transferable feature learning.

Result: TOFU outperforms other baseline models in both transductive and inductive settings across 17 benchmark datasets, demonstrating superior performance even on unseen multi-modal knowledge graphs.

Conclusion: TOFU is a robust and generalizable approach for MMKGR, leveraging multi-modal information effectively and addressing limitations in current foundation models.

Abstract: Multi-modal knowledge graph reasoning (MMKGR) aims to predict the missing links by exploiting both graph structure information and multi-modal entity contents. Most existing works are designed for a transductive setting, which learns dataset-specific embeddings and struggles to generalize to new KGs. Recent knowledge graph foundation models (KGFMs) improve cross-KG transfer, but they mainly exploit structural patterns and ignore rich multi-modal signals. We address these gaps by proposing a token-based foundation model (TOFU) for MMKGR, which exhibits strong generalization across different MMKGs. TOFU discretizes structural, visual, and textual information into modality-specific tokens. TOFU then employs a hierarchical fusion architecture with mixture-of-message mechanisms, aiming to process these tokens and obtain transferable features for MMKGR. Experimental results on 17 transductive, inductive, and fully-inductive MMKGs show that TOFU consistently outperforms strong KGFM and MMKGR baselines, delivering strong performance on unseen MMKGs.

### [52] [Mitigating Gradient Inversion Risks in Language Models via Token Obfuscation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15897)
*Xinguo Feng,Zhongkui Ma,Zihan Wang,Alsharif Abuadbba,Guangdong Bai*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper presents GHOST, a mechanism to protect against gradient inversion attacks (GIAs) by using token-level obfuscation, ensuring both data privacy and high model utility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation stems from the vulnerability of collaborative learning models to GIAs, where adversaries can reconstruct private training data from shared gradients, and the inadequacy of existing gradient-based defenses due to semantic similarity retention.

Method: GHOST uses a token-level obfuscation approach by identifying semantically distinct but embedding-proximate tokens to disrupt the connection between token and gradient spaces, while maintaining training utility through minimal feature disruption.

Result: GHOST reduced the data recovery rate to as low as 1% while preserving high training utility, achieving up to 0.92 in classification F1 and 5.45 in perplexity across diverse models and tasks.

Conclusion: GHOST effectively addresses the challenge of gradient inversion attacks by enabling privacy while maintaining model performance, making it a viable defense in collaborative learning scenarios.

Abstract: Training and fine-tuning large-scale language models largely benefit from collaborative learning, but the approach has been proven vulnerable to gradient inversion attacks (GIAs), which allow adversaries to reconstruct private training data from shared gradients. Existing defenses mainly employ gradient perturbation techniques, e.g., noise injection or gradient pruning, to disrupt GIAs' direct mapping from gradient space to token space. However, these methods often fall short due to the retention of semantics similarity across gradient, embedding, and token spaces. In this work, we propose a novel defense mechanism named GHOST (gradient shield with obfuscated tokens), a token-level obfuscation mechanism that neutralizes GIAs by decoupling the inherent connections across gradient, embedding, and token spaces. GHOST is built upon an important insight: due to the large scale of the token space, there exist semantically distinct yet embedding-proximate tokens that can serve as the shadow substitutes of the original tokens, which enables a semantic disconnection in the token space while preserving the connection in the embedding and gradient spaces. GHOST comprises a searching step, which identifies semantically distinct candidate tokens using a multi-criteria searching process, and a selection step, which selects optimal shadow tokens to ensure minimal disruption to features critical for training by preserving alignment with the internal outputs produced by original tokens. Evaluation across diverse model architectures (from BERT to Llama) and datasets demonstrates the remarkable effectiveness of GHOST in protecting privacy (as low as 1% in recovery rate) and preserving utility (up to 0.92 in classification F1 and 5.45 in perplexity), in both classification and generation tasks against state-of-the-art GIAs and adaptive attack scenarios.

TL;DR: The paper introduces MultiCube-RAG, a training-free framework utilizing ontology-based cube structures for efficient multi-hop reasoning and retrieval in question answering, improving accuracy and explainability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing RAG methods struggle with structural semantics and multi-hop reasoning, and training-based approaches face convergence and computational challenges.

Method: Developed an ontology-based cube structure for modeling subjects, attributes, and relations, enabling decomposition of complex queries into simpler subqueries for multi-step reasoning.

Result: MultiCube-RAG achieves an 8.9% accuracy improvement compared to baselines on four multi-hop QA datasets while also being more efficient and explainable.

Conclusion: MultiCube-RAG addresses the challenges in multi-hop QA by combining precision, efficiency, and ease of interpretation with its novel cube-based structure.

Abstract: Multi-hop question answering (QA) necessitates multi-step reasoning and retrieval across interconnected subjects, attributes, and relations. Existing retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) methods struggle to capture these structural semantics accurately, resulting in suboptimal performance. Graph-based RAGs structure such information in graphs, but the resulting graphs are often noisy and computationally expensive. Moreover, most methods rely on single-step retrieval, neglecting the need for multi-hop reasoning processes. Recent training-based approaches attempt to incentivize the large language models (LLMs) for iterative reasoning and retrieval, but their training processes are prone to unstable convergence and high computational overhead. To address these limitations, we devise an ontology-based cube structure with multiple and orthogonal dimensions to model structural subjects, attributes, and relations. Built on the cube structure, we propose MultiCube-RAG, a training-free method consisting of multiple cubes for multi-step reasoning and retrieval. Each cube specializes in modeling a class of subjects, so that MultiCube-RAG flexibly selects the most suitable cubes to acquire the relevant knowledge precisely. To enhance the query-based reasoning and retrieval, our method decomposes a complex multi-hop query into a set of simple subqueries along cube dimensions and conquers each of them sequentially. Experiments on four multi-hop QA datasets show that MultiCube-RAG improves response accuracy by 8.9% over the average performance of various baselines. Notably, we also demonstrate that our method performs with greater efficiency and inherent explainability.

*Rujikorn Charakorn,Edoardo Cetin,Shinnosuke Uesaka,Robert Tjarko Lange*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study introduces Doc-to-LoRA (D2L), a method to reduce memory and latency issues when processing long input sequences in Large Language Models by generating lightweight adapters for efficient task adaptation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the inefficiencies of transformers when dealing with long input sequences due to their quadratic attention costs, as well as challenges in training costs and latency associated with context distillation.

Method: The authors propose Doc-to-LoRA (D2L), where a lightweight hypernetwork generates LoRA adapters for target LLMs. This enables approximate context distillation in a single forward pass, reducing memory and computational overheads during inference.

Result: D2L achieves near-perfect zero-shot accuracy on long-context tasks, handles sequences exceeding the model's native context window by 4x, and outperforms standard context distillation on QA datasets, especially in reduced memory and latency environments.

Conclusion: D2L empowers LLMs with efficient and rapid adaptation capabilities, supporting frequent knowledge updates and personalized interactions with less computational overhead.

Abstract: Long input sequences are central to in-context learning, document understanding, and multi-step reasoning of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, the quadratic attention cost of Transformers makes inference memory-intensive and slow. While context distillation (CD) can transfer information into model parameters, per-prompt distillation is impractical due to training costs and latency. To address these limitations, we propose Doc-to-LoRA (D2L), a lightweight hypernetwork that meta-learns to perform approximate CD within a single forward pass. Given an unseen prompt, D2L generates a LoRA adapter for a target LLM, enabling subsequent queries to be answered without re-consuming the original context, reducing latency and KV-cache memory consumption during inference of the target LLM. On a long-context needle-in-a-haystack task, D2L successfully learns to map contexts into adapters that store the needle information, achieving near-perfect zero-shot accuracy at sequence lengths exceeding the target LLM's native context window by more than 4x. On real-world QA datasets with limited compute, D2L outperforms standard CD while significantly reducing peak memory consumption and update latency. We envision that D2L can facilitate rapid adaptation of LLMs, opening up the possibility of frequent knowledge updates and personalized chat behavior.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces DocSplit, a benchmark dataset for the document packet splitting task, and highlights its challenges and evaluation of existing models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The task of splitting multi-page document packets into individual units is essential for understanding documents in real-world contexts like legal or financial domains, but it remains underexplored.

Method: The authors formalized the task, developed the DocSplit dataset covering various types and complexities, and created evaluation metrics. Experiments were conducted on multimodal LLMs using this benchmark.

Result: Evaluation revealed inadequacies in current models' handling of document packet splitting tasks, especially for complex scenarios like interleaved documents and unclear boundaries.

Conclusion: The proposed benchmark and datasets can advance document understanding research and improve models for applications in document-intensive domains. The datasets have been made available to the research community.

Abstract: Document understanding in real-world applications often requires processing heterogeneous, multi-page document packets containing multiple documents stitched together. Despite recent advances in visual document understanding, the fundamental task of document packet splitting, which involves separating a document packet into individual units, remains largely unaddressed. We present the first comprehensive benchmark dataset, DocSplit, along with novel evaluation metrics for assessing the document packet splitting capabilities of large language models. DocSplit comprises five datasets of varying complexity, covering diverse document types, layouts, and multimodal settings. We formalize the DocSplit task, which requires models to identify document boundaries, classify document types, and maintain correct page ordering within a document packet. The benchmark addresses real-world challenges, including out-of-order pages, interleaved documents, and documents lacking clear demarcations. We conduct extensive experiments evaluating multimodal LLMs on our datasets, revealing significant performance gaps in current models' ability to handle complex document splitting tasks. The DocSplit benchmark datasets and proposed novel evaluation metrics provide a systematic framework for advancing document understanding capabilities essential for legal, financial, healthcare, and other document-intensive domains. We release the datasets to facilitate future research in document packet processing.

TL;DR: This paper investigates Korean multiword adpositions, specifically postpositional verb-based constructions (PVCs), proposes annotation guidelines to enhance cross-lingual integration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Korean MWEs, particularly multiword adpositions, lack comprehensive resources and analysis compared to other languages.

Method: The authors analyzed PVC expressions from Korean Wikipedia and contrasted them with non-MWEs and light verb constructions (LVCs).

Result: The paper presented a detailed survey and introduced annotation guidelines for Korean MWEs to facilitate alignment with cross-lingual frameworks.

Conclusion: This research advances the understanding and systematic representation of Korean MWEs, enhancing their integration into cross-lingual annotation models.

Abstract: Multiword expressions (MWEs) have been widely studied in cross-lingual annotation frameworks such as PARSEME. However, Korean MWEs remain underrepresented in these efforts. In particular, Korean multiword adpositions lack systematic analysis, annotated resources, and integration into existing multilingual frameworks. In this paper, we study a class of Korean functional multiword expressions: postpositional verb-based constructions (PVCs). Using data from Korean Wikipedia, we survey and analyze several PVC expressions and contrast them with non-MWEs and light verb constructions (LVCs) with similar structure. Building on this analysis, we propose annotation guidelines designed to support future work in Korean multiword adpositions and facilitate alignment with cross-lingual frameworks.

*Bradley McDanel,Steven Li,Harshit Khaitan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper identifies issues with token-ranking heuristics in the prefill stage of long-context LLM inference, proposes a new oracle-based evaluation method, and introduces a Cross-Layer Attention Aggregation (CLAA) technique for reducing computational bottlenecks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation behind this study is to address computational inefficiencies in the prefill stage of long-context LLM inference, which serves as a bottleneck. Current token-ranking heuristics exhibit instability, making token importance estimation unreliable, and existing evaluation metrics fail to capture these issues.

Method: The paper introduces an Answer-Informed Oracle to define token importance based on attention from generated answers to the prompt, identifying instability in existing heuristics. It then proposes Cross-Layer Attention Aggregation (CLAA) for stable and efficient token-ranking by aggregating scores across layers.

Result: The proposed CLAA approach significantly close the gap to the oracle-defined upper bound of token-ranking quality and reduces Time-to-First-Token (TTFT) by up to 39% compared to the Full KV Cache baseline.

Conclusion: Cross-Layer Attention Aggregation effectively mitigates token importance instability in long-context LLM inference, improving inference speed and accuracy. By leveraging attention aggregation, this technique offers a practical solution to computational bottlenecks associated with ranking methods.

Abstract: The prefill stage in long-context LLM inference remains a computational bottleneck. Recent token-ranking heuristics accelerate inference by selectively processing a subset of semantically relevant tokens. However, existing methods suffer from unstable token importance estimation, often varying between layers. Evaluating token-ranking quality independently from heuristic-specific architectures is challenging. To address this, we introduce an Answer-Informed Oracle, which defines ground-truth token importance by measuring attention from generated answers back to the prompt. This oracle reveals that existing heuristics exhibit high variance across layers: rankings can degrade sharply at specific layers, a failure mode invisible to end-to-end benchmarks. The diagnosis suggests a simple fix: aggregate scores across layers rather than relying on any single one. We implement this as Cross-Layer Attention Aggregation (CLAA), which closes the gap to the oracle upper bound and reduces Time-to-First-Token (TTFT) by up to 39\% compared to the Full KV Cache baseline.

Motivation: To enhance control over language model responses when the impact of behaviors is diffused across multiple tokens in long-form outputs.

Method: Develop a procedure (GCM) that quantifies how specific model components mediate binary concepts and selects components for steering using a dataset of contrasting responses and probing techniques.

Result: GCM was tested on multiple tasks and language models, outperforming traditional methods in steering model behaviors with a sparse set of components like attention heads.

Conclusion: The GCM approach effectively localizes and controls long-form outputs of language models, advancing precise model steering capabilities.

Abstract: Where should we intervene in a language model (LM) to control behaviors that are diffused across many tokens of a long-form response? We introduce Generative Causal Mediation (GCM), a procedure for selecting model components, e.g., attention heads, to steer a binary concept (e.g., talk in verse vs. talk in prose) from contrastive long-form responses. In GCM, we first construct a dataset of contrasting inputs and responses. Then, we quantify how individual model components mediate the contrastive concept and select the strongest mediators for steering. We evaluate GCM on three tasks--refusal, sycophancy, and style transfer--across three language models. GCM successfully localizes concepts expressed in long-form responses and consistently outperforms correlational probe-based baselines when steering with a sparse set of attention heads. Together, these results demonstrate that GCM provides an effective approach for localizing and controlling the long-form responses of LMs.

### [59] [Language Statistics and False Belief Reasoning: Evidence from 41 Open-Weight LMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16085)
*Sean Trott,Samuel Taylor,Cameron Jones,James A. Michaelov,Pamela D. Rivière*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper investigates mental state reasoning in language models across 41 open-weight models, revealing patterns in sensitivity to knowledge states and proposing parallels between LM and human cognitive biases.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study seeks to explore mental state reasoning in language models (LMs) to both better understand LMs and to test psychological theories, like the role of language exposure in human social cognition.

Method: The researchers replicate and extend prior research by evaluating the false belief reasoning behavior across 41 open-weight LMs, analyzing their sensitivity to implied knowledge states and their predictive capabilities.

Result: 34% of the tested LMs exhibited sensitivity to implied knowledge states. Larger LMs demonstrated increased sensitivity and higher predictive power. The research found a similarity between humans and LMs in their bias due to knowledge cues.

Conclusion: Larger samples of open-weight LMs are valuable for testing human cognition theories and evaluating LM capabilities. Language distributional statistics can explain certain behaviors in LMs that align with human cognition but not all.

Abstract: Research on mental state reasoning in language models (LMs) has the potential to inform theories of human social cognition--such as the theory that mental state reasoning emerges in part from language exposure--and our understanding of LMs themselves. Yet much published work on LMs relies on a relatively small sample of closed-source LMs, limiting our ability to rigorously test psychological theories and evaluate LM capacities. Here, we replicate and extend published work on the false belief task by assessing LM mental state reasoning behavior across 41 open-weight models (from distinct model families). We find sensitivity to implied knowledge states in 34% of the LMs tested; however, consistent with prior work, none fully ``explain away'' the effect in humans. Larger LMs show increased sensitivity and also exhibit higher psychometric predictive power. Finally, we use LM behavior to generate and test a novel hypothesis about human cognition: both humans and LMs show a bias towards attributing false beliefs when knowledge states are cued using a non-factive verb (``John thinks...'') than when cued indirectly (``John looks in the...''). Unlike the primary effect of knowledge states, where human sensitivity exceeds that of LMs, the magnitude of the human knowledge cue effect falls squarely within the distribution of LM effect sizes-suggesting that distributional statistics of language can in principle account for the latter but not the former in humans. These results demonstrate the value of using larger samples of open-weight LMs to test theories of human cognition and evaluate LM capacities.

*Shankar Padmanabhan,Mustafa Omer Gul,Tanya Goyal*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Introduced 'DiSC', a novel method for enabling continual knowledge adaptation in post-trained LLMs, balancing new learning with mitigating forgetting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Post-training enhances LLMs with skills like reasoning and instruction-following. However, they struggle with continual adaptation, needing a method to learn new information without forgetting prior capabilities.

Method: The proposed method, DiSC (Distillation via Split Contexts), conditions separate training example segments, aligning student and teacher distributions by minimizing KL divergence between shared tokens, enabling efficient adaptation.

Result: DiSC outperforms prior fine-tuning and distillation methods by providing the best balance of learning new knowledge and retaining prior skills in experiments across four models and two domains.

Conclusion: DiSC proves to be an effective method for continual knowledge adaptation in LLMs, maintaining earlier capabilities while acquiring new knowledge.

Abstract: Post-training endows pretrained LLMs with a variety of desirable skills, including instruction-following, reasoning, and others. However, these post-trained LLMs only encode knowledge up to a cut-off date, necessitating continual adaptation. Unfortunately, existing solutions cannot simultaneously learn new knowledge from an adaptation document corpora and mitigate the forgetting of earlier learned capabilities. To address this, we introduce Distillation via Split Contexts (DiSC), a simple context-distillation based approach for continual knowledge adaptation. \methodname~derives student and teacher distributions by conditioning on distinct segments of the training example and minimizes the KL divergence between the shared tokens. This allows us to efficiently apply context-distillation without requiring explicit generation steps during training. We run experiments on four post-trained models and two adaptation domains. Compared to prior finetuning and distillation methods for continual adaptation, DiSC consistently reports the best trade-off between learning new knowledge and mitigating forgetting of previously learned skills like instruction-following, reasoning, and factual knowledge.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces Missing-by-Design (MBD), a framework enabling selective modality revocation in multimodal sentiment analysis, aimed at privacy compliance and user autonomy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the growing need for revocable multimodal systems that enable selective removal of modality-specific data for privacy and user control.

Method: MBD employs structured representation learning, generator-based reconstruction for recovering missing channels, and a certifiable deletion pipeline using saliency-driven candidate selection and Gaussian updates.

Result: Experiments demonstrate MBD's strong predictive performance even with incomplete inputs, achieving a balance between privacy preservation and utility.

Conclusion: The framework offers a practical approach to surgical unlearning as an efficient alternative to full model retraining in privacy-sensitive multimodal systems.

Abstract: As multimodal systems increasingly process sensitive personal data, the ability to selectively revoke specific data modalities has become a critical requirement for privacy compliance and user autonomy. We present Missing-by-Design (MBD), a unified framework for revocable multimodal sentiment analysis that combines structured representation learning with a certifiable parameter-modification pipeline. Revocability is critical in privacy-sensitive applications where users or regulators may request removal of modality-specific information. MBD learns property-aware embeddings and employs generator-based reconstruction to recover missing channels while preserving task-relevant signals. For deletion requests, the framework applies saliency-driven candidate selection and a calibrated Gaussian update to produce a machine-verifiable Modality Deletion Certificate. Experiments on benchmark datasets show that MBD achieves strong predictive performance under incomplete inputs and delivers a practical privacy-utility trade-off, positioning surgical unlearning as an efficient alternative to full retraining.

### [62] [Balancing Faithfulness and Performance in Reasoning via Multi-Listener Soft Execution](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16154)
*Nithin Sivakumaran,Shoubin Yu,Hyunji Lee,Yue Zhang,Ali Payani,Mohit Bansal,Elias Stengel-Eskin*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces REMUL, a multi-party reinforcement learning approach, to enhance faithfulness in CoT reasoning while improving accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To resolve the issue where chain-of-thought reasoning in LLMs often lacks faithfulness and compromises task performance.

Method: A reinforcement learning approach named REMUL encourages LLMs to generate reasoning paths that other listener models can follow, optimizing for clarity and task performance.

Result: REMUL outperforms on several reasoning benchmarks, improving both reasoning faithfulness and task accuracy.

Conclusion: The approach enhances faithfulness, improves clarity of reasoning, and strikes a balance between interpretability and task success.

Abstract: Chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning sometimes fails to faithfully reflect the true computation of a large language model (LLM), hampering its utility in explaining how LLMs arrive at their answers. Moreover, optimizing for faithfulness and interpretability in reasoning often degrades task performance. To address this tradeoff and improve CoT faithfulness, we propose Reasoning Execution by Multiple Listeners (REMUL), a multi-party reinforcement learning approach. REMUL builds on the hypothesis that reasoning traces which other parties can follow will be more faithful. A speaker model generates a reasoning trace, which is truncated and passed to a pool of listener models who "execute" the trace, continuing the trace to an answer. Speakers are rewarded for producing reasoning that is clear to listeners, with additional correctness regularization via masked supervised finetuning to counter the tradeoff between faithfulness and performance. On multiple reasoning benchmarks (BIG-Bench Extra Hard, MuSR, ZebraLogicBench, and FOLIO), REMUL consistently and substantially improves three measures of faithfulness -- hint attribution, early answering area over the curve (AOC), and mistake injection AOC -- while also improving accuracy. Our analysis finds that these gains are robust across training domains, translate to legibility gains, and are associated with shorter and more direct CoTs.

### [63] [LLMs Exhibit Significantly Lower Uncertainty in Creative Writing Than Professional Writers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16162)
*Peiqi Sui*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper highlights the importance of uncertainty in creative writing and examines how current language models fall short in producing sufficiently uncertain, and thus creative, outputs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the limitations of LLMs in creative writing, focusing on their tendency to produce overly factual and cliché-ridden text due to alignment strategies that decrease uncertainty.

Method: The authors utilize an information-theoretic analysis to measure the "uncertainty gap" by comparing the outputs of 28 LLMs with human-authored stories on storytelling datasets.

Result: The study reveals that human-authored writing exhibits higher uncertainty than model-generated content, with instruction-tuned models and reasoning tasks amplifying this gap. The gap is strongly correlated with writing quality and is more evident in creative domains.

Conclusion: To achieve human-level creativity in writing, LLM alignment paradigms must evolve to recognize the difference between harmful hallucinations and the constructive ambiguity that enhances literary richness.

Abstract: We argue that uncertainty is a key and understudied limitation of LLMs' performance in creative writing, which is often characterized as trite and cliché-ridden. Literary theory identifies uncertainty as a necessary condition for creative expression, while current alignment strategies steer models away from uncertain outputs to ensure factuality and reduce hallucination. We formalize this tension by quantifying the "uncertainty gap" between human-authored stories and model-generated continuations. Through a controlled information-theoretic analysis of 28 LLMs on high-quality storytelling datasets, we demonstrate that human writing consistently exhibits significantly higher uncertainty than model outputs. We find that instruction-tuned and reasoning models exacerbate this trend compared to their base counterparts; furthermore, the gap is more pronounced in creative writing than in functional domains, and strongly correlates to writing quality. Achieving human-level creativity requires new uncertainty-aware alignment paradigms that can distinguish between destructive hallucinations and the constructive ambiguity required for literary richness.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper proposes a novel 'model transplantation' technique to enhance underperforming language models using localized internal modules without additional training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Language models sometimes perform worse than previous versions, and existing solutions to address these are resource-intensive, requiring an alternative method to improve them quickly.

Method: The study identifies and selects modules showing consistent activation changes for specific tasks, then transplants them into an underperforming model to observe measurable improvements immediately.

Result: Experimental results demonstrate significant performance improvements in underperforming language models, achieving up to twice the target baseline performance and substantial gap recovery through module transplantation.

Conclusion: The paper provides evidence for task-localized modularity in language models and introduces 'model transplantation' as a promising technique for immediate enhancement without extensive resources.

Abstract: Despite the continuous research and evolution of language models, they sometimes underperform previous versions. Existing approaches to overcome these challenges are resource-intensive, highlighting the need for alternatives that enable immediate action. We assume that each language model has a local module inside that is suitable for a specific function. First, this work identifies a set of modules showing consistent and local activation changes under an inference workload through activation-based analysis. Subsequently, we transplant an internal module that is properly activated for a specific task into the target model, leading to immediate and measurable functional changes without additional training or fine-tuning. To experimentally demonstrate the effectiveness of the transplant technique, we quantify the relationship between transplant strength and performance improvement under different conditions for two language models. In the cross-generation setting, we find that transplanting activation-selected modules can substantially improve the underperforming model, reaching up to twice the target baseline and achieving gap-based recovery above 100%. Moreover, in transplant experiments between a base model and its instruction-tuned counterpart, transplantation improves the underperforming model toward the stronger baseline, yielding up to about 2.33 times the target baseline with gap-based recovery reaching up to 100% in the best case. These results show that meaningful capacity transfer can be realized through the implantation of highly localized modules implied by language models. Overall, this work provides empirical evidence for task-localized modularity in language models and presents a new research area: model transplantation.

### [65] [The Validity of Coreference-based Evaluations of Natural Language Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16200)
*Ian Porada*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The thesis investigates the effectiveness of coreference-based evaluations, highlighting their limitations and suggesting improvements for measuring model generalizability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address issues with coreference-based evaluations, such as inconsistent definitions and results, to better understand the performance of language models.

Method: It involves analyzing traditional coreference evaluations, introducing a new evaluation focused on event plausibility, and testing models for generalizability under modified contexts.

Result: Language models showed strong performance on standard benchmarks but struggled to generalize across modified evaluation settings.

Conclusion: Findings reveal both advancements and limitations in current NLP methods, underscoring the need for improved evaluations and models that generalize more effectively.

Abstract: In this thesis, I refine our understanding as to what conclusions we can reach from coreference-based evaluations by expanding existing evaluation practices and considering the extent to which evaluation results are either converging or conflicting. First, I analyze standard coreference evaluations and show that their design often leads to non-generalizable conclusions due to issues of measurement validity - including contestedness (multiple, competing definitions of coreference) and convergent validity (evaluation results that rank models differently across benchmarks). Second, I propose and implement a novel evaluation focused on testing systems' ability to infer the relative plausibility of events, a key aspect of resolving coreference. Through this extended evaluation, I find that contemporary language models demonstrate strong performance on standard benchmarks - improving over earlier baseline systems within certain domains and types of coreference - but remain sensitive to the evaluation conditions: they often fail to generalize in ways one would expect a human to be capable of when evaluation contexts are slightly modified. Taken together, these findings clarify both the strengths, such as improved accuracy over baselines on widely used evaluations, and the limitations of the current NLP paradigm, including weaknesses in measurement validity, and suggest directions for future work in developing better evaluation methods and more genuinely generalizable systems.

*Sanket Badhe,Deep Shah,Nehal Kathrotia*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper examines the challenges posed by long-tail knowledge in large language models (LLMs), introduces a structured framework for analysis, and identifies key open challenges in improving its representation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the persistent failures of LLMs on low-frequency, domain-specific, cultural, and temporal knowledge, which remain under-examined despite improvements in average-case performance.

Method: Develop a structured framework to analyze long-tail knowledge representation, loss mechanisms, technical interventions, and implications, synthesizing prior studies and evaluation practices.

Result: Provides a taxonomy explaining how long-tail knowledge is defined, lost, and evaluated, and discusses rare yet impactful failure cases and their relation to fairness, accountability, and user trust.

Conclusion: Proposes open challenges related to privacy, sustainability, and governance as critical constraints for improving long-tail knowledge representation in LLMs, offering a unifying framework for future research.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are trained on web-scale corpora that exhibit steep power-law distributions, in which the distribution of knowledge is highly long-tailed, with most appearing infrequently. While scaling has improved average-case performance, persistent failures on low-frequency, domain-specific, cultural, and temporal knowledge remain poorly characterized. This paper develops a structured taxonomy and analysis of long-Tail Knowledge in large language models, synthesizing prior work across technical and sociotechnical perspectives.
  We introduce a structured analytical framework that synthesizes prior work across four complementary axes: how long-Tail Knowledge is defined, the mechanisms by which it is lost or distorted during training and inference, the technical interventions proposed to mitigate these failures, and the implications of these failures for fairness, accountability, transparency, and user trust. We further examine how existing evaluation practices obscure tail behavior and complicate accountability for rare but consequential failures. The paper concludes by identifying open challenges related to privacy, sustainability, and governance that constrain long-Tail Knowledge representation. Taken together, this paper provides a unifying conceptual framework for understanding how long-Tail Knowledge is defined, lost, evaluated, and manifested in deployed language model systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the reliability and behavior of LLMs as unbiased annotators in low-resource and identity-sensitive contexts.

Method: A benchmark analysis of 17 LLMs was conducted using a unified evaluation framework for annotating Bangla hate speech.

Result: Annotator bias and substantial instability were found in model judgments, with smaller task-specific models often outperforming larger LLMs.

Conclusion: Current LLMs have limitations for sensitive annotation tasks in low-resource languages, necessitating careful evaluation before deployment.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used as automated annotators to scale dataset creation, yet their reliability as unbiased annotators--especially for low-resource and identity-sensitive settings--remains poorly understood. In this work, we study the behavior of LLMs as zero-shot annotators for Bangla hate speech, a task where even human agreement is challenging, and annotator bias can have serious downstream consequences. We conduct a systematic benchmark of 17 LLMs using a unified evaluation framework. Our analysis uncovers annotator bias and substantial instability in model judgments. Surprisingly, increased model scale does not guarantee improved annotation quality--smaller, more task-aligned models frequently exhibit more consistent behavior than their larger counterparts. These results highlight important limitations of current LLMs for sensitive annotation tasks in low-resource languages and underscore the need for careful evaluation before deployment.

TL;DR: This paper introduces Aladdin-FTI, a system for generating and translating Arabic dialects and Modern Standard Arabic (MSA).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the under-representation and computational challenges of Arabic dialects in NLP by leveraging advancements like Large Language Models.

Method: Developed Aladdin-FTI to handle text generation and bidirectional translation for five Arabic dialects, MSA, and English.

Result: Aladdin-FTI successfully supports dialectal Arabic text generation and translation, addressing the variability in Arabic dialects.

Conclusion: The system enhances NLP capabilities for Arabic dialects and contributes with public access to code and trained models for further research.

Abstract: Arabic dialects have long been under-represented in Natural Language Processing (NLP) research due to their non-standardization and high variability, which pose challenges for computational modeling. Recent advances in the field, such as Large Language Models (LLMs), offer promising avenues to address this gap by enabling Arabic to be modeled as a pluricentric language rather than a monolithic system. This paper presents Aladdin-FTI, our submission to the AMIYA shared task. The proposed system is designed to both generate and translate dialectal Arabic (DA). Specifically, the model supports text generation in Moroccan, Egyptian, Palestinian, Syrian, and Saudi dialects, as well as bidirectional translation between these dialects, Modern Standard Arabic (MSA), and English. The code and trained model are publicly available.

TL;DR: The paper introduces MultiCW, a multilingual dataset to improve claim detection for fact-checking across languages, domains, and styles. It evaluates fine-tuned models outperforming zero-shot LLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the gap in detecting check-worthy claims as part of automated fact-checking, especially with limited resources across diverse languages and styles.

Method: The creation of MultiCW dataset with balanced samples across 16 languages, 7 topical domains, and 2 writing styles, alongside evaluation sets and benchmarking fine-tuned multilingual transformers with LLMs.

Result: Fine-tuned models consistently outperformed zero-shot LLMs in claim classification and generalized well across languages, domains, and styles.

Conclusion: MultiCW is a valuable resource for advancing automated fact-checking and enabling better comparisons between fine-tuned models and LLMs in detecting check-worthy claims.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are beginning to reshape how media professionals verify information, yet automated support for detecting check-worthy claims a key step in the fact-checking process remains limited. We introduce the Multi-Check-Worthy (MultiCW) dataset, a balanced multilingual benchmark for check-worthy claim detection spanning 16 languages, 7 topical domains, and 2 writing styles. It consists of 123,722 samples, evenly distributed between noisy (informal) and structured (formal) texts, with balanced representation of check-worthy and non-check-worthy classes across all languages. To probe robustness, we also introduce an equally balanced out-of-distribution evaluation set of 27,761 samples in 4 additional languages. To provide baselines, we benchmark 3 common fine-tuned multilingual transformers against a diverse set of 15 commercial and open LLMs under zero-shot settings. Our findings show that fine-tuned models consistently outperform zero-shot LLMs on claim classification and show strong out-of-distribution generalization across languages, domains, and styles. MultiCW provides a rigorous multilingual resource for advancing automated fact-checking and enables systematic comparisons between fine-tuned models and cutting-edge LLMs on the check-worthy claim detection task.

TL;DR: MemoryArena is introduced as a benchmark to evaluate agents' memory in multi-session settings, focusing on real-world interdependencies between memorization and action.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks either test memorization or single-session actions in isolation, failing to address realistic settings where memory and action are intertwined.

Method: Develop MemoryArena with agentic tasks that involve interdependent subtasks requiring agents to acquire and use memory from past actions to solve complex, multi-session tasks.

Result: Agents performing well on long-context memory benchmarks struggle within MemoryArena's agentic setting, highlighting deficiencies in existing evaluation methods.

Conclusion: MemoryArena demonstrates the importance of evaluating agents in realistic scenarios where memory and action are connected, providing deeper insights into their capabilities.

Abstract: Existing evaluations of agents with memory typically assess memorization and action in isolation. One class of benchmarks evaluates memorization by testing recall of past conversations or text but fails to capture how memory is used to guide future decisions. Another class focuses on agents acting in single-session tasks without the need for long-term memory. However, in realistic settings, memorization and action are tightly coupled: agents acquire memory while interacting with the environment, and subsequently rely on that memory to solve future tasks. To capture this setting, we introduce MemoryArena, a unified evaluation gym for benchmarking agent memory in multi-session Memory-Agent-Environment loops. The benchmark consists of human-crafted agentic tasks with explicitly interdependent subtasks, where agents must learn from earlier actions and feedback by distilling experiences into memory, and subsequently use that memory to guide later actions to solve the overall task. MemoryArena supports evaluation across web navigation, preference-constrained planning, progressive information search, and sequential formal reasoning, and reveals that agents with near-saturated performance on existing long-context memory benchmarks like LoCoMo perform poorly in our agentic setting, exposing a gap in current evaluations for agents with memory.

TL;DR: The paper introduces STING, a red-teaming framework to test misuse of LLM agents in multi-turn scenarios, showing it outperforms common benchmarks in identifying misuse vulnerabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the gap in evaluating how LLM agents can be manipulated into executing multi-step illicit tasks, given the limitations of single-prompt benchmark tests.

Method: The authors designed STING, a framework that builds step-by-step illicit plans through benign personas, probes target agents with adaptive multi-turn prompts, and uses judge agents for tracking task completion.

Result: STING demonstrates higher effectiveness in completing illicit tasks as compared to single-turn or baseline multi-turn methods, with unique findings in multilingual settings that challenge assumptions about success rates in lower-resource languages.

Conclusion: STING enhances testing of agent misuse in realistic multi-turn, multilingual scenarios, offering improved evaluation techniques for preventing LLM-based system misuse.

Abstract: LLM-based agents execute real-world workflows via tools and memory. These affordances enable ill-intended adversaries to also use these agents to carry out complex misuse scenarios. Existing agent misuse benchmarks largely test single-prompt instructions, leaving a gap in measuring how agents end up helping with harmful or illegal tasks over multiple turns. We introduce STING (Sequential Testing of Illicit N-step Goal execution), an automated red-teaming framework that constructs a step-by-step illicit plan grounded in a benign persona and iteratively probes a target agent with adaptive follow-ups, using judge agents to track phase completion. We further introduce an analysis framework that models multi-turn red-teaming as a time-to-first-jailbreak random variable, enabling analysis tools like discovery curves, hazard-ratio attribution by attack language, and a new metric: Restricted Mean Jailbreak Discovery. Across AgentHarm scenarios, STING yields substantially higher illicit-task completion than single-turn prompting and chat-oriented multi-turn baselines adapted to tool-using agents. In multilingual evaluations across six non-English settings, we find that attack success and illicit-task completion do not consistently increase in lower-resource languages, diverging from common chatbot findings. Overall, STING provides a practical way to evaluate and stress-test agent misuse in realistic deployment settings, where interactions are inherently multi-turn and often multilingual.

TL;DR: The paper introduces an agentic data augmentation method for Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis (ABSA), which utilizes iterative generation and verification processes to improve training data quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance performance in ABSA tasks by leveraging high-quality synthetic training data generated through an iterative and robust augmentation method.

Method: The proposed agentic method involves iterative generation and verification of synthetic training examples, compared to a closely matched prompting-based baseline using T5-Base and Tk-Instruct models.

Result: Agentic augmentation outperforms raw prompting, especially for aspect term generation tasks and label preservation. It also delivers consistent performance gains when combined with real data, particularly for T5-Base.

Conclusion: The agentic method effectively boosts ABSA model performance, with significant improvements observed for T5-Base compared to prompting-based augmentation.

Abstract: We propose an agentic data augmentation method for Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis (ABSA) that uses iterative generation and verification to produce high quality synthetic training examples. To isolate the effect of agentic structure, we also develop a closely matched prompting-based baseline using the same model and instructions. Both methods are evaluated across three ABSA subtasks (Aspect Term Extraction (ATE), Aspect Sentiment Classification (ATSC), and Aspect Sentiment Pair Extraction (ASPE)), four SemEval datasets, and two encoder-decoder models: T5-Base and Tk-Instruct. Our results show that the agentic augmentation outperforms raw prompting in label preservation of the augmented data, especially when the tasks require aspect term generation. In addition, when combined with real data, agentic augmentation provides higher gains, consistently outperforming prompting-based generation. These benefits are most pronounced for T5-Base, while the more heavily pretrained Tk-Instruct exhibits smaller improvements. As a result, augmented data helps T5-Base achieve comparable performance with its counterpart.

TL;DR: The paper introduces TabAgent, a framework for replacing AI decision components with lightweight classifiers to enhance efficiency, reducing latency by 95% and inference costs by 85-91%, while maintaining success rates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the inefficiencies of current agentic systems that rely heavily on frequent large language model (LLM) calls, which result in high latency and costs.

Method: The authors propose TabAgent, a framework consisting of three key components: TabSchema (structured schema extraction), TabSynth (schema-aligned synthetic supervision), and TabHead (lightweight classifier).

Result: TabAgent achieves task success equivalent to traditional methods while significantly reducing inference latency by 95% and costs by 85-91%.

Conclusion: TabAgent offers an efficient alternative for agentic systems by replacing generative bottlenecks in AI architectures with learned discriminative models, paving the way for scalable, cost-effective solutions.

Abstract: Agentic systems, AI architectures that autonomously execute multi-step workflows to achieve complex goals, are often built using repeated large language model (LLM) calls for closed-set decision tasks such as routing, shortlisting, gating, and verification. While convenient, this design makes deployments slow and expensive due to cumulative latency and token usage. We propose TabAgent, a framework for replacing generative decision components in closed-set selection tasks with a compact textual-tabular classifier trained on execution traces. TabAgent (i) extracts structured schema, state, and dependency features from trajectories (TabSchema), (ii) augments coverage with schema-aligned synthetic supervision (TabSynth), and (iii) scores candidates with a lightweight classifier (TabHead). On the long-horizon AppWorld benchmark, TabAgent maintains task-level success while eliminating shortlist-time LLM calls, reducing latency by approximately 95% and inference cost by 85-91%. Beyond tool shortlisting, TabAgent generalizes to other agentic decision heads, establishing a paradigm for learned discriminative replacements of generative bottlenecks in production agent architectures.

TL;DR: The paper introduces IndicEval, a benchmarking platform for evaluating large language models (LLMs) using high-stakes exam questions in English and Hindi, focusing on reasoning, domain knowledge, and bilingual adaptability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks for LLMs fail to reflect the academic rigor and multilingual complexity found in real-world applications, necessitating a more realistic evaluation approach.

Method: IndicEval utilizes real examination questions (UPSC, JEE, NEET) across STEM and humanities, automating assessments with Zero-Shot, Few-Shot, and Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting strategies. It allows for modular integration of new models and languages.

Result: Experiments on four LLMs reveal CoT significantly improves reasoning accuracy, cross-model performance disparities are evident in complex exams, and bilingual accuracy suffers, particularly in Hindi and under Zero-Shot conditions.

Conclusion: IndicEval provides a robust, extensible platform for evaluating LLMs in multilingual and educational settings, highlighting challenges in bilingual reasoning and offering pathways for model improvement.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) necessitates evaluation frameworks that reflect real-world academic rigor and multilingual complexity. This paper introduces IndicEval, a scalable benchmarking platform designed to assess LLM performance using authentic high-stakes examination questions from UPSC, JEE, and NEET across STEM and humanities domains in both English and Hindi. Unlike synthetic benchmarks, IndicEval grounds evaluation in real examination standards, enabling realistic measurement of reasoning, domain knowledge, and bilingual adaptability. The framework automates assessment using Zero-Shot, Few-Shot, and Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting strategies and supports modular integration of new models and languages. Experiments conducted on Gemini 2.0 Flash, GPT-4, Claude, and LLaMA 3-70B reveal three major findings. First, CoT prompting consistently improves reasoning accuracy, with substantial gains across subjects and languages. Second, significant cross-model performance disparities persist, particularly in high-complexity examinations. Third, multilingual degradation remains a critical challenge, with marked accuracy drops in Hindi compared to English, especially under Zero-Shot conditions. These results highlight persistent gaps in bilingual reasoning and domain transfer. Overall, IndicEval provides a practice-oriented, extensible foundation for rigorous, equitable evaluation of LLMs in multilingual educational settings and offers actionable insights for improving reasoning robustness and language adaptability.

### [75] [Training Models on Dialects of Translationese Shows How Lexical Diversity and Source-Target Syntactic Similarity Shape Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16469)
*Jenny Kunz*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores how training English language models on machine-translated text impacts their linguistic and grammatical performance based on properties of the source language.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Machine-translated text is crucial in multilingual NLP due to the scarcity of native multilingual data. However, this text often displays 'translationese,' which affects models trained on such data.

Method: The authors trained small English language models using text translated from 24 diverse source languages, analyzing how variations in typological and corpus properties influenced model performance.

Result: The source language significantly affects the models' behavior. Lexical diversity impacts general perplexity, while grammatical accuracy correlates strongly with typological similarity to English if sufficient data is available.

Conclusion: Translationese influences models differently based on source language properties, underscoring the importance of considering these factors when using machine-translated text for NLP training.

Abstract: Machine-translated data is widely used in multilingual NLP, particularly when native text is scarce. However, translated text differs systematically from native text. This phenomenon is known as translationese, and it reflects both traces of the source language and characteristic properties of translation itself. In this paper, we study how training on machine-translated data affects small English language models, focusing on how translationese from different source languages shapes linguistic acceptability judgments and language modelling for different domains. We train models on English text translated from 24 typologically and resource-diverse source languages, enabling a systematic analysis of how source language and corpus properties influence what models learn. Our results show that the source language has a clear impact on model behavior: general perplexity is more driven by the lexical diversity of the translated corpus, while grammatical performance is strongly correlated to typological similarity to English, given enough data.

*Jeffrey T. H. Wong,Zixi Zhang,Junyi Liu,Yiren Zhao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Team-of-Thoughts introduces a novel Multi-Agent System framework that leverages heterogeneous agents effectively, with superior benchmarks in reasoning and code generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing MAS architectures are limited by static and homogeneous configurations, restricting their ability to leverage post-trained model strengths.

Method: The paper introduces an orchestrator-tool paradigm with two mechanisms: orchestrator calibration for model coordination and self-assessment protocols for profiling expertise.

Result: Team-of-Thoughts achieves superior performance, notably 96.67% accuracy on AIME24 and 72.53% on LiveCodeBench, outperforming standard methods.

Conclusion: The proposed framework demonstrates the advantages of combining heterogeneous agents dynamically, enabling significant improvements in inference accuracy and task performance.

Abstract: Existing Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) typically rely on static, homogeneous model configurations, limiting their ability to exploit the distinct strengths of differently post-trained models. To address this, we introduce Team-of-Thoughts, a novel MAS architecture that leverages the complementary capabilities of heterogeneous agents via an orchestrator-tool paradigm. Our framework introduces two key mechanisms to optimize performance: (1) an orchestrator calibration scheme that identifies models with superior coordination capabilities, and (2) a self-assessment protocol where tool agents profile their own domain expertise to account for variations in post-training skills. During inference, the orchestrator dynamically activates the most suitable tool agents based on these proficiency profiles. Experiments on five reasoning and code generation benchmarks show that Team-of-Thoughts delivers consistently superior task performance. Notably, on AIME24 and LiveCodeBench, our approach achieves accuracies of 96.67% and 72.53%, respectively, substantially outperforming homogeneous role-play baselines, which score 80% and 65.93%.

### [77] [Learning to Learn from Language Feedback with Social Meta-Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16488)
*Jonathan Cook,Diego Antognini,Martin Klissarov,Claudiu Musat,Edward Grefenstette*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Large language models (LLMs) are improved with a methodology called social meta-learning (SML), enabling them to actively solicit and learn from feedback in conversational tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs struggle to adapt and learn from corrective feedback during dialogues, making their interactions less adaptive and collaborative compared to human conversations.

Method: Social meta-learning (SML) finetunes LLMs using simulated pedagogical dialogues, teaching them to request feedback and learn iteratively within conversation, converting static tasks into interactive problems.

Result: SML enables LLMs to generalize feedback usage across domains (e.g., math to coding), effectively solve underspecified tasks, reduce premature responses, and actively seek necessary information during conversations.

Conclusion: SML offers a scalable solution to enhance LLMs' ability to learn from conversational feedback, fostering adaptive and context-sensitive AI systems.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often struggle to learn from corrective feedback within a conversational context. They are rarely proactive in soliciting this feedback, even when faced with ambiguity, which can make their dialogues feel static, one-sided, and lacking the adaptive qualities of human conversation. To address these limitations, we draw inspiration from social meta-learning (SML) in humans - the process of learning how to learn from others. We formulate SML as a finetuning methodology, training LLMs to solicit and learn from language feedback in simulated pedagogical dialogues, where static tasks are converted into interactive social learning problems. SML effectively teaches models to use conversation to solve problems they are unable to solve in a single turn. This capability generalises across domains; SML on math problems produces models that better use feedback to solve coding problems and vice versa. Furthermore, despite being trained only on fully-specified problems, these models are better able to solve underspecified tasks where critical information is revealed over multiple turns. When faced with this ambiguity, SML-trained models make fewer premature answer attempts and are more likely to ask for the information they need. This work presents a scalable approach to developing AI systems that effectively learn from language feedback.

### [78] [From Growing to Looping: A Unified View of Iterative Computation in LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16490)
*Ferdinand Kapl,Emmanouil Angelis,Kaitlin Maile,Johannes von Oswald,Stefan Bauer*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper investigates the relationship between looping and depth-growing in neural networks, showing they both enhance reasoning through iterative computation and can complement each other for stronger results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the connection between looping and depth-growing neural networks in improving reasoning and explore how these methods can work together.

Method: The authors analyze depth-wise signatures of looping and depth-grown models, apply looping to depth-grown models, and assess their performance with reasoning tasks under different conditions.

Result: Looping and depth-growing exhibit shared iterative computation signatures. Combining them significantly improves reasoning tasks, achieving up to 2x accuracy improvements and demonstrating adaptability to additional data.

Conclusion: Looping and depth-growth are practical and complementary methods for scaling iterative computation, positioning them as effective strategies to enhance reasoning in neural networks.

Abstract: Looping, reusing a block of layers across depth, and depth growing, training shallow-to-deep models by duplicating middle layers, have both been linked to stronger reasoning, but their relationship remains unclear. We provide a mechanistic unification: looped and depth-grown models exhibit convergent depth-wise signatures, including increased reliance on late layers and recurring patterns aligned with the looped or grown block. These shared signatures support the view that their gains stem from a common form of iterative computation. Building on this connection, we show that the two techniques are adaptable and composable: applying inference-time looping to the middle blocks of a depth-grown model improves accuracy on some reasoning primitives by up to $2\times$, despite the model never being trained to loop. Both approaches also adapt better than the baseline when given more in-context examples or additional supervised fine-tuning data. Additionally, depth-grown models achieve the largest reasoning gains when using higher-quality, math-heavy cooldown mixtures, which can be further boosted by adapting a middle block to loop. Overall, our results position depth growth and looping as complementary, practical methods for inducing and scaling iterative computation to improve reasoning.

### [79] [Optimizing Soft Prompt Tuning via Structural Evolution](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16500)
*Zhenzhen Huang,Chaoning Zhang,Haoyu Bian,Songbo Zhang,Chi-lok Andy Tai,Jiaquan Zhang,Caiyan Qin,Jingjing Qu,Yalan Ye,Yang Yang,Heng Tao Shen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper proposes an optimization method leveraging topological data analysis to improve the interpretability and effectiveness of soft prompt tuning in large pre-trained language models, using a new loss function termed Topological Soft Prompt Loss (TSLoss).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Soft prompts achieve good results in few-shot settings but lack explicit semantics and interpretability due to their reliance on high-dimensional implicit representations.

Method: The method employs topological data analysis, specifically persistent homology, to measure the structural evolution of soft prompts during training and introduces a novel loss function (TSLoss) to guide learning toward topologically stable and connected parameter adaptations.

Result: Training with TSLoss results in faster convergence and improved tuning performance in soft prompt optimization while also enhancing interpretability.

Conclusion: The proposed TSLoss offers an interpretable and effective way to optimize soft prompt tuning, connecting structural and topological perspectives with enhanced model performance.

Abstract: Soft prompt tuning leverages continuous embeddings to capture task-specific information in large pre-trained language models (LLMs), achieving competitive performance in few-shot settings. However, soft prompts rely on high-dimensional, implicit representations and lack explicit semantics and traceable training behaviors, which limits their interpretability. To address this limitation, we propose a soft prompt tuning optimization method based on topological morphological evolution. Specifically, we employ persistent homology from topological data analysis (TDA) to quantify the structural representations of soft prompts in continuous parameter space and their training process evolution. Quantitative analysis shows that topologically stable and compact soft prompts achieve better downstream performance. Based on this empirical observation, we construct a loss function for optimizing soft prompt tuning, termed Topological Soft Prompt Loss (TSLoss). TSLoss guides the model to learn structurally stable adaptations by quantifying inter-parameter connectivity and redundancy. Extensive experiments show that training with TSLoss accelerates convergence and improves tuning performance, providing an interpretable method to understand and optimize soft prompt tuning from structural and topological perspectives.

*Taja Kuzman Pungeršek,Peter Rupnik,Daniela Širinić,Nikola Ljubešić*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces ParlaCAP, a dataset for analyzing European parliamentary agenda-setting with a scalable domain-specific classifier built leveraging a teacher-student framework.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The aim is to facilitate comparative research on political attention and representation across European parliaments, addressing limitations of existing classifiers in handling domain-specific, multilingual data.

Method: A teacher-student framework is adopted where a large language model annotates training data, and a multilingual encoder model is fine-tuned to these annotations for scalable, domain-specific classification.

Result: The domain-specific classifier demonstrates comparable annotation agreement to human annotators and surpasses existing CAP classifiers trained on out-of-domain data.

Conclusion: ParlaCAP provides a robust resource for analyzing policy topics in European parliaments with enhanced analytical capabilities through metadata and multilingual sentiment analysis tools.

Abstract: This paper introduces ParlaCAP, a large-scale dataset for analyzing parliamentary agenda setting across Europe, and proposes a cost-effective method for building domain-specific policy topic classifiers. Applying the Comparative Agendas Project (CAP) schema to the multilingual ParlaMint corpus of over 8 million speeches from 28 parliaments of European countries and autonomous regions, we follow a teacher-student framework in which a high-performing large language model (LLM) annotates in-domain training data and a multilingual encoder model is fine-tuned on these annotations for scalable data annotation. We show that this approach produces a classifier tailored to the target domain. Agreement between the LLM and human annotators is comparable to inter-annotator agreement among humans, and the resulting model outperforms existing CAP classifiers trained on manually-annotated but out-of-domain data. In addition to the CAP annotations, the ParlaCAP dataset offers rich speaker and party metadata, as well as sentiment predictions coming from the ParlaSent multilingual transformer model, enabling comparative research on political attention and representation across countries. We illustrate the analytical potential of the dataset with three use cases, examining the distribution of parliamentary attention across policy topics, sentiment patterns in parliamentary speech, and gender differences in policy attention.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper addresses the challenge of detecting PII in math tutoring transcripts, introducing MathEd-PII, a benchmark dataset for better redaction with domain-aware strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To tackle the problem of over-redaction by generic PII detection systems in math tutoring transcripts, which harms educational data's usability, especially due to numeric ambiguity.

Method: The authors created MathEd-PII, a dataset with tutoring transcript annotations, and tested detection methods including density-based segmentation and various LLM-based approaches for performance benchmarking.

Result: Math-aware prompting significantly outperformed the baseline detection system, achieving an F1 score of 0.821 compared to 0.379, reducing numeric false positives.

Conclusion: Domain context is essential for utility-preserving de-identification of math tutoring data, and MathEd-PII provides tools for advancing this effort.

Abstract: Large-scale sharing of dialogue-based data is instrumental for advancing the science of teaching and learning, yet rigorous de-identification remains a major barrier. In mathematics tutoring transcripts, numeric expressions frequently resemble structured identifiers (e.g., dates or IDs), leading generic Personally Identifiable Information (PII) detection systems to over-redact core instructional content and reduce dataset utility. This work asks how PII can be detected in math tutoring transcripts while preserving their educational utility. To address this challenge, we investigate the "numeric ambiguity" problem and introduce MathEd-PII, the first benchmark dataset for PII detection in math tutoring dialogues, created through a human-in-the-loop LLM workflow that audits upstream redactions and generates privacy-preserving surrogates. The dataset contains 1,000 tutoring sessions (115,620 messages; 769,628 tokens) with validated PII annotations. Using a density-based segmentation method, we show that false PII redactions are disproportionately concentrated in math-dense regions, confirming numeric ambiguity as a key failure mode. We then compare four detection strategies: a Presidio baseline and LLM-based approaches with basic, math-aware, and segment-aware prompting. Math-aware prompting substantially improves performance over the baseline (F1: 0.821 vs. 0.379) while reducing numeric false positives, demonstrating that de-identification must incorporate domain context to preserve analytic utility. This work provides both a new benchmark and evidence that utility-preserving de-identification for tutoring data requires domain-aware modeling.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces CitiLink-Summ, a benchmark dataset for summarization of European Portuguese municipal meeting minutes, and establishes baselines using advanced summarization models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Municipal meeting minutes are difficult for citizens to understand due to their complexity and length. Automatic summarization can address this issue, but there is a lack of datasets for developing and evaluating summarization models in this domain, especially for low-resource languages like European Portuguese.

Method: The authors created CitiLink-Summ, a corpus of 100 Portuguese municipal meeting minutes with 2,322 manually written summaries. They used this dataset to evaluate state-of-the-art generative models (BART, PRIMERA) and large language models (LLMs) using metrics such as ROUGE, BLEU, METEOR, and BERTScore.

Result: Baseline results for automatic summarization of municipal meeting minutes were established using the CitiLink-Summ dataset and advanced models, demonstrating the dataset's usability and value.

Conclusion: CitiLink-Summ is the first benchmark dataset for municipal meeting summarization in European Portuguese, facilitating the development of NLP solutions for complex government records and advancing research in this domain.

Abstract: Municipal meeting minutes are formal records documenting the discussions and decisions of local government, yet their content is often lengthy, dense, and difficult for citizens to navigate. Automatic summarization can help address this challenge by producing concise summaries for each discussion subject. Despite its potential, research on summarizing discussion subjects in municipal meeting minutes remains largely unexplored, especially in low-resource languages, where the inherent complexity of these documents adds further challenges. A major bottleneck is the scarcity of datasets containing high-quality, manually crafted summaries, which limits the development and evaluation of effective summarization models for this domain. In this paper, we present CitiLink-Summ, a new corpus of European Portuguese municipal meeting minutes, comprising 100 documents and 2,322 manually hand-written summaries, each corresponding to a distinct discussion subject. Leveraging this dataset, we establish baseline results for automatic summarization in this domain, employing state-of-the-art generative models (e.g., BART, PRIMERA) as well as large language models (LLMs), evaluated with both lexical and semantic metrics such as ROUGE, BLEU, METEOR, and BERTScore. CitiLink-Summ provides the first benchmark for municipal-domain summarization in European Portuguese, offering a valuable resource for advancing NLP research on complex administrative texts.

*Melkamu Abay Mersha,Jugal Kalita*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Introduces Context-Aware Layer-wise Integrated Gradients (CA-LIG) to improve the interpretability of transformer models, providing nuanced, context-sensitive attributions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing explainability methods for transformer models lack the ability to unambiguously capture token importance in a context-aware manner while also tracing how relevance evolves across layers and structures.

Method: Develop CA-LIG, which computes layer-wise Integrated Gradients in each Transformer block and integrates them with class-specific attention gradients to generate nuanced attribution maps.

Result: CA-LIG demonstrates stronger context sensitivity, enhanced faithfulness in attribution, and clearer visualizations compared to existing explainability methods across multiple tasks and domains.

Conclusion: The method contributes to advancing the interpretability and conceptual understanding of Transformer decision-making by offering a more comprehensive and reliable attribution framework.

Abstract: Transformer models achieve state-of-the-art performance across domains and tasks, yet their deeply layered representations make their predictions difficult to interpret. Existing explainability methods rely on final-layer attributions, capture either local token-level attributions or global attention patterns without unification, and lack context-awareness of inter-token dependencies and structural components. They also fail to capture how relevance evolves across layers and how structural components shape decision-making. To address these limitations, we proposed the \textbf{Context-Aware Layer-wise Integrated Gradients (CA-LIG) Framework}, a unified hierarchical attribution framework that computes layer-wise Integrated Gradients within each Transformer block and fuses these token-level attributions with class-specific attention gradients. This integration yields signed, context-sensitive attribution maps that capture supportive and opposing evidence while tracing the hierarchical flow of relevance through the Transformer layers. We evaluate the CA-LIG Framework across diverse tasks, domains, and transformer model families, including sentiment analysis and long and multi-class document classification with BERT, hate speech detection in a low-resource language setting with XLM-R and AfroLM, and image classification with Masked Autoencoder vision Transformer model. Across all tasks and architectures, CA-LIG provides more faithful attributions, shows stronger sensitivity to contextual dependencies, and produces clearer, more semantically coherent visualizations than established explainability methods. These results indicate that CA-LIG provides a more comprehensive, context-aware, and reliable explanation of Transformer decision-making, advancing both the practical interpretability and conceptual understanding of deep neural models.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper studies large-scale pre-training for multi-vector models, introducing ColBERT-Zero, which outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods while relying only on public data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve the performance of multi-vector models by focusing on large-scale pre-training rather than solely relying on knowledge distillation from single-vector models.

Method: Large-scale multi-vector pre-training and comparisons of its results with smaller KD steps. Analysis includes supervised steps and alignment of fine-tuning with pre-training setups.

Result: ColBERT-Zero, a model trained only on public data, surpasses previous state-of-the-art models (e.g., GTE-ModernColBERT, GTE-ModernBERT) and demonstrates efficacy of full pre-training strategies. Supervised steps before KD also prove effective for avoiding costly unsupervised phases.

Conclusion: Large-scale pre-training of multi-vector models leads to much better performance, especially in public data settings. Setting alignment between fine-tuning and pre-training setups is crucial for optimal outcomes.

Abstract: Current state-of-the-art multi-vector models are obtained through a small Knowledge Distillation (KD) training step on top of strong single-vector models, leveraging the large-scale pre-training of these models. In this paper, we study the pre-training of multi-vector models and show that large-scale multi-vector pre-training yields much stronger multi-vector models. Notably, a fully ColBERT-pre-trained model, ColBERT-Zero, trained only on public data, outperforms GTE-ModernColBERT as well as its base model, GTE-ModernBERT, which leverages closed and much stronger data, setting new state-of-the-art for model this size. We also find that, although performing only a small KD step is not enough to achieve results close to full pre-training, adding a supervised step beforehand allows to achieve much closer performance while skipping the most costly unsupervised phase. Finally, we find that aligning the fine-tuning and pre-training setups is crucial when repurposing existing models. To enable exploration of our results, we release various checkpoints as well as code used to train them.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper studies inconsistencies in pairwise judgment probabilities of large language models (LLMs) and introduces BT-sigma, a model to infer rankings and judge reliability automatically.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the variability and inconsistency in LLM-based comparative judgments for natural language generation evaluation, especially in scenarios without human-labelled supervision.

Method: Proposes BT-sigma, an extension of the Bradley-Terry model, to infer item rankings and judge (LLM) reliability jointly, using pairwise comparisons without requiring supervision.

Result: BT-sigma outperforms traditional aggregation methods and correlates with independent measures of consistency in LLM judgments on benchmark datasets.

Conclusion: BT-sigma effectively models judge reliability and improves assessment by addressing inconsistencies, offering an unsupervised calibration solution.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly applied as automatic evaluators for natural language generation assessment often using pairwise comparative judgements. Existing approaches typically rely on single judges or aggregate multiple judges assuming equal reliability. In practice, LLM judges vary substantially in performance across tasks and aspects, and their judgment probabilities may be biased and inconsistent. Furthermore, human-labelled supervision for judge calibration may be unavailable. We first empirically demonstrate that inconsistencies in LLM comparison probabilities exist and show that it limits the effectiveness of direct probability-based ranking. To address this, we study the LLM-as-a-jury setting and propose BT-sigma, a judge-aware extension of the Bradley-Terry model that introduces a discriminator parameter for each judge to jointly infer item rankings and judge reliability from pairwise comparisons alone. Experiments on benchmark NLG evaluation datasets show that BT-sigma consistently outperforms averaging-based aggregation methods, and that the learned discriminator strongly correlates with independent measures of the cycle consistency of LLM judgments. Further analysis reveals that BT-sigma can be interpreted as an unsupervised calibration mechanism that improves aggregation by modelling judge reliability.

### [86] [AREG: Adversarial Resource Extraction Game for Evaluating Persuasion and Resistance in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16639)
*Adib Sakhawat,Fardeen Sadab*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Adversarial Resource Extraction Game (AREG) to evaluate the persuasion and resistance capabilities of LLMs in dynamic adversarial settings. Results show that persuasion and resistance are weakly correlated and defensive ability tends to be stronger.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Researchers aim to understand and evaluate the social intelligence of LLMs by moving beyond simple text generation to dynamic, adversarial, interactional frameworks. This helps assess complex behaviors such as persuasion and resistance in negotiation-like settings.

Method: A game called AREG is designed, which creates a multi-turn, zero-sum negotiation scenario where models compete for resources. The study conducts a round-robin tournament among frontier LLMs to evaluate offensive (persuasion) and defensive (resistance) capabilities.

Result: Persuasion and resistance capabilities are weakly correlated (ρ = 0.33) and do not reliably predict each other. Models generally demonstrate stronger resistance scores than persuasion scores, revealing a defensive advantage.

Conclusion: Social influence in LLMs is not a unified ability. Purely focusing on persuasion in evaluation frameworks may overlook other asymmetries or vulnerabilities, such as defensive strength and interactional dynamics.

Abstract: Evaluating the social intelligence of Large Language Models (LLMs) increasingly requires moving beyond static text generation toward dynamic, adversarial interaction. We introduce the Adversarial Resource Extraction Game (AREG), a benchmark that operationalizes persuasion and resistance as a multi-turn, zero-sum negotiation over financial resources. Using a round-robin tournament across frontier models, AREG enables joint evaluation of offensive (persuasion) and defensive (resistance) capabilities within a single interactional framework. Our analysis provides evidence that these capabilities are weakly correlated ($ρ= 0.33$) and empirically dissociated: strong persuasive performance does not reliably predict strong resistance, and vice versa. Across all evaluated models, resistance scores exceed persuasion scores, indicating a systematic defensive advantage in adversarial dialogue settings. Further linguistic analysis suggests that interaction structure plays a central role in these outcomes. Incremental commitment-seeking strategies are associated with higher extraction success, while verification-seeking responses are more prevalent in successful defenses than explicit refusal. Together, these findings indicate that social influence in LLMs is not a monolithic capability and that evaluation frameworks focusing on persuasion alone may overlook asymmetric behavioral vulnerabilities.

*Subrit Dikshit*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces Quecto-V1, a small language model for Indian legal intelligence, with a focus on accessibility and efficiency through domain-specific training and 8-bit quantization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rise of LLMs in NLP has created a gap where resource-heavy models exclude practitioners in constrained environments, especially in privacy-critical fields like law.

Method: The authors trained a modified GPT-2 architecture (124M parameters) exclusively on Indian legal texts, incorporating post-training 8-bit quantization for efficiency.

Result: Quecto-V1 excels in legal-specific retrieval tasks while running offline on consumer-grade CPUs, with a 74% reduction in model size and minimal accuracy loss.

Conclusion: Domain-specific, quantized small models like Quecto-V1 can democratize access to specialized applications like legal intelligence while ensuring privacy and cost-effectiveness.

Abstract: The rapid proliferation of Large Language Models (LLMs) has revolutionized Natural Language Processing (NLP) but has simultaneously created a "resource divide." State-of-the-art legal intelligence systems typically rely on massive parameter counts (7B+) and cloud-based inference, rendering them inaccessible to practitioners in resource-constrained environments and posing significant data sovereignty risks. This paper introduces Quecto-V1, a domain-specific Small Language Model (SLM) engineered to democratize access to Indian legal intelligence. Built upon a custom configuration of the GPT-2 architecture (124 million parameters), Quecto-V1 was trained from scratch exclusively on a corpus of Indian statutes, including the Indian Penal Code (IPC), the Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC), and the Constitution of India. Unlike generalist models, which prioritize broad world knowledge, our approach maximizes "lexical density" within the legal domain. Furthermore, we address the deployment bottleneck by applying post-training 8-bit quantization (GGUF format), compressing the model to a memory footprint of under 150 MB. Our empirical analysis demonstrates that Quecto-V1 achieves high fidelity in retrieving statutory definitions and penal provisions, outperforming general-purpose SLMs in domain-specific exact match tasks while running entirely offline on consumer-grade CPUs. We further present an ablation study showing that 8-bit quantization yields a 74% reduction in model size with less than 3.5% degradation in retrieval accuracy compared to full-precision baselines. These findings suggest that for specialized, high-stakes domains like law, domain-specific training coupled with aggressive quantization offers a viable, privacy-preserving alternative to monolithic cloud models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current multilingual safety alignments require significant resources, limiting scalability. The motivation is to create a resource-efficient solution.

Method: The authors introduce the Multi-Lingual Consistency (MLC) loss, which improves alignment by enhancing collinearity between multilingual representation vectors. It integrates with existing monolingual pipelines and enables simultaneous alignment across languages using multilingual prompt variants.

Result: The method is validated on different model architectures, showing improved multilingual safety and cross-lingual generalization with minimal impact on the model's general utilities.

Conclusion: The proposed MLC loss method is an effective, practical solution for multilingual consistency alignment under limited supervision, offering scalability and improved safety.

Abstract: The widespread deployment of large language models (LLMs) across linguistic communities necessitates reliable multilingual safety alignment. However, recent efforts to extend alignment to other languages often require substantial resources, either through large-scale, high-quality supervision in the target language or through pairwise alignment with high-resource languages, which limits scalability. In this work, we propose a resource-efficient method for improving multilingual safety alignment. We introduce a plug-and-play Multi-Lingual Consistency (MLC) loss that can be integrated into existing monolingual alignment pipelines. By improving collinearity between multilingual representation vectors, our method encourages directional consistency at the multilingual semantic level in a single update. This allows simultaneous alignment across multiple languages using only multilingual prompt variants without requiring additional response-level supervision in low-resource languages. We validate the proposed method across different model architectures and alignment paradigms, and demonstrate its effectiveness in enhancing multilingual safety with limited impact on general model utility. Further evaluation across languages and tasks indicates improved cross-lingual generalization, suggesting the proposed approach as a practical solution for multilingual consistency alignment under limited supervision.

### [89] [Calibrate-Then-Act: Cost-Aware Exploration in LLM Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16699)
*Wenxuan Ding,Nicholas Tomlin,Greg Durrett*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a framework called Calibrate-Then-Act (CTA) to improve LLM decision-making by reasoning about cost-uncertainty tradeoffs in problem environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs face issues in scenarios requiring interaction with an environment, where cost-uncertainty tradeoffs must be reasoned out (e.g., testing code snippets for correctness).

Method: The Calibrate-Then-Act (CTA) framework formalizes tasks like coding and information retrieval as sequential decision-making under uncertainty, using a prior to model latent environment states and feed these into the LLM for optimized reasoning.

Result: Experiments on information-seeking question answering and coding tasks show CTA improves decision-making strategies, outperforming baseline approaches.

Conclusion: Explicit reasoning about cost-benefit tradeoffs with frameworks like CTA enhances the ability of LLMs to make optimal environment exploration decisions.

Abstract: LLMs are increasingly being used for complex problems which are not necessarily resolved in a single response, but require interacting with an environment to acquire information. In these scenarios, LLMs must reason about inherent cost-uncertainty tradeoffs in when to stop exploring and commit to an answer. For instance, on a programming task, an LLM should test a generated code snippet if it is uncertain about the correctness of that code; the cost of writing a test is nonzero, but typically lower than the cost of making a mistake. In this work, we show that we can induce LLMs to explicitly reason about balancing these cost-uncertainty tradeoffs, then perform more optimal environment exploration. We formalize multiple tasks, including information retrieval and coding, as sequential decision-making problems under uncertainty. Each problem has latent environment state that can be reasoned about via a prior which is passed to the LLM agent. We introduce a framework called Calibrate-Then-Act (CTA), where we feed the LLM this additional context to enable it to act more optimally. This improvement is preserved even under RL training of both the baseline and CTA. Our results on information-seeking QA and on a simplified coding task show that making cost-benefit tradeoffs explicit with CTA can help agents discover more optimal decision-making strategies.

*Hee Seung Hwang,Xindi Wu,Sanghyuk Chun,Olga Russakovsky*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes REFINE, an RL-based framework addressing limitations in fast weight architectures for long-context modeling by shifting from NTP to NSP objectives, showing superior performance on various long-context tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to overcome the limitations of fast weight architectures in capturing semantic coherence and long-range dependencies due to reliance on the next-token prediction (NTP) paradigm, which is insufficient for adequate context modeling.

Method: REFINE employs a reinforcement learning framework with a next-sequence prediction (NSP) objective. It uses prediction entropy to select informative token positions, generates multi-token rollouts, assigns self-supervised sequence-level rewards, and optimizes with group relative policy optimization (GRPO).

Result: Experiments with models like LaCT-760M and DeltaNet-1.3B show that REFINE outperforms traditional supervised fine-tuning with NTP across tasks including retrieval, question answering, and benchmarks like LongBench.

Conclusion: REFINE represents an efficient and flexible method for improving long-context modeling in fast weight architectures, offering enhancements throughout the training lifecycle of pre-trained language models.

Abstract: Fast weight architectures offer a promising alternative to attention-based transformers for long-context modeling by maintaining constant memory overhead regardless of context length. However, their potential is limited by the next-token prediction (NTP) training paradigm. NTP optimizes single-token predictions and ignores semantic coherence across multiple tokens following a prefix. Consequently, fast weight models, which dynamically update their parameters to store contextual information, learn suboptimal representations that fail to capture long-range dependencies. We introduce REFINE (Reinforced Fast weIghts with Next sEquence prediction), a reinforcement learning framework that trains fast weight models under the next-sequence prediction (NSP) objective. REFINE selects informative token positions based on prediction entropy, generates multi-token rollouts, assigns self-supervised sequence-level rewards, and optimizes the model with group relative policy optimization (GRPO). REFINE is applicable throughout the training lifecycle of pre-trained language models: mid-training, post-training, and test-time training. Our experiments on LaCT-760M and DeltaNet-1.3B demonstrate that REFINE consistently outperforms supervised fine-tuning with NTP across needle-in-a-haystack retrieval, long-context question answering, and diverse tasks in LongBench. REFINE provides an effective and versatile framework for improving long-context modeling in fast weight architectures.

### [91] [Egocentric Bias in Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15892)
*Maijunxian Wang,Yijiang Li,Bingyang Wang,Tianwei Zhao,Ran Ji,Qingying Gao,Emmy Liu,Hokin Deng,Dezhi Luo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces FlipSet, a benchmark for testing visual perspective-taking abilities of vision-language models, uncovering egocentric biases and failures in spatial reasoning integration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the gap in evaluating visual perspective-taking abilities in vision-language models and highlight their limitations in spatial reasoning.

Method: FlipSet is developed as a diagnostic benchmark requiring models to simulate 180-degree rotations of 2D character strings, isolating spatial transformations.

Result: Evaluating 103 models shows egocentric bias with most performing below chance, revealing compositional deficits in integrating spatial and social operations.

Conclusion: Current vision-language models fail in integrating theory-of-mind and spatial reasoning, highlighting limitations and offering FlipSet as a diagnostic tool for improvement.

Abstract: Visual perspective taking--inferring how the world appears from another's viewpoint--is foundational to social cognition. We introduce FlipSet, a diagnostic benchmark for Level-2 visual perspective taking (L2 VPT) in vision-language models. The task requires simulating 180-degree rotations of 2D character strings from another agent's perspective, isolating spatial transformation from 3D scene complexity. Evaluating 103 VLMs reveals systematic egocentric bias: the vast majority perform below chance, with roughly three-quarters of errors reproducing the camera viewpoint. Control experiments expose a compositional deficit--models achieve high theory-of-mind accuracy and above-chance mental rotation in isolation, yet fail catastrophically when integration is required. This dissociation indicates that current VLMs lack the mechanisms needed to bind social awareness to spatial operations, suggesting fundamental limitations in model-based spatial reasoning. FlipSet provides a cognitively grounded testbed for diagnosing perspective-taking capabilities in multimodal systems.

*Jingwei Li,Jiaxin Tong,Pengfei Wu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper addresses the challenge of detecting realistic facial forgeries with a novel MSBA-CLIP framework that leverages CLIP, blending augmentation, and forgery intensity estimation, achieving state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing facial forgery detection methods struggle with accuracy and generalization due to distribution shifts caused by diverse forgery methods.

Method: The proposed MSBA-CLIP framework integrates CLIP's multimodal alignment, Multivariate and Soft Blending Augmentation, and a Multivariate Forgery Intensity Estimation module.

Result: The framework demonstrated superior accuracy and AUC in both in-domain and cross-domain evaluations, achieving improvements over baselines and solidifying its efficacy.

Conclusion: Although computationally demanding, the MSBA-CLIP framework significantly advances generalizable and robust deepfake detection methods, overcoming prior limitations.

Abstract: The proliferation of highly realistic facial forgeries necessitates robust detection methods. However, existing approaches often suffer from limited accuracy and poor generalization due to significant distribution shifts among samples generated by diverse forgery techniques. To address these challenges, we propose a novel Multivariate and Soft Blending Augmentation with CLIP-guided Forgery Intensity Estimation (MSBA-CLIP) framework. Our method leverages the multimodal alignment capabilities of CLIP to capture subtle forgery traces. We introduce a Multivariate and Soft Blending Augmentation (MSBA) strategy that synthesizes images by blending forgeries from multiple methods with random weights, forcing the model to learn generalizable patterns. Furthermore, a dedicated Multivariate Forgery Intensity Estimation (MFIE) module is designed to explicitly guide the model in learning features related to varied forgery modes and intensities. Extensive experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art performance. On in-domain tests, our method improves Accuracy and AUC by 3.32\% and 4.02\%, respectively, over the best baseline. In cross-domain evaluations across five datasets, it achieves an average AUC gain of 3.27\%. Ablation studies confirm the efficacy of both proposed components. While the reliance on a large vision-language model entails higher computational cost, our work presents a significant step towards more generalizable and robust deepfake detection.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the cost and performance gap between high-resolution and low-resolution LiDAR sensors, thereby enabling cross-sensor compatibility in real-world autonomous driving.

Method: Categorization of LiDAR super-resolution methods into CNN-based architectures, model-based deep unrolling, implicit representation methods, and Transformer & Mamba-based approaches; analysis of benchmarks, data representations, and metrics.

Result: Current trends emphasize range image representation for efficiency, extreme model compression, resolution flexibility, real-time processing, and sensor generalization.

Conclusion: The paper highlights the potential of LiDAR super-resolution but also outlines open challenges and future research areas for practical deployments in enhanced autonomous driving.

Abstract: LiDAR sensors are often considered essential for autonomous driving, but high-resolution sensors remain expensive while affordable low-resolution sensors produce sparse point clouds that miss critical details. LiDAR super-resolution addresses this challenge by using deep learning to enhance sparse point clouds, bridging the gap between different sensor types and enabling cross-sensor compatibility in real-world deployments. This paper presents the first comprehensive survey of LiDAR super-resolution methods for autonomous driving. Despite the importance of practical deployment, no systematic review has been conducted until now. We organize existing approaches into four categories: CNN-based architectures, model-based deep unrolling, implicit representation methods, and Transformer and Mamba-based approaches. We establish fundamental concepts including data representations, problem formulation, benchmark datasets and evaluation metrics. Current trends include the adoption of range image representation for efficient processing, extreme model compression and the development of resolution-flexible architectures. Recent research prioritizes real-time inference and cross-sensor generalization for practical deployment. We conclude by identifying open challenges and future research directions for advancing LiDAR super-resolution technology.

*Xianwei Mao,Kai Ye,Sheng Zhou,Nan Zhang,Haikuan Huang,Bin Li,Jiajun Bu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces MaS-VQA, a framework for improving KB-VQA by filtering irrelevant visual regions and knowledge fragments, enabling better answer accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current KB-VQA models struggle with noisy, incomplete, or misaligned external knowledge, and internal knowledge is difficult to interpret and utilize effectively.

Method: MaS-VQA employs a Mask-and-Select mechanism to filter irrelevant visual content and knowledge fragments, combined with constrained activation of internal knowledge for co-modeling.

Result: Experiments show that MaS-VQA boosts performance on Encyclopedic-VQA and InfoSeek datasets across various MLLM architectures, while ablation tests confirm its noise-reduction utility.

Conclusion: Integrating explicit filtering and constrained reasoning allows MaS-VQA to enhance the synergy between external and internal knowledge, leading to improved KB-VQA results.

Abstract: Knowledge-based Visual Question Answering (KB-VQA) requires models to answer questions by integrating visual information with external knowledge. However, retrieved knowledge is often noisy, partially irrelevant, or misaligned with the visual content, while internal model knowledge is difficult to control and interpret. Naive aggregation of these sources limits reasoning effectiveness and reduces answer accuracy. To address this, we propose MaS-VQA, a selection-driven framework that tightly couples explicit knowledge filtering with implicit knowledge reasoning. MaS-VQA first retrieves candidate passages and applies a Mask-and-Select mechanism to jointly prune irrelevant image regions and weakly relevant knowledge fragments, producing compact, high-signal multimodal knowledge . This filtered knowledge then guides the activation of internal knowledge in a constrained semantic space, enabling complementary co-modeling of explicit and implicit knowledge for robust answer prediction. Experiments on Encyclopedic-VQA and InfoSeek demonstrate consistent performance gains across multiple MLLM backbones, and ablations verify that the selection mechanism effectively reduces noise and enhances knowledge utilization.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the lack of benchmarks evaluating precise spatial reasoning on Earth imagery in MLLMs, which is key for applications like embodied AI.

Method: The authors designed EarthSpatialBench, a benchmark with over 325K question-answer pairs, covering qualitative/quantitative spatial reasoning, topological relations, object queries, and references using textual descriptions, visual overlays, and geometry coordinates.

Result: Experiments on open-source and proprietary models identified limitations in their spatial reasoning capabilities when using EarthSpatialBench.

Conclusion: EarthSpatialBench fills the gap in testing spatial reasoning on Earth imagery, providing a comprehensive framework to evaluate and improve MLLMs.

Abstract: Benchmarking spatial reasoning in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) has attracted growing interest in computer vision due to its importance for embodied AI and other agentic systems that require precise interaction with the physical world. However, spatial reasoning on Earth imagery has lagged behind, as it uniquely involves grounding objects in georeferenced images and quantitatively reasoning about distances, directions, and topological relations using both visual cues and vector geometry coordinates (e.g., 2D bounding boxes, polylines, and polygons). Existing benchmarks for Earth imagery primarily focus on 2D spatial grounding, image captioning, and coarse spatial relations (e.g., simple directional or proximity cues). They lack support for quantitative direction and distance reasoning, systematic topological relations, and complex object geometries beyond bounding boxes. To fill this gap, we propose \textbf{EarthSpatialBench}, a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating spatial reasoning in MLLMs on Earth imagery. The benchmark contains over 325K question-answer pairs spanning: (1) qualitative and quantitative reasoning about spatial distance and direction; (2) systematic topological relations; (3) single-object queries, object-pair queries, and compositional aggregate group queries; and (4) object references expressed via textual descriptions, visual overlays, and explicit geometry coordinates, including 2D bounding boxes, polylines, and polygons. We conducted extensive experiments on both open-source and proprietary models to identify limitations in the spatial reasoning of MLLMs.

*Christian Schlarmann,Matthias Hein*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This study explores a security vulnerability in Generative Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs), demonstrating how manipulated images can trigger biased outputs even after a long multi-turn conversation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to investigate the underexplored security vulnerabilities of LVLMs, specifically in long-context multi-turn interactions, where user manipulation could occur without immediate detection.

Method: The authors propose a Visual Memory Injection (VMI) attack, which stealthily manipulates LVLMs by embedding triggers into images downloaded by users, inducing specific target responses under certain prompts.

Result: VMI successfully exploits LVLMs, showing effective manipulation across multi-turn conversations with users in tests involving various open-weight LVLMs.

Conclusion: The findings highlight the need for improved robustness in LVLMs to defend against stealthy multi-turn attacks via perturbed images, emphasizing the risk of large-scale user manipulation.

Abstract: Generative large vision-language models (LVLMs) have recently achieved impressive performance gains, and their user base is growing rapidly. However, the security of LVLMs, in particular in a long-context multi-turn setting, is largely underexplored. In this paper, we consider the realistic scenario in which an attacker uploads a manipulated image to the web/social media. A benign user downloads this image and uses it as input to the LVLM. Our novel stealthy Visual Memory Injection (VMI) attack is designed such that on normal prompts the LVLM exhibits nominal behavior, but once the user gives a triggering prompt, the LVLM outputs a specific prescribed target message to manipulate the user, e.g. for adversarial marketing or political persuasion. Compared to previous work that focused on single-turn attacks, VMI is effective even after a long multi-turn conversation with the user. We demonstrate our attack on several recent open-weight LVLMs. This article thereby shows that large-scale manipulation of users is feasible with perturbed images in multi-turn conversation settings, calling for better robustness of LVLMs against these attacks.

*Yuval Levental*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper investigates a key limitation of vision-language models (VLMs) in accurately localizing binary grid cells when textual identities are absent. Experiments show significant performance drops in visual tasks that do not leverage text recognition pathways.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to identify limitations in current vision-language models (VLMs) by evaluating their ability to localize visual elements in binary grids without the help of textual markers, showing these models' reliance on text-recognition pathways for spatial reasoning.

Method: Fifteen 15x15 binary grids with varying densities were created and rendered in two styles: one with text symbols (. and #) and another with filled squares (no textual identifiers). Three VLMs (Claude, ChatGPT, and Gemini) were tasked to transcribe these grids under both conditions.

Result: In the text-symbol condition, the models achieved higher accuracy (Claude: 91%, ChatGPT: 91%, Gemini: 84%) and F1 scores (Claude and ChatGPT: ~84%, Gemini: 63%). In the filled-squares condition, all models showed significantly lower accuracies (60-73%) and F1 scores (29-39%). Each model exhibited distinct failure patterns in the filled-squares condition.

Conclusion: The results highlight a critical limitation in VLMs' capacity for spatial reasoning when text-based pathways are absent, emphasizing a reliance on text features for accurate localization. Further development is needed to improve VLMs' native visual reasoning skills.

Abstract: We present a simple experiment that exposes a fundamental limitation in vision-language models (VLMs): the inability to accurately localize filled cells in binary grids when those cells lack textual identity. We generate fifteen 15x15 grids with varying density (10.7%-41.8% filled cells) and render each as two image types -- text symbols (. and #) and filled squares without gridlines -- then ask three frontier VLMs (Claude Opus, ChatGPT 5.2, and Gemini 3 Thinking) to transcribe them. In the text-symbol condition, Claude and ChatGPT achieve approximately 91% cell accuracy and 84% F1, while Gemini achieves 84% accuracy and 63% F1. In the filled-squares condition, all three models collapse to 60-73% accuracy and 29-39% F1. Critically, all conditions pass through the same visual encoder -- the text symbols are images, not tokenized text. The text-vs-squares F1 gap ranges from 34 to 54 points across models, demonstrating that VLMs behave as if they possess a high-fidelity text-recognition pathway for spatial reasoning that dramatically outperforms their native visual pathway. Each model exhibits a distinct failure mode in the squares condition -- systematic under-counting (Claude), massive over-counting (ChatGPT), and template hallucination (Gemini) -- but all share the same underlying deficit: severely degraded spatial localization for non-textual visual elements.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces GPEReg-Net, a framework for improving photoacoustic microscopy registration, achieving superior performance metrics over the state-of-the-art through scene-appearance disentanglement and temporal coherence techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Imaging speed improvements in optical photoacoustic microscopy introduced domain shifts and misalignments that were inadequately addressed by existing registration methods.

Method: The authors propose GPEReg-Net, utilizing Adaptive Instance Normalization for scene-appearance disentanglement and a Global Position Encoding module to improve temporal coherence during registration.

Result: GPEReg-Net outperformed existing methods on benchmark datasets, achieving superior metrics: NCC of 0.953, SSIM of 0.932, and PSNR of 34.49dB.

Conclusion: GPEReg-Net effectively addresses domain shift and geometric misalignment while improving registration performance, setting a new benchmark in optical photoacoustic microscopy registration.

Abstract: High-speed optical-resolution photoacoustic microscopy (OR-PAM) with bidirectional raster scanning doubles imaging speed but introduces coupled domain shift and geometric misalignment between forward and backward scan lines. Existing registration methods, constrained by brightness constancy assumptions, achieve limited alignment quality, while recent generative approaches address domain shift through complex architectures that lack temporal awareness across frames. We propose GPEReg-Net, a scene-appearance disentanglement framework that separates domain-invariant scene features from domain-specific appearance codes via Adaptive Instance Normalization (AdaIN), enabling direct image-to-image registration without explicit deformation field estimation. To exploit temporal structure in sequential acquisitions, we introduce a Global Position Encoding (GPE) module that combines learnable position embeddings with sinusoidal encoding and cross-frame attention, allowing the network to leverage context from neighboring frames for improved temporal coherence. On the OR-PAM-Reg-4K benchmark (432 test samples), GPEReg-Net achieves NCC of 0.953, SSIM of 0.932, and PSNR of 34.49dB, surpassing the state-of-the-art by 3.8% in SSIM and 1.99dB in PSNR while maintaining competitive NCC.

*Phoenix Yu,Tilo Burghardt,Andrew W Dowsey,Neill W Campbell*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper addresses challenges in detecting and re-identifying Holstein-Friesian cows in crowded farm environments using a novel detect-segment-identify pipeline.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current detection methods fail in crowded scenarios, particularly for cows with complex coat patterns, limiting effectiveness and transferability.

Method: The authors propose a new pipeline integrating Open-Vocabulary Weight-free Localisation, Segment Anything models, and Re-ID networks for pre-processing and recognition.

Result: Their approach achieved a detection accuracy of 98.93%, surpassing baselines with improvements of 47.52% and 27.13%. Additionally, unsupervised contrastive learning reached 94.82% Re-ID accuracy.

Conclusion: The paper demonstrates effective and reliable Re-ID in crowded settings without manual intervention, aided by their novel methodology and accessible dataset/code.

Abstract: Holstein-Friesian detection and re-identification (Re-ID) methods capture individuals well when targets are spatially separate. However, existing approaches, including YOLO-based species detection, break down when cows group closely together. This is particularly prevalent for species which have outline-breaking coat patterns. To boost both effectiveness and transferability in this setting, we propose a new detect-segment-identify pipeline that leverages the Open-Vocabulary Weight-free Localisation and the Segment Anything models as pre-processing stages alongside Re-ID networks. To evaluate our approach, we publish a collection of nine days CCTV data filmed on a working dairy farm. Our methodology overcomes detection breakdown in dense animal groupings, resulting in a 98.93% accuracy. This significantly outperforms current oriented bounding box-driven, as well as SAM species detection baselines with accuracy improvements of 47.52% and 27.13%, respectively. We show that unsupervised contrastive learning can build on this to yield 94.82% Re-ID accuracy on our test data. Our work demonstrates that Re-ID in crowded scenarios is both practical as well as reliable in working farm settings with no manual intervention. Code and dataset are provided for reproducibility.

TL;DR: This paper introduces a self-supervised framework for remote photoplethysmography (rPPG) in Pediatric Intensive Care Units, improving robustness in clinical settings with motion artifacts and limited data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional contact-based sensors in PICUs cause discomfort, skin irritation, and infection risks. Current rPPG methods face challenges like motion artifacts and variable lighting, hindering their adoption in clinical settings.

Method: The authors propose a self-supervised progressive curriculum learning framework using VisionMamba architecture, adaptive masking, and teacher-student distillation. They train the model across clean public videos, synthetic occlusion scenarios, and clinical data from 500 pediatric patients.

Result: Their system achieves a 42% reduction in mean absolute error compared to standard masked autoencoders and a 31% improvement over PhysFormer, with a final MAE of 3.2 bpm. The model also adapts well to occlusions and noisy clinical environments.

Conclusion: The framework advances contactless heart rate monitoring in pediatric care settings by addressing data, robustness, and physiological relevance challenges, offering a practical and effective solution.

Abstract: Continuous monitoring of vital signs in Pediatric Intensive Care Units (PICUs) is essential for early detection of clinical deterioration and effective clinical decision-making. However, contact-based sensors such as pulse oximeters may cause skin irritation, increase infection risk, and lead to patient discomfort. Remote photoplethysmography (rPPG) offers a contactless alternative to monitor heart rate using facial video, but remains underutilized in PICUs due to motion artifacts, occlusions, variable lighting, and domain shifts between laboratory and clinical data.
  We introduce a self-supervised pretraining framework for rPPG estimation in the PICU setting, based on a progressive curriculum strategy. The approach leverages the VisionMamba architecture and integrates an adaptive masking mechanism, where a lightweight Mamba-based controller assigns spatiotemporal importance scores to guide probabilistic patch sampling. This strategy dynamically increases reconstruction difficulty while preserving physiological relevance.
  To address the lack of labeled clinical data, we adopt a teacher-student distillation setup. A supervised expert model, trained on public datasets, provides latent physiological guidance to the student. The curriculum progresses through three stages: clean public videos, synthetic occlusion scenarios, and unlabeled videos from 500 pediatric patients.
  Our framework achieves a 42% reduction in mean absolute error relative to standard masked autoencoders and outperforms PhysFormer by 31%, reaching a final MAE of 3.2 bpm. Without explicit region-of-interest extraction, the model consistently attends to pulse-rich areas and demonstrates robustness under clinical occlusions and noise.

TL;DR: The paper identifies issues with neuromorphic datasets, highlights deficiencies in size, standardization, and accessibility, and recommends leveraging simulated and meta-datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for better quality, standardized, and easily accessible neuromorphic datasets to enhance research and mitigate the inefficiencies of current practices.

Method: A review of over 423 neuromorphic datasets, analyzing their tasks, structure, challenges, and trends such as synthetic data and meta-datasets.

Result: The study identifies key difficulties with dataset size, standardization, access, and the growing dependency on synthetic data while introducing meta-datasets as a potential solution.

Conclusion: To improve neuromorphic research, better dataset standardization, accessibility, and exploitation of meta-datasets are crucial to minimizing biases and optimizing performance.

Abstract: Neuromorphic engineering has a data problem. Despite the meteoric rise in the number of neuromorphic datasets published over the past ten years, the conclusion of a significant portion of neuromorphic research papers still states that there is a need for yet more data and even larger datasets. Whilst this need is driven in part by the sheer volume of data required by modern deep learning approaches, it is also fuelled by the current state of the available neuromorphic datasets and the difficulties in finding them, understanding their purpose, and determining the nature of their underlying task. This is further compounded by practical difficulties in downloading and using these datasets. This review starts by capturing a snapshot of the existing neuromorphic datasets, covering over 423 datasets, and then explores the nature of their tasks and the underlying structure of the presented data. Analysing these datasets shows the difficulties arising from their size, the lack of standardisation, and difficulties in accessing the actual data. This paper also highlights the growth in the size of individual datasets and the complexities involved in working with the data. However, a more important concern is the rise of synthetic datasets, created by either simulation or video-to-events methods. This review explores the benefits of simulated data for testing existing algorithms and applications, highlighting the potential pitfalls for exploring new applications of neuromorphic technologies. This review also introduces the concepts of meta-datasets, created from existing datasets, as a way of both reducing the need for more data, and to remove potential bias arising from defining both the dataset and the task.

TL;DR: This paper introduces SAM 3D Body (3DB), a promptable model for 3D human mesh recovery from a single image that achieves state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The research aims to overcome the limitations of existing 3D human mesh recovery methods by creating a model that generalizes across diverse conditions while maintaining consistent accuracy.

Method: The proposed model, 3DB, uses an encoder-decoder architecture and incorporates the Momentum Human Rig (MHR) for representing human meshes. It employs auxiliary prompts for guided inference and utilizes a multi-stage annotation pipeline for data preparation.

Result: 3DB achieves superior generalization and performance, presenting improvements in both qualitative user preferences and quantitative metrics, backed by a high-quality evaluation dataset.

Conclusion: 3DB and MHR establish a new benchmark in full-body 3D human mesh recovery, offering robust generalization, improved accuracy, and accessibility through open-source availability.

Abstract: We introduce SAM 3D Body (3DB), a promptable model for single-image full-body 3D human mesh recovery (HMR) that demonstrates state-of-the-art performance, with strong generalization and consistent accuracy in diverse in-the-wild conditions. 3DB estimates the human pose of the body, feet, and hands. It is the first model to use a new parametric mesh representation, Momentum Human Rig (MHR), which decouples skeletal structure and surface shape. 3DB employs an encoder-decoder architecture and supports auxiliary prompts, including 2D keypoints and masks, enabling user-guided inference similar to the SAM family of models. We derive high-quality annotations from a multi-stage annotation pipeline that uses various combinations of manual keypoint annotation, differentiable optimization, multi-view geometry, and dense keypoint detection. Our data engine efficiently selects and processes data to ensure data diversity, collecting unusual poses and rare imaging conditions. We present a new evaluation dataset organized by pose and appearance categories, enabling nuanced analysis of model behavior. Our experiments demonstrate superior generalization and substantial improvements over prior methods in both qualitative user preference studies and traditional quantitative analysis. Both 3DB and MHR are open-source.

*Juampablo E. Heras Rivera,Dickson T. Chen,Tianyi Ren,Daniel K. Low,Asma Ben Abacha,Alberto Santamaria-Pang,Mehmet Kurt*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: BTReport presents an open-source brain tumor radiology report generation framework that separates imaging feature extraction and report composition, ensuring interpretability and reduced hallucination.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The lack of open paired image-report datasets has hindered progress in developing radiology report generation techniques for neuro-oncology compared to other areas.

Method: BTReport leverages deterministic imaging feature extraction for analysis and employs large language models (LLMs) for structuring and formatting reports. It distinctly splits the tasks of analysis and narrative generation.

Result: Reports generated by BTReport align more closely with clinical reference reports. The extracted features predict clinical outcomes like survival and IDH mutation status.

Conclusion: BTReport enhances interpretability and accuracy in radiology report generation by separating feature extraction from language modeling, enabling progress in neuro-oncology and dataset augmentation (BTReport-BraTS).

Abstract: Recent advances in radiology report generation (RRG) have been driven by large paired image-text datasets; however, progress in neuro-oncology has been limited due to a lack of open paired image-report datasets. Here, we introduce BTReport, an open-source framework for brain tumor RRG that constructs natural language radiology reports using deterministically extracted imaging features. Unlike existing approaches that rely on large general-purpose or fine-tuned vision-language models for both image interpretation and report composition, BTReport performs deterministic feature extraction for image analysis and uses large language models only for syntactic structuring and narrative formatting. By separating RRG into a deterministic feature extraction step and a report generation step, the generated reports are completely interpretable and less prone to hallucinations. We show that the features used for report generation are predictive of key clinical outcomes, including survival and IDH mutation status, and reports generated by BTReport are more closely aligned with reference clinical reports than existing baselines for RRG. Finally, we introduce BTReport-BraTS, a companion dataset that augments BraTS imaging with synthetically generated radiology reports produced with BTReport.

*Ahmad Elallaf,Yu Zhang,Yuktha Priya Masupalli,Jeong Yang,Young Lee,Zechun Cao,Gongbo Liang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces MedProbCLIP, a probabilistic vision-language learning framework designed for better representation learning and retrieval in chest X-ray and radiology reports. It improves accuracy, calibration, and reliability while enhancing safety for medical decision-making.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Foundation models like CLIP and CXR-CLIP face challenges in reliability, particularly in critical biomedical settings. This work seeks to address the lack of trustworthiness and uncertainty modeling required for applications like radiology.

Method: MedProbCLIP introduces probabilistic modeling with Gaussian embeddings and a contrastive learning objective. It combines multi-view encoding for radiographs and multi-section encoding for reports. To reduce overconfidence, a variational information bottleneck is employed.

Result: MedProbCLIP outperforms deterministic and probabilistic baselines in retrieval and zero-shot classification tasks on MIMIC-CXR. It also demonstrates superior calibration, risk coverage, selective retrieval reliability, and robustness against clinical corruptions.

Conclusion: The probabilistic approach in MedProbCLIP significantly improves the trustworthiness of vision-language models, making them more suitable for high-stakes biomedical tasks like radiology applications.

Abstract: Vision-language foundation models have emerged as powerful general-purpose representation learners with strong potential for multimodal understanding, but their deterministic embeddings often fail to provide the reliability required for high-stakes biomedical applications. This work introduces MedProbCLIP, a probabilistic vision-language learning framework for chest X-ray and radiology report representation learning and bidirectional retrieval. MedProbCLIP models image and text representations as Gaussian embeddings through a probabilistic contrastive objective that explicitly captures uncertainty and many-to-many correspondences between radiographs and clinical narratives. A variational information bottleneck mitigates overconfident predictions, while MedProbCLIP employs multi-view radiograph encoding and multi-section report encoding during training to provide fine-grained supervision for clinically aligned correspondence, yet requires only a single radiograph and a single report at inference. Evaluated on the MIMIC-CXR dataset, MedProbCLIP outperforms deterministic and probabilistic baselines, including CLIP, CXR-CLIP, and PCME++, in both retrieval and zero-shot classification. Beyond accuracy, MedProbCLIP demonstrates superior calibration, risk-coverage behavior, selective retrieval reliability, and robustness to clinically relevant corruptions, underscoring the value of probabilistic vision-language modeling for improving the trustworthiness and safety of radiology image-text retrieval systems.

### [106] [LGQ: Learning Discretization Geometry for Scalable and Stable Image Tokenization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16086)
*Idil Bilge Altun,Mert Onur Cakiroglu,Elham Buxton,Mehmet Dalkilic,Hasan Kurban*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces Learnable Geometric Quantization (LGQ), a discrete image tokenizer that learns discretization geometry end-to-end to solve challenges in discrete image tokenization, such as code utilization imbalance and representation collapse.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Discrete image tokenization faces challenges like biased optimization, inefficient code utilization, and representation collapse in scalable visual generation models.

Method: The paper proposes LGQ, which uses temperature-controlled soft assignments for differentiable training and minimizes a variational free-energy objective. It includes peakedness and usage regularizers for balanced code utilization.

Result: LGQ demonstrates improved code utilization efficiency and visual generation fidelity on ImageNet compared with existing methods like FSQ and SimVQ, reducing active codes while maintaining comparable performance.

Conclusion: LGQ outperforms existing quantization methods in achieving balanced code utilization and stable optimization, and it achieves high efficiency and fidelity in visual generation.

Abstract: Discrete image tokenization is a key bottleneck for scalable visual generation: a tokenizer must remain compact for efficient latent-space priors while preserving semantic structure and using discrete capacity effectively. Existing quantizers face a trade-off: vector-quantized tokenizers learn flexible geometries but often suffer from biased straight-through optimization, codebook under-utilization, and representation collapse at large vocabularies. Structured scalar or implicit tokenizers ensure stable, near-complete utilization by design, yet rely on fixed discretization geometries that may allocate capacity inefficiently under heterogeneous latent statistics.
  We introduce Learnable Geometric Quantization (LGQ), a discrete image tokenizer that learns discretization geometry end-to-end. LGQ replaces hard nearest-neighbor lookup with temperature-controlled soft assignments, enabling fully differentiable training while recovering hard assignments at inference. The assignments correspond to posterior responsibilities of an isotropic Gaussian mixture and minimize a variational free-energy objective, provably converging to nearest-neighbor quantization in the low-temperature limit. LGQ combines a token-level peakedness regularizer with a global usage regularizer to encourage confident yet balanced code utilization without imposing rigid grids.
  Under a controlled VQGAN-style backbone on ImageNet across multiple vocabulary sizes, LGQ achieves stable optimization and balanced utilization. At 16K codebook size, LGQ improves rFID by 11.88% over FSQ while using 49.96% fewer active codes, and improves rFID by 6.06% over SimVQ with 49.45% lower effective representation rate, achieving comparable fidelity with substantially fewer active entries.

### [107] [OmniCT: Towards a Unified Slice-Volume LVLM for Comprehensive CT Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16110)
*Tianwei Lin,Zhongwei Qiu,Wenqiao Zhang,Jiang Liu,Yihan Xie,Mingjian Gao,Zhenxuan Fan,Zhaocheng Li,Sijing Li,Zhongle Xie,Peng LU,Yueting Zhuang,Yingda Xia,Ling Zhang,Beng Chin Ooi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: OmniCT is a unified Large Vision-Language Model that bridges slice and volume understanding in CT scans, enhancing both fine details and spatial reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a need to overcome the limitation of fragmented understanding in existing LVLMs for CT imaging, where slice-based models lack spatial consistency and volumetric models lack granularity.

Method: OmniCT introduces three key components: Spatial Consistency Enhancement for volumetric adaptation, Organ-level Semantic Enhancement for anatomical alignment, and MedEval-CT, a large CT dataset with comprehensive metrics.

Result: OmniCT achieves superior performance across diverse CT clinical tasks, excelling in both detail sensitivity and spatial reasoning.

Conclusion: The work establishes a novel unified approach for slice-volume understanding in medical imaging, offering a new standard for clinical applications.

Abstract: Computed Tomography (CT) is one of the most widely used and diagnostically information-dense imaging modalities, covering critical organs such as the heart, lungs, liver, and colon. Clinical interpretation relies on both slice-driven local features (e.g., sub-centimeter nodules, lesion boundaries) and volume-driven spatial representations (e.g., tumor infiltration, inter-organ anatomical relations). However, existing Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) remain fragmented in CT slice versus volumetric understanding: slice-driven LVLMs show strong generalization but lack cross-slice spatial consistency, while volume-driven LVLMs explicitly capture volumetric semantics but suffer from coarse granularity and poor compatibility with slice inputs. The absence of a unified modeling paradigm constitutes a major bottleneck for the clinical translation of medical LVLMs. We present OmniCT, a powerful unified slice-volume LVLM for CT scenarios, which makes three contributions: (i) Spatial Consistency Enhancement (SCE): volumetric slice composition combined with tri-axial positional embedding that introduces volumetric consistency, and an MoE hybrid projection enables efficient slice-volume adaptation; (ii) Organ-level Semantic Enhancement (OSE): segmentation and ROI localization explicitly align anatomical regions, emphasizing lesion- and organ-level semantics; (iii) MedEval-CT: the largest slice-volume CT dataset and hybrid benchmark integrates comprehensive metrics for unified evaluation. OmniCT consistently outperforms existing methods with a substantial margin across diverse clinical tasks and satisfies both micro-level detail sensitivity and macro-level spatial reasoning. More importantly, it establishes a new paradigm for cross-modal medical imaging understanding.

*Joel Mathew Cherian,Ashutosh Muralidhara Bharadwaj,Vima Gupta,Anand Padmanabha Iyer*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces CHAI, a text-to-video diffusion method that improves inference speed through cross-inference caching and an effective cache attention mechanism.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the slow sequential denoising process in text-to-video diffusion models, while maintaining high video quality.

Method: The proposed solution uses Cache Attention, a mechanism for selectively attending to shared objects/scenes across latents, enabling reuse of cached latents for semantically related prompts.

Result: CHAI achieves high-quality video generation with as few as 8 denoising steps and is 1.65x-3.35x faster than the OpenSora 1.2 baseline while preserving quality.

Conclusion: CHAI significantly reduces latency in text-to-video diffusion models by leveraging cross-inference caching and Cache Attention, balancing speed and video quality.

Abstract: Text-to-video diffusion models deliver impressive results but remain slow because of the sequential denoising of 3D latents. Existing approaches to speed up inference either require expensive model retraining or use heuristic-based step skipping, which struggles to maintain video quality as the number of denoising steps decreases. Our work, CHAI, aims to use cross-inference caching to reduce latency while maintaining video quality. We introduce Cache Attention as an effective method for attending to shared objects/scenes across cross-inference latents. This selective attention mechanism enables effective reuse of cached latents across semantically related prompts, yielding high cache hit rates. We show that it is possible to generate high-quality videos using Cache Attention with as few as 8 denoising steps. When integrated into the overall system, CHAI is 1.65x - 3.35x faster than baseline OpenSora 1.2 while maintaining video quality.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a training-free approach (IRIS) using real-time eye-tracking data to improve accuracy in ambiguous VQA tasks significantly.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to tackle the challenge of resolving ambiguity in open-ended visual question answering (VQA) tasks by leveraging real-time human gaze data.

Method: The researchers utilized eye-tracking data in real-time and analyzed user fixations to enhance disambiguation in large vision-language models (VLMs) without additional training.

Result: The proposed IRIS approach doubled ambiguously-answered question accuracy from 35.2% to 77.2%, while keeping results consistent for unambiguous queries. Improvements were observed across different state-of-the-art VLMs.

Conclusion: Real-time eye-tracking data can be effectively used to significantly improve performance on ambiguous VQA, setting the stage for new benchmarks and interactive protocols for further development.

Abstract: We introduce IRIS (Intent Resolution via Inference-time Saccades), a novel training-free approach that uses eye-tracking data in real-time to resolve ambiguity in open-ended VQA. Through a comprehensive user study with 500 unique image-question pairs, we demonstrate that fixations closest to the time participants start verbally asking their questions are the most informative for disambiguation in Large VLMs, more than doubling the accuracy of responses on ambiguous questions (from 35.2% to 77.2%) while maintaining performance on unambiguous queries. We evaluate our approach across state-of-the-art VLMs, showing consistent improvements when gaze data is incorporated in ambiguous image-question pairs, regardless of architectural differences. We release a new benchmark dataset to use eye movement data for disambiguated VQA, a novel real-time interactive protocol, and an evaluation suite.

*Huichan Seo,Minki Hong,Sieun Choi,Jihie Kim,Jean Oh*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper addresses demographic biases in instruction-guided image-to-image (I2I) editing systems, highlighting identity-related failures during edits based on race, gender, and age.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding and mitigating demographic-conditioned failures in I2I editing systems to ensure fairness and robustness across diverse populations.

Method: The study formalized two failure modes (Soft Erasure and Stereotype Replacement) and introduced a benchmark evaluating demographic-conditioned I2I behaviors using controlled prompts, vision-language model scoring, and human evaluations.

Result: The analysis revealed pervasive, demographically uneven failures in identity preservation, influenced by implicit societal biases. Introducing prompt-level identity constraints reduced demographic changes for minorities while maintaining majority-group stability.

Conclusion: Identity preservation bias is a core issue in I2I systems, necessitating the design of demographic-robust editing mechanisms to address these disparities.

Abstract: Demographic bias in text-to-image (T2I) generation is well studied, yet demographic-conditioned failures in instruction-guided image-to-image (I2I) editing remain underexplored. We examine whether identical edit instructions yield systematically different outcomes across subject demographics in open-weight I2I editors. We formalize two failure modes: Soft Erasure, where edits are silently weakened or ignored in the output image, and Stereotype Replacement, where edits introduce unrequested, stereotype-consistent attributes. We introduce a controlled benchmark that probes demographic-conditioned behavior by generating and editing portraits conditioned on race, gender, and age using a diagnostic prompt set, and evaluate multiple editors with vision-language model (VLM) scoring and human evaluation. Our analysis shows that identity preservation failures are pervasive, demographically uneven, and shaped by implicit social priors, including occupation-driven gender inference. Finally, we demonstrate that a prompt-level identity constraint, without model updates, can substantially reduce demographic change for minority groups while leaving majority-group portraits largely unchanged, revealing asymmetric identity priors in current editors. Together, our findings establish identity preservation as a central and demographically uneven failure mode in I2I editing and motivate demographic-robust editing systems.

*Patrick Poggi,Divake Kumar,Theja Tulabandhula,Amit Ranjan Trivedi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Introduces UncL-STARK, a framework for dynamic depth adaptation in single-object transformers, ensuring efficient inference in video tracking.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer-based trackers face inefficiency due to fixed-depth inference in videos with temporally coherent frames.

Method: A fine-tuned design enabling uncertainty-aware depth adaptation using random-depth training, knowledge distillation, and lightweight uncertainty estimates.

Result: Significant reduction in computational cost—up to 12% GFLOPs reduction, 8.9% latency reduction, and 10.8% energy savings—without compromising accuracy.

Conclusion: UncL-STARK demonstrates robust adaptability and efficiency, validating its effectiveness in maintaining high accuracy while reducing resource usage.

Abstract: Transformer-based single-object trackers achieve state-of-the-art accuracy but rely on fixed-depth inference, executing the full encoder--decoder stack for every frame regardless of visual complexity, thereby incurring unnecessary computational cost in long video sequences dominated by temporally coherent frames. We propose UncL-STARK, an architecture-preserving approach that enables dynamic, uncertainty-aware depth adaptation in transformer-based trackers without modifying the underlying network or adding auxiliary heads. The model is fine-tuned to retain predictive robustness at multiple intermediate depths using random-depth training with knowledge distillation, thus enabling safe inference-time truncation. At runtime, we derive a lightweight uncertainty estimate directly from the model's corner localization heatmaps and use it in a feedback-driven policy that selects the encoder and decoder depth for the next frame based on the prediction confidence by exploiting temporal coherence in video. Extensive experiments on GOT-10k and LaSOT demonstrate up to 12\% GFLOPs reduction, 8.9\% latency reduction, and 10.8\% energy savings while maintaining tracking accuracy within 0.2\% of the full-depth baseline across both short-term and long-term sequences.

*Hiroki Nakamura,Hiroto Iino,Masashi Okada,Tadahiro Taniguchi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces EasyControlEdge, an edge-specialized adaptation of image-generation foundation models for crisp and data-efficient edge detection in real-world scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aimed to address challenges in achieving crisp edge detection with limited training samples, especially in complex real-world applications like floor-plans, satellite imagery, and medical imaging.

Method: They adapted image-generation foundation models by introducing edge-specific objectives using an efficient pixel-space loss and conditional guidance based on dynamics to control edge density during inference.

Result: Experiments conducted on datasets like BSDS500, NYUDv2, BIPED, and CubiCasa showed consistent performance improvements compared to state-of-the-art methods, particularly in crispness evaluation without post-processing and in scenarios with limited training data.

Conclusion: EasyControlEdge enables crisp and data-efficient edge detection by leveraging pre-trained priors and iterative refinement from foundation models, showing its potential in various real-world applications.

Abstract: We propose EasyControlEdge, adapting an image-generation foundation model to edge detection. In real-world edge detection (e.g., floor-plan walls, satellite roads/buildings, and medical organ boundaries), crispness and data efficiency are crucial, yet producing crisp raw edge maps with limited training samples remains challenging. Although image-generation foundation models perform well on many downstream tasks, their pretrained priors for data-efficient transfer and iterative refinement for high-frequency detail preservation remain underexploited for edge detection. To enable crisp and data-efficient edge detection using these capabilities, we introduce an edge-specialized adaptation of image-generation foundation models. To better specialize the foundation model for edge detection, we incorporate an edge-oriented objective with an efficient pixel-space loss. At inference, we introduce guidance based on unconditional dynamics, enabling a single model to control the edge density through a guidance scale. Experiments on BSDS500, NYUDv2, BIPED, and CubiCasa compare against state-of-the-art methods and show consistent gains, particularly under no-post-processing crispness evaluation and with limited training data.

*J. Dhar,M. K. Pandey,D. Chakladar,M. Haghighat,A. Alavi,S. Mistry,N. Zaidi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces HyPCA-Net, a novel multimodal medical imaging framework that enhances performance and reduces computational costs in multi-disease analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current multimodal medical imaging methods are computationally expensive, prone to information loss, and struggle to generalize effectively for multi-disease analysis.

Method: HyPCA-Net is proposed with two novel blocks: (1) a residual adaptive learning attention block for modality-specific representation refinement and (2) a dual-view cascaded attention block for robust shared representation across modalities.

Result: Extensive experiments across ten datasets demonstrate that HyPCA-Net achieves up to 5.2% performance improvement and 73.1% reduction in computational cost compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: HyPCA-Net offers a resource-efficient and accurate solution for multimodal medical imaging, particularly beneficial in low-resource environments and multi-disease tasks.

Abstract: Multimodal fusion frameworks, which integrate diverse medical imaging modalities (e.g., MRI, CT), have shown great potential in applications such as skin cancer detection, dementia diagnosis, and brain tumor prediction. However, existing multimodal fusion methods face significant challenges. First, they often rely on computationally expensive models, limiting their applicability in low-resource environments. Second, they often employ cascaded attention modules, which potentially increase risk of information loss during inter-module transitions and hinder their capacity to effectively capture robust shared representations across modalities. This restricts their generalization in multi-disease analysis tasks. To address these limitations, we propose a Hybrid Parallel-Fusion Cascaded Attention Network (HyPCA-Net), composed of two core novel blocks: (a) a computationally efficient residual adaptive learning attention block for capturing refined modality-specific representations, and (b) a dual-view cascaded attention block aimed at learning robust shared representations across diverse modalities. Extensive experiments on ten publicly available datasets exhibit that HyPCA-Net significantly outperforms existing leading methods, with improvements of up to 5.2% in performance and reductions of up to 73.1% in computational cost.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AFFMAE is a hierarchical pretraining framework that improves high-resolution computer vision tasks, cutting computation costs and memory requirements significantly while maintaining comparable performance to ViT-MAE.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the computational challenges of high-resolution self-supervised pretraining, especially for research labs without access to large-scale infrastructure.

Method: Introduced AFFMAE, which uses adaptive, off-grid token merging to handle visible tokens dynamically and implemented efficient cluster attention kernels and deep supervision to improve training stability and performance.

Result: AFFMAE achieves equal performance to ViT-MAE on high-resolution electron microscopy segmentation, while reducing computation costs by up to 7-fold, memory usage by half, and accelerating training on a single RTX 5090.

Conclusion: AFFMAE effectively demonstrates the potential for efficient high-resolution pretraining frameworks, making foundational model training accessible to smaller research entities without compromising on performance.

Abstract: Self-supervised pretraining has transformed computer vision by enabling data-efficient fine-tuning, yet high-resolution training typically requires server-scale infrastructure, limiting in-domain foundation model development for many research laboratories. Masked Autoencoders (MAE) reduce computation by encoding only visible tokens, but combining MAE with hierarchical downsampling architectures remains structurally challenging due to dense grid priors and mask-aware design compromises. We introduce AFFMAE, a masking-friendly hierarchical pretraining framework built on adaptive, off-grid token merging. By discarding masked tokens and performing dynamic merging exclusively over visible tokens, AFFMAE removes dense-grid assumptions while preserving hierarchical scalability. We developed numerically stable mixed-precision Flash-style cluster attention kernels, and mitigate sparse-stage representation collapse via deep supervision. On high-resolution electron microscopy segmentation, AFFMAE matches ViT-MAE performance at equal parameter count while reducing FLOPs by up to 7x, halving memory usage, and achieving faster training on a single RTX 5090.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve the efficiency and accuracy of eyeframe lens tracing by eliminating reliance on traditional mechanical tools that require precise calibration and additional equipment.

Method: Developed an artificial vision-based approach using multi-view information, including image acquisition, eyeframe segmentation, depth estimation, and multi-view processing with RGB and depth data.

Result: The proposed algorithm achieves competitive measurements using still RGB images, without the need for specialized tracing tools, simplifying workflows.

Conclusion: This solution improves precision and reduces workflow complexity in eyeframe lens tracing by leveraging artificial vision and eliminating mechanical calibration dependencies.

Abstract: Eyeframe lens tracing is an important process in the optical industry that requires sub-millimeter precision to ensure proper lens fitting and optimal vision correction. Traditional frame tracers rely on mechanical tools that need precise positioning and calibration, which are time-consuming and require additional equipment, creating an inefficient workflow for opticians. This work presents a novel approach based on artificial vision that utilizes multi-view information. The proposed algorithm operates on images captured from an InVision system. The full pipeline includes image acquisition, frame segmentation to isolate the eyeframe from background, depth estimation to obtain 3D spatial information, and multi-view processing that integrates segmented RGB images with depth data for precise frame contour measurement. To this end, different configurations and variants are proposed and analyzed on real data, providing competitive measurements from still color images with respect to other solutions, while eliminating the need for specialized tracing equipment and reducing workflow complexity for optical technicians.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the challenge of limited labeled data for training AI models, which is resource-intensive and costly, especially for tasks like object detection.

Method: The researchers developed a self-supervised learning strategy where an AI model is trained on unlabeled data. This approach allows models to focus on relevant object features and improve feature extraction.

Result: The proposed model outperformed state-of-the-art feature extractors pre-trained on ImageNet for object detection, showcasing improved feature representations and robustness.

Conclusion: Enhancing feature extractors through self-supervised learning can significantly reduce the dependence on labeled data, improving model performance and efficiency for complex AI tasks like object detection.

Abstract: In the fast-evolving field of artificial intelligence, where models are increasingly growing in complexity and size, the availability of labeled data for training deep learning models has become a significant challenge. Addressing complex problems like object detection demands considerable time and resources for data labeling to achieve meaningful results. For companies developing such applications, this entails extensive investment in highly skilled personnel or costly outsourcing. This research work aims to demonstrate that enhancing feature extractors can substantially alleviate this challenge, enabling models to learn more effective representations with less labeled data. Utilizing a self-supervised learning strategy, we present a model trained on unlabeled data that outperforms state-of-the-art feature extractors pre-trained on ImageNet and particularly designed for object detection tasks. Moreover, the results demonstrate that our approach encourages the model to focus on the most relevant aspects of an object, thus achieving better feature representations and, therefore, reinforcing its reliability and robustness.

### [119] [SCAR: Satellite Imagery-Based Calibration for Aerial Recordings](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16349)
*Henry Hölzemann,Michael Schleiss*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SCAR is a method for refining the calibration of aerial visual-inertial systems over time by using georeferenced satellite data, improving long-term accuracy without manual intervention.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current approaches for calibrating aerial visual-inertial systems often degrade under long-term deployment and require dedicated maneuvers or manual input. SCAR addresses this by utilizing external geospatial data to improve calibration robustness.

Method: SCAR aligns aerial images with 2D-3D correspondences derived from orthophotos and elevation models to refine both intrinsic and extrinsic calibration parameters.

Result: SCAR significantly outperforms existing baselines like Kalibr and VINS-Mono in reducing reprojection errors and improving localization accuracy across diverse aerial campaigns.

Conclusion: SCAR enables accurate and reproducible auto-calibration for aerial systems over long-term operations, eliminating the need for manual calibration efforts.

Abstract: We introduce SCAR, a method for long-term auto-calibration refinement of aerial visual-inertial systems that exploits georeferenced satellite imagery as a persistent global reference. SCAR estimates both intrinsic and extrinsic parameters by aligning aerial images with 2D--3D correspondences derived from publicly available orthophotos and elevation models. In contrast to existing approaches that rely on dedicated calibration maneuvers or manually surveyed ground control points, our method leverages external geospatial data to detect and correct calibration degradation under field deployment conditions. We evaluate our approach on six large-scale aerial campaigns conducted over two years under diverse seasonal and environmental conditions. Across all sequences, SCAR consistently outperforms established baselines (Kalibr, COLMAP, VINS-Mono), reducing median reprojection error by a large margin, and translating these calibration gains into substantially lower visual localization rotation errors and higher pose accuracy. These results demonstrate that SCAR provides accurate, robust, and reproducible calibration over long-term aerial operations without the need for manual intervention.

*Qi He,XiangXiang Wang,Jingtao Zhang,Yongbin Yu,Hongxiang Chu,Manping Fan,JingYe Cai,Zhenglin Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces an Adaptive Multi-scale Attention Aggregation (AMAA) framework that enhances monocular 3D Semantic Scene Completion (SSC) for assistive systems targeting visually impaired users.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve structural and semantic stability in monocular SSC for visually impaired users, addressing challenges like unreliable voxel features and cross-scale information propagation.

Method: The AMAA framework integrates channel-spatial attention aggregation and hierarchical adaptive feature-gating to regulate feature reliability in monocular SSC.

Result: AMAA outperforms MonoScene with better SSC mIoU (27.25%) and SC IoU (43.10%) on the NYUv2 benchmark, while maintaining low system complexity and enabling hardware deployment.

Conclusion: AMAA enhances the reliability and deployability of monocular SSC, making it suitable for indoor assistive systems designed for visually impaired users.

Abstract: In indoor assistive perception for visually impaired users, 3D Semantic Scene Completion (SSC) is expected to provide structurally coherent and semantically consistent occupancy under strictly monocular vision for safety-critical scene understanding. However, existing monocular SSC approaches often lack explicit modeling of voxel-feature reliability and regulated cross-scale information propagation during 2D-3D projection and multi-scale fusion, making them vulnerable to projection diffusion and feature entanglement and thus limiting structural stability.To address these challenges, this paper presents an Adaptive Multi-scale Attention Aggregation (AMAA) framework built upon the MonoScene pipeline. Rather than introducing a heavier backbone, AMAA focuses on reliability-oriented feature regulation within a monocular SSC framework. Specifically, lifted voxel features are jointly calibrated in semantic and spatial dimensions through parallel channel-spatial attention aggregation, while multi-scale encoder-decoder fusion is stabilized via a hierarchical adaptive feature-gating strategy that regulates information injection across scales.Experiments on the NYUv2 benchmark demonstrate consistent improvements over MonoScene without significantly increasing system complexity: AMAA achieves 27.25% SSC mIoU (+0.31) and 43.10% SC IoU (+0.59). In addition, system-level deployment on an NVIDIA Jetson platform verifies that the complete AMAA framework can be executed stably on embedded hardware. Overall, AMAA improves monocular SSC quality and provides a reliable and deployable perception framework for indoor assistive systems targeting visually impaired users.

### [121] [ReMoRa: Multimodal Large Language Model based on Refined Motion Representation for Long-Video Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16412)
*Daichi Yashima,Shuhei Kurita,Yusuke Oda,Komei Sugiura*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces ReMoRa, a video understanding model for MLLMs that addresses computational challenges by using compressed video representations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current multimodal large language models struggle with long-form video understanding due to computational inefficiency and redundancy in processing high-volume video data.

Method: ReMoRa processes videos using sparse keyframes for appearance and compact motion representations for temporal dynamics, skipping full RGB frame sequences. It introduces a denoising module and achieves linear scalability with sequence length.

Result: Extensive experiments show ReMoRa surpasses existing methods in benchmarks like LongVideoBench, NExT-QA, and MLVU.

Conclusion: ReMoRa addresses video understanding challenges efficiently with compressed data representations and demonstrates superior performance on long-video benchmarks.

Abstract: While multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have shown remarkable success across a wide range of tasks, long-form video understanding remains a significant challenge. In this study, we focus on video understanding by MLLMs. This task is challenging because processing a full stream of RGB frames is computationally intractable and highly redundant, as self-attention have quadratic complexity with sequence length. In this paper, we propose ReMoRa, a video MLLM that processes videos by operating directly on their compressed representations. A sparse set of RGB keyframes is retained for appearance, while temporal dynamics are encoded as a motion representation, removing the need for sequential RGB frames. These motion representations act as a compact proxy for optical flow, capturing temporal dynamics without full frame decoding. To refine the noise and low fidelity of block-based motions, we introduce a module to denoise and generate a fine-grained motion representation. Furthermore, our model compresses these features in a way that scales linearly with sequence length. We demonstrate the effectiveness of ReMoRa through extensive experiments across a comprehensive suite of long-video understanding benchmarks. ReMoRa outperformed baseline methods on multiple challenging benchmarks, including LongVideoBench, NExT-QA, and MLVU.

*Ali Faraz,Raja Kolla,Ashish Kulkarni,Shubham Agarwal*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper evaluates two training strategies for multilingual OCR using vision-language models, achieving notable speedups and strong performance on Indic OCR benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in developing efficient, accurate OCR systems that handle India's linguistic and document diversity while being suitable for real-world deployment.

Method: The first method uses a multimodal approach with a vision encoder and a multilingual language model trained end-to-end. The second method fine-tunes an existing OCR model. Extensive evaluation metrics compare these strategies.

Result: The second method delivers superior accuracy-latency trade-offs. Chitrapathak-2 achieves 3-6x speedup over its predecessor and SOTA performance in Telugu OCR. Parichay, designed for government documents, achieves 89.8% Exact Match with faster inference.

Conclusion: These systems provide state-of-the-art Indic OCR capabilities and insights for building scalable, high-performing OCR pipelines for diverse Indian linguistic and document needs.

Abstract: Designing Optical Character Recognition (OCR) systems for India requires balancing linguistic diversity, document heterogeneity, and deployment constraints. In this paper, we study two training strategies for building multilingual OCR systems with Vision-Language Models through the Chitrapathak series. We first follow a popular multimodal approach, pairing a generic vision encoder with a strong multilingual language model and training the system end-to-end for OCR. Alternatively, we explore fine-tuning an existing OCR model, despite not being trained for the target languages. Through extensive evaluation on multilingual Indic OCR benchmarks and deployment-oriented metrics, we find that the second strategy consistently achieves better accuracy-latency trade-offs. Chitrapathak-2 achieves 3-6x speedup over its predecessor with being state-of-the-art (SOTA) in Telugu (6.69 char ANLS) and second best in the rest. In addition, we present Parichay, an independent OCR model series designed specifically for 9 Indian government documents to extract structured key fields, achieving 89.8% Exact Match score with a faster inference. Together, these systems achieve SOTA performance and provide practical guidance for building production-scale OCR pipelines in the Indian context.

### [123] [Visual Self-Refine: A Pixel-Guided Paradigm for Accurate Chart Parsing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16455)
*Jinsong Li,Xiaoyi Dong,Yuhang Zang,Yuhang Cao,Jiaqi Wang,Dahua Lin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper presents a novel approach, Visual Self-Refine (VSR), for tackling visual perception challenges in Chart Parsing by utilizing iterative visual feedback.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the shortcomings of existing Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) in visual perception tasks like Chart Parsing, especially their struggles with visually dense charts and errors such as data omission, misalignment, and hallucination.

Method: The paper introduces the Visual Self-Refine (VSR) paradigm, where models generate and inspect pixel-level visualizations of their outputs iteratively to ensure accuracy and correct errors. It is instantiated in Chart Parsing through a model named ChartVSR, which uses a two-stage process: a Refine Stage for pixel-level accuracy and a Decode Stage for structured data parsing.

Result: ChartVSR was evaluated using a newly proposed benchmark, ChartP-Bench, and demonstrates improved accuracy and reliability in parsing complex charts compared to traditional methods.

Conclusion: The VSR paradigm introduces a new visual feedback approach to enhance model accuracy, positioning it as a general-purpose solution for a variety of vision-centric tasks.

Abstract: While Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities for reasoning and self-correction at the textual level, these strengths provide minimal benefits for complex tasks centered on visual perception, such as Chart Parsing. Existing models often struggle with visually dense charts, leading to errors like data omission, misalignment, and hallucination. Inspired by the human strategy of using a finger as a ``visual anchor'' to ensure accuracy when reading complex charts, we propose a new paradigm named Visual Self-Refine (VSR). The core idea of VSR is to enable a model to generate pixel-level localization outputs, visualize them, and then feed these visualizations back to itself, allowing it to intuitively inspect and correct its own potential visual perception errors. We instantiate the VSR paradigm in the domain of Chart Parsing by proposing ChartVSR. This model decomposes the parsing process into two stages: a Refine Stage, where it iteratively uses visual feedback to ensure the accuracy of all data points' Pixel-level Localizations, and a Decode Stage, where it uses these verified localizations as precise visual anchors to parse the final structured data. To address the limitations of existing benchmarks, we also construct ChartP-Bench, a new and highly challenging benchmark for chart parsing. Our work also highlights VSR as a general-purpose visual feedback mechanism, offering a promising new direction for enhancing accuracy on a wide range of vision-centric tasks.

### [124] [MMA: Multimodal Memory Agent](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16493)
*Yihao Lu,Wanru Cheng,Zeyu Zhang,Hao Tang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper presents the Multimodal Memory Agent (MMA), which improves long-horizon multimodal agents by addressing memory retrieval issues through dynamic reliability scoring and evidence reweighting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges in multimodal agents relying on retrieved memory, which often suffers from low credibility, stale, or conflicting information, leading to overconfident errors.

Method: MMA combines source credibility, temporal decay, and conflict-aware network consensus to dynamically assign reliability scores to retrieved memory, allowing for more accurate evidence weighting and the ability to abstain when confidence is low.

Result: MMA demonstrated significant improvements on the FEVER, LoCoMo, and MMA-Bench benchmarks, such as reducing variance by 35.2%, improving safety-oriented and selective utility, and handling visual biases effectively.

Conclusion: MMA is a reliable and robust solution for long-horizon multimodal agents, tackling memory-related issues while improving accuracy, utility, and safety. The introduction of MMA-Bench also proves effective for evaluating belief dynamics in such systems.

Abstract: Long-horizon multimodal agents depend on external memory; however, similarity-based retrieval often surfaces stale, low-credibility, or conflicting items, which can trigger overconfident errors. We propose Multimodal Memory Agent (MMA), which assigns each retrieved memory item a dynamic reliability score by combining source credibility, temporal decay, and conflict-aware network consensus, and uses this signal to reweight evidence and abstain when support is insufficient. We also introduce MMA-Bench, a programmatically generated benchmark for belief dynamics with controlled speaker reliability and structured text-vision contradictions. Using this framework, we uncover the "Visual Placebo Effect", revealing how RAG-based agents inherit latent visual biases from foundation models. On FEVER, MMA matches baseline accuracy while reducing variance by 35.2% and improving selective utility; on LoCoMo, a safety-oriented configuration improves actionable accuracy and reduces wrong answers; on MMA-Bench, MMA reaches 41.18% Type-B accuracy in Vision mode, while the baseline collapses to 0.0% under the same protocol.

### [125] [Benchmarking Adversarial Robustness and Adversarial Training Strategies for Object Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16494)
*Alexis Winter,Jean-Vincent Martini,Romaric Audigier,Angelique Loesch,Bertrand Luvison*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper addresses the security risks of object detection models attacked by adversarial methods and introduces a unified benchmark framework to evaluate attacks and defenses effectively.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to fill the gap in standardized evaluation methods for attacks and defenses on object detection models, as existing approaches use inconsistent datasets and metrics.

Method: The authors propose a unified benchmark framework with specific metrics for evaluating attacks' impact on localization and classification errors, and conduct experiments on diverse attacks/detectors.

Result: Modern attacks lack transferability to transformer-based architectures, and the most robust defense strategy combines high-perturbation attacks with mixed objectives during training.

Conclusion: Creating standardized benchmarks and diversified adversarial training enhances the robustness of object detection models against adversarial attacks, improving transferability and defense strategies.

Abstract: Object detection models are critical components of automated systems, such as autonomous vehicles and perception-based robots, but their sensitivity to adversarial attacks poses a serious security risk. Progress in defending these models lags behind classification, hindered by a lack of standardized evaluation. It is nearly impossible to thoroughly compare attack or defense methods, as existing work uses different datasets, inconsistent efficiency metrics, and varied measures of perturbation cost. This paper addresses this gap by investigating three key questions: (1) How can we create a fair benchmark to impartially compare attacks? (2) How well do modern attacks transfer across different architectures, especially from Convolutional Neural Networks to Vision Transformers? (3) What is the most effective adversarial training strategy for robust defense? To answer these, we first propose a unified benchmark framework focused on digital, non-patch-based attacks. This framework introduces specific metrics to disentangle localization and classification errors and evaluates attack cost using multiple perceptual metrics. Using this benchmark, we conduct extensive experiments on state-of-the-art attacks and a wide range of detectors. Our findings reveal two major conclusions: first, modern adversarial attacks against object detection models show a significant lack of transferability to transformer-based architectures. Second, we demonstrate that the most robust adversarial training strategy leverages a dataset composed of a mix of high-perturbation attacks with different objectives (e.g., spatial and semantic), which outperforms training on any single attack.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces DressWild, a feed-forward pipeline that generates physics-consistent sewing patterns and 3D garments from a single image.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current garment pattern generation struggles with diverse poses and is either computationally expensive or lacks scalability. There is a demand for editable, separable, and simulation-ready garments.

Method: DressWild uses vision-language models to normalize input poses, extracts pose-aware garment features, and employs a transformer-based encoder to predict sewing pattern parameters suitable for simulation and virtual applications.

Result: DressWild efficiently reconstructs diverse sewing patterns and 3D garments from single images without multi-view inputs or iterative processes.

Conclusion: DressWild provides a scalable, efficient solution for realistic garment simulation and animation, fulfilling the need for editable and simulation-ready garments.

Abstract: Recent advances in garment pattern generation have shown promising progress. However, existing feed-forward methods struggle with diverse poses and viewpoints, while optimization-based approaches are computationally expensive and difficult to scale. This paper focuses on sewing pattern generation for garment modeling and fabrication applications that demand editable, separable, and simulation-ready garments. We propose DressWild, a novel feed-forward pipeline that reconstructs physics-consistent 2D sewing patterns and the corresponding 3D garments from a single in-the-wild image. Given an input image, our method leverages vision-language models (VLMs) to normalize pose variations at the image level, then extract pose-aware, 3D-informed garment features. These features are fused through a transformer-based encoder and subsequently used to predict sewing pattern parameters, which can be directly applied to physical simulation, texture synthesis, and multi-layer virtual try-on. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach robustly recovers diverse sewing patterns and the corresponding 3D garments from in-the-wild images without requiring multi-view inputs or iterative optimization, offering an efficient and scalable solution for realistic garment simulation and animation.

*Kaiting Liu,Hazel Doughty*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper presents a method to refine coarse video classifier categories into finer subcategories using zero-shot and low-shot techniques without additional data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To deal with limitations of fixed taxonomies in video recognition models that collapse distinctions and struggle to accommodate evolving category definitions.

Method: Introduces category splitting as a new task and proposes a zero-shot editing method leveraging latent compositional structures, supplemented by low-shot fine-tuning.

Result: Experiments show the proposed method improves accuracy on newly split categories while preserving overall model performance, outperforming vision-language baselines.

Conclusion: The method is effective in refining coarse categories, avoiding the expense of new annotations or retraining models, and ensures accuracy retention on existing categories.

Abstract: Video recognition models are typically trained on fixed taxonomies which are often too coarse, collapsing distinctions in object, manner or outcome under a single label. As tasks and definitions evolve, such models cannot accommodate emerging distinctions and collecting new annotations and retraining to accommodate such changes is costly. To address these challenges, we introduce category splitting, a new task where an existing classifier is edited to refine a coarse category into finer subcategories, while preserving accuracy elsewhere. We propose a zero-shot editing method that leverages the latent compositional structure of video classifiers to expose fine-grained distinctions without additional data. We further show that low-shot fine-tuning, while simple, is highly effective and benefits from our zero-shot initialization. Experiments on our new video benchmarks for category splitting demonstrate that our method substantially outperforms vision-language baselines, improving accuracy on the newly split categories without sacrificing performance on the rest.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel deep learning-based face morphing technique for attacking face recognition systems, demonstrating strong effectiveness compared to existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address vulnerabilities in face recognition systems caused by unsupervised passport photo enrollment processes, which allow morphing attacks to exploit these weaknesses.

Method: Utilized Arc2Face, an identity-conditioned face foundation model, to create photorealistic morphed faces and tested them against state-of-the-art techniques using metrics on novel and established datasets.

Result: The proposed method performed comparably to landmark-based techniques in morphing attack potential and showcased its ability to preserve and manipulate identity information effectively.

Conclusion: The deep learning-based approach provides a viable, challenging alternative in morphing attacks, emphasizing its potential to highlight vulnerabilities in current face recognition systems.

Abstract: Face morphing attacks are widely recognized as one of the most challenging threats to face recognition systems used in electronic identity documents. These attacks exploit a critical vulnerability in passport enrollment procedures adopted by many countries, where the facial image is often acquired without a supervised live capture process. In this paper, we propose a novel face morphing technique based on Arc2Face, an identity-conditioned face foundation model capable of synthesizing photorealistic facial images from compact identity representations. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach by comparing the morphing attack potential metric on two large-scale sequestered face morphing attack detection datasets against several state-of-the-art morphing methods, as well as on two novel morphed face datasets derived from FEI and ONOT. Experimental results show that the proposed deep learning-based approach achieves a morphing attack potential comparable to that of landmark-based techniques, which have traditionally been regarded as the most challenging. These findings confirm the ability of the proposed method to effectively preserve and manage identity information during the morph generation process.

TL;DR: This paper proposes CLIP-MHAdapter, a method to better adapt pre-trained vision-language models for fine-grained street-view image attribute classification, achieving improved accuracy with low computational cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Street-view attribute classification is computationally challenging but crucial for applications like autonomous driving and urban analytics. Existing methods do not effectively capture localized image details in complex street scenes.

Method: The authors introduce CLIP-MHAdapter, which appends an MLP with multi-head self-attention to CLIP for modeling inter-patch dependencies, focusing on localized features in images.

Result: CLIP-MHAdapter, with just 1.4 million trainable parameters, achieves state-of-the-art or competitive results across eight tasks on the Global StreetScapes dataset, demonstrating high accuracy and efficiency.

Conclusion: CLIP-MHAdapter effectively improves street-view attribute classification tasks, leveraging lightweight adaptation methods to advance performance without computational complexities.

Abstract: Street-view image attribute classification is a vital downstream task of image classification, enabling applications such as autonomous driving, urban analytics, and high-definition map construction. It remains computationally demanding whether training from scratch, initialising from pre-trained weights, or fine-tuning large models. Although pre-trained vision-language models such as CLIP offer rich image representations, existing adaptation or fine-tuning methods often rely on their global image embeddings, limiting their ability to capture fine-grained, localised attributes essential in complex, cluttered street scenes. To address this, we propose CLIP-MHAdapter, a variant of the current lightweight CLIP adaptation paradigm that appends a bottleneck MLP equipped with multi-head self-attention operating on patch tokens to model inter-patch dependencies. With approximately 1.4 million trainable parameters, CLIP-MHAdapter achieves superior or competitive accuracy across eight attribute classification tasks on the Global StreetScapes dataset, attaining new state-of-the-art results while maintaining low computational cost.

*Jiaming Liu,Felix Petersen,Yunhe Gao,Yabin Zhang,Hyojin Kim,Akshay S. Chaudhari,Yu Sun,Stefano Ermon,Sergios Gatidis*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a new framework, Self-Supervised Semantic Bridge (SSB), which enhances image translation by integrating semantic priors into diffusion models without requiring cross-domain supervision.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for unpaired image-to-image translation face challenges: adversarial techniques struggle with unseen data, and diffusion-inversion approaches often yield low-quality outputs. The authors aim to address these shortcomings by leveraging semantic representations.

Method: SSB utilizes self-supervised visual encoders to learn representations invariant to appearance but sensitive to geometric structure. These learned latent spaces condition the diffusion bridge models for accurate spatially faithful image translation.

Result: Experimental results demonstrate that SSB outperforms prior approaches in medical image synthesis across both in-domain and out-of-domain tasks. Additionally, it proves effective in high-quality text-guided image editing.

Conclusion: SSB provides a robust and adaptable framework for unpaired image translation, showing superior results in diverse tasks and demonstrating its potential for generalization and innovation in the field.

Abstract: Adversarial diffusion and diffusion-inversion methods have advanced unpaired image-to-image translation, but each faces key limitations. Adversarial approaches require target-domain adversarial loss during training, which can limit generalization to unseen data, while diffusion-inversion methods often produce low-fidelity translations due to imperfect inversion into noise-latent representations. In this work, we propose the Self-Supervised Semantic Bridge (SSB), a versatile framework that integrates external semantic priors into diffusion bridge models to enable spatially faithful translation without cross-domain supervision. Our key idea is to leverage self-supervised visual encoders to learn representations that are invariant to appearance changes but capture geometric structure, forming a shared latent space that conditions the diffusion bridges. Extensive experiments show that SSB outperforms strong prior methods for challenging medical image synthesis in both in-domain and out-of-domain settings, and extends easily to high-quality text-guided editing.

*Bo Lang,Nirav Savaliya,Zhihao Zheng,Jinglun Feng,Zheng-Hang Yeh,Mooi Choo Chuah*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel framework is introduced for consistent online HD map construction that emphasizes improved temporal consistency and stability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing HD mapping methods face challenges such as temporal inconsistencies and instabilities during the construction process.

Method: The framework includes (1) a Semantic-Aware Query Generator for global context, (2) a History Rasterized Map Memory for storing detailed instance maps, (3) a History-Map Guidance Module for enhancing temporal continuity, and (4) a Short-Term Future Guidance module for temporal consistency through motion prediction.

Result: Experimental results on nuScenes and Argoverse2 datasets show superior performance and efficiency of the proposed method compared to SOTA methods.

Conclusion: This proposed framework improves the stability and temporal consistency in HD map construction, making it highly effective for autonomous driving.

Abstract: High-definition (HD) maps are crucial to autonomous driving, providing structured representations of road elements to support navigation and planning. However, existing query-based methods often employ random query initialization and depend on implicit temporal modeling, which lead to temporal inconsistencies and instabilities during the construction of a global map. To overcome these challenges, we introduce a novel end-to-end framework for consistent online HD vectorized map construction, which jointly performs map instance tracking and short-term prediction. First, we propose a Semantic-Aware Query Generator that initializes queries with spatially aligned semantic masks to capture scene-level context globally. Next, we design a History Rasterized Map Memory to store fine-grained instance-level maps for each tracked instance, enabling explicit historical priors. A History-Map Guidance Module then integrates rasterized map information into track queries, improving temporal continuity. Finally, we propose a Short-Term Future Guidance module to forecast the immediate motion of map instances based on the stored history trajectories. These predicted future locations serve as hints for tracked instances to further avoid implausible predictions and keep temporal consistency. Extensive experiments on the nuScenes and Argoverse2 datasets demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods with good efficiency.

*Yingyuan Yang,Tian Lan,Yifei Gao,Yimeng Lu,Wenjun He,Meng Wang,Chenghao Liu,Chen Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces VETime, a framework combining temporal and visual modalities for time-series anomaly detection, overcoming limitations of existing models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the trade-off between fine-grained anomaly localization in temporal models and the global context understanding in vision-based models.

Method: VETime employs Reversible Image Conversion, Patch-Level Temporal Alignment, Anomaly Window Contrastive Learning, and Multi-Modal Fusion for effective anomaly detection.

Result: VETime outperforms state-of-the-art models in zero-shot scenarios with higher precision and lower computational costs.

Conclusion: VETime effectively bridges temporal and visual modalities, providing advanced anomaly detection capabilities while efficiently using computational resources.

Abstract: Time-series anomaly detection (TSAD) requires identifying both immediate Point Anomalies and long-range Context Anomalies. However, existing foundation models face a fundamental trade-off: 1D temporal models provide fine-grained pointwise localization but lack a global contextual perspective, while 2D vision-based models capture global patterns but suffer from information bottlenecks due to a lack of temporal alignment and coarse-grained pointwise detection. To resolve this dilemma, we propose VETime, the first TSAD framework that unifies temporal and visual modalities through fine-grained visual-temporal alignment and dynamic fusion. VETime introduces a Reversible Image Conversion and a Patch-Level Temporal Alignment module to establish a shared visual-temporal timeline, preserving discriminative details while maintaining temporal sensitivity. Furthermore, we design an Anomaly Window Contrastive Learning mechanism and a Task-Adaptive Multi-Modal Fusion to adaptively integrate the complementary perceptual strengths of both modalities.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces SAW-Bench, a benchmark emphasizing egocentric situated awareness in videos using smart glasses, highlighting challenges in observer-centric reasoning for multimodal foundation models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of benchmarks for evaluating MFMs on observer-centric relationships, which are crucial for egocentric situational reasoning, compared to the existing emphasis on environment-centric spatial relations.

Method: The authors created SAW-Bench, consisting of 786 self-recorded real-world videos and 2,071 human-annotated questions, focusing on six specific awareness tasks to evaluate spatial observer-centric understanding.

Result: The evaluation revealed a 37.66% performance gap between humans and the best-performing model (Gemini 3 Flash), identifying systematic errors in models' reasoning of camera geometry and spatial dynamics.

Conclusion: SAW-Bench offers a framework for advancing research in egocentric spatial intelligence, emphasizing situated awareness beyond passive observation and recognizing key deficiencies in current model reasoning approaches.

Abstract: A core aspect of human perception is situated awareness, the ability to relate ourselves to the surrounding physical environment and reason over possible actions in context. However, most existing benchmarks for multimodal foundation models (MFMs) emphasize environment-centric spatial relations (relations among objects in a scene), while largely overlooking observer-centric relationships that require reasoning relative to agent's viewpoint, pose, and motion. To bridge this gap, we introduce SAW-Bench (Situated Awareness in the Real World), a novel benchmark for evaluating egocentric situated awareness using real-world videos. SAW-Bench comprises 786 self-recorded videos captured with Ray-Ban Meta (Gen 2) smart glasses spanning diverse indoor and outdoor environments, and over 2,071 human-annotated question-answer pairs. It probes a model's observer-centric understanding with six different awareness tasks. Our comprehensive evaluation reveals a human-model performance gap of 37.66%, even with the best-performing MFM, Gemini 3 Flash. Beyond this gap, our in-depth analysis uncovers several notable findings; for example, while models can exploit partial geometric cues in egocentric videos, they often fail to infer a coherent camera geometry, leading to systematic spatial reasoning errors. We position SAW-Bench as a benchmark for situated spatial intelligence, moving beyond passive observation to understanding physically grounded, observer-centric dynamics.

### [134] [Are Object-Centric Representations Better At Compositional Generalization?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16689)
*Ferdinand Kapl,Amir Mohammad Karimi Mamaghan,Maximilian Seitzer,Karl Henrik Johansson,Carsten Marr,Stefan Bauer,Andrea Dittadi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper explores the effectiveness of object-centric (OC) representations for compositional generalization in visually rich settings using a visual question answering benchmark across three datasets, comparing OC and dense representations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Compositional generalization is a key feature of human cognition but remains a challenge in machine learning. The study aims to evaluate whether object-centric representations can address this issue in visually complex scenarios.

Method: The authors introduced a Visual Question Answering benchmark across three visual worlds (CLEVRTex, Super-CLEVR, MOVi-C) and compared vision encoders DINOv2 and SigLIP2 with and without object-centric biases under controlled conditions.

Result: OC representations outperformed dense ones in harder compositional generalization tasks and were more sample-efficient, while dense representations only rivaled or surpassed OC under sufficient data and computational resources.

Conclusion: Object-centric representations demonstrate stronger compositional generalization, especially when training data, dataset diversity, or computational resources are limited.

Abstract: Compositional generalization, the ability to reason about novel combinations of familiar concepts, is fundamental to human cognition and a critical challenge for machine learning. Object-centric (OC) representations, which encode a scene as a set of objects, are often argued to support such generalization, but systematic evidence in visually rich settings is limited. We introduce a Visual Question Answering benchmark across three controlled visual worlds (CLEVRTex, Super-CLEVR, and MOVi-C) to measure how well vision encoders, with and without object-centric biases, generalize to unseen combinations of object properties. To ensure a fair and comprehensive comparison, we carefully account for training data diversity, sample size, representation size, downstream model capacity, and compute. We use DINOv2 and SigLIP2, two widely used vision encoders, as the foundation models and their OC counterparts. Our key findings reveal that (1) OC approaches are superior in harder compositional generalization settings; (2) original dense representations surpass OC only on easier settings and typically require substantially more downstream compute; and (3) OC models are more sample efficient, achieving stronger generalization with fewer images, whereas dense encoders catch up or surpass them only with sufficient data and diversity. Overall, object-centric representations offer stronger compositional generalization when any one of dataset size, training data diversity, or downstream compute is constrained.

### [135] [Saliency-Aware Multi-Route Thinking: Revisiting Vision-Language Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16702)
*Mingjia Shi,Yinhan He,Yaochen Zhu,Jundong Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes a new method called the Saliency-Aware Principle (SAP) to improve reasoning in vision-language models (VLMs) by enabling better visual grounding and reducing hallucination.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to improve the reasoning in VLMs, overcoming challenges in maintaining visual grounding throughout text generation and addressing difficulties caused by noisy grounding inferences.

Method: The authors introduce SAP, a strategy based on high-level reasoning principles that encourages stable control during noisy feedback, supports revisiting visual evidence when needed, and enables parallel exploration of reasoning paths without requiring additional model training.

Result: SAP shows competitive performance, particularly in reducing object hallucination, and achieves stable reasoning and lower response latency compared to sequential reasoning styles under similar computational budgets.

Conclusion: SAP offers a promising approach for more robust and effective vision-language reasoning without additional training, enhancing VLM robustness and efficiency.

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) aim to reason by jointly leveraging visual and textual modalities. While allocating additional inference-time computation has proven effective for large language models (LLMs), achieving similar scaling in VLMs remains challenging. A key obstacle is that visual inputs are typically provided only once at the start of generation, while textual reasoning (e.g., early visual summaries) is generated autoregressively, causing reasoning to become increasingly text-dominated and allowing early visual grounding errors to accumulate. Moreover, vanilla guidance for visual grounding during inference is often coarse and noisy, making it difficult to steer reasoning over long texts. To address these challenges, we propose \emph{Saliency-Aware Principle} (SAP) selection. SAP operates on high-level reasoning principles rather than token-level trajectories, which enable stable control over discrete generation under noisy feedback while allowing later reasoning steps to re-consult visual evidence when renewed grounding is required. In addition, SAP supports multi-route inference, enabling parallel exploration of diverse reasoning behaviors. SAP is model-agnostic and data-free, requiring no additional training. Empirical results show that SAP achieves competitive performance, especially in reducing object hallucination, under comparable token-generation budgets while yielding more stable reasoning and lower response latency than CoT-style long sequential reasoning.

### [136] [TeCoNeRV: Leveraging Temporal Coherence for Compressible Neural Representations for Videos](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16711)
*Namitha Padmanabhan,Matthew Gwilliam,Abhinav Shrivastava*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces TeCoNeRV, a novel approach to improve implicit neural representation (INR)-based video compression, tackling challenges in memory efficiency, scalability, and compression quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the inefficiencies and scalability issues of INR-based video compression techniques, particularly the challenges of encoding high-resolution videos efficiently and effectively.

Method: The method includes three key innovations: (1) spatial and temporal decomposition of weight prediction into patch tubelets, reducing memory requirements during pretraining; (2) a residual-based storage scheme that minimizes bitstream size by storing differences between representations of video segments; and (3) temporal coherence regularization to align changes in weight space with video content changes.

Result: TeCoNeRV achieves significant performance improvements, with gains of 2.47 dB and 5.35 dB PSNR over baseline methods at 480p and 720p resolutions, along with 36% reduced bitrates and encoding speeds 1.5-3x faster. It is the first hypernetwork to produce efficient results at 1080p resolution.

Conclusion: TeCoNeRV successfully overcomes the limitations of previous INR-based video compression methods, significantly improving quality, reducing memory usage and bitrates, and enabling scalability to higher resolutions.

Abstract: Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) have recently demonstrated impressive performance for video compression. However, since a separate INR must be overfit for each video, scaling to high-resolution videos while maintaining encoding efficiency remains a significant challenge. Hypernetwork-based approaches predict INR weights (hyponetworks) for unseen videos at high speeds, but with low quality, large compressed size, and prohibitive memory needs at higher resolutions. We address these fundamental limitations through three key contributions: (1) an approach that decomposes the weight prediction task spatially and temporally, by breaking short video segments into patch tubelets, to reduce the pretraining memory overhead by 20$\times$; (2) a residual-based storage scheme that captures only differences between consecutive segment representations, significantly reducing bitstream size; and (3) a temporal coherence regularization framework that encourages changes in the weight space to be correlated with video content. Our proposed method, TeCoNeRV, achieves substantial improvements of 2.47dB and 5.35dB PSNR over the baseline at 480p and 720p on UVG, with 36% lower bitrates and 1.5-3$\times$ faster encoding speeds. With our low memory usage, we are the first hypernetwork approach to demonstrate results at 480p, 720p and 1080p on UVG, HEVC and MCL-JCV.

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: OpenMP's non-determinism complicates debugging; this paper proposes scalable record-and-replay techniques for OpenMP using Distributed Clock and Distributed Epoch schemes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Debugging and testing OpenMP programs is challenging due to non-deterministic behavior, necessitating scalable record-and-replay solutions.

Method: Developed techniques leveraging Distributed Clock (DC) and Distributed Epoch (DE) schemes, integrated into the ReOMP tool, and combined with MPI replay tools like ReMPI.

Result: Proposed method is 2-5x more efficient than traditional synchronization-based methods and successfully integrates with MPI-level replay tools with minimal overhead.

Conclusion: The proposed approach efficiently addresses OpenMP record-and-replay challenges and offers compatibility with hybrid MPI+OpenMP applications.

Abstract: After all these years and all these other shared memory programming frameworks, OpenMP is still the most popular one. However, its greater levels of non-deterministic execution makes debugging and testing more challenging. The ability to record and deterministically replay the program execution is key to address this challenge. However, scalably replaying OpenMP programs is still an unresolved problem. In this paper, we propose two novel techniques that use Distributed Clock (DC) and Distributed Epoch (DE) recording schemes to eliminate excessive thread synchronization for OpenMP record and replay. Our evaluation on representative HPC applications with ReOMP, which we used to realize DC and DE recording, shows that our approach is 2-5x more efficient than traditional approaches that synchronize on every shared-memory access. Furthermore, we demonstrate that our approach can be easily combined with MPI-level replay tools to replay non-trivial MPI+OpenMP applications. We achieve this by integrating \toolname into ReMPI, an existing scalable MPI record-and-replay tool, with only a small MPI-scale-independent runtime overhead.

*Xin Huang,Weiping Zhang,Shiman Meng,Wubiao Xu,Xiang Fu,Luanzheng Guo,Kento Sato*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: The paper introduces a method to improve checkpoint/restart efficiency by identifying and excluding unused data in HPC applications through automatic differentiation, achieving up to 20% storage savings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Checkpoint/Restart consumes significant system resources in HPC applications, and not all data is relevant to computation, highlighting the need for an efficient mechanism to exclude non-critical data.

Method: The proposed method uses automatic differentiation to examine individual elements of variables, identifying critical/uncritical data for checkpointing. This ensures only data impacting application output is saved.

Result: The approach successfully visualized critical/uncritical regions within variables and was validated on eight NAS Parallel Benchmark applications, achieving up to 20% reduction in checkpoint storage.

Conclusion: Using automatic differentiation for selective checkpointing is effective in reducing storage requirements without impacting computation, aligning with the computational logic of HPC applications.

Abstract: Checkpoint/Restart (C/R) saves the running state of the programs periodically, which consumes considerable system resources. We observe that not every piece of data is involved in the computation in typical HPC applications; such unused data should be excluded from checkpointing for better storage/compute efficiency. To find out, we propose a systematic approach that leverages automatic differentiation (AD) to scrutinize every element within variables (e.g., arrays) for checkpointing allowing us to identify critical/uncritical elements and eliminate uncritical elements from checkpointing. Specifically, we inspect every single element within a variable for checkpointing with an AD tool to determine whether the element has an impact on the application output or not. We empirically validate our approach with eight benchmarks from the NAS Parallel Benchmark (NPB) suite. We successfully visualize critical/uncritical elements/regions within a variable with respect to its impact (yes or no) on the application output. We find patterns/distributions of critical/uncritical elements/regions quite interesting and follow the physical formulation/logic of the algorithm.The evaluation on NPB benchmarks shows that our approach saves storage for checkpointing by up to 20%.

TL;DR: This paper introduces a dynamic pipeline reconfiguration method to optimize resource utilization and adapt to changing workloads in serverless environments for large language model (LLM) inference on heterogeneous GPU clusters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the challenges of serving LLM inference efficiently under constrained GPU resources in heterogeneous and dynamic serverless computing environments.

Method: The proposed method utilizes dynamic pipeline reconfiguration to adjust deployment settings online, minimizing downtime and performance degradation despite LLM inference's stateful nature and the large size of model parameters.

Result: Experiments show that the method offers under 50 ms of service downtime and less than 10% overhead on time-to-first-token (TTFT) and time-per-output-token (TPOT) on NVIDIA A100 and L40 GPUs.

Conclusion: Dynamic pipeline reconfiguration effectively adapts to serverless workloads in heterogeneous GPU environments, enhancing flexibility while maintaining low service disruption and performance impact.

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs), efficiently serving LLM inference under limited GPU resources has become a critical challenge. Recently, an increasing number of studies have explored applying serverless computing paradigms to LLM serving in order to maximize resource utilization. However, LLM inference workloads are highly diverse, and modern GPU clusters are inherently heterogeneous, making it necessary to dynamically adjust deployment configurations online to better adapt to the elastic and dynamic nature of serverless environments. At the same time, enabling such online reconfiguration is particularly challenging due to the stateful nature of LLM inference and the massive size of model parameters. In this paper, we propose a dynamic pipeline reconfiguration approach that enables online adjustment of pipeline configurations while minimizing service downtime and performance degradation. Our method allows the system to select the optimal pipeline configuration in response to changing workloads. Experimental results on heterogeneous GPU platforms, including NVIDIA A100 and L40s, demonstrate that our migration mechanism incurs less than 50 ms of service downtime, while introducing under 10% overhead on both time-to-first-token (TTFT) and time-per-output-token (TPOT).

*Joel Rybicki,Jakob Solnerzik,Robin Vacus*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: The paper examines space-time complexities of population protocols in sparse graphs, especially bounded-degree trees, showing that unlike dense graphs, these sparse graphs have minimal space-time trade-offs for leader election and exact majority.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore whether sparse graph families, such as bounded-degree trees, exhibit space-time trade-offs in population protocols akin to dense graphs like complete interaction graphs.

Method: Developed two self-stabilising protocols: a fast 2-hop coloring protocol using stochastic drift arguments, and a tree orientation algorithm to build rooted trees efficiently. The protocols leverage directed tree designs for computational problems.

Result: Constant-space protocols with near-optimal stabilisation times for leader election and exact majority were developed, enabling linear speed-ups compared to previous approaches.

Conclusion: Bounded-degree trees show negligible space-time trade-offs for these problems, highlighting their computational efficiency compared to dense graphs.

Abstract: We investigate space-time trade-offs for population protocols in sparse interaction graphs. In complete interaction graphs, optimal space-time trade-offs are known for the leader election and exact majority problems. However, it has remained open if other graph families exhibit similar space-time complexity trade-offs, as existing lower bound techniques do not extend beyond highly dense graphs.
  In this work, we show that -- unlike in complete graphs -- population protocols on bounded-degree trees do not exhibit significant asymptotic space-time trade-offs for leader election and exact majority. For these problems, we give constant-space protocols that have near-optimal worst-case expected stabilisation time. These new protocols achieve a linear speed-up compared to the state-of-the-art.
  Our results are based on two novel protocols, which we believe are of independent interest. First, we give a new fast self-stabilising 2-hop colouring protocol for general interaction graphs, whose stabilisation time we bound using a stochastic drift argument. Second, we give a self-stabilising tree orientation algorithm that builds a rooted tree in optimal time on any tree. As a consequence, we can use simple constant-state protocols designed for directed trees to solve leader election and exact majority fast. For example, we show that ``directed'' annihilation dynamics solve exact majority in $O(n^2 \log n)$ steps on directed trees.

*Prabhjot Singh,Adel N. Toosi,Rajkumar Buyya*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: The paper examines the overhead of circuit cutting in quantum machine learning pipelines, proposing a cut-aware execution pipeline and analyzing its efficiency and scalability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a lack of systems-level analysis on the end-to-end impact of circuit cutting on iterative, estimator-driven training pipelines in quantum workloads.

Method: The authors propose and evaluate a staged, cut-aware estimator execution pipeline using binary classification workloads like Iris and MNIST, analyzing runtime interactions and performance outcomes.

Result: The findings reveal that circuit cutting introduces significant overheads, particularly in classical reconstruction phases, which limits speed-up potential under increased parallelism. However, test accuracy and robustness are largely preserved.

Conclusion: Efficient scaling of circuit cutting for quantum machine learning requires improved reconstruction techniques and scheduling policies that better handle critical path dependencies.

Abstract: Circuit cutting decomposes a large quantum circuit into a collection of smaller subcircuits. The outputs of these subcircuits are then classically reconstructed to recover the original expectation values. While prior work characterises cutting overhead largely in terms of subcircuit counts and sampling complexity, its end-to-end impact on iterative, estimator-driven training pipelines remains insufficiently measured from a systems perspective. In this paper, we propose a cut-aware estimator execution pipeline that treats circuit cutting as a staged distributed workload and instruments each estimator query into partitioning, subexperiment generation, parallel execution, and classical reconstruction phases. Using logged runtime traces and learning outcomes on two binary classification workloads (Iris and MNIST), we quantify cutting overheads, scaling limits, and sensitivity to injected stragglers, and we evaluate whether accuracy and robustness are preserved under matched training budgets. Our measurements show that cutting introduces substantial end-to-end overheads that grow with the number of cuts, and that reconstruction constitutes a dominant fraction of per-query time, bounding achievable speed-up under increased parallelism. Despite these systems costs, test accuracy and robustness are preserved in the measured regimes, with configuration-dependent improvements observed in some cut settings. These results indicate that practical scaling of circuit cutting for learning workloads hinges on reducing and overlapping reconstruction and on scheduling policies that account for barrier-dominated critical paths.

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: This paper introduces push0, a cloud-native proof orchestration system for real-time management and efficient task distribution in zero-knowledge proof generation for blockchain systems, such as ZK-rollups and Ethereum's L1 zkEVM.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address the stringent timing and reliability constraints faced by blockchain systems employing zero-knowledge proofs, due to proof delays causing finality lag, economic loss, and inefficiency.

Method: The paper proposes push0, which uses an event-driven dispatcher-collector architecture with priority queues to enforce sequential proving while utilizing parallelism. Controlled and production experiments validate its efficiency.

Result: Push0 achieves minimal orchestration overhead (less than 0.1%) and high scaling efficiency in real-world and controlled experiments, as demonstrated on Zircuit zkrollup's integration with 14+ million mainnet blocks.

Conclusion: Push0 supports integration of different zkVMs, ensures fault-tolerant task recovery, and provides scalable proof orchestration suitable for centralized rollup operators and decentralized networks.

Abstract: Zero-knowledge proof generation imposes stringent timing and reliability constraints on blockchain systems. For ZK-rollups, delayed proofs cause finality lag and economic loss; for Ethereum's emerging L1 zkEVM, proofs must complete within the 12-second slot window to enable stateless validation. The Ethereum Foundation's Ethproofs initiative coordinates multiple independent zkVMs across proving clusters to achieve real-time block proving, yet no principled orchestration framework addresses the joint challenges of (i) strict head-of-chain ordering, (ii) sub-slot latency bounds, (iii) fault-tolerant task reassignment, and (iv) prover-agnostic workflow composition. We present push0, a cloud-native proof orchestration system that decouples prover binaries from scheduling infrastructure. push0 employs an event-driven dispatcher--collector architecture over persistent priority queues, enforcing block-sequential proving while exploiting intra-block parallelism. We formalize requirements drawn from production ZK-rollup operations and the Ethereum real-time proving specification, then demonstrate via production Kubernetes cluster experiments that push0 achieves 5 ms median orchestration overhead with 99--100% scaling efficiency at 32 dispatchers for realistic workloads--overhead negligible (less than 0.1%) relative to typical proof computation times of 7+ seconds. Controlled Docker experiments validate these results, showing comparable performance (3--10 ms P50) when network variance is eliminated. Production deployment on the Zircuit zkrollup (14+ million mainnet blocks since March 2025) provides ecological validity for these controlled experiments. Our design enables seamless integration of heterogeneous zkVMs, supports automatic task recovery via message persistence, and provides the scheduling primitives necessary for both centralized rollup operators and decentralized multi-prover networks.

TL;DR: The paper addresses parallel meshless methods using a modified Poisson disc sampling algorithm, ensuring efficient work distribution and reducing thread locking challenges through a spatial indexing and hypertree approach.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The aim is to efficiently generate nodes for meshless methods, which are critical for adaptive numerical analysis and handling complex geometries, while leveraging parallel computing for improved performance.

Method: The authors modify an n-dimensional Poisson disc sampling algorithm for parallel execution, using spatial indexing with work distribution hypertrees. These hypertrees are prebuilt to balance workload and prevent data locking during modifications.

Result: The proposed algorithm significantly reduces mutex acquisitions for collision checks and ensures efficient thread operations while advancing node fronts. It demonstrates superior performance compared to existing parallelisation techniques.

Conclusion: The developed algorithm improves parallelism in meshless methods, minimizes thread collision handling issues, and has potential for further adaptation to distributed systems.

Abstract: Meshless methods are used to solve partial differential equations by approximating differential operators at a node as a weighted sum of values at its neighbours. One of the algorithms for generating nodes suitable for meshless numerical analysis is an n-dimensional Poisson disc sampling based method. It can handle complex geometries and supports variable node density, a crucial feature for adaptive analysis. We modify this method for parallel execution using coupled spatial indexing and work distribution hypertrees. The latter is prebuilt according to the node density function, ensuring that each leaf represents a balanced work unit. Threads advance separate fronts and claim work hypertree leaves as needed while avoiding leaves neighbouring those claimed by other threads. Node placement constraints and the partially prebuilt spatial hypertree are combined to eliminate the need to lock the tree while it is being modified. Thread collision handling is managed by the work hypertree at the leaf level, drastically reducing the number of required mutex acquisitions for point insertion collision checks. We explore the behaviour of the proposed algorithm and compare the performance with existing attempts at parallelisation and consider the requirements for adapting the developed algorithm to distributed systems.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a framework to assess computational reliability in Extreme Edge Computing (XEC), where streaming workloads are distributed across consumer devices.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The research addresses the challenge of ensuring the reliability of distributed inference (DI) tasks in XEC environments, despite the unpredictable computational capacities of consumer devices.

Method: The authors develop an analytical framework for computational reliability, deriving expressions under Minimal Information (MI) and historical data conditions, and extending to multi-device setups. They validate the method with real-world experiments on object detection using YOLO11m.

Result: The framework provides closed-form reliability expressions and optimal workload allocation strategies, validated by experiments that display alignment of analytical and empirical results.

Conclusion: The framework effectively quantifies computational reliability, offering insights and tools for orchestrators to deploy and manage distributed streaming services in volatile edge environments.

Abstract: Extreme Edge Computing (XEC) distributes streaming workloads across consumer-owned devices, exploiting their proximity to users and ubiquitous availability. Many such workloads are AI-driven, requiring continuous neural network inference for tasks like object detection and video analytics. Distributed Inference (DI), which partitions model execution across multiple edge devices, enables these streaming services to meet strict throughput and latency requirements. Yet consumer devices exhibit volatile computational availability due to competing applications and unpredictable usage patterns. This volatility poses a fundamental challenge: how can we quantify the probability that a device, or ensemble of devices, will maintain the processing rate required by a streaming service? This paper presents an analytical framework for computational reliability in XEC, defined as the probability that instantaneous capacity meets demand at a specified Quality of Service (QoS) threshold. We derive closed-form reliability expressions under two information regimes: Minimal Information (MI), requiring only declared operational bounds, and historical data, which refines estimates via Maximum Likelihood Estimation from past observations. The framework extends to multi-device deployments, providing reliability expressions for series, parallel, and partitioned workload configurations. We derive optimal workload allocation rules and analytical bounds for device selection, equipping orchestrators with tractable tools to evaluate deployment feasibility and configure distributed streaming systems. We validate the framework using real-time object detection with YOLO11m model as a representative DI streaming workload; experiments on emulated XED environments demonstrate close agreement between analytical predictions, Monte Carlo sampling, and empirical measurements across diverse capacity and demand configurations.

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: FlowPrefill resolves prefill phase bottlenecks in serving systems for large language models, improving responsiveness and throughput.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large language models need systems that can handle concurrent requests with varying SLOs. HoL blocking delays high-priority requests in the prefill phase, causing TTFT violations.

Method: FlowPrefill introduces Operator-Level Preemption for fine-grained interruption and Event-Driven Scheduling for minimal control-plane overhead.

Result: FlowPrefill achieves up to 5.6× improvement in maximum goodput while meeting diverse SLOs in comparison to state-of-the-art systems.

Conclusion: The system effectively optimizes TTFT and throughput by decoupling preemption granularity from scheduling frequency using novel adaptive mechanisms.

Abstract: The growing demand for large language models (LLMs) requires serving systems to handle many concurrent requests with diverse service level objectives (SLOs). This exacerbates head-of-line (HoL) blocking during the compute-intensive prefill phase, where long-running requests monopolize resources and delay higher-priority ones, leading to widespread time-to-first-token (TTFT) SLO violations. While chunked prefill enables interruptibility, it introduces an inherent trade-off between responsiveness and throughput: reducing chunk size improves response latency but degrades computational efficiency, whereas increasing chunk size maximizes throughput but exacerbates blocking. This necessitates an adaptive preemption mechanism. However, dynamically balancing execution granularity against scheduling overheads remains a key challenge.
  In this paper, we propose FlowPrefill, a TTFT-goodput-optimized serving system that resolves this conflict by decoupling preemption granularity from scheduling frequency. To achieve adaptive prefill scheduling, FlowPrefill introduces two key innovations: 1) Operator-Level Preemption, which leverages operator boundaries to enable fine-grained execution interruption without the efficiency loss associated with fixed small chunking; and 2) Event-Driven Scheduling, which triggers scheduling decisions only upon request arrival or completion events, thereby supporting efficient preemption responsiveness while minimizing control-plane overhead. Evaluation on real-world production traces shows that FlowPrefill improves maximum goodput by up to 5.6$\times$ compared to state-of-the-art systems while satisfying heterogeneous SLOs.

TL;DR: A framework combining nonlinear dynamics, perceptual psychophysics, and high-frequency haptic rendering for more realistic surgical simulation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improve realism in surgical simulations by addressing challenges in handling nonlinear dynamics and creating perceptually accurate haptic feedback.

Method: Utilized Koopman operator theory for nonlinear dynamics control, Bayesian calibration for perceptual consistency, and statistical analyses for performance evaluation in simulated surgical tasks.

Result: Achieved 4.3 ms latency, <2.8% force error, 20% improvement in perceptual discrimination, and outperformed traditional rendering methods.

Conclusion: The framework significantly enhances surgical simulations and offers promising pathways for VR-based medical education and closed-loop neural feedback integration.

Abstract: We introduce a unified framework that combines nonlinear dynamics, perceptual psychophysics and high frequency haptic rendering to enhance realism in surgical simulation. The interaction of the surgical device with soft tissue is elevated to an augmented state space with a Koopman operator formulation, allowing linear prediction and control of the dynamics that are nonlinear by nature. To make the rendered forces consistent with human perceptual limits, we put forward a Bayesian calibration module based on WeberFechner and Stevens scaling laws, which progressively shape force signals relative to each individual's discrimination thresholds. For various simulated surgical tasks such as palpation, incision, and bone milling, the proposed system attains an average rendering latency of 4.3 ms, a force error of less than 2.8% and a 20% improvement in perceptual discrimination. Multivariate statistical analyses (MANOVA and regression) reveal that the system's performance is significantly better than that of conventional spring-damper and energy, based rendering methods. We end by discussing the potential impact on surgical training and VR, based medical education, as well as sketching future work toward closed, loop neural feedback in haptic interfaces.

### [147] [Memes-as-Replies: Can Models Select Humorous Manga Panel Responses?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15842)
*Ryosuke Kohita,Seiichiro Yoshioka*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces the Meme Reply Selection task and a manga-based benchmark dataset to study contextual humor in memes, revealing challenges for current models in handling complex social cues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the gap in understanding how memes are used dynamically and contextually for humor in web communication, which is an understudied area.

Method: The authors introduced the MaMe-Re benchmark, consisting of 100,000 human-annotated pairs, and evaluated the task using large language models (LLMs). They analyzed performance in capturing humor and contextual cues.

Result: Key findings include preliminary evidence of LLMs understanding complex social cues, no improvement from adding visual information, and struggles in distinguishing subtle differences in wit.

Conclusion: Current models face challenges in selecting contextually humorous meme replies, indicating an open research area.

Abstract: Memes are a popular element of modern web communication, used not only as static artifacts but also as interactive replies within conversations. While computational research has focused on analyzing the intrinsic properties of memes, the dynamic and contextual use of memes to create humor remains an understudied area of web science. To address this gap, we introduce the Meme Reply Selection task and present MaMe-Re (Manga Meme Reply Benchmark), a benchmark of 100,000 human-annotated pairs (500,000 total annotations from 2,325 unique annotators) consisting of openly licensed Japanese manga panels and social media posts. Our analysis reveals three key insights: (1) large language models (LLMs) show preliminary evidence of capturing complex social cues such as exaggeration, moving beyond surface-level semantic matching; (2) the inclusion of visual information does not improve performance, revealing a gap between understanding visual content and effectively using it for contextual humor; (3) while LLMs can match human judgments in controlled settings, they struggle to distinguish subtle differences in wit among semantically similar candidates. These findings suggest that selecting contextually humorous replies remains an open challenge for current models.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Epilepsy involves over 50 million cases globally, and one-third experience drug-resistant seizures requiring surgical intervention. To advance clinical workflows constrained by manual iEEG review, Omni-iEEG presents a harmonized pre-surgical dataset with 302 patients, 178 hours of recordings, and 36K annotations to support reproducible, scalable epilepsy research.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Epilepsy treatment is hindered by the challenges of drug resistance and insufficient tools for localizing the epileptogenic zone. Existing data-centric approaches are limited by inconsistent data formats, lack of standardized benchmarks, and insufficient annotations, preventing cross-validation and clinical utility.

Method: Omni-iEEG consolidates heterogeneous iEEG formats, metadata, and recordings from diverse sources, harmonizing clinical metadata such as seizure onset and surgical outcomes validated by certified epileptologists.

Result: Omni-iEEG offers 302 patient datasets, 178 hours of high-resolution iEEG recordings, 36K pathological annotations, and well-defined clinical tasks grounded in evaluation metrics. It supports benchmarking and demonstrates end-to-end modeling applications for long iEEG segments.

Conclusion: Omni-iEEG establishes a scalable, reproducible platform for epilepsy research with standardized benchmarks, clinically-prioritized evaluation, and data-driven insights that promote generalizable and clinically meaningful models.

Abstract: Epilepsy affects over 50 million people worldwide, and one-third of patients suffer drug-resistant seizures where surgery offers the best chance of seizure freedom. Accurate localization of the epileptogenic zone (EZ) relies on intracranial EEG (iEEG). Clinical workflows, however, remain constrained by labor-intensive manual review. At the same time, existing data-driven approaches are typically developed on single-center datasets that are inconsistent in format and metadata, lack standardized benchmarks, and rarely release pathological event annotations, creating barriers to reproducibility, cross-center validation, and clinical relevance. With extensive efforts to reconcile heterogeneous iEEG formats, metadata, and recordings across publicly available sources, we present $\textbf{Omni-iEEG}$, a large-scale, pre-surgical iEEG resource comprising $\textbf{302 patients}$ and $\textbf{178 hours}$ of high-resolution recordings. The dataset includes harmonized clinical metadata such as seizure onset zones, resections, and surgical outcomes, all validated by board-certified epileptologists. In addition, Omni-iEEG provides over 36K expert-validated annotations of pathological events, enabling robust biomarker studies. Omni-iEEG serves as a bridge between machine learning and epilepsy research. It defines clinically meaningful tasks with unified evaluation metrics grounded in clinical priors, enabling systematic evaluation of models in clinically relevant settings. Beyond benchmarking, we demonstrate the potential of end-to-end modeling on long iEEG segments and highlight the transferability of representations pretrained on non-neurophysiological domains. Together, these contributions establish Omni-iEEG as a foundation for reproducible, generalizable, and clinically translatable epilepsy research.

*Barak Or*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a framework to analyze and ensure runtime stability in hybrid reasoning systems under uncertainty, focusing on detectability, bounded divergence, and recoverability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the runtime behavior of hybrid reasoning systems under uncertainty and partial observability, where failures often occur gradually rather than as individual errors.

Method: A Kalman-inspired framework is utilized to model reasoning as a stochastic process, introducing the concept of cognitive drift and monitoring innovation statistics to predict and manage instability.

Result: The framework successfully detects instability before task failures and demonstrates recovery capabilities, ensuring the system retains bounded and reliable behavior.

Conclusion: Runtime stability is crucial for dependable reasoning under uncertainty, and their approach provides a mechanism for early instability detection and recovery in hybrid reasoning systems.

Abstract: Hybrid reasoning systems that combine learned components with model-based inference are increasingly deployed in tool-augmented decision loops, yet their runtime behavior under partial observability and sustained evidence mismatch remains poorly understood. In practice, failures often arise as gradual divergence of internal reasoning dynamics rather than as isolated prediction errors. This work studies runtime stability in hybrid reasoning systems from a Kalman-inspired perspective. We model reasoning as a stochastic inference process driven by an internal innovation signal and introduce cognitive drift as a measurable runtime phenomenon. Stability is defined in terms of detectability, bounded divergence, and recoverability rather than task-level correctness. We propose a runtime stability framework that monitors innovation statistics, detects emerging instability, and triggers recovery-aware control mechanisms. Experiments on multi-step, tool-augmented reasoning tasks demonstrate reliable instability detection prior to task failure and show that recovery, when feasible, re-establishes bounded internal behavior within finite time. These results emphasize runtime stability as a system-level requirement for reliable reasoning under uncertainty.

TL;DR: This paper introduces a method to automatically optimize Generalized Additive Models (GAMs) using NSGA-II, achieving a balance between prediction accuracy and model simplicity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manually designing GAM structures is challenging, and there is a need for optimization techniques that enhance interpretability and performance simultaneously.

Method: The NSGA-II genetic algorithm is employed to automatically optimize GAMs by minimizing prediction error (RMSE) and a Complexity Penalty incorporating sparsity, smoothness, and uncertainty.

Result: NSGA-II produces GAMs that are either more accurate than baseline LinearGAMs or achieve comparable performance with significantly reduced complexity.

Conclusion: This automated framework improves the trade-off between accuracy and interpretability, offering a generalizable tool for transparent, high-performing models.

Abstract: Generalized Additive Models (GAMs) balance predictive accuracy and interpretability, but manually configuring their structure is challenging. We propose using the multi-objective genetic algorithm NSGA-II to automatically optimize GAMs, jointly minimizing prediction error (RMSE) and a Complexity Penalty that captures sparsity, smoothness, and uncertainty. Experiments on the California Housing dataset show that NSGA-II discovers GAMs that outperform baseline LinearGAMs in accuracy or match performance with substantially lower complexity. The resulting models are simpler, smoother, and exhibit narrower confidence intervals, enhancing interpretability. This framework provides a general approach for automated optimization of transparent, high-performing models. The code can be found at https://github.com/KaaustaaubShankar/GeneticAdditiveModels.

*SungJun Cho,Chetan Gohil,Rukuang Huang,Oiwi Parker Jones,Mark W. Woolrich*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper evaluates tokenization strategies for transformer-based neuroimaging models using MEG data, comparing learnable and non-learnable approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address the unclear impact of tokenization strategies on large-scale neuroimaging foundation models.

Method: A systematic evaluation of tokenizers for MEG data was conducted using learnable (autoencoder-based) and non-learnable methods on three diverse datasets.

Result: Both tokenization approaches showed high reconstruction fidelity and comparable performance on several modeling and downstream tasks.

Conclusion: Simple, fixed tokenization strategies may suffice for neural foundation model development, maintaining performance comparable to learnable methods.

Abstract: Recent success in natural language processing has motivated growing interest in large-scale foundation models for neuroimaging data. Such models often require discretization of continuous neural time series data, a process referred to as 'tokenization'. However, the impact of different tokenization strategies for neural data is currently poorly understood. In this work, we present a systematic evaluation of sample-level tokenization strategies for transformer-based large neuroimaging models (LNMs) applied to magnetoencephalography (MEG) data. We compare learnable and non-learnable tokenizers by examining their signal reconstruction fidelity and their impact on subsequent foundation modeling performance (token prediction, biological plausibility of generated data, preservation of subject-specific information, and performance on downstream tasks). For the learnable tokenizer, we introduce a novel approach based on an autoencoder. Experiments were conducted on three publicly available MEG datasets spanning different acquisition sites, scanners, and experimental paradigms. Our results show that both learnable and non-learnable discretization schemes achieve high reconstruction accuracy and broadly comparable performance across most evaluation criteria, suggesting that simple fixed sample-level tokenization strategies can be used in the development of neural foundation models.

*Mingchun Sun,Rongqiang Zhao,Zhennan Huang,Songyu Ding,Jie Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces IT-OSE for robustly estimating optimal sample size in data augmentation, improving model performance and reducing computational costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of theoretical research and established metrics for determining optimal sample size in data augmentation.

Method: Propose IT-OSE, an information-theoretic method, and ICD score to estimate and evaluate optimal sample size in industrial scenarios, backed by theoretical analysis and experimental validation.

Result: IT-OSE increases accuracy by 4.38% in classification tasks and reduces errors by 18.80% in regression tasks; reduces computational costs up to 83.97%.

Conclusion: IT-OSE provides reliable OSS estimation, enhances model performance, reduces resource costs, and is applicable across sensor-based industrial scenarios.

Abstract: In industrial scenarios, data augmentation is an effective approach to improve model performance. However, its benefits are not unidirectionally beneficial. There is no theoretical research or established estimation for the optimal sample size (OSS) in augmentation, nor is there an established metric to evaluate the accuracy of OSS or its deviation from the ground truth. To address these issues, we propose an information-theoretic optimal sample size estimation (IT-OSE) to provide reliable OSS estimation for industrial data augmentation. An interval coverage and deviation (ICD) score is proposed to evaluate the estimated OSS intuitively. The relationship between OSS and dominant factors is theoretically analyzed and formulated, thereby enhancing the interpretability. Experiments show that, compared to empirical estimation, the IT-OSE increases accuracy in classification tasks across baseline models by an average of 4.38%, and reduces MAPE in regression tasks across baseline models by an average of 18.80%. The improvements in downstream model performance are more stable. ICDdev in the ICD score is also reduced by an average of 49.30%. The determinism of OSS is enhanced. Compared to exhaustive search, the IT-OSE achieves the same OSS while reducing computational and data costs by an average of 83.97% and 93.46%. Furthermore, practicality experiments demonstrate that the IT-OSE exhibits generality across representative sensor-based industrial scenarios.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces B-DENSE to improve diffusion models by aligning multi-branch trajectories, enhancing generative modeling accuracy while addressing high inference latency and discretization errors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the high inference latency of diffusion models and mitigate discretization errors arising from sparse supervision in current distillation techniques.

Method: B-DENSE introduces multi-branch trajectory alignment by modifying the student model to output expanded channels, with each representing discrete intermediate steps. These branches are trained to align with the teacher model's trajectory, ensuring dense correspondence.

Result: The proposed framework improves image generation quality compared to other baseline distillation approaches by enabling the student model to explore the solution space effectively.

Conclusion: B-DENSE enhances the performance of generative models by leveraging dense intermediate alignment, overcoming limitations of traditional sparse supervision frameworks in distillation techniques.

Abstract: Inspired by non-equilibrium thermodynamics, diffusion models have achieved state-of-the-art performance in generative modeling. However, their iterative sampling nature results in high inference latency. While recent distillation techniques accelerate sampling, they discard intermediate trajectory steps. This sparse supervision leads to a loss of structural information and introduces significant discretization errors. To mitigate this, we propose B-DENSE, a novel framework that leverages multi-branch trajectory alignment. We modify the student architecture to output $K$-fold expanded channels, where each subset corresponds to a specific branch representing a discrete intermediate step in the teacher's trajectory. By training these branches to simultaneously map to the entire sequence of the teacher's target timesteps, we enforce dense intermediate trajectory alignment. Consequently, the student model learns to navigate the solution space from the earliest stages of training, demonstrating superior image generation quality compared to baseline distillation frameworks.

*Qing Yang,Yuhao Jiang,Rui Wang,Jipeng Guo,Yejiang Wang,Xinghe Cheng,Zezheng Wu,Jiapu Wang,Jingwei Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces BamaER, a framework for personalized exercise recommendation to improve learning progress by integrating behavior-aware and memory-augmented mechanisms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing exercise recommendation methods fail to incorporate rich behavioral data and face challenges in accurately modeling long-term learning dependencies, resulting in unreliable estimations of student knowledge mastery.

Method: The authors propose the BamaER framework, comprising three modules: (1) a hybrid encoding learning progress prediction module, (2) a memory-augmented knowledge tracing module, and (3) an optimization-based exercise filtering module to enhance recommendation accuracy and diversity.

Result: BamaER outperformed state-of-the-art methods across five real-world educational datasets, demonstrating superior performance on various evaluation metrics.

Conclusion: Behavior-aware mechanisms, dynamic memory integration, and diversity-aware filtering significantly improve personalized learning recommendations, addressing key limitations in existing methods.

Abstract: Exercise recommendation focuses on personalized exercise selection conditioned on students' learning history, personal interests, and other individualized characteristics. Despite notable progress, most existing methods represent student learning solely as exercise sequences, overlooking rich behavioral interaction information. This limited representation often leads to biased and unreliable estimates of learning progress. Moreover, fixed-length sequence segmentation limits the incorporation of early learning experiences, thereby hindering the modeling of long-term dependencies and the accurate estimation of knowledge mastery. To address these limitations, we propose BamaER, a Behavior-aware memory-augmented Exercise Recommendation framework that comprises three core modules: (i) the learning progress prediction module that captures heterogeneous student interaction behaviors via a tri-directional hybrid encoding scheme; (ii) the memory-augmented knowledge tracing module that maintains a dynamic memory matrix to jointly model historical and current knowledge states for robust mastery estimation; and (iii) the exercise filtering module that formulates candidate selection as a diversity-aware optimization problem, solved via the Hippopotamus Optimization Algorithm to reduce redundancy and improve recommendation coverage. Experiments on five real-world educational datasets show that BamaER consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines across a range of evaluation metrics.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the computational bottlenecks and optimization challenges in scaling PINNs to large spatiotemporal domains for reconstructing complex flows governed by Navier-Stokes equations.

Method: A distributed PINNs framework is developed with strategies like reference anchor normalization and decoupled asymmetric weighting to handle pressure indeterminacy and ensure global pressure consistency. Additionally, training is optimized using CUDA graphs and JIT compilation to minimize computational overhead.

Result: The proposed method achieves near-linear scaling and high-fidelity flow reconstruction, as validated on complex hydrodynamic benchmarks.

Conclusion: This framework offers an efficient and scalable solution for flow reconstruction, ensuring physical rigor and computational efficiency in understanding complex hydrodynamics.

Abstract: Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) offer a powerful paradigm for flow reconstruction, seamlessly integrating sparse velocity measurements with the governing Navier-Stokes equations to recover complete velocity and latent pressure fields. However, scaling such models to large spatiotemporal domains is hindered by computational bottlenecks and optimization instabilities. In this work, we propose a robust distributed PINNs framework designed for efficient flow reconstruction via spatiotemporal domain decomposition. A critical challenge in such distributed solvers is pressure indeterminacy, where independent sub-networks drift into inconsistent local pressure baselines. We address this issue through a reference anchor normalization strategy coupled with decoupled asymmetric weighting. By enforcing a unidirectional information flow from designated master ranks where the anchor point lies to neighboring ranks, our approach eliminates gauge freedom and guarantees global pressure uniqueness while preserving temporal continuity. Furthermore, to mitigate the Python interpreter overhead associated with computing high-order physics residuals, we implement a high-performance training pipeline accelerated by CUDA graphs and JIT compilation. Extensive validation on complex flow benchmarks demonstrates that our method achieves near-linear strong scaling and high-fidelity reconstruction, establishing a scalable and physically rigorous pathway for flow reconstruction and understanding of complex hydrodynamics.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a semi-supervised framework to improve P300-based BCI speller systems with minimal calibration effort, showing better efficiency and accuracy in scenarios with limited labeled EEG data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address lengthy calibration procedures in conventional P300 BCI spellers, which limits efficiency and usability, especially with limited labeled data.

Method: An adaptive semi-supervised EM-GMM algorithm was integrated into the framework to update the binary classifier with minimal labeled calibration data.

Result: In testing with 15 participants, character-level accuracy reached above 0.7 for 9 individuals, outperforming the benchmark for 7 out of these 9 participants.

Conclusion: The semi-supervised framework enhances efficiency and usability for real-time P300 BCI spellers, offering practical advantages in scenarios requiring limited calibration data.

Abstract: A P300 ERP-based Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) speller is an assistive communication tool. It searches for the P300 event-related potential (ERP) elicited by target stimuli, distinguishing it from the neural responses to non-target stimuli embedded in electroencephalogram (EEG) signals. Conventional methods require a lengthy calibration procedure to construct the binary classifier, which reduced overall efficiency. Thus, we proposed a unified framework with minimum calibration effort such that, given a small amount of labeled calibration data, we employed an adaptive semi-supervised EM-GMM algorithm to update the binary classifier. We evaluated our method based on character-level prediction accuracy, information transfer rate (ITR), and BCI utility. We applied calibration on training data and reported results on testing data. Our results indicate that, out of 15 participants, 9 participants exceed the minimum character-level accuracy of 0.7 using either on our adaptive method or the benchmark, and 7 out of these 9 participants showed that our adaptive method performed better than the benchmark. The proposed semi-supervised learning framework provides a practical and efficient alternative to improve the overall spelling efficiency in the real-time BCI speller system, particularly in contexts with limited labeled data.

*Zhi Sheng,Yuan Yuan,Guozhen Zhang,Yong Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces R$^2$Energy, a large-scale benchmark for renewable energy forecasting focusing on robust predictions during extreme weather conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The increase in renewable energy sources, coupled with extreme weather threats due to climate change, necessitates robust and reliable forecasting models for power system stability.

Method: The study provides a standardized benchmark dataset with over 10.7 million records from wind and solar stations in China and introduces a leakage-free paradigm, allowing fair evaluation of forecasting models while analyzing their robustness under extreme conditions.

Result: Key findings reveal a robustness-complexity trade-off, where model reliability during extreme weather is more influenced by meteorological integration strategies than architectural complexity.

Conclusion: R$^2$Energy serves as a critical resource for advancing forecasting models, addressing challenges in predicting renewable energy outputs reliably during volatile climate conditions.

Abstract: The rapid expansion of renewable energy, particularly wind and solar power, has made reliable forecasting critical for power system operations. While recent deep learning models have achieved strong average accuracy, the increasing frequency and intensity of climate-driven extreme weather events pose severe threats to grid stability and operational security. Consequently, developing robust forecasting models that can withstand volatile conditions has become a paramount challenge. In this paper, we present R$^2$Energy, a large-scale benchmark for NWP-assisted renewable energy forecasting. It comprises over 10.7 million high-fidelity hourly records from 902 wind and solar stations across four provinces in China, providing the diverse meteorological conditions necessary to capture the wide-ranging variability of renewable generation. We further establish a standardized, leakage-free forecasting paradigm that grants all models identical access to future Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) signals, enabling fair and reproducible comparison across state-of-the-art representative forecasting architectures. Beyond aggregate accuracy, we incorporate regime-wise evaluation with expert-aligned extreme weather annotations, uncovering a critical ``robustness gap'' typically obscured by average metrics. This gap reveals a stark robustness-complexity trade-off: under extreme conditions, a model's reliability is driven by its meteorological integration strategy rather than its architectural complexity. R$^2$Energy provides a principled foundation for evaluating and developing forecasting models for safety-critical power system applications.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The research explores the challenges of clustering arms with Gaussian feedback in MAB problems, relevant in real-life settings like portfolio management and mmWave communications.

Method: The authors improve upon the Thompson Sampling algorithm by introducing TSCG and UTSCG tailored for hierarchical clustering structures, analyzing their theoretical regret bounds.

Result: The algorithms show lower regret bounds theoretically compared to standard Thompson Sampling with Gaussian priors, supported by numerical experiments.

Conclusion: The paper establishes the advantage of the proposed algorithms over standard approaches for specific clustered arm settings.

Abstract: We study a type of Multi-Armed Bandit (MAB) problems in which arms with a Gaussian reward feedback are clustered. Such an arm setting finds applications in many real-world problems, for example, mmWave communications and portfolio management with risky assets, as a result of the universality of the Gaussian distribution. Based on the Thompson Sampling algorithm with Gaussian prior (TSG) algorithm for the selection of the optimal arm, we propose our Thompson Sampling with Clustered arms under Gaussian prior (TSCG) specific to the 2-level hierarchical structure. We prove that by utilizing the 2-level structure, we can achieve a lower regret bound than we do with ordinary TSG. In addition, when the reward is Unimodal, we can reach an even lower bound on the regret by our Unimodal Thompson Sampling algorithm with Clustered Arms under Gaussian prior (UTSCG). Each of our proposed algorithms are accompanied by theoretical evaluation of the upper regret bound, and our numerical experiments confirm the advantage of our proposed algorithms.

*Riccardo De Santi,Kimon Protopapas,Ya-Ping Hsieh,Andreas Krause*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper addresses the limitation of flow and diffusion models that produce narrow data samples by proposing a method called Flow Expander (FE) that broadens the sampling density while retaining validity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to solve the problem of limited sample generation capacity of pre-trained flow models, particularly in scientific discovery, by extending their density within the broader design space.

Method: The authors introduce Flow Expander (FE), a scalable mirror descent algorithm, to expand flow models via entropy maximization constrained by verifier checks. This involves a mathematical optimization over noised state spaces.

Result: The method shows theoretical convergence guarantees and successfully increases sample diversity while ensuring validity in empirical evaluations, including molecular design tasks.

Conclusion: FE effectively enables flow models to generate diverse and valid samples beyond the regions of high data dependency by leveraging verifier-constrained optimization.

Abstract: Flow and diffusion models are typically pre-trained on limited available data (e.g., molecular samples), covering only a fraction of the valid design space (e.g., the full molecular space). As a consequence, they tend to generate samples from only a narrow portion of the feasible domain. This is a fundamental limitation for scientific discovery applications, where one typically aims to sample valid designs beyond the available data distribution. To this end, we address the challenge of leveraging access to a verifier (e.g., an atomic bonds checker), to adapt a pre-trained flow model so that its induced density expands beyond regions of high data availability, while preserving samples validity. We introduce formal notions of strong and weak verifiers and propose algorithmic frameworks for global and local flow expansion via probability-space optimization. Then, we present Flow Expander (FE), a scalable mirror descent scheme that provably tackles both problems by verifier-constrained entropy maximization over the flow process noised state space. Next, we provide a thorough theoretical analysis of the proposed method, and state convergence guarantees under both idealized and general assumptions. Ultimately, we empirically evaluate our method on both illustrative, yet visually interpretable settings, and on a molecular design task showcasing the ability of FE to expand a pre-trained flow model increasing conformer diversity while preserving validity.

*Jayadev Billa*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The study explores how capabilities emerge during neural network training by analyzing geometric measures across model scales, tracking emergence events in tasks, and focusing on patterns related to training dynamics and prediction limits.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the mechanisms of capability emergence in neural networks during training is crucial to improving interpretability and adjustability for various tasks.

Method: The authors analyze five geometric measures across multiple model scales and tasks, examining how these measures evolve during training. They identify representation collapse, track geometric indicators, and observe their alignment with task-specific emergence.

Result: The study identifies universal representation collapse across scales, a top-down propagation of collapse, precursor geometric signals, and clear limits in their predictive capabilities on task ordering and timing.

Conclusion: The geometric anatomy of emergence is highlighted, including its replication and limits, but the approach is not intended to serve as a predictive tool for task performance.

Abstract: Capability emergence during neural network training remains mechanistically opaque. We track five geometric measures across five model scales (405K-85M parameters), 120+ emergence events in eight algorithmic tasks, and three Pythia language models (160M-2.8B). We find: (1) training begins with a universal representation collapse to task-specific floors that are scale-invariant across a 210X parameter range (e.g., modular arithmetic collapses to RANKME ~ 2.0 regardless of model size); (2) collapse propagates top-down through layers (32/32 task X model consistency), contradicting bottom-up feature-building intuition; (3) a geometric hierarchy in which representation geometry leads emergence (75-100% precursor rate for hard tasks), while the local learning coefficient is synchronous (0/24 precursor) and Hessian measures lag. We also delineate prediction limits: geometric measures encode coarse task difficulty but not fine-grained timing (within-class concordance 27%; when task ordering reverses across scales, prediction fails at 26%). On Pythia, global geometric patterns replicate but per-task precursor signals do not -- the precursor relationship requires task-training alignment that naturalistic pre-training does not provide. Our contribution is the geometric anatomy of emergence and its boundary conditions, not a prediction tool.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces adaptive geodesic conformal prediction for regression tasks on Riemannian manifolds, offering uniform conditional coverage through geodesic scores and difficulty normalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing conformal prediction methods poorly handle cases with responses on Riemannian manifolds and fail to adapt to local prediction difficulty, leading to inferior coverage calibration.

Method: The authors replace Euclidean residuals with geodesic nonconformity scores and normalize by a difficulty estimator based on cross-validation, generating geodesic caps that adapt to prediction difficulty.

Result: The adaptive method showed more uniform coverage and reduced variability in both synthetic and real-world tasks, outperforming Euclidean-based baselines significantly.

Conclusion: Adaptive geodesic conformal prediction offers better-calibrated prediction regions and improved performance for regression problems with manifold-valued responses.

Abstract: Conformal prediction provides distribution-free coverage guaranties for regression; yet existing methods assume Euclidean output spaces and produce prediction regions that are poorly calibrated when responses lie on Riemannian manifolds. We propose \emph{adaptive geodesic conformal prediction}, a framework that replaces Euclidean residuals with geodesic nonconformity scores and normalizes them by a cross-validated difficulty estimator to handle heteroscedastic noise. The resulting prediction regions, geodesic caps on the sphere, have position-independent area and adapt their size to local prediction difficulty, yielding substantially more uniform conditional coverage than non-adaptive alternatives. In a synthetic sphere experiment with strong heteroscedasticity and a real-world geomagnetic field forecasting task derived from IGRF-14 satellite data, the adaptive method markedly reduces conditional coverage variability and raises worst-case coverage much closer to the nominal level, while coordinate-based baselines waste a large fraction of coverage area due to chart distortion.

TL;DR: MolCrystalFlow is a flow-based generative model designed for predicting molecular crystal structures, effectively handling intra- and intermolecular complexity using geometric methods and benchmarking successfully against current models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the challenge of predicting molecular crystal structures due to their large molecule sizes and complex interactions, extending generative modeling techniques to overcome current limitations.

Method: MolCrystalFlow, a flow-based generative model, uses rigid body embedding for molecules, geodesic flow construction, and graph neural networks on Riemannian manifolds to predict lattice matrices, molecular orientations, and centroids.

Result: The model outperforms state-of-the-art generative models and rule-based methods in molecular crystal prediction benchmarks, integrating with machine learning potentials for enhanced performance.

Conclusion: MolCrystalFlow advances the capability of generative models in molecular crystal prediction, demonstrating its potential in data-driven discoveries and integration with computational chemistry workflows.

Abstract: Molecular crystal structure prediction represents a grand challenge in computational chemistry due to large sizes of constituent molecules and complex intra- and intermolecular interactions. While generative modeling has revolutionized structure discovery for molecules, inorganic solids, and metal-organic frameworks, extending such approaches to fully periodic molecular crystals is still elusive. Here, we present MolCrystalFlow, a flow-based generative model for molecular crystal structure prediction. The framework disentangles intramolecular complexity from intermolecular packing by embedding molecules as rigid bodies and jointly learning the lattice matrix, molecular orientations, and centroid positions. Centroids and orientations are represented on their native Riemannian manifolds, allowing geodesic flow construction and graph neural network operations that respects geometric symmetries. We benchmark our model against state-of-the-art generative models for large-size periodic crystals and rule-based structure generation methods on two open-source molecular crystal datasets. We demonstrate an integration of MolCrystalFlow model with universal machine learning potential to accelerate molecular crystal structure prediction, paving the way for data-driven generative discovery of molecular crystals.

### [163] [Can Generative Artificial Intelligence Survive Data Contamination? Theoretical Guarantees under Contaminated Recursive Training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16065)
*Kevin Wang,Hongqian Niu,Didong Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores how recursive training of Generative AI on AI-generated and human-generated data mixture affects model performance, providing theoretical results and extending analysis to sampling bias scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a rising concern as generative AI systems are increasingly trained on datasets contaminated with both human-generated and AI-generated content, leading to potential model degradation or collapse.

Method: The authors propose a general theoretical framework for studying recursive training without assuming specific data distribution types. They analyze convergence rates of such models and extend the research by incorporating empirical studies and cases of sampling bias.

Result: The study finds that contaminated recursive training converges, with its rate dictated by the baseline model's convergence rate and the proportion of real data used. It offers a positive theoretical outcome by not enforcing distributional constraints on data.

Conclusion: The findings suggest that though recursive training under data contamination converges, reliance remains on the data's real-to-generated ratio. This adds valuable insight and furthers understanding in real-world scenarios, including sampling biases.

Abstract: Generative Artificial Intelligence (AI), such as large language models (LLMs), has become a transformative force across science, industry, and society. As these systems grow in popularity, web data becomes increasingly interwoven with this AI-generated material and it is increasingly difficult to separate them from naturally generated content. As generative models are updated regularly, later models will inevitably be trained on mixtures of human-generated data and AI-generated data from earlier versions, creating a recursive training process with data contamination. Existing theoretical work has examined only highly simplified settings, where both the real data and the generative model are discrete or Gaussian, where it has been shown that such recursive training leads to model collapse. However, real data distributions are far more complex, and modern generative models are far more flexible than Gaussian and linear mechanisms. To fill this gap, we study recursive training in a general framework with minimal assumptions on the real data distribution and allow the underlying generative model to be a general universal approximator. In this framework, we show that contaminated recursive training still converges, with a convergence rate equal to the minimum of the baseline model's convergence rate and the fraction of real data used in each iteration. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first (positive) theoretical result on recursive training without distributional assumptions on the data. We further extend the analysis to settings where sampling bias is present in data collection and support all theoretical results with empirical studies.

*KC Santosh,Srikanth Baride,Rodrigue Rizk*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces AI-CARE, a tool for evaluating machine learning models based on energy consumption, carbon emissions, and performance to align AI advancements with sustainability goals.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Machine learning benchmarks largely disregard energy consumption and carbon emissions, presenting misalignment with real-world needs in energy-constrained and climate-aware applications.

Method: The authors propose AI-CARE, an evaluation tool that measures energy consumption and carbon emissions, along with introducing a carbon-performance tradeoff curve that visualizes performance against carbon cost.

Result: The study theoretically and empirically shows that carbon-aware benchmarking reshapes model rankings and promotes environmentally-friendly, high-performance architectures.

Conclusion: AI-CARE encourages multi-objective evaluation and seeks to guide the AI community toward sustainable practices with its benchmark tool and tradeoff curve.

Abstract: As machine learning (ML) continues its rapid expansion, the environmental cost of model training and inference has become a critical societal concern. Existing benchmarks overwhelmingly focus on standard performance metrics such as accuracy, BLEU, or mAP, while largely ignoring energy consumption and carbon emissions. This single-objective evaluation paradigm is increasingly misaligned with the practical requirements of large-scale deployment, particularly in energy-constrained environments such as mobile devices, developing regions, and climate-aware enterprises. In this paper, we propose AI-CARE, an evaluation tool for reporting energy consumption, and carbon emissions of ML models. In addition, we introduce the carbon-performance tradeoff curve, an interpretable tool that visualizes the Pareto frontier between performance and carbon cost. We demonstrate, through theoretical analysis and empirical validation on representative ML workloads, that carbon-aware benchmarking changes the relative ranking of models and encourages architectures that are simultaneously accurate and environmentally responsible. Our proposal aims to shift the research community toward transparent, multi-objective evaluation and align ML progress with global sustainability goals.

### [165] [MoE-Spec: Expert Budgeting for Efficient Speculative Decoding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16052)
*Bradley McDanel,Steven Li,Sruthikesh Surineni,Harshit Khaitan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces MoE-Spec, a method to improve Large Language Model (LLM) inference with Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models by reducing memory cost and increasing throughput.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the bottleneck introduced in Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models during speculative decoding, particularly the memory pressure caused by large draft trees activating many experts.

Method: The authors propose MoE-Spec, a method that enforces fixed expert capacity limits at each layer during verification, selectively loading the most relevant experts while discarding others.

Result: MoE-Spec improves throughput by 10-30% compared to state-of-the-art speculative decoding baselines (EAGLE-3), while maintaining comparable quality and allowing flexibility in trading accuracy for latency.

Conclusion: MoE-Spec effectively mitigates memory bottlenecks in MoE models and enhances the efficiency of large-scale LLM inference, offering a balance between throughput, quality, and latency trade-offs.

Abstract: Speculative decoding accelerates Large Language Model (LLM) inference by verifying multiple drafted tokens in parallel. However, for Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models, this parallelism introduces a severe bottleneck: large draft trees activate many unique experts, significantly increasing memory pressure and diminishing speedups from speculative decoding relative to autoregressive decoding. Prior methods reduce speculation depth when MoE verification becomes expensive. We propose MoE-Spec, a training-free verification-time expert budgeting method that decouples speculation depth from memory cost by enforcing a fixed expert capacity limit at each layer, loading only the experts that contribute most to verification and dropping the long tail of rarely used experts that drive bandwidth overhead. Experiments across multiple model scales and datasets show that this method yields 10--30\% higher throughput than state-of-the-art speculative decoding baselines (EAGLE-3) at comparable quality, with flexibility to trade accuracy for further latency reductions through tighter budgets.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a computational method for analyzing shape graph datasets, focusing on both connectivity and geometric attributes, and tests its effectiveness on real-world data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the need for analyzing geometric and connectivity structures of 2D or 3D shape graphs for tasks like classification and clustering, which traditional graph analysis methods often overlook.

Method: The authors develop a feature representation pipeline extracting topological, geometric, and directional features with invariance properties for use in statistical analysis.

Result: The method is successfully applied to datasets including urban networks, neuronal traces, and astrocyte imaging, and performs well compared to standard methods.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively captures and analyzes shape graph datasets, balancing connectivity and geometry, making it useful for various application domains.

Abstract: This paper introduces and demonstrates a computational pipeline for the statistical analysis of shape graph datasets, namely geometric networks embedded in 2D or 3D spaces. Unlike traditional abstract graphs, our purpose is not only to retrieve and distinguish variations in the connectivity structure of the data but also geometric differences of the network branches. Our proposed approach relies on the extraction of a specifically curated and explicit set of topological, geometric and directional features, designed to satisfy key invariance properties. We leverage the resulting feature representation for tasks such as group comparison, clustering and classification on cohorts of shape graphs. The effectiveness of this representation is evaluated on several real-world datasets including urban road/street networks, neuronal traces and astrocyte imaging. These results are benchmarked against several alternative methods, both feature-based and not.

TL;DR: This paper proposes a multi-objective alignment framework for AI therapeutic systems using direct preference optimization and demonstrates its benefits over single-objective approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Mental health disorders impact over 1 billion people, yet access to care is hindered by workforce shortages and cost constraints.

Method: Surveyed 335 individuals with lived mental health experience to collect therapeutic preference rankings; developed reward models for six criteria; compared multi-objective direct preference optimization against single-objective optimization, supervised fine-tuning, and parameter merging.

Result: Multi-objective DPO achieves better balanced performance (77.6% empathy, 62.6% safety) compared to single-objective approaches; therapeutic criteria surpass general communication principles by 17.2%; clinician evaluations favor MODPO with comparable reliability.

Conclusion: Multi-objective alignment offers promising advantages in balancing clinical safety and patient preferences for AI therapeutic systems.

Abstract: Mental health disorders affect over 1 billion people worldwide, yet access to care remains limited by workforce shortages and cost constraints. While AI systems show therapeutic promise, current alignment approaches optimize objectives independently, failing to balance patient preferences with clinical safety. We survey 335 individuals with lived mental health experience to collect preference rankings across therapeutic dimensions, then develop a multi-objective alignment framework using direct preference optimization. We train reward models for six criteria -- empathy, safety, active listening, self-motivated change, trust/rapport, and patient autonomy -- and systematically compare multi-objective approaches against single-objective optimization, supervised fine-tuning, and parameter merging. Multi-objective DPO (MODPO) achieves superior balance (77.6% empathy, 62.6% safety) compared to single-objective optimization (93.6% empathy, 47.8% safety), and therapeutic criteria outperform general communication principles by 17.2%. Blinded clinician evaluation confirms MODPO is consistently preferred, with LLM-evaluator agreement comparable to inter-clinician reliability.

*Dawon Ahn,Het Patel,Aemal Khattak,Jia Chen,Evangelos E. Papalexakis*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a multi-view tensor decomposition framework to analyze driver behavior at railway crossings through video data, identifying location-based behavioral patterns that can inform safety interventions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Driver behavior at railway crossings varies due to location, time, and conditions, and current methods lack the ability to identify shared patterns across locations for better safety insights.

Method: A multi-view tensor decomposition framework is used, leveraging TimeSformer embeddings for different phases (Approach, Waiting, Clearance) and applying non-negative symmetric CP decomposition to uncover latent behavioral patterns.

Result: Behavioral patterns were found to be influenced more by crossing location than the time of day, and approach-phase behaviors exhibited discriminative features. Crossings showed distinct location-based behavioral clustering.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively enables scalable behavioral analysis across railway crossings, facilitating location-based clustering for guiding targeted safety interventions.

Abstract: Railway crossings present complex safety challenges where driver behavior varies by location, time, and conditions. Traditional approaches analyze crossings individually, limiting the ability to identify shared behavioral patterns across locations. We propose a multi-view tensor decomposition framework that captures behavioral similarities across three temporal phases: Approach (warning activation to gate lowering), Waiting (gates down to train passage), and Clearance (train passage to gate raising). We analyze railway crossing videos from multiple locations using TimeSformer embeddings to represent each phase. By constructing phase-specific similarity matrices and applying non-negative symmetric CP decomposition, we discover latent behavioral components with distinct temporal signatures. Our tensor analysis reveals that crossing location appears to be a stronger determinant of behavior patterns than time of day, and that approach-phase behavior provides particularly discriminative signatures. Visualization of the learned component space confirms location-based clustering, with certain crossings forming distinct behavioral clusters. This automated framework enables scalable pattern discovery across multiple crossings, providing a foundation for grouping locations by behavioral similarity to inform targeted safety interventions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the lack of a systematic and comprehensive treatment of Bayesian quadrature, despite its development in the 1980s and increasing interdisciplinary use.

Method: The authors review mathematical foundations, propose a taxonomy for methods, compile theoretical guarantees, conduct numerical studies, and offer insights on practical challenges in Bayesian quadrature.

Result: The paper presents a detailed analysis of Bayesian quadrature including its classifications, theoretical insights, and practical limitations, along with an exhaustive bibliography.

Conclusion: The survey bridges a gap in understanding and applying Bayesian quadrature, offering a structured and insightful resource for researchers across various disciplines.

Abstract: Bayesian quadrature is a probabilistic, model-based approach to numerical integration, the estimation of intractable integrals, or expectations. Although Bayesian quadrature was popularised already in the 1980s, no systematic and comprehensive treatment has been published. The purpose of this survey is to fill this gap. We review the mathematical foundations of Bayesian quadrature from different points of view; present a systematic taxonomy for classifying different Bayesian quadrature methods along the three axes of modelling, inference, and sampling; collect general theoretical guarantees; and provide a controlled numerical study that explores and illustrates the effect of different choices along the axes of the taxonomy. We also provide a realistic assessment of practical challenges and limitations to application of Bayesian quadrature methods and include an up-to-date and nearly exhaustive bibliography that covers not only machine learning and statistics literature but all areas of mathematics and engineering in which Bayesian quadrature or equivalent methods have seen use.

*Rahul Singh,Siddharth Chandak,Eric Moulines,Vivek S. Borkar,Nicholas Bambos*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper presents a high-probability regret bound for online Q-learning in infinite-horizon discounted MDPs, introducing novel exploration methods and analysis techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of high-probability regret bounds for classical online Q-learning, especially without relying on optimism or bonus terms.

Method: Analyzes Boltzmann Q-learning with decaying temperature and introduces a Smoothed $ε_n$-Greedy exploration scheme to improve performance. Additionally, develops a high-probability concentration bound for contractive Markovian stochastic approximation.

Result: Boltzmann Q-learning shows sublinear regret for large suboptimality gaps but can degrade to linear for small gaps. The $ε_n$-Greedy scheme achieves a gap-robust near-$\tilde{O}(N^{9/10})$ regret.

Conclusion: The proposed methods offer a robust alternative to existing exploration strategies in Q-learning with strong theoretical guarantees and broader implications for stochastic approximation.

Abstract: We present the first high-probability regret bound for classical online Q-learning in infinite-horizon discounted Markov decision processes, without relying on optimism or bonus terms. We first analyze Boltzmann Q-learning with decaying temperature and show that its regret depends critically on the suboptimality gap of the MDP: for sufficiently large gaps, the regret is sublinear, while for small gaps it deteriorates and can approach linear growth. To address this limitation, we study a Smoothed $ε_n$-Greedy exploration scheme that combines $ε_n$-greedy and Boltzmann exploration, for which we prove a gap-robust regret bound of near-$\tilde{O}(N^{9/10})$. To analyze these algorithms, we develop a high-probability concentration bound for contractive Markovian stochastic approximation with iterate- and time-dependent transition dynamics. This bound may be of independent interest as the contraction factor in our bound is governed by the mixing time and is allowed to converge to one asymptotically.

TL;DR: The paper investigates the implicit bias of momentum-based optimizers on homogeneous models, showing how they influence margin maximization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the implicit bias of momentum-based optimizers, including Muon, MomentumGD, and Adam, in maximizing specific types of margins in homogeneous models.

Method: Extended analysis of normalized steepest descent, momentum algorithms, and Adam algorithm, supported by theoretical proofs and experiments.

Result: Momentum-based optimization algorithms are shown to approximate steepest descent trajectories under certain conditions, demonstrating bias toward specific margin maximization problems.

Conclusion: The choice of optimizer influences the type of margin maximized in homogeneous models, adding to the understanding of implicit biases in optimization methods.

Abstract: We study the implicit bias of momentum-based optimizers on homogeneous models. We first extend existing results on the implicit bias of steepest descent in homogeneous models to normalized steepest descent with an optional learning rate schedule. We then show that for smooth homogeneous models, momentum steepest descent algorithms like Muon (spectral norm), MomentumGD ($\ell_2$ norm), and Signum ($\ell_\infty$ norm) are approximate steepest descent trajectories under a decaying learning rate schedule, proving that these algorithms too have a bias towards KKT points of the corresponding margin maximization problem. We extend the analysis to Adam (without the stability constant), which maximizes the $\ell_\infty$ margin, and to Muon-Signum and Muon-Adam, which maximize a hybrid norm. Our experiments corroborate the theory and show that the identity of the margin maximized depends on the choice of optimizer. Overall, our results extend earlier lines of work on steepest descent in homogeneous models and momentum-based optimizers in linear models.

### [172] [Why Any-Order Autoregressive Models Need Two-Stream Attention: A Structural-Semantic Tradeoff](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16092)
*Patrick Pynadath,Ruqi Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores any-order autoregressive models (AO-ARMs) for masked diffusion and investigates the role of two-stream attention in managing a tradeoff between semantic and structural priorities during generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to improve AO-ARMs by understanding and addressing specific challenges in balancing semantic and structural information processing during generation, which affects prediction performance.

Method: A novel approach called Decoupled RoPE is proposed, which modifies rotary position embeddings to handle position information without exposing target content, isolating the tradeoff involved in prediction.

Result: Decoupled RoPE achieves competitive results for short sequence lengths but degrades at longer lengths, revealing the role of two-stream attention in managing the structural-semantic tradeoff.

Conclusion: The study provides evidence that two-stream attention's advantages lie in its ability to address the structural-semantic tradeoff, not just position-content separation, thereby improving any-order generation models.

Abstract: Any-order autoregressive models (AO-ARMs) offer a promising path toward efficient masked diffusion by enabling native key-value caching, but competitive performance has so far required two-stream attention, typically motivated as a means of decoupling token content from position. In this work, we argue that two-stream attention may be serving a more subtle role. We identify a structural-semantic tradeoff in any-order generation: the hidden representation at each step must simultaneously attend to semantically informative tokens for prediction and structurally recent tokens for summarization, objectives that compete for attention capacity in a single stream but can specialize across two streams. To isolate this tradeoff from position-content separation, we propose Decoupled RoPE, a modification to rotary position embeddings that provides target position information without revealing target content. Decoupled RoPE performs competitively at short sequence lengths--where semantic and structural proximity coincide--but degrades as sequence length increases and the two orderings diverge. These results suggest that the success of two-stream attention stems not merely from separating position from content, but from circumventing the deeper structural-semantic tradeoff inherent to any-order generation.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a bias-correction method using the Weierstrass transform under Local Differential Privacy (LDP), proposing a novel algorithm called IWP-SGD for unbiased binary classification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation of this work is to address the bias introduced by noise in data released under noninteractive LDP, ensuring data usability for subsequent unbiased analyses.

Method: The method involves leveraging the Weierstrass transform to analyze and correct bias in binary classification tasks. The approach includes formulating a stochastic gradient descent algorithm (IWP-SGD) based on inverting the Weierstrass transform.

Result: The proposed IWP-SGD algorithm is proven to converge to the true population risk minimizer at a rate of O(1/n) and is empirically validated on synthetic and real-world binary classification datasets.

Conclusion: The paper demonstrates that data under LDP can be corrected for bias using the Weierstrass transform, making it viable for unbiased analysis in binary classification, with contributions validated both theoretically and empirically.

Abstract: Releasing data once and for all under noninteractive Local Differential Privacy (LDP) enables complete data reusability, but the resulting noise may create bias in subsequent analyses. In this work, we leverage the Weierstrass transform to characterize this bias in binary classification. We prove that inverting this transform leads to a bias-correction method to compute unbiased estimates of nonlinear functions on examples released under LDP. We then build a novel stochastic gradient descent algorithm called Inverse Weierstrass Private SGD (IWP-SGD). It converges to the true population risk minimizer at a rate of $\mathcal{O}(1/n)$, with $n$ the number of examples. We empirically validate IWP-SGD on binary classification tasks using synthetic and real-world datasets.

*Afonso Lourenço,Francisca Osório,Diogo Risca,Goreti Marreiros*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a semantic-aware continual learning framework for fault diagnostics in railway systems, leveraging unsupervised and supervised methods to detect anomalies effectively under evolving conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Maintenance of the railway wheel-rail interface is crucial for safety and cost efficiency, but traditional predictive maintenance struggles with feature engineering and evolving operational patterns.

Method: Accelerometer data is encoded using a Variational AutoEncoder (VAE) for unsupervised learning. Metadata is extracted via AI-driven peak detection on fiber Bragg grating sensors and fused with VAE embeddings. A gradient boosting classifier and a replay-based continual learning approach ensure adaptive anomaly detection.

Result: The model successfully detects minor imperfections like flats and polygonization while adapting to varying operational conditions, such as train type and track profile, using minimal sensors.

Conclusion: The framework presents an efficient, adaptive, and label-efficient solution for online railway fault detection, demonstrating robustness to evolving dynamics and minimal reliance on manual labeling.

Abstract: Reliable and cost-effective maintenance is essential for railway safety, particularly at the wheel-rail interface, which is prone to wear and failure. Predictive maintenance frameworks increasingly leverage sensor-generated time-series data, yet traditional methods require manual feature engineering, and deep learning models often degrade in online settings with evolving operational patterns. This work presents a semantic-aware, label-efficient continual learning framework for railway fault diagnostics. Accelerometer signals are encoded via a Variational AutoEncoder into latent representations capturing the normal operational structure in a fully unsupervised manner. Importantly, semantic metadata, including axle counts, wheel indexes, and strain-based deformations, is extracted via AI-driven peak detection on fiber Bragg grating sensors (resistant to electromagnetic interference) and fused with the VAE embeddings, enhancing anomaly detection under unknown operational conditions. A lightweight gradient boosting supervised classifier stabilizes anomaly scoring with minimal labels, while a replay-based continual learning strategy enables adaptation to evolving domains without catastrophic forgetting. Experiments show the model detects minor imperfections due to flats and polygonization, while adapting to evolving operational conditions, such as changes in train type, speed, load, and track profiles, captured using a single accelerometer and strain gauge in wayside monitoring.

TL;DR: The paper addresses the hubness phenomenon in generative model evaluation and proposes GICDM to improve distance-based metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding generative model evaluation often relies on distorted distance relationships due to the hubness phenomenon, which impacts metric reliability.

Method: Introduced Generative ICDM (GICDM), an improved method based on Iterative Contextual Dissimilarity Measure (ICDM), including a multi-scale extension.

Result: The GICDM method resolves hubness issues, restores trustworthy metrics, and aligns better with human judgments in synthetic and real dataset evaluations.

Conclusion: GICDM enhances generative model evaluation by mitigating hubness impacts, enabling more reliable metric assessments.

Abstract: Generative model evaluation commonly relies on high-dimensional embedding spaces to compute distances between samples. We show that dataset representations in these spaces are affected by the hubness phenomenon, which distorts nearest neighbor relationships and biases distance-based metrics. Building on the classical Iterative Contextual Dissimilarity Measure (ICDM), we introduce Generative ICDM (GICDM), a method to correct neighborhood estimation for both real and generated data. We introduce a multi-scale extension to improve empirical behavior. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real benchmarks demonstrate that GICDM resolves hubness-induced failures, restores reliable metric behavior, and improves alignment with human judgment.

*Leo,Wang,Connor Mclaughlin,Lili Su*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper investigates how to optimally select data sources for joint representation learning, demonstrating the benefits of careful source selection in achieving statistical and practical efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to determine which data sources to include in shared representation learning to avoid hindrances caused by irrelevant or poor-quality data.

Method: The authors focus on a linear setting with sources sharing a low-dimensional subspace, propose methods for source screening, and formalize the concept of informative subpopulations.

Result: They show that training on selected data subsets can achieve minimax optimality, discarding a significant amount of data without loss of accuracy. Algorithms and heuristics for source selection are validated through theoretical and empirical evaluations.

Conclusion: Source screening and selective training can enhance representation learning by avoiding irrelevant or poor-quality data, offering both statistical optimality and practical usefulness.

Abstract: Learning with shared representation is widely recognized as an effective way to separate commonalities from heterogeneity across various heterogeneous sources. Most existing work includes all related data sources via simultaneously training a common feature extractor and source-specific heads. It is well understood that data sources with low relevance or poor quality may hinder representation learning. In this paper, we further dive into the question of which data sources should be learned jointly by focusing on the traditionally deemed ``good'' collection of sources, in which individual sources have similar relevance and qualities with respect to the true underlying common structure. Towards tractability, we focus on the linear setting where sources share a low-dimensional subspace. We find that source screening can play a central role in statistically optimal subspace estimation. We show that, for a broad class of problem instances, training on a carefully selected subset of sources suffices to achieve minimax optimality, even when a substantial portion of data is discarded. We formalize the notion of an informative subpopulation, develop algorithms and practical heuristics for identifying such subsets, and validate their effectiveness through both theoretical analysis and empirical evaluations on synthetic and real-world datasets.

### [177] [Investigating GNN Convergence on Large Randomly Generated Graphs with Realistic Node Feature Correlations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16145)
*Mohammed Zain Ali Ahmed*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores the convergence behavior of graph neural networks (GNNs) on random graphs with correlated node features, presenting a novel graph generation method and evidence of improved GNN expressiveness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing studies on GNNs' convergence ignore real-world graphs' natural feature correlations, leading to underestimations of GNNs' expressive power.

Method: The authors propose a method to generate random graphs with correlated node features, inspired by real-life graph properties captured by the Barabási-Albert model. They perform both theoretical and empirical analysis to validate their approach.

Result: The study observes divergent behavior in GNNs' convergence on their generated graphs, showing that GNNs can be more expressive than previously understood.

Conclusion: Graph neural networks may demonstrate improved expressiveness on realistic graphs with correlated features, contrary to earlier studies on convergence in random graph contexts.

Abstract: There are a number of existing studies analysing the convergence behaviour of graph neural networks on large random graphs. Unfortunately, the majority of these studies do not model correlations between node features, which would naturally exist in a variety of real-life networks. Consequently, the derived limitations of GNNs, resulting from such convergence behaviour, is not truly reflective of the expressive power of GNNs when applied to realistic graphs. In this paper, we will introduce a novel method to generate random graphs that have correlated node features. The node features will be sampled in such a manner to ensure correlation between neighbouring nodes. As motivation for our choice of sampling scheme, we will appeal to properties exhibited by real-life graphs, particularly properties that are captured by the Barabási-Albert model. A theoretical analysis will strongly indicate that convergence can be avoided in some cases, which we will empirically validate on large random graphs generated using our novel method. The observed divergent behaviour provides evidence that GNNs may be more expressive than initial studies would suggest, especially on realistic graphs.

Result: SeMI* achieves optimal MI attack power while leveraging model updates, provides tighter privacy audits, and outperforms existing methods in practical settings.

Conclusion: Using SeMI*, adversaries achieve more precise privacy audits by leveraging the insights from model updates, presenting a significant improvement over existing MI attacks and analysis.

Abstract: Modern AI models are not static. They go through multiple updates in their lifecycles. Thus, exploiting the model dynamics to create stronger Membership Inference (MI) attacks and tighter privacy audits are timely questions. Though the literature empirically shows that using a sequence of model updates can increase the power of MI attacks, rigorous analysis of the `optimal' MI attacks is limited to static models with infinite samples. Hence, we develop an `optimal' MI attack, SeMI*, that uses the sequence of model updates to identify the presence of a target inserted at a certain update step. For the empirical mean computation, we derive the optimal power of SeMI*, while accessing a finite number of samples with or without privacy. Our results retrieve the existing asymptotic analysis. We observe that having access to the model sequence avoids the dilution of MI signals unlike the existing attacks on the final model, where the MI signal vanishes as training data accumulates. Furthermore, an adversary can use SeMI* to tune both the insertion time and the canary to yield tighter privacy audits. Finally, we conduct experiments across data distributions and models trained or fine-tuned with DP-SGD demonstrating that practical variants of SeMI* lead to tighter privacy audits than the baselines.

TL;DR: This paper addresses cross-subject generalization in EEG-based brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) by exploring spectral and temporal features, introducing ASPEN, a hybrid architecture utilizing multiplicative fusion for improved transferability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Cross-subject variability in EEG signals hampers generalization in BCIs, necessitating exploration of more stable features like spectral representations.

Method: They analyze EEG neural signals to compare spectral features with temporal waveforms and propose ASPEN, a hybrid architecture integrating both streams through multiplicative fusion to adaptively balance spectral and temporal contributions.

Result: Experimental results on six datasets verify ASPEN's ability to dynamically optimize feature use across different paradigms, achieving superior or competitive accuracy in unseen-subject scenarios.

Conclusion: ASPEN's multiplicative multimodal fusion approach proves effective for cross-subject generalization, making it a promising method for EEG-based BCI paradigms.

Abstract: Cross-subject generalization in EEG-based brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) remains challenging due to individual variability in neural signals. We investigate whether spectral representations offer more stable features for cross-subject transfer than temporal waveforms. Through correlation analyses across three EEG paradigms (SSVEP, P300, and Motor Imagery), we find that spectral features exhibit consistently higher cross-subject similarity than temporal signals. Motivated by this observation, we introduce ASPEN, a hybrid architecture that combines spectral and temporal feature streams via multiplicative fusion, requiring cross-modal agreement for features to propagate. Experiments across six benchmark datasets reveal that ASPEN is able to dynamically achieve the optimal spectral-temporal balance depending on the paradigm. ASPEN achieves the best unseen-subject accuracy on three of six datasets and competitive performance on others, demonstrating that multiplicative multimodal fusion enables effective cross-subject generalization.

*Difei Xu,Meng Ding,Zebin Ma,Huanyi Xie,Youming Tao,Aicha Slaitane,Di Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper addresses challenges in DP-DRO optimization, proposes novel methods, and achieves improved utility bounds.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To tackle limitations of DP-DRO, which has been understudied compared to DP-ERM, by addressing challenges posed by distribution shifts, group imbalances, and the need for robustness under differential privacy.

Method: Develops DP Double-Spider and DP Recursive-Spider optimization methods for DP-DRO, achieving improved utility rates under certain divergence measures.

Result: The proposed methods achieve strong utility bounds, perform well experimentally, and match best-known results for non-convex DP-ERM in specific cases.

Conclusion: By reformulating and innovating optimization methods, this work advances our understanding and implementation of DP-DRO, offering practical solutions for privacy-preserving robust optimization.

Abstract: Real-world deployments routinely face distribution shifts, group imbalances, and adversarial perturbations, under which the traditional Empirical Risk Minimization (ERM) framework can degrade severely.
  Distributionally Robust Optimization (DRO) addresses this issue by optimizing the worst-case expected loss over an uncertainty set of distributions, offering a principled approach to robustness.
  Meanwhile, as training data in DRO always involves sensitive information, safeguarding it against leakage under Differential Privacy (DP) is essential.
  In contrast to classical DP-ERM, DP-DRO has received much less attention due to its minimax optimization structure with uncertainty constraint.
  To bridge the gap, we provide a comprehensive study of DP-(finite-sum)-DRO with $ψ$-divergence and non-convex loss.
  First, we study DRO with general $ψ$-divergence by reformulating it as a minimization problem, and develop a novel $(\varepsilon, δ)$-DP optimization method, called DP Double-Spider, tailored to this structure.
  Under mild assumptions, we show that it achieves a utility bound of $\mathcal{O}(\frac{1}{\sqrt{n}}+ (\frac{\sqrt{d \log (1/δ)}}{n \varepsilon})^{2/3})$ in terms of the gradient norm, where $n$ denotes the data size and $d$ denotes the model dimension.
  We further improve the utility rate for specific divergences.
  In particular, for DP-DRO with KL-divergence, by transforming the problem into a compositional finite-sum optimization problem, we develop a DP Recursive-Spider method and show that it achieves a utility bound of $\mathcal{O}((\frac{\sqrt{d \log(1/δ)}}{n\varepsilon})^{2/3} )$, matching the best-known result for non-convex DP-ERM.
  Experimentally, we demonstrate that our proposed methods outperform existing approaches for DP minimax optimization.

### [181] [HiPER: Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning with Explicit Credit Assignment for Large Language Model Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16165)
*Jiangweizhi Peng,Yuanxin Liu,Ruida Zhou,Charles Fleming,Zhaoran Wang,Alfredo Garcia,Mingyi Hong*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces HiPER, a framework to improve training long-horizon LLM agents in decision-making using hierarchical reinforcement learning (RL). It separates planning and execution for better performance and reduces optimization instability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods struggle with training LLM agents in sparse-reward, long-horizon decision-making tasks, as flat policies fail to assign credit efficiently across long action sequences.

Method: The proposed HiPER framework leverages hierarchical RL by breaking the policy into a high-level planner for subgoals and a low-level executor for actions. The hierarchical advantage estimation (HAE) method ensures better credit assignment and reduced variance during training.

Result: HiPER achieved state-of-the-art performance on benchmarks like ALFWorld (97.4% success) and WebShop (83.3% success), significantly outperforming existing methods, particularly in long-horizon tasks.

Conclusion: HiPER's hierarchical design demonstrates the effectiveness of explicit temporal abstraction for scalable RL training of multi-turn LLM agents, addressing challenges in long-horizon decision-making.

Abstract: Training LLMs as interactive agents for multi-turn decision-making remains challenging, particularly in long-horizon tasks with sparse and delayed rewards, where agents must execute extended sequences of actions before receiving meaningful feedback. Most existing reinforcement learning (RL) approaches model LLM agents as flat policies operating at a single time scale, selecting one action at each turn. In sparse-reward settings, such flat policies must propagate credit across the entire trajectory without explicit temporal abstraction, which often leads to unstable optimization and inefficient credit assignment.
  We propose HiPER, a novel Hierarchical Plan-Execute RL framework that explicitly separates high-level planning from low-level execution. HiPER factorizes the policy into a high-level planner that proposes subgoals and a low-level executor that carries them out over multiple action steps. To align optimization with this structure, we introduce a key technique called hierarchical advantage estimation (HAE), which carefully assigns credit at both the planning and execution levels. By aggregating returns over the execution of each subgoal and coordinating updates across the two levels, HAE provides an unbiased gradient estimator and provably reduces variance compared to flat generalized advantage estimation.
  Empirically, HiPER achieves state-of-the-art performance on challenging interactive benchmarks, reaching 97.4\% success on ALFWorld and 83.3\% on WebShop with Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct (+6.6\% and +8.3\% over the best prior method), with especially large gains on long-horizon tasks requiring multiple dependent subtasks. These results highlight the importance of explicit hierarchical decomposition for scalable RL training of multi-turn LLM agents.

*Binghang Lu,Jiahao Zhang,Guang Lin*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SpecMuon proposes a spectral-aware optimization technique for physics-informed learning, decomposing gradients and applying adaptive RSAV updates for improved convergence and stability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Optimize physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) and neural operators struggling with ill-conditioned gradients, multi-scale spectral behavior, and physical constraints-induced stiffness.

Method: The method decomposes gradients into singular modes, applies RSAV updates along dominant spectral directions, and integrates Muon’s geometry while controlling stiff spectral components.

Result: SpecMuon achieves faster convergence and improved stability compared to other optimizers in numerical tests on PINNs and DeepONets for problems such as Burgers equation and fractional PDEs.

Conclusion: SpecMuon enhances optimization stability and convergence in physics-informed learning using mode-wise adjustments and spectral-aware strategies, validated through theoretical guarantees and numerical experiments.

Abstract: Physics-informed neural networks and neural operators often suffer from severe optimization difficulties caused by ill-conditioned gradients, multi-scale spectral behavior, and stiffness induced by physical constraints. Recently, the Muon optimizer has shown promise by performing orthogonalized updates in the singular-vector basis of the gradient, thereby improving geometric conditioning. However, its unit-singular-value updates may lead to overly aggressive steps and lack explicit stability guarantees when applied to physics-informed learning. In this work, we propose SpecMuon, a spectral-aware optimizer that integrates Muon's orthogonalized geometry with a mode-wise relaxed scalar auxiliary variable (RSAV) mechanism. By decomposing matrix-valued gradients into singular modes and applying RSAV updates individually along dominant spectral directions, SpecMuon adaptively regulates step sizes according to the global loss energy while preserving Muon's scale-balancing properties. This formulation interprets optimization as a multi-mode gradient flow and enables principled control of stiff spectral components. We establish rigorous theoretical properties of SpecMuon, including a modified energy dissipation law, positivity and boundedness of auxiliary variables, and global convergence with a linear rate under the Polyak-Lojasiewicz condition. Numerical experiments on physics-informed neural networks, DeepONets, and fractional PINN-DeepONets demonstrate that SpecMuon achieves faster convergence and improved stability compared with Adam, AdamW, and the original Muon optimizer on benchmark problems such as the one-dimensional Burgers equation and fractional partial differential equations.

*Yunshu Wu,Jiayi Cheng,Partha Thakuria,Rob Brekelmans,Evangelos E. Papalexakis,Greg Ver Steeg*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper improves non-autoregressive generation by introducing a new training method (DSL) that enhances iterative refinement, significantly reducing compute steps while maintaining high-quality outputs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Non-autoregressive generation methods face challenges like error accumulation and distribution shift in iterative refinement stages, necessitating more efficient and accurate approaches.

Method: The authors propose DSL (Discrete Stochastic Localization), which trains a single denoiser across various corruption levels to improve iterative refinement in masked diffusion language models, optimizing step-efficiency.

Result: DSL achieves higher quality generation with fewer denoising steps, yielding large MAUVE gains and matching autoregressive quality at higher step budgets.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates that training innovations like DSL can greatly enhance iterative non-autoregressive language modeling, improving efficiency and performance without increasing computational cost.

Abstract: Non-autoregressive (NAR) generation reduces decoding latency by predicting many tokens in parallel, but iterative refinement often suffers from error accumulation and distribution shift under self-generated drafts. Masked diffusion language models (MDLMs) and their remasking samplers (e.g., ReMDM) can be viewed as modern NAR iterative refinement, where generation repeatedly revises a partially observed draft. In this work we show that \emph{training alone} can substantially improve the step-efficiency of MDLM/ReMDM sampling. We propose \textsc{DSL} (Discrete Stochastic Localization), which trains a single SNR-invariant denoiser across a continuum of corruption levels, bridging intermediate draft noise and mask-style endpoint corruption within one Diffusion Transformer. On OpenWebText, \textsc{DSL} fine-tuning yields large MAUVE gains at low step budgets, surpassing the MDLM+ReMDM baseline with \(\sim\)4$\times$ fewer denoiser evaluations, and matches autoregressive quality at high budgets. Analyses show improved self-correction and uncertainty calibration, making remasking markedly more compute-efficient.

TL;DR: The paper presents a federated learning framework with lightweight MLP and differential privacy to detect energy theft in smart grids, addressing privacy and computational challenges efficiently.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Energy theft significantly impacts smart grids, causing economic loss and operational difficulties, while centralized detection methods face privacy and resource constraints.

Method: A federated learning framework utilizes lightweight MLP models for resource-constrained devices, coupled with Gaussian noise-based differential privacy for secure data handling.

Result: Experiments on real smart meter data show high performance metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, AUC) under various data distributions while maintaining privacy.

Conclusion: The framework is practical and scalable for privacy-preserving energy theft detection in smart meter-driven smart grids.

Abstract: Energy theft poses a significant threat to the stability and efficiency of smart grids, leading to substantial economic losses and operational challenges. Traditional centralized machine learning approaches for theft detection require aggregating user data, raising serious concerns about privacy and data security. These issues are further exacerbated in smart meter environments, where devices are often resource-constrained and lack the capacity to run heavy models. In this work, we propose a privacy-preserving federated learning framework for energy theft detection that addresses both privacy and computational constraints. Our approach leverages a lightweight multilayer perceptron (MLP) model, suitable for deployment on low-power smart meters, and integrates basic differential privacy (DP) by injecting Gaussian noise into local model updates before aggregation. This ensures formal privacy guarantees without compromising learning performance. We evaluate our framework on a real-world smart meter dataset under both IID and non-IID data distributions. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves competitive accuracy, precision, recall, and AUC scores while maintaining privacy and efficiency. This makes the proposed solution practical and scalable for secure energy theft detection in next-generation smart grid infrastructures.

### [185] [Deep TPC: Temporal-Prior Conditioning for Time Series Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16188)
*Filippos Bellos,NaveenJohn Premkumar,Yannis Avrithis,Nam H. Nguyen,Jason J. Corso*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes Temporal-Prior Conditioning (TPC), a novel method to improve large language models for time series analysis, achieving state-of-the-art results in long-term forecasting by better integrating temporal information throughout the model.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for time series analysis rely on shallow temporal conditioning, which limits their ability to effectively reason about time due to degradation of temporal cues through model layers.

Method: The authors introduce TPC, which incorporates learnable time series tokens that interact with temporal embeddings across multiple model layers using cross-attention, all while keeping the main LLM frozen.

Result: TPC demonstrates superior performance in long-term forecasting tasks across diverse datasets, outperforming traditional fine-tuning and other temporal conditioning approaches.

Conclusion: TPC effectively disentangles time series signals from temporal information, allowing for efficient training and enhanced forecasting performance, setting a new benchmark in the field.

Abstract: LLM-for-time series (TS) methods typically treat time shallowly, injecting positional or prompt-based cues once at the input of a largely frozen decoder, which limits temporal reasoning as this information degrades through the layers. We introduce Temporal-Prior Conditioning (TPC), which elevates time to a first-class modality that conditions the model at multiple depths. TPC attaches a small set of learnable time series tokens to the patch stream; at selected layers these tokens cross-attend to temporal embeddings derived from compact, human-readable temporal descriptors encoded by the same frozen LLM, then feed temporal context back via self-attention. This disentangles time series signal and temporal information while maintaining a low parameter budget. We show that by training only the cross-attention modules and explicitly disentangling time series signal and temporal information, TPC consistently outperforms both full fine-tuning and shallow conditioning strategies, achieving state-of-the-art performance in long-term forecasting across diverse datasets.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Geometric Compactification (GC)-PINN, a framework improving physics-informed neural networks by reshaping input coordinates to better fit multi-scale PDE systems, resulting in enhanced stability, accuracy, and speed.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in training PINNs caused by gradient stiffness and ill-conditioning due to misalignment with multi-scale PDE structures.

Method: The authors propose differentiable geometric compactification mappings that reshape input coordinates, coupled with spectral analysis of residual operators, without altering PINN architecture.

Result: GC-PINN delivers more uniform residual distributions, higher solution accuracy, and improved training stability and speed in empirical tests on 1D and 2D PDEs.

Conclusion: Geometric compactification mappings are effective in overcoming convergence barriers in PINNs for multi-scale PDEs.

Abstract: Several complex physical systems are governed by multi-scale partial differential equations (PDEs) that exhibit both smooth low-frequency components and localized high-frequency structures. Existing physics-informed neural network (PINN) methods typically train with fixed coordinate system inputs, where geometric misalignment with these structures induces gradient stiffness and ill-conditioning that hinder convergence. To address this issue, we introduce a mapping paradigm that reshapes the input coordinates through differentiable geometric compactification mappings and couples the geometric structure of PDEs with the spectral properties of residual operators. Based on this paradigm, we propose Geometric Compactification (GC)-PINN, a framework that introduces three mapping strategies for periodic boundaries, far-field scale expansion, and localized singular structures in the input domain without modifying the underlying PINN architecture. Extensive empirical evaluation demonstrates that this approach yields more uniform residual distributions and higher solution accuracy on representative 1D and 2D PDEs, while improving training stability and convergence speed.

TL;DR: The paper introduces GMFS, a framework for scalable cooperative MARL that efficiently handles heterogeneous interactions using graphon-subsampling methods, achieving theoretical and experimental validation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the computational challenges in managing large populations of agents in multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) due to the exponential scaling of the state-action space.

Method: Developing the GMFS framework that subsamples agents based on interaction strength to approximate a graphon-weighted mean-field, ensuring scalable and accurate learning.

Result: Theoretical guarantees showing sample complexity of poly(κ) and an optimality gap of O(1/√κ), validated through numerical simulations in robotic coordination scenarios.

Conclusion: GMFS demonstrates the potential for efficiently coordinating heterogeneous agent interactions in MARL, achieving near-optimal performance while maintaining scalability.

Abstract: Coordinating large populations of interacting agents is a central challenge in multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL), where the size of the joint state-action space scales exponentially with the number of agents. Mean-field methods alleviate this burden by aggregating agent interactions, but these approaches assume homogeneous interactions. Recent graphon-based frameworks capture heterogeneity, but are computationally expensive as the number of agents grows. Therefore, we introduce $\texttt{GMFS}$, a $\textbf{G}$raphon $\textbf{M}$ean-$\textbf{F}$ield $\textbf{S}$ubsampling framework for scalable cooperative MARL with heterogeneous agent interactions. By subsampling $κ$ agents according to interaction strength, we approximate the graphon-weighted mean-field and learn a policy with sample complexity $\mathrm{poly}(κ)$ and optimality gap $O(1/\sqrtκ)$. We verify our theory with numerical simulations in robotic coordination, showing that $\texttt{GMFS}$ achieves near-optimal performance.

TL;DR: ModalImmune is a training framework that enhances multimodal model robustness by simulating modality failures during training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the vulnerability of multimodal systems to input channel loss during deployment in real-world conditions.

Method: Introduces ModalImmune with components like spectrum-adaptive collapse regularizer, information-gain guided controller, gradient masking, and meta-parameter adaptation.

Result: Empirical results demonstrate resilience to modality removal, corruption, and maintain stability and reconstruction capabilities.

Conclusion: Equips multimodal systems with robustness against modality failures, improving real-world deployment reliability.

Abstract: Multimodal systems are vulnerable to partial or complete loss of input channels at deployment, which undermines reliability in real-world settings. This paper presents ModalImmune, a training framework that enforces modality immunity by intentionally and controllably collapsing selected modality information during training so the model learns joint representations that are robust to destructive modality influence. The framework combines a spectrum-adaptive collapse regularizer, an information-gain guided controller for targeted interventions, curvature-aware gradient masking to stabilize destructive updates, and a certified Neumann-truncated hyper-gradient procedure for automatic meta-parameter adaptation. Empirical evaluation on standard multimodal benchmarks demonstrates that ModalImmune improves resilience to modality removal and corruption while retaining convergence stability and reconstruction capacity.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces DOIT, a training-free method for adapting pre-trained diffusion models to high-reward distributions without modifying the original model, using Doob's $h$-transform.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing adaptation methods for diffusion models are computationally expensive, often require differentiable rewards, and lack theoretical guarantees.

Method: DOIT employs a measure transport framework, specifically using Doob's $h$-transform, for dynamic corrections during diffusion sampling, enabling efficient adaptation without further training or pre-trained model modification.

Result: DOIT achieves superior performance on D4RL benchmarks compared to state-of-the-art methods, while maintaining computational efficiency.

Conclusion: DOIT provides a theoretically grounded, efficient, and flexible method for adapting diffusion models to non-differentiable high-reward distributions, broadening their application scope.

Abstract: Adaptation methods have been a workhorse for unlocking the transformative power of pre-trained diffusion models in diverse applications. Existing approaches often abstract adaptation objectives as a reward function and steer diffusion models to generate high-reward samples. However, these approaches can incur high computational overhead due to additional training, or rely on stringent assumptions on the reward such as differentiability. Moreover, despite their empirical success, theoretical justification and guarantees are seldom established. In this paper, we propose DOIT (Doob-Oriented Inference-time Transformation), a training-free and computationally efficient adaptation method that applies to generic, non-differentiable rewards. The key framework underlying our method is a measure transport formulation that seeks to transport the pre-trained generative distribution to a high-reward target distribution. We leverage Doob's $h$-transform to realize this transport, which induces a dynamic correction to the diffusion sampling process and enables efficient simulation-based computation without modifying the pre-trained model. Theoretically, we establish a high probability convergence guarantee to the target high-reward distribution via characterizing the approximation error in the dynamic Doob's correction. Empirically, on D4RL offline RL benchmarks, our method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines while preserving sampling efficiency.

Motivation: To extend Neurochaos Learning (NL) applications from separable and time series data to linked data, particularly knowledge graphs.

Method: Implemented node aggregation on knowledge graphs and input aggregated features into ChaosNet to test NL on homophilic and heterophilic graph datasets.

Result: Demonstrated higher efficacy of NL on homophilic graphs compared to heterophilic graphs with detailed analysis.

Conclusion: Extending NL to linked data is feasible and effective, particularly for homophilic graphs, laying the groundwork for future research on heterophilic graphs.

Abstract: Neurochaos Learning (NL) has shown promise in recent times over traditional deep learning due to its two key features: ability to learn from small sized training samples, and low compute requirements. In prior work, NL has been implemented and extensively tested on separable and time series data, and demonstrated its superior performance on both classification and regression tasks. In this paper, we investigate the next step in NL, viz., applying NL to linked data, in particular, data that is represented in the form of knowledge graphs. We integrate linked data into NL by implementing node aggregation on knowledge graphs, and then feeding the aggregated node features to the simplest NL architecture: ChaosNet. We demonstrate the results of our implementation on homophilic graph datasets as well as heterophilic graph datasets of verying heterophily. We show better efficacy of our approach on homophilic graphs than on heterophilic graphs. While doing so, we also present our analysis of the results, as well as suggestions for future work.

TL;DR: The paper introduces MCL, a plug-and-play module for neural operators, to improve prediction stability by incorporating geometric constraints, significantly reducing errors with minimal parameter increase.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing neural operators face challenges with instability over long-term rollouts, due to unconstrained updates in Euclidean latent space violating geometric and conservation laws.

Method: The authors propose MCL, which applies low-rank Lie algebra parameterization to constrain latent space updates by enforcing geometric consistency through group action updates.

Result: MCL reduces relative prediction errors by 30-50% in complex PDE tasks, while only increasing parameters by 2.26%, showing significant stability improvements across various systems.

Conclusion: The MCL method enhances neural operator performance through geometric inductive biases, offering an effective, scalable solution for stable, long-term PDE predictions.

Abstract: Neural operators offer an effective framework for learning solutions of partial differential equations for many physical systems in a resolution-invariant and data-driven manner. Existing neural operators, however, often suffer from instability in multi-layer iteration and long-horizon rollout, which stems from the unconstrained Euclidean latent space updates that violate the geometric and conservation laws. To address this challenge, we propose to constrain manifolds with low-rank Lie algebra parameterization that performs group action updates on the latent representation. Our method, termed Manifold Constraining based on Lie group (MCL), acts as an efficient \emph{plug-and-play} module that enforces geometric inductive bias to existing neural operators. Extensive experiments on various partial differential equations, such as 1-D Burgers and 2-D Navier-Stokes, over a wide range of parameters and steps demonstrate that our method effectively lowers the relative prediction error by 30-50\% at the cost of 2.26\% of parameter increase. The results show that our approach provides a scalable solution for improving long-term prediction fidelity by addressing the principled geometric constraints absent in the neural operator updates.

Conclusion: UCTECG-Net enhances ECG classification accuracy and provides reliable uncertainty estimates, making it suitable for risk-aware applications.

Abstract: Deep learning has improved automated electrocardiogram (ECG) classification, but limited insight into prediction reliability hinders its use in safety-critical settings. This paper proposes UCTECG-Net, an uncertainty-aware hybrid architecture that combines one-dimensional convolutions and Transformer encoders to process raw ECG signals and their spectrograms jointly. Evaluated on the MIT-BIH Arrhythmia and PTB Diagnostic datasets, UCTECG-Net outperforms LSTM, CNN1D, and Transformer baselines in terms of accuracy, precision, recall and F1 score, achieving up to 98.58% accuracy on MIT-BIH and 99.14% on PTB. To assess predictive reliability, we integrate three uncertainty quantification methods (Monte Carlo Dropout, Deep Ensembles, and Ensemble Monte Carlo Dropout) into all models and analyze their behavior using an uncertainty-aware confusion matrix and derived metrics. The results show that UCTECG-Net, particularly with Ensemble or EMCD, provides more reliable and better-aligned uncertainty estimates than competing architectures, offering a stronger basis for risk-aware ECG decision support.

Motivation: Existing surface extraction methods focus only on single-class surfaces, lacking solutions for multi-class implicit representations that maintain topological integrity and avoid holes.

Method: The authors propose a novel 2D boundary extraction algorithm tailored for multi-class implicit representations, emphasizing topological consistency, water-tightness, and controllable detail levels.

Conclusion: This work pioneers extraction techniques for multi-class surfaces, ensuring accurate topology and laying the foundation for further advancements in this domain.

Abstract: Surface extraction from implicit neural representations modelling a single class surface is a well-known task. However, there exist no surface extraction methods from an implicit representation of multiple classes that guarantee topological correctness and no holes. In this work, we lay the groundwork by introducing a 2D boundary extraction algorithm for the multi-class case focusing on topological consistency and water-tightness, which also allows for setting minimum detail restraint on the approximation. Finally, we evaluate our algorithm using geological modelling data, showcasing its adaptiveness and ability to honour complex topology.

### [195] [SEMixer: Semantics Enhanced MLP-Mixer for Multiscale Mixing and Long-term Time Series Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16220)
*Xu Zhang,Qitong Wang,Peng Wang,Wei Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces SEMixer, a lightweight multiscale model for long-term time series forecasting (TSF), which uses a Random Attention Mechanism and a Multiscale Progressive Mixing Chain to handle multiscale temporal dependencies effectively.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Long-term time series forecasting is challenged by redundancy, noise in time series data, and semantic gaps between different scales, requiring methods for efficient alignment and integration of multiscale dependencies.

Method: SEMixer uses a Random Attention Mechanism (RAM) to capture diverse time-patch interactions and a Multiscale Progressive Mixing Chain (MPMC) to stack RAM and MLP-Mixer for effective temporal mixing and bridging semantic scale gaps.

Result: SEMixer demonstrated its effectiveness on 10 public datasets and the 2025 CCF AlOps Challenge, achieving third place using 21GB of real wireless network data.

Conclusion: SEMixer proves to be a memory-efficient, high-performing model for multiscale time series forecasting, with enhanced ability to handle noise, redundancy, and semantic gaps.

Abstract: Modeling multiscale patterns is crucial for long-term time series forecasting (TSF). However, redundancy and noise in time series, together with semantic gaps between non-adjacent scales, make the efficient alignment and integration of multi-scale temporal dependencies challenging. To address this, we propose SEMixer, a lightweight multiscale model designed for long-term TSF. SEMixer features two key components: a Random Attention Mechanism (RAM) and a Multiscale Progressive Mixing Chain (MPMC). RAM captures diverse time-patch interactions during training and aggregates them via dropout ensemble at inference, enhancing patch-level semantics and enabling MLP-Mixer to better model multi-scale dependencies. MPMC further stacks RAM and MLP-Mixer in a memory-efficient manner, achieving more effective temporal mixing. It addresses semantic gaps across scales and facilitates better multiscale modeling and forecasting performance. We not only validate the effectiveness of SEMixer on 10 public datasets, but also on the \textit{2025 CCF AlOps Challenge} based on 21GB real wireless network data, where SEMixer achieves third place.

### [196] [Amortized Predictability-aware Training Framework for Time Series Forecasting and Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16224)
*Xu Zhang,Peng Wang,Yichen Li,Wei Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a new framework, APTF, addressing the challenge of training on noisy, low-predictability time series samples by improving model focus on high-predictability data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Time series models face difficulty when training with noisy data, as low-predictability samples can hinder model stability and performance.

Method: The authors propose APTF, which uses Hierarchical Predictability-aware Loss to dynamically penalize low-predictability samples and an amortization model to reduce estimation errors.

Result: APTF effectively enhances training stability and robustness, improving outcomes in time series forecasting and classification tasks.

Conclusion: The framework offers a general approach to handling noise in time series data, aiding model optimization during training.

Abstract: Time series data are prone to noise in various domains, and training samples may contain low-predictability patterns that deviate from the normal data distribution, leading to training instability or convergence to poor local minima. Therefore, mitigating the adverse effects of low-predictability samples is crucial for time series analysis tasks such as time series forecasting (TSF) and time series classification (TSC). While many deep learning models have achieved promising performance, few consider how to identify and penalize low-predictability samples to improve model performance from the training perspective. To fill this gap, we propose a general Amortized Predictability-aware Training Framework (APTF) for both TSF and TSC. APTF introduces two key designs that enable the model to focus on high-predictability samples while still learning appropriately from low-predictability ones: (i) a Hierarchical Predictability-aware Loss (HPL) that dynamically identifies low-predictability samples and progressively expands their loss penalty as training evolves, and (ii) an amortization model that mitigates predictability estimation errors caused by model bias, further enhancing HPL's effectiveness. The code is available at https://github.com/Meteor-Stars/APTF.

*Zizhao Wang,Chang Shi,Jiaheng Hu,Kevin Rohling,Roberto Martín-Martín,Amy Zhang,Peter Stone*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FLAM introduces a factored dynamics framework for learning latent actions from action-free video, focusing on more accurate modeling in complex, multi-entity scenes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges in modeling complex environments where multiple entities act simultaneously, often leading to poor performance by monolithic action modeling approaches.

Method: The authors propose Factored Latent Action Model (FLAM), which decomposes the scene into independent factors, each with its own latent action and predictive dynamics.

Result: FLAM achieves better prediction accuracy, representation quality, and performance in downstream policy learning compared to prior monolithic latent action models.

Conclusion: Factorized latent action models like FLAM improve video generation quality and controllability in action-free video settings, particularly in multi-entity environments.

Abstract: Learning latent actions from action-free video has emerged as a powerful paradigm for scaling up controllable world model learning. Latent actions provide a natural interface for users to iteratively generate and manipulate videos. However, most existing approaches rely on monolithic inverse and forward dynamics models that learn a single latent action to control the entire scene, and therefore struggle in complex environments where multiple entities act simultaneously. This paper introduces Factored Latent Action Model (FLAM), a factored dynamics framework that decomposes the scene into independent factors, each inferring its own latent action and predicting its own next-step factor value. This factorized structure enables more accurate modeling of complex multi-entity dynamics and improves video generation quality in action-free video settings compared to monolithic models. Based on experiments on both simulation and real-world multi-entity datasets, we find that FLAM outperforms prior work in prediction accuracy and representation quality, and facilitates downstream policy learning, demonstrating the benefits of factorized latent action models.

*Matthias Frey,Jonathan H. Manton,Jingge Zhu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper addresses universal prediction for stochastic sequences with finite horizon $T$, proposing high-probability bounds with a convergence rate similar to existing expectation bounds. An impossibility result is also introduced.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to complement existing expectation bounds with high-probability bounds for universal prediction of stochastic sequences, enabling stronger guarantees.

Method: The authors derive high-probability bounds with convergence rates and introduce an impossibility result that specifies the limits of improvement for these bounds.

Result: The high-probability bounds achieve a convergence rate of $\mathcal{O}(T^{-1/2} δ^{-1/2})$, while impossibility results show no improvement in the exponent of $δ$ without further assumptions.

Conclusion: The paper provides new high-probability bounds for universal prediction while clarifying the limits through an impossibility result, enhancing the theoretical understanding of the problem.

Abstract: We revisit the classical problem of universal prediction of stochastic sequences with a finite time horizon $T$ known to the learner. The question we investigate is whether it is possible to derive vanishing regret bounds that hold with high probability, complementing existing bounds from the literature that hold in expectation. We propose such high-probability bounds which have a very similar form as the prior expectation bounds. For the case of universal prediction of a stochastic process over a countable alphabet, our bound states a convergence rate of $\mathcal{O}(T^{-1/2} δ^{-1/2})$ with probability as least $1-δ$ compared to prior known in-expectation bounds of the order $\mathcal{O}(T^{-1/2})$. We also propose an impossibility result which proves that it is not possible to improve the exponent of $δ$ in a bound of the same form without making additional assumptions.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a supervised classification framework with class-dependent rewards (CDR) for predicting solar flares, comparing various model approaches, feature combinations, and interpretability techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve solar flare prediction accuracy within 24 hours using advanced machine learning models and knowledge-informed features.

Method: Developed and tested deep learning models (CNN, BiLSTM, Transformer) and their CDR variants, using LOS magnetic parameters, combined features, and interpretability analyses.

Result: CDR-Transformer performed the best overall, with specific magnetic field parameters like R_VALUE and TOTUSJH being key. Additionally, the CDR model's performance surpassed NASA/CCMC's predictions.

Conclusion: Class-dependent rewards enhance model performance, especially for knowledge-informed features. CDR-Transformer is a promising tool for solar flare prediction.

Abstract: In this work, we develop, for the first time, a supervised classification framework with class-dependent rewards (CDR) to predict $\geq$MM flares within 24 hr. We construct multiple datasets, covering knowledge-informed features and line-of sight (LOS) magnetograms. We also apply three deep learning models (CNN, CNN-BiLSTM, and Transformer) and three CDR counterparts (CDR-CNN, CDR-CNN-BiLSTM, and CDR-Transformer). First, we analyze the importance of LOS magnetic field parameters with the Transformer, then compare its performance using LOS-only, vector-only, and combined magnetic field parameters. Second, we compare flare prediction performance based on CDR models versus deep learning counterparts. Third, we perform sensitivity analysis on reward engineering for CDR models. Fourth, we use the SHAP method for model interpretability. Finally, we conduct performance comparison between our models and NASA/CCMC. The main findings are: (1)Among LOS feature combinations, R_VALUE and AREA_ACR consistently yield the best results. (2)Transformer achieves better performance with combined LOS and vector magnetic field data than with either alone. (3)Models using knowledge-informed features outperform those using magnetograms. (4)While CNN and CNN-BiLSTM outperform their CDR counterparts on magnetograms, CDR-Transformer is slightly superior to its deep learning counterpart when using knowledge-informed features. Among all models, CDR-Transformer achieves the best performance. (5)The predictive performance of the CDR models is not overly sensitive to the reward choices.(6)Through SHAP analysis, the CDR model tends to regard TOTUSJH as more important, while the Transformer tends to prioritize R_VALUE more.(7)Under identical prediction time and active region (AR) number, the CDR-Transformer shows superior predictive capabilities compared to NASA/CCMC.

*Adam Zweiger,Xinghong Fu,Han Guo,Yoon Kim*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes a fast context compaction approach in latent space for reducing the key-value (KV) cache size in language models, achieving significant memory efficiency with minimal performance loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the inefficiency in scaling language models to long contexts caused by the large KV cache size, while avoiding the performance losses associated with traditional summarization methods.

Method: The authors introduce Attention Matching, which constructs compact keys and values in latent space to replicate attention outputs and maintain attention mass at the KV-head level.

Result: Their approach enables significant KV cache compaction (up to 50x) in a matter of seconds on certain datasets, with little downstream performance degradation.

Conclusion: Fast and efficient latent space context compaction through Attention Matching offers a viable solution for managing long contexts in language models, providing substantial improvement in compaction time and quality trade-offs.

Abstract: Scaling language models to long contexts is often bottlenecked by the size of the key-value (KV) cache. In deployed settings, long contexts are typically managed through compaction in token space via summarization. However, summarization can be highly lossy, substantially harming downstream performance. Recent work on Cartridges has shown that it is possible to train highly compact KV caches in latent space that closely match full-context performance, but at the cost of slow and expensive end-to-end optimization. This work describes an approach for fast context compaction in latent space through Attention Matching, which constructs compact keys and values to reproduce attention outputs and preserve attention mass at a per-KV-head level. We show that this formulation naturally decomposes into simple subproblems, some of which admit efficient closed-form solutions. Within this framework, we develop a family of methods that significantly push the Pareto frontier of compaction time versus quality, achieving up to 50x compaction in seconds on some datasets with little quality loss.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces WS-KAN, the first weight-space architecture designed for Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs), addressing their symmetry properties and outperforming baseline methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to improve weight-space models for neural networks, especially applying structured approaches to Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs), which lack tailored architecture despite sharing permutation symmetries with MLPs.

Method: The study introduces the KAN-graph representation and proposes WS-KAN, a weight-space architecture designed to respect KAN symmetries. WS-KAN's expressiveness is analyzed by its ability to replicate the forward pass of input networks.

Result: Through a comprehensive benchmark of trained KAN models across various tasks, WS-KAN consistently outperformed structure-agnostic baseline methods, verifying its effectiveness.

Conclusion: WS-KAN demonstrates the importance of leveraging network symmetries for interpreting weight-space representations, presenting itself as an effective tool for learning from KANs' parameters while outperforming unstructured alternatives.

Abstract: Weight-space models learn directly from the parameters of neural networks, enabling tasks such as predicting their accuracy on new datasets. Naive methods -- like applying MLPs to flattened parameters -- perform poorly, making the design of better weight-space architectures a central challenge. While prior work leveraged permutation symmetries in standard networks to guide such designs, no analogous analysis or tailored architecture yet exists for Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs). In this work, we show that KANs share the same permutation symmetries as MLPs, and propose the KAN-graph, a graph representation of their computation. Building on this, we develop WS-KAN, the first weight-space architecture that learns on KANs, which naturally accounts for their symmetry. We analyze WS-KAN's expressive power, showing it can replicate an input KAN's forward pass - a standard approach for assessing expressiveness in weight-space architectures. We construct a comprehensive ``zoo'' of trained KANs spanning diverse tasks, which we use as benchmarks to empirically evaluate WS-KAN. Across all tasks, WS-KAN consistently outperforms structure-agnostic baselines, often by a substantial margin. Our code is available at https://github.com/BarSGuy/KAN-Graph-Metanetwork.

Motivation: To improve interpretability in fault diagnosis decisions made by a highly accurate LSTM classifier in non-linear chemical processes.

Method: Two XAI methods, Integrated Gradients and SHAP, are applied to explain the fault diagnosis decisions of an LSTM classifier trained on the TEP dataset.

Result: XAI methods successfully identify the subsystem where faults occur, often highlighting the same features, with SHAP occasionally providing more detailed insights relating to fault root causes.

Conclusion: XAI methods are effective in enhancing decision transparency for fault detection in chemical processes and are adaptable to similar problems beyond this specific case.

Abstract: In this work, we apply and compare two state-of-the-art eXplainability Artificial Intelligence (XAI) methods, the Integrated Gradients (IG) and the SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP), that explain the fault diagnosis decisions of a highly accurate Long Short-Time Memory (LSTM) classifier. The classifier is trained to detect faults in a benchmark non-linear chemical process, the Tennessee Eastman Process (TEP). It is highlighted how XAI methods can help identify the subsystem of the process where the fault occurred. Using our knowledge of the process, we note that in most cases the same features are indicated as the most important for the decision, while insome cases the SHAP method seems to be more informative and closer to the root cause of the fault. Finally, since the used XAI methods are model-agnostic, the proposed approach is not limited to the specific process and can also be used in similar problems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To resolve the challenges of nonlinearity and ill-posedness in spectroscopic photoacoustic imaging, which hinder accurate estimation of chromophore concentrations critical for physiological insights.

Method: The study developed the SPOI-AE (Spectroscopic Photoacoustic Optical Inversion Autoencoder) which was trained and tested on in vivo mouse lymph node sPA images and validated via a simulated phantom with ground truths.

Result: SPOI-AE achieved better image reconstructions and biologically plausible estimates for optical parameters, chromophore concentrations, and tissue oxygen saturation compared to traditional methods.

Conclusion: SPOI-AE represents a significant step forward in addressing the nonlinear and ill-posed issues of sPA imaging, demonstrating improved accuracy and biological relevance in chromophore concentration estimation.

Abstract: Accurate estimation of the relative concentrations of chromophores in a spectroscopic photoacoustic (sPA) image can reveal immense structural, functional, and molecular information about physiological processes. However, due to nonlinearities and ill-posedness inherent to sPA imaging, concentration estimation is intractable. The Spectroscopic Photoacoustic Optical Inversion Autoencoder (SPOI-AE) aims to address the sPA optical inversion and spectral unmixing problems without assuming linearity. Herein, SPOI-AE was trained and tested on \textit{in vivo} mouse lymph node sPA images with unknown ground truth chromophore concentrations. SPOI-AE better reconstructs input sPA pixels than conventional algorithms while providing biologically coherent estimates for optical parameters, chromophore concentrations, and the percent oxygen saturation of tissue. SPOI-AE's unmixing accuracy was validated using a simulated mouse lymph node phantom ground truth.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for reward-agnostic exploration in MDPs are limited in accuracy ($ε$), and the gap between upper and lower bounds for reward-free exploration remains unresolved.

Method: The authors propose a novel algorithm using an online learning approach with expertly tailored rewards to design exploration policies, enabling accurate dynamics estimation and computation of $ε$-optimal policies.

Result: Their algorithm significantly relaxes the accuracy requirement $ε$ compared to previous works. Tight lower bounds are also established, closing the exploration gap in reward-free methods.

Conclusion: The paper improves reward-agnostic exploration in MDPs and establishes theoretical bounds in reward-free exploration, advancing understanding in this domain.

Abstract: We study reward-free and reward-agnostic exploration in episodic finite-horizon Markov decision processes (MDPs), where an agent explores an unknown environment without observing external rewards. Reward-free exploration aims to enable $ε$-optimal policies for any reward revealed after exploration, while reward-agnostic exploration targets $ε$-optimality for rewards drawn from a small finite class. In the reward-agnostic setting, Li, Yan, Chen, and Fan achieve minimax sample complexity, but only for restrictively small accuracy parameter $ε$. We propose a new algorithm that significantly relaxes the requirement on $ε$. Our approach is novel and of technical interest by itself. Our algorithm employs an online learning procedure with carefully designed rewards to construct an exploration policy, which is used to gather data sufficient for accurate dynamics estimation and subsequent computation of an $ε$-optimal policy once the reward is revealed. Finally, we establish a tight lower bound for reward-free exploration, closing the gap between known upper and lower bounds.

*Eva Paraschou,Line Harder Clemmensen,Sneha Das*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper addresses bias spillover in large language models (LLMs) and highlights the need for multi-attribute fairness evaluation as mitigating one bias can exacerbate others.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM fairness alignment efforts largely focus on single-attribute biases, often neglecting the multidimensional nature of fairness and leading to potential bias spillover.

Method: The study examines gender alignment effects on fairness across nine sensitive attributes using three state-of-the-art LLMs. It employs Direct Preference Optimization and the BBQ benchmark to assess biases across ambiguous and clear contexts.

Result: The investigation found bias spillover, where improvement in fairness for one attribute led to significant biases in others, especially under ambiguous contexts.

Conclusion: It emphasizes the importance of multi-attribute and context-aware fairness frameworks to comprehensively address bias in LLMs.

Abstract: Conventional large language model (LLM) fairness alignment largely focuses on mitigating bias along single sensitive attributes, overlooking fairness as an inherently multidimensional and context-specific value. This approach risks creating systems that achieve narrow fairness metrics while exacerbating disparities along untargeted attributes, a phenomenon known as bias spillover. While extensively studied in machine learning, bias spillover remains critically underexplored in LLM alignment. In this work, we investigate how targeted gender alignment affects fairness across nine sensitive attributes in three state-of-the-art LLMs (Mistral 7B, Llama 3.1 8B, Qwen 2.5 7B). Using Direct Preference Optimization and the BBQ benchmark, we evaluate fairness under ambiguous and disambiguous contexts. Our findings reveal noticeable bias spillover: while aggregate results show improvements, context-aware analysis exposes significant degradations in ambiguous contexts, particularly for physical appearance ($p< 0.001$ across all models), sexual orientation, and disability status. We demonstrate that improving fairness along one attribute can inadvertently worsen disparities in others under uncertainty, highlighting the necessity of context-aware, multi-attribute fairness evaluation frameworks.

Conclusion: This work establishes benchmarks for energy-efficient event-driven processing and demonstrates the potential of FPGA-based architectures for audio applications, combining performance gains with resource and energy savings.

Abstract: As the volume of data recorded by embedded edge sensors increases, particularly from neuromorphic devices producing discrete event streams, there is a growing need for hardware-aware neural architectures that enable efficient, low-latency, and energy-conscious local processing. We present an FPGA implementation of event-graph neural networks for audio processing. We utilise an artificial cochlea that converts time-series signals into sparse event data, reducing memory and computation costs. Our architecture was implemented on a SoC FPGA and evaluated on two open-source datasets. For classification task, our baseline floating-point model achieves 92.7% accuracy on SHD dataset - only 2.4% below the state of the art - while requiring over 10x and 67x fewer parameters. On SSC, our models achieve 66.9-71.0% accuracy. Compared to FPGA-based spiking neural networks, our quantised model reaches 92.3% accuracy, outperforming them by up to 19.3% while reducing resource usage and latency. For SSC, we report the first hardware-accelerated evaluation. We further demonstrate the first end-to-end FPGA implementation of event-audio keyword spotting, combining graph convolutional layers with recurrent sequence modelling. The system achieves up to 95% word-end detection accuracy, with only 10.53 microsecond latency and 1.18 W power consumption, establishing a strong benchmark for energy-efficient event-driven KWS.

Result: LoRSum matches or surpasses LoRA baselines with manageable computational overhead. It avoids full-matrix SVD, achieves efficiency, and performs well across synthetic tasks, image (CIFAR-100), and language-model fine-tuning benchmarks (GLUE, SQuAD v2, and WikiText-103).

Conclusion: LoRSum improves the computational and memory efficiency of LoRA fine-tuning, bridging gaps in training methods and retaining parameter efficiency while yielding superior or comparable performance.

Abstract: Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) fine-tunes large models by learning low-rank updates on top of frozen weights, dramatically reducing trainable parameters and memory. In this work, we address the gap between training with full steps with low-rank projections (SVDLoRA) and LoRA fine-tuning. We propose LoRSum, a memory-efficient subroutine that closes this gap for gradient descent by casting LoRA optimization as a proximal sub-problem and solving it efficiently with alternating least squares updates, which we prove to be an implicit block power method. We recover several recently proposed preconditioning methods for LoRA as special cases, and show that LoRSum can also be used for updating a low-rank momentum. In order to address full steps with preconditioned gradient descent, we propose a scaled variant of LoRSum that uses structured metrics such as K-FAC and Shampoo, and we show that storing the diagonal of these metrics still allows them to perform well while remaining memory-efficient. Experiments on a synthetic task, CIFAR-100, and language-model fine-tuning on GLUE, SQuAD v2, and WikiText-103, show that our method can match or improve LoRA baselines given modest compute overhead, while avoiding full-matrix SVD projections and retaining LoRA-style parameter efficiency.

*Jung Min Choi,Vijaya Krishna Yalavarthi,Lars Schmidt-Thieme*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces HPMixer, a framework for multivariate time series forecasting that combines decoupled modeling of periodic patterns and residual dynamics, achieving competitive or state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve multivariate time series forecasting by effectively modeling periodic patterns and residual dynamics in a complementary manner.

Method: HPMixer uses a learnable cycle module enhanced by a nonlinear channel-wise MLP for periodicity, alongside LSWT for residuals extracted as stable frequency-domain representations and hierarchical patching for multi-scale modeling.

Result: HPMixer achieves competitive or state-of-the-art results on standard multivariate benchmarks in time series forecasting.

Conclusion: The HPMixer effectively integrates decoupled modeling techniques for periodicity and residuals, providing a robust framework for long-term multivariate time series forecasting.

Abstract: In long-term multivariate time series forecasting, effectively capturing both periodic patterns and residual dynamics is essential. To address this within standard deep learning benchmark settings, we propose the Hierarchical Patching Mixer (HPMixer), which models periodicity and residuals in a decoupled yet complementary manner. The periodic component utilizes a learnable cycle module [7] enhanced with a nonlinear channel-wise MLP for greater expressiveness. The residual component is processed through a Learnable Stationary Wavelet Transform (LSWT) to extract stable, shift-invariant frequency-domain representations. Subsequently, a channel-mixing encoder models explicit inter-channel dependencies, while a two-level non-overlapping hierarchical patching mechanism captures coarse- and fine-scale residual variations. By integrating decoupled periodicity modeling with structured, multi-scale residual learning, HPMixer provides an effective framework. Extensive experiments on standard multivariate benchmarks demonstrate that HPMixer achieves competitive or state-of-the-art performance compared to recent baselines.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The aim is to improve the ability to verify and learn C-RASP programs, which are simplified languages that capture transformer-expressible concepts.

Method: The authors introduce two main contributions: (1) connection of C-RASP verification to synchronous dataflow program checking using optimized model checkers, and (2) a new local search algorithm for learning C-RASP programs from examples.

Result: The proposed methods were tested on C-RASP benchmarks and successfully applied in transformer program optimization and constrained learning tasks.

Conclusion: The developed techniques demonstrate practical applications in optimizing and constraining transformer programs, advancing the field of program verification and learning for C-RASP.

Abstract: C-RASP is a simple programming language that was recently shown to capture concepts expressible by transformers. In this paper, we develop new algorithmic techniques for automatically verifying C-RASPs. To this end, we establish a connection to the verification of synchronous dataflow programs in Lustre, which enables us to exploit state-of-the-art model checkers utilizing highly optimized SMT-solvers. Our second contribution addresses learning a C-RASP program in the first place. To this end, we provide a new algorithm for learning a C-RASP from examples using local search. We demonstrate efficacy of our implementation for benchmarks of C-RASPs in the literature, in particular in connection to the following applications: (1) transformer program optimization, and (2) constrained learning of transformer programs (based on a partial specification).

### [213] [Fast and Scalable Analytical Diffusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16498)
*Xinyi Shang,Peng Sun,Jingyu Lin,Zhiqiang Shen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces GoldDiff, a training-free framework that enhances scalability and efficiency in analytical diffusion models by dynamically pinpointing a 'Golden Subset' during generative modeling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study addresses the major scalability issue in analytical diffusion models, where a full-dataset scan is required for generative modeling, making it computationally prohibitive.

Method: The authors identify 'Posterior Progressive Concentration,' which allows pinpointing a local, dynamic subset ('Golden Subset') for denoising at each timestep, decoupling inference complexity from dataset size. They propose GoldDiff, leveraging a coarse-to-fine mechanism for dynamic retrieval.

Result: GoldDiff achieves a 71x speedup on AFHQ data while maintaining or improving the performance of full-scan methods. It successfully scales analytical diffusion to ImageNet-1K for the first time.

Conclusion: The paper establishes a scalable, training-free framework for large-scale generative modeling, enhancing computational efficiency without compromising performance.

Abstract: Analytical diffusion models offer a mathematically transparent path to generative modeling by formulating the denoising score as an empirical-Bayes posterior mean. However, this interpretability comes at a prohibitive cost: the standard formulation necessitates a full-dataset scan at every timestep, scaling linearly with dataset size. In this work, we present the first systematic study addressing this scalability bottleneck. We challenge the prevailing assumption that the entire training data is necessary, uncovering the phenomenon of Posterior Progressive Concentration: the effective golden support of the denoising score is not static but shrinks asymptotically from the global manifold to a local neighborhood as the signal-to-noise ratio increases. Capitalizing on this, we propose Dynamic Time-Aware Golden Subset Diffusion (GoldDiff), a training-free framework that decouples inference complexity from dataset size. Instead of static retrieval, GoldDiff uses a coarse-to-fine mechanism to dynamically pinpoint the ''Golden Subset'' for inference. Theoretically, we derive rigorous bounds guaranteeing that our sparse approximation converges to the exact score. Empirically, GoldDiff achieves a $\bf 71 \times$ speedup on AFHQ while matching or achieving even better performance than full-scan baselines. Most notably, we demonstrate the first successful scaling of analytical diffusion to ImageNet-1K, unlocking a scalable, training-free paradigm for large-scale generative modeling.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Conditionally Additive Local Models (CALMs), which aim to improve the balance between interpretability and accuracy compared to existing GAMs and GA$^2$Ms by considering locally additive effects in input feature regions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of GAMs in underfitting due to the lack of interactions and the interpretability-sacrificing nature of GA$^2$Ms to improve accuracy.

Method: CALMs allow multiple univariate shape functions per feature activated in different regions defined by thresholds on interacting features, ensuring local additivity. A new training pipeline is proposed to identify homogeneous regions and fit shape functions using region-aware backfitting.

Result: CALMs perform better than GAMs in accuracy and match the performance of GA$^2$Ms, demonstrating effectiveness in diverse classification and regression tasks.

Conclusion: CALMs achieve a strong balance between predictive accuracy and interpretability, presenting as a promising alternative to current methods like GAMs and GA$^2$Ms.

Abstract: Generalized additive models (GAMs) offer interpretability through independent univariate feature effects but underfit when interactions are present in data. GA$^2$Ms add selected pairwise interactions which improves accuracy, but sacrifices interpretability and limits model auditing. We propose \emph{Conditionally Additive Local Models} (CALMs), a new model class, that balances the interpretability of GAMs with the accuracy of GA$^2$Ms. CALMs allow multiple univariate shape functions per feature, each active in different regions of the input space. These regions are defined independently for each feature as simple logical conditions (thresholds) on the features it interacts with. As a result, effects remain locally additive while varying across subregions to capture interactions. We further propose a principled distillation-based training pipeline that identifies homogeneous regions with limited interactions and fits interpretable shape functions via region-aware backfitting. Experiments on diverse classification and regression tasks show that CALMs consistently outperform GAMs and achieve accuracy comparable with GA$^2$Ms. Overall, CALMs offer a compelling trade-off between predictive accuracy and interpretability.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores the impact of loss functions on deep learning models for LC-MS/MS data analysis, revealing inherent trade-offs and providing theoretical insights.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the poorly understood impact of loss functions on model performance in analyzing LC-MS/MS spectra using deep learning.

Method: The authors investigate loss functions through theoretical analysis, deriving regret bounds to showcase trade-offs between fingerprint prediction accuracy and molecular retrieval performance.

Result: The study identifies a trade-off between optimizing for fingerprint similarity and molecular retrieval, dependent on the similarity structure of candidate sets.

Conclusion: The paper offers guidance on selecting loss functions and molecular fingerprints by uncovering theoretical insights into the trade-offs between key modeling objectives.

Abstract: One of the central challenges in the computational analysis of liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) data is to identify the compounds underlying the output spectra. In recent years, this problem is increasingly tackled using deep learning methods. A common strategy involves predicting a molecular fingerprint vector from an input mass spectrum, which is then used to search for matches in a chemical compound database. While various loss functions are employed in training these predictive models, their impact on model performance remains poorly understood. In this study, we investigate commonly used loss functions, deriving novel regret bounds that characterize when Bayes-optimal decisions for these objectives must diverge. Our results reveal a fundamental trade-off between the two objectives of (1) fingerprint similarity and (2) molecular retrieval. Optimizing for more accurate fingerprint predictions typically worsens retrieval results, and vice versa. Our theoretical analysis shows this trade-off depends on the similarity structure of candidate sets, providing guidance for loss function and fingerprint selection.

*Gerhard Stenzel,Isabella Debelic,Michael Kölle,Tobias Rohe,Leo Sünkel,Julian Hager,Claudia Linnhoff-Popien*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper enhances directed quantum circuit synthesis (DQCS) with reinforcement learning to include continuous single-qubit rotations, comparing one-stage and two-stage training approaches. Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) proves more effective than Advantage Actor-Critic (A2C) while scaling remains a challenge for higher complexities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to improve quantum circuit synthesis by integrating parameterized quantum state preparation for better performance and scalability, addressing the limitations of discrete gate selection in current methods.

Method: The study explores reinforcement learning-based approaches—one-stage PPO, which selects gate type, qubit(s), and rotation angle simultaneously, and a two-stage method that optimizes discrete circuits' rotation angles using Adam optimization with parameter-shift gradients.

Result: Experimental evaluations demonstrate PPO's superior performance over A2C in both one-stage and two-stage methods. Scalability is limited as complexity increases, with the one-stage PPO policy being more practical and computationally efficient.

Conclusion: For practical applications with limited computing resources, the one-stage PPO method is recommended due to its balance between success rate and computational cost, although scalability to higher complexities remains a key challenge.

Abstract: We extend directed quantum circuit synthesis (DQCS) with reinforcement learning from purely discrete gate selection to parameterized quantum state preparation with continuous single-qubit rotations \(R_x\), \(R_y\), and \(R_z\). We compare two training regimes: a one-stage agent that jointly selects the gate type, the affected qubit(s), and the rotation angle; and a two-stage variant that first proposes a discrete circuit and subsequently optimizes the rotation angles with Adam using parameter-shift gradients. Using Gymnasium and PennyLane, we evaluate Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) and Advantage Actor--Critic (A2C) on systems comprising two to ten qubits and on targets of increasing complexity with \(λ\) ranging from one to five. Whereas A2C does not learn effective policies in this setting, PPO succeeds under stable hyperparameters (one-stage: learning rate approximately \(5\times10^{-4}\) with a self-fidelity-error threshold of 0.01; two-stage: learning rate approximately \(10^{-4}\)). Both approaches reliably reconstruct computational basis states (between 83\% and 99\% success) and Bell states (between 61\% and 77\% success). However, scalability saturates for \(λ\) of approximately three to four and does not extend to ten-qubit targets even at \(λ=2\). The two-stage method offers only marginal accuracy gains while requiring around three times the runtime. For practicality under a fixed compute budget, we therefore recommend the one-stage PPO policy, provide explicit synthesized circuits, and contrast with a classical variational baseline to outline avenues for improved scalability.

*Shafagh Abband Pashaki,Sepehr Maleki,Amir Badiee*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes an incentive-based demand response approach for residential smart grids to reduce peak demand and encourage energy consumption shifts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address electricity grid congestion and capacity constraints through a user-centered approach, leveraging financial incentives.

Method: A hierarchical framework with a service provider setting real-time incentive rates using deep reinforcement learning, considering wholesale prices, residential load, and user preferences.

Result: The approach achieved a 22.82% reduction in the peak-to-average ratio in simulations, effectively smoothing energy demand from real-world consumption data.

Conclusion: The proposed method demonstrates the effectiveness of incentives and adaptive learning in optimizing energy consumption patterns and enhancing grid efficiency.

Abstract: This paper presents a capacity-constrained incentive-based demand response approach for residential smart grids. It aims to maintain electricity grid capacity limits and prevent congestion by financially incentivising end users to reduce or shift their energy consumption. The proposed framework adopts a hierarchical architecture in which a service provider adjusts hourly incentive rates based on wholesale electricity prices and aggregated residential load. The financial interests of both the service provider and end users are explicitly considered. A deep reinforcement learning approach is employed to learn optimal real-time incentive rates under explicit capacity constraints. Heterogeneous user preferences are modelled through appliance-level home energy management systems and dissatisfaction costs. Using real-world residential electricity consumption and price data from three households, simulation results show that the proposed approach effectively reduces peak demand and smooths the aggregated load profile. This leads to an approximately 22.82% reduction in the peak-to-average ratio compared to the no-demand-response case.

TL;DR: Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) have limitations like high computational costs and slow convergence. FEKAN improves upon them by introducing feature enrichment, enhancing efficiency and accuracy without extra parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: KANs offer interpretability but face practical challenges due to computational inefficiency and slow convergence, limiting their adoption.

Method: The paper introduces Feature-Enriched Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (FEKANs), which enrich features to improve computational efficiency and convergence, tested across various benchmarks.

Result: FEKAN exhibits faster convergence and better approximation accuracy than traditional KAN variants across diverse tasks like function approximation, PDE modeling, and neural operator settings.

Conclusion: FEKAN enhances KAN's performance by increasing representation capacity, accelerating convergence, and reducing computational overhead while maintaining interpretability.

Abstract: Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) have recently emerged as a compelling alternative to multilayer perceptrons, offering enhanced interpretability via functional decomposition. However, existing KAN architectures, including spline-, wavelet-, radial-basis variants, etc., suffer from high computational cost and slow convergence, limiting scalability and practical applicability. Here, we introduce Feature-Enriched Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (FEKAN), a simple yet effective extension that preserves all the advantages of KAN while improving computational efficiency and predictive accuracy through feature enrichment, without increasing the number of trainable parameters. By incorporating these additional features, FEKAN accelerates convergence, increases representation capacity, and substantially mitigates the computational overhead characteristic of state-of-the-art KAN architectures. We investigate FEKAN across a comprehensive set of benchmarks, including function-approximation tasks, physics-informed formulations for diverse partial differential equations (PDEs), and neural operator settings that map between input and output function spaces. For function approximation, we systematically compare FEKAN against a broad family of KAN variants, FastKAN, WavKAN, ReLUKAN, HRKAN, ChebyshevKAN, RBFKAN, and the original SplineKAN. Across all tasks, FEKAN demonstrates substantially faster convergence and consistently higher approximation accuracy than the underlying baseline architectures. We also establish the theoretical foundations for FEKAN, showing its superior representation capacity compared to KAN, which contributes to improved accuracy and efficiency.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper investigates transfer learning for linear regression using overparameterized pre-trained models and proposes debiasing to optimize use.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in transfer learning with overparameterized pre-trained models, particularly issues arising from overparameterization bias in high-dimensional parameter spaces.

Method: They formulate the target learning task with a squared error minimization approach, including penalties for deviating from pre-trained models, and analytically derive the test error and propose a debiasing correction factor.

Result: Shows that using more pre-trained models in transfer learning can be beneficial if overparameterization issues are managed; demonstrates the efficacy of debiasing for robust target learning.

Conclusion: Managing overparameterization bias is essential for improving transfer learning performance when using numerous pre-trained models, and their method provides a solution through debiasing.

Abstract: We study transfer learning for a linear regression task using several least-squares pretrained models that can be overparameterized.
  We formulate the target learning task as optimization that minimizes squared errors on the target dataset with penalty on the distance of the learned model from the pretrained models. We analytically formulate the test error of the learned target model and provide the corresponding empirical evaluations.
  Our results elucidate when using more pretrained models can improve transfer learning. Specifically, if the pretrained models are overparameterized, using sufficiently many of them is important for beneficial transfer learning. However, the learning may be compromised by overparameterization bias of pretrained models, i.e., the minimum $\ell_2$-norm solution's restriction to a small subspace spanned by the training examples in the high-dimensional parameter space. We propose a simple debiasing via multiplicative correction factor that can reduce the overparameterization bias and leverage more pretrained models to learn a target predictor.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a framework for adversarial attacks targeting Safe RL policies, specifically addressing the lack of gradient access and safety constraints in adversarial settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Safe RL methods often assume benign environments, thereby leaving policies vulnerable to adversarial perturbations in real-world applications.

Method: The framework learns a constraint model and surrogate policy from expert demonstrations and black-box interactions, enabling gradient optimization without internal gradient access or accurate safety constraints.

Result: The proposed approach effectively identifies vulnerabilities in Safe RL policies, supported by theoretical derivations and experimental validation on benchmarks.

Conclusion: The framework successfully exposes flaws in Safe RL policies under adversarial conditions, demonstrating potential improvement areas for safety and robustness considerations.

Abstract: Safe reinforcement learning (Safe RL) aims to ensure policy performance while satisfying safety constraints. However, most existing Safe RL methods assume benign environments, making them vulnerable to adversarial perturbations commonly encountered in real-world settings. In addition, existing gradient-based adversarial attacks typically require access to the policy's gradient information, which is often impractical in real-world scenarios. To address these challenges, we propose an adversarial attack framework to reveal vulnerabilities of Safe RL policies. Using expert demonstrations and black-box environment interaction, our framework learns a constraint model and a surrogate (learner) policy, enabling gradient-based attack optimization without requiring the victim policy's internal gradients or the ground-truth safety constraints. We further provide theoretical analysis establishing feasibility and deriving perturbation bounds. Experiments on multiple Safe RL benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach under limited privileged access.

*Tianmeng Hu,Yongzheng Cui,Biao Luo,Ke Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces RIDER, a framework for RNA 3D structure inverse design using reinforcement learning. RIDER achieves substantial improvements in structural similarity while discovering distinct designs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Recent RNA design methods focus on native sequence recovery, which doesn't fully ensure correct folding into 3D structures. A system directly optimizing for structural fidelity is needed.

Method: The authors developed RIDER, combining a generative diffusion model pre-trained for RNA structure prediction and fine-tuned via reinforcement learning based on 3D self-consistency metrics.

Result: RIDER achieves a 9% improvement in native sequence recovery and over 100% improvement in 3D structural similarity across all metrics.

Conclusion: RIDER advances RNA design by directly optimizing for 3D structure, outperforming existing methods in both fidelity and sequence diversity.

Abstract: The inverse design of RNA three-dimensional (3D) structures is crucial for engineering functional RNAs in synthetic biology and therapeutics. While recent deep learning approaches have advanced this field, they are typically optimized and evaluated using native sequence recovery, which is a limited surrogate for structural fidelity, since different sequences can fold into similar 3D structures and high recovery does not necessarily indicate correct folding. To address this limitation, we propose RIDER, an RNA Inverse DEsign framework with Reinforcement learning that directly optimizes for 3D structural similarity. First, we develop and pre-train a GNN-based generative diffusion model conditioned on the target 3D structure, achieving a 9% improvement in native sequence recovery over state-of-the-art methods. Then, we fine-tune the model with an improved policy gradient algorithm using four task-specific reward functions based on 3D self-consistency metrics. Experimental results show that RIDER improves structural similarity by over 100% across all metrics and discovers designs that are distinct from native sequences.

TL;DR: The paper investigates the impact of parameter sharing in Variational Quantum Circuits (VQCs) and highlights how it creates deceptive optimization landscapes that mislead classical optimizers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how parameter sharing in VQCs affects their optimization landscape and performance due to deceptive gradient regions.

Method: Through experimental analysis, the authors explore the effects of parameter sharing, develop a gradient deceptiveness detection algorithm, and propose a framework to measure optimization difficulty.

Result: Parameter sharing enhances expressivity but increases solution landscape deceptiveness, degrading optimizer performance unless hyperparameters are tuned effectively.

Conclusion: While parameter sharing offers benefits for expressivity, it challenges traditional classical optimizers, suggesting the need for more advanced optimization strategies in quantum circuit designs.

Abstract: Variational Quantum Circuits (VQCs) have emerged as a promising paradigm for quantum machine learning in the NISQ era. While parameter sharing in VQCs can reduce the parameter space dimensionality and potentially mitigate the barren plateau phenomenon, it introduces a complex trade-off that has been largely overlooked. This paper investigates how parameter sharing, despite creating better global optima with fewer parameters, fundamentally alters the optimization landscape through deceptive gradients -- regions where gradient information exists but systematically misleads optimizers away from global optima. Through systematic experimental analysis, we demonstrate that increasing degrees of parameter sharing generate more complex solution landscapes with heightened gradient magnitudes and measurably higher deceptiveness ratios. Our findings reveal that traditional gradient-based optimizers (Adam, SGD) show progressively degraded convergence as parameter sharing increases, with performance heavily dependent on hyperparameter selection. We introduce a novel gradient deceptiveness detection algorithm and a quantitative framework for measuring optimization difficulty in quantum circuits, establishing that while parameter sharing can improve circuit expressivity by orders of magnitude, this comes at the cost of significantly increased landscape deceptiveness. These insights provide important considerations for quantum circuit design in practical applications, highlighting the fundamental mismatch between classical optimization strategies and quantum parameter landscapes shaped by parameter sharing.

Motivation: To address the inefficiency of multi-agent reinforcement learning on large-scale network environments by implementing scalable, efficient decision-making mechanisms.

Method: MetaDOAR incorporates state projection via structural embeddings, top-k device selection, beam search, and Q-value caching to reduce computation and optimize decisions in large networks.

Result: MetaDOAR achieves better payoffs than state-of-the-art baselines on large network environments without memory or training scalability issues.

Conclusion: MetaDOAR demonstrates a practical and efficient hierarchical policy learning framework for complex, large-scale network decision-making tasks.

Abstract: We introduce MetaDOAR, a lightweight meta-controller that augments the Double Oracle / PSRO paradigm with a learned, partition-aware filtering layer and Q-value caching to enable scalable multi-agent reinforcement learning on very large cyber-network environments. MetaDOAR learns a compact state projection from per node structural embeddings to rapidly score and select a small subset of devices (a top-k partition) on which a conventional low-level actor performs focused beam search utilizing a critic agent. Selected candidate actions are evaluated with batched critic forwards and stored in an LRU cache keyed by a quantized state projection and local action identifiers, dramatically reducing redundant critic computation while preserving decision quality via conservative k-hop cache invalidation. Empirically, MetaDOAR attains higher player payoffs than SOTA baselines on large network topologies, without significant scaling issues in terms of memory usage or training time. This contribution provide a practical, theoretically motivated path to efficient hierarchical policy learning for large-scale networked decision problems.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores the computational feasibility of sampling from a diffusion model biased by a reward function and provides algorithms for specific cases, while identifying intractable scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of understanding and efficiency in inference-time algorithms used for sampling and reasoning tasks, especially when using pre-trained models with reward-based transformations.

Method: Analyzed the tractability of reward-tilted diffusion models for quadratic rewards. Proposed efficient algorithms for specific cases (low-rank positive-definite quadratic tilts) using the Hubbard-Stratonovich transform and highlighted intractability in others (negative-definite tilts with high-magnitude matrices).

Result: Developed an efficient sampling algorithm for low-rank positive-definite quadratic tilts and identified that sampling with negative-definite tilts is intractable even for certain low-rank matrices.

Conclusion: This work advances the theoretical framework for using reward-tilted diffusion models in inference-time algorithms, shedding light on their computational limits and providing new efficient methods for sampling.

Abstract: Inference-time algorithms are an emerging paradigm in which pre-trained models are used as subroutines to solve downstream tasks. Such algorithms have been proposed for tasks ranging from inverse problems and guided image generation to reasoning. However, the methods currently deployed in practice are heuristics with a variety of failure modes -- and we have very little understanding of when these heuristics can be efficiently improved.
  In this paper, we consider the task of sampling from a reward-tilted diffusion model -- that is, sampling from $p^{\star}(x) \propto p(x) \exp(r(x))$ -- given a reward function $r$ and pre-trained diffusion oracle for $p$. We provide a fine-grained analysis of the computational tractability of this task for quadratic rewards $r(x) = x^\top A x + b^\top x$. We show that linear-reward tilts are always efficiently sampleable -- a simple result that seems to have gone unnoticed in the literature. We use this as a building block, along with a conceptually new ingredient -- the Hubbard-Stratonovich transform -- to provide an efficient algorithm for sampling from low-rank positive-definite quadratic tilts, i.e. $r(x) = x^\top A x$ where $A$ is positive-definite and of rank $O(1)$. For negative-definite tilts, i.e. $r(x) = - x^\top A x$ where $A$ is positive-definite, we prove that the problem is intractable even if $A$ is of rank 1 (albeit with exponentially-large entries).

Motivation: To address the challenges of optimizing urban transportation routing and congestion management through accurate forecasting of spatial and temporal demands in shared mobility.

Method: Introduces two gradient boosting model variations: classification-based and regression-based, integrating temporal and contextual features. Real-world datasets from five metropolitan areas are used for evaluation against state-of-the-art methods and a Generative AI-based model.

Result: The proposed approach demonstrates superior performance in forecasting shared mobility demand patterns, illustrating its effectiveness in improving modern urban transportation systems.

Conclusion: The methodology contributes to sustainable and efficient urban micro-mobility management by offering advanced forecasting techniques, aiding in tackling challenges from rapid urbanization and enhancing city livability.

Abstract: Urban demand forecasting plays a critical role in optimizing routing, dispatching, and congestion management within Intelligent Transportation Systems. By leveraging data fusion and analytics techniques, traffic demand forecasting serves as a key intermediate measure for identifying emerging spatial and temporal demand patterns. In this paper, we tackle this challenge by proposing two gradient boosting model variations, one for classiffication and one for regression, both capable of generating demand forecasts at various temporal horizons, from 5 minutes up to one hour. Our overall approach effectively integrates temporal and contextual features, enabling accurate predictions that are essential for improving the efficiency of shared (micro-) mobility services. To evaluate its effectiveness, we utilize open shared mobility data derived from e-scooter and e-bike networks in five metropolitan areas. These real-world datasets allow us to compare our approach with state-of-the-art methods as well as a Generative AI-based model, demonstrating its effectiveness in capturing the complexities of modern urban mobility. Ultimately, our methodology offers novel insights on urban micro-mobility management, helping to tackle the challenges arising from rapid urbanization and thus, contributing to more sustainable, efficient, and livable cities.

*Maria Luisa Taccari,Kenza Tazi,Oisín M. Morrison,Andreas Grafberger,Juan Colonese,Corentin Carton de Wiart,Christel Prudhomme,Cinzia Mazzetti,Matthew Chantry,Florian Pappenberger*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper presents a novel deterministic LSTM-based model, AIFL, aimed at improving global daily streamflow forecasting through a two-stage training strategy addressing domain shifts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current data-driven models for streamflow forecasting suffer from performance issues when transitioning from historical reanalysis data to operational forecasting. This gap hinders effective flood preparedness and water resource management.

Method: AIFL employs a two-stage training approach: pre-training on 40 years of ERA5-Land reanalysis data to understand hydrological processes and fine-tuning on operational forecasts to adapt to real-world forecasting biases.

Result: AIFL achieved high predictive performance, with a median modified Kling-Gupta Efficiency (KGE') of 0.66 and a median Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency (NSE) of 0.53, proving competitive with global state-of-the-art systems.

Conclusion: The model provides a reliable, reproducible, and transparent solution for global streamflow forecasting, excelling in extreme-event detection and offering a robust baseline for operational hydrology.

Abstract: Reliable global streamflow forecasting is essential for flood preparedness and water resource management, yet data-driven models often suffer from a performance gap when transitioning from historical reanalysis to operational forecast products. This paper introduces AIFL (Artificial Intelligence for Floods), a deterministic LSTM-based model designed for global daily streamflow forecasting. Trained on 18,588 basins curated from the CARAVAN dataset, AIFL utilises a novel two-stage training strategy to bridge the reanalysis-to-forecast domain shift. The model is first pre-trained on 40 years of ERA5-Land reanalysis (1980-2019) to capture robust hydrological processes, then fine-tuned on operational Integrated Forecasting System (IFS) control forecasts (2016-2019) to adapt to the specific error structures and biases of operational numerical weather prediction. To our knowledge, this is the first global model trained end-to-end within the CARAVAN ecosystem. On an independent temporal test set (2021-2024), AIFL achieves high predictive skill with a median modified Kling-Gupta Efficiency (KGE') of 0.66 and a median Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency (NSE) of 0.53. Benchmarking results show that AIFL is highly competitive with current state-of-the-art global systems, achieving comparable accuracy while maintaining a transparent and reproducible forcing pipeline. The model demonstrates exceptional reliability in extreme-event detection, providing a streamlined and operationally robust baseline for the global hydrological community.

### [227] [Predicting The Cop Number Using Machine Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16600)
*Meagan Mann,Christian Muise,Erin Meger*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper explores using machine learning (ML) and graph neural networks (GNNs) to predict the cop number of graphs, achieving high accuracy and aligning results with theoretical insights.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Determining the cop number of graphs is computationally challenging, requiring alternative approaches for approximations and insights.

Method: The authors employ classical machine learning models (e.g., tree-based) and graph neural networks to predict the cop number based on structural graph properties. They also analyze feature importance related to these predictions.

Result: Tree-based ML models accurately predicted the cop number, even with class imbalance, while GNNs performed similarly without explicit feature engineering. Key predictive features include node connectivity and clustering, consistent with theoretical results.

Conclusion: Machine learning can complement existing cop number algorithms by providing scalable approximations when exact computation is impractical.

Abstract: Cops and Robbers is a pursuit evasion game played on a graph, first introduced independently by Quilliot \cite{quilliot1978jeux} and Nowakowski and Winkler \cite{NOWAKOWSKI1983235} over four decades ago. A main interest in recent the literature is identifying the cop number of graph families. The cop number of a graph, $c(G)$, is defined as the minimum number of cops required to guarantee capture of the robber. Determining the cop number is computationally difficult and exact algorithms for this are typically restricted to small graph families. This paper investigates whether classical machine learning methods and graph neural networks can accurately predict a graph's cop number from its structural properties and identify which properties most strongly influence this prediction. Of the classical machine learning models, tree-based models achieve high accuracy in prediction despite class imbalance, whereas graph neural networks achieve comparable results without explicit feature engineering. The interpretability analysis shows that the most predictive features are related to node connectivity, clustering, clique structure, and width parameters, which aligns with known theoretical results. Our findings suggest that machine learning approaches can be used in complement with existing cop number algorithms by offering scalable approximations where computation is infeasible.

### [228] [Almost Sure Convergence of Differential Temporal Difference Learning for Average Reward Markov Decision Processes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16629)
*Ethan Blaser,Jiuqi Wang,Shangtong Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper improves the theoretical guarantees for differential temporal difference (TD) learning in average reward reinforcement learning (RL) by removing the need for a local clock and proving its convergence under practical learning conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the gap between theoretical guarantees and practical implementations of differential TD algorithms in average reward RL, as existing methods require state visit count-based learning rates, which are impractical and limited to tabular settings.

Method: The research proves the almost sure convergence of on-policy $n$-step differential TD with standard diminishing learning rates and establishes three sufficient conditions for off-policy $n$-step differential TD to converge without a local clock.

Result: The study demonstrates the convergence of both on-policy and off-policy $n$-step differential TD algorithms under standard learning rates without requiring a local clock tied to state visits.

Conclusion: The work strengthens the theoretical foundation of differential TD methods, expanding their utility in practical RL applications beyond tabular settings and ensuring that they align better with real-world implementation practices.

Abstract: The average reward is a fundamental performance metric in reinforcement learning (RL) focusing on the long-run performance of an agent. Differential temporal difference (TD) learning algorithms are a major advance for average reward RL as they provide an efficient online method to learn the value functions associated with the average reward in both on-policy and off-policy settings. However, existing convergence guarantees require a local clock in learning rates tied to state visit counts, which practitioners do not use and does not extend beyond tabular settings. We address this limitation by proving the almost sure convergence of on-policy $n$-step differential TD for any $n$ using standard diminishing learning rates without a local clock. We then derive three sufficient conditions under which off-policy $n$-step differential TD also converges without a local clock. These results strengthen the theoretical foundations of differential TD and bring its convergence analysis closer to practical implementations.

### [229] [Optimizer choice matters for the emergence of Neural Collapse](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16642)
*Jim Zhao,Tin Sum Cheng,Wojciech Masarczyk,Aurelien Lucchi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Neural Collapse (NC), a structured pattern in deep neural networks during training, is shown to depend on the choice of optimizer and not universal across all methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To challenge the assumption that Neural Collapse emerges independent of the optimizer and to highlight its dependency on specific optimization techniques.

Method: Introduced a novel metric (NC0) to analyze NC, conducted both theoretical analysis indicating the effect of optimizer and weight decay coupling, and validated findings with 3,900 empirical runs.

Result: Theoretical and empirical evidence shows NC is shaped by optimizer characteristics, especially weight decay coupling, and momentum accelerates NC dynamics in SGD.

Conclusion: Optimizer choice critically influences the emergence of NC, underscoring the need to consider weight-decay coupling in shaping optimizer behavior and implicit neural biases.

Abstract: Neural Collapse (NC) refers to the emergence of highly symmetric geometric structures in the representations of deep neural networks during the terminal phase of training. Despite its prevalence, the theoretical understanding of NC remains limited. Existing analyses largely ignore the role of the optimizer, thereby suggesting that NC is universal across optimization methods. In this work, we challenge this assumption and demonstrate that the choice of optimizer plays a critical role in the emergence of NC. The phenomenon is typically quantified through NC metrics, which, however, are difficult to track and analyze theoretically. To overcome this limitation, we introduce a novel diagnostic metric, NC0, whose convergence to zero is a necessary condition for NC. Using NC0, we provide theoretical evidence that NC cannot emerge under decoupled weight decay in adaptive optimizers, as implemented in AdamW. Concretely, we prove that SGD, SignGD with coupled weight decay (a special case of Adam), and SignGD with decoupled weight decay (a special case of AdamW) exhibit qualitatively different NC0 dynamics. Also, we show the accelerating effect of momentum on NC (beyond convergence of train loss) when trained with SGD, being the first result concerning momentum in the context of NC. Finally, we conduct extensive empirical experiments consisting of 3,900 training runs across various datasets, architectures, optimizers, and hyperparameters, confirming our theoretical results. This work provides the first theoretical explanation for optimizer-dependent emergence of NC and highlights the overlooked role of weight-decay coupling in shaping the implicit biases of optimizers.

### [230] [Factorization Machine with Quadratic-Optimization Annealing for RNA Inverse Folding and Evaluation of Binary-Integer Encoding and Nucleotide Assignment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16643)
*Shuta Kikuchi,Shu Tanaka*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes a novel approach using a factorization machine with quadratic-optimization annealing (FMQA) for solving RNA inverse folding, focusing on nucleotide encoding to improve solution quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the RNA inverse folding problem by creating an efficient method requiring fewer sequence evaluations, especially when experimental validations are resource-limited.

Method: The method involves applying FMQA, a black-box optimization method, to RNA inverse folding, while analyzing the impact of nucleotide encoding and integer-to-nucleotide assignments on solution quality.

Result: Results show one-hot and domain-wall encodings outperform binary and unary encodings, and specific nucleotide assignments improve thermodynamic stability of secondary structures.

Conclusion: Encoding choices and nucleotide assignments in FMQA significantly affect RNA inverse folding. Domain-wall encoding and strategic nucleotide placement lead to better and stable RNA structure predictions.

Abstract: The RNA inverse folding problem aims to identify nucleotide sequences that preferentially adopt a given target secondary structure. While various heuristic and machine learning-based approaches have been proposed, many require a large number of sequence evaluations, which limits their applicability when experimental validation is costly. We propose a method to solve the problem using a factorization machine with quadratic-optimization annealing (FMQA). FMQA is a discrete black-box optimization method reported to obtain high-quality solutions with a limited number of evaluations. Applying FMQA to the problem requires converting nucleotides into binary variables. However, the influence of integer-to-nucleotide assignments and binary-integer encoding on the performance of FMQA has not been thoroughly investigated, even though such choices determine the structure of the surrogate model and the search landscape, and thus can directly affect solution quality. Therefore, this study aims both to establish a novel FMQA framework for RNA inverse folding and to analyze the effects of these assignments and encoding methods. We evaluated all 24 possible assignments of the four nucleotides to the ordered integers (0-3), in combination with four binary-integer encoding methods. Our results demonstrated that one-hot and domain-wall encodings outperform binary and unary encodings in terms of the normalized ensemble defect value. In domain-wall encoding, nucleotides assigned to the boundary integers (0 and 3) appeared with higher frequency. In the RNA inverse folding problem, assigning guanine and cytosine to these boundary integers promoted their enrichment in stem regions, which led to more thermodynamically stable secondary structures than those obtained with one-hot encoding.

### [231] [Neighborhood Stability as a Measure of Nearest Neighbor Searchability](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16673)
*Thomas Vecchiato,Sebastian Bruch*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces two measures to evaluate the suitability of clustering-based Approximate Nearest Neighbor Search (ANNS) methods for a dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There was a lack of analytical tools to determine if clustering-based ANNS methods were suitable for a given dataset.

Method: Two measures, clustering-NSM for clustering quality and point-NSM for clusterability, are introduced to analyze and predict the effectiveness of clustering-based ANNS methods.

Result: The measures can evaluate 'searchability' of high-dimensional points in Euclidean space based on nearest neighbor relationships.

Conclusion: These measures enable assessing dataset searchability without relying on distances, broadening applicability across various distance functions.

Abstract: Clustering-based Approximate Nearest Neighbor Search (ANNS) organizes a set of points into partitions, and searches only a few of them to find the nearest neighbors of a query. Despite its popularity, there are virtually no analytical tools to determine the suitability of clustering-based ANNS for a given dataset -- what we call "searchability." To address that gap, we present two measures for flat clusterings of high-dimensional points in Euclidean space. First is Clustering-Neighborhood Stability Measure (clustering-NSM), an internal measure of clustering quality -- a function of a clustering of a dataset -- that we show to be predictive of ANNS accuracy. The second, Point-Neighborhood Stability Measure (point-NSM), is a measure of clusterability -- a function of the dataset itself -- that is predictive of clustering-NSM. The two together allow us to determine whether a dataset is searchable by clustering-based ANNS given only the data points. Importantly, both are functions of nearest neighbor relationships between points, not distances, making them applicable to various distance functions including inner product.

### [232] [Retrieval-Augmented Foundation Models for Matched Molecular Pair Transformations to Recapitulate Medicinal Chemistry Intuition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16684)
*Bo Pan,Peter Zhiping Zhang,Hao-Wei Pang,Alex Zhu,Xiang Yu,Liying Zhang,Liang Zhao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper presents a novel approach to analog generation using Matched Molecular Pair Transformations (MMPTs), enabling better diversity, novelty, and controllability in designing chemical compounds.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional analog generation either lacks edit controllability at the molecular level or depends on small models and restricted settings, limiting their practical applicability in medicinal chemistry.

Method: The authors propose a variable-to-variable formulation for analog generation, train a foundation model on large-scale MMPTs, and develop prompting mechanisms for user control. They further introduce MMPT-RAG, a retrieval-augmented framework incorporating external references for improved analog generation.

Result: Experiments demonstrate enhanced diversity, novelty, and controllability alongside improved recovery of realistic analog structures in both general chemical and patent-specific datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed method broadens the applicability of analog generation, offering better molecular transformations and practical usability for real-world medicinal chemistry discovery tasks.

Abstract: Matched molecular pairs (MMPs) capture the local chemical edits that medicinal chemists routinely use to design analogs, but existing ML approaches either operate at the whole-molecule level with limited edit controllability or learn MMP-style edits from restricted settings and small models. We propose a variable-to-variable formulation of analog generation and train a foundation model on large-scale MMP transformations (MMPTs) to generate diverse variables conditioned on an input variable. To enable practical control, we develop prompting mechanisms that let the users specify preferred transformation patterns during generation. We further introduce MMPT-RAG, a retrieval-augmented framework that uses external reference analogs as contextual guidance to steer generation and generalize from project-specific series. Experiments on general chemical corpora and patent-specific datasets demonstrate improved diversity, novelty, and controllability, and show that our method recovers realistic analog structures in practical discovery scenarios.

*Aloni Cohen,Refael Kohen,Kobbi Nissim,Uri Stemmer*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper identifies privacy risks in machine unlearning and proposes a new security definition to protect undeleted data from leakage due to deletions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address privacy risks in machine unlearning, particularly how the process can inadvertently leak information about undeleted data when striving for 'perfect retraining.'

Method: The authors present a reconstruction attack to highlight privacy vulnerabilities and propose a new security definition that focuses on safeguarding undeleted data from such risks.

Result: They demonstrate potential risks in existing machine unlearning practices and outline how their new security definition allows essential functionalities like summation and statistical learning while mitigating privacy concerns.

Conclusion: Current machine unlearning practices have privacy flaws, but the proposed security framework offers a way to maintain both privacy and essential model functionalities.

Abstract: Machine unlearning aims to remove specific data points from a trained model, often striving to emulate "perfect retraining", i.e., producing the model that would have been obtained had the deleted data never been included. We demonstrate that this approach, and security definitions that enable it, carry significant privacy risks for the remaining (undeleted) data points. We present a reconstruction attack showing that for certain tasks, which can be computed securely without deletions, a mechanism adhering to perfect retraining allows an adversary controlling merely $ω(1)$ data points to reconstruct almost the entire dataset merely by issuing deletion requests. We survey existing definitions for machine unlearning, showing they are either susceptible to such attacks or too restrictive to support basic functionalities like exact summation. To address this problem, we propose a new security definition that specifically safeguards undeleted data against leakage caused by the deletion of other points. We show that our definition permits several essential functionalities, such as bulletin boards, summations, and statistical learning.

### [234] [Causality is Key for Interpretability Claims to Generalise](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16698)
*Shruti Joshi,Aaron Mueller,David Klindt,Wieland Brendel,Patrik Reizinger,Dhanya Sridhar*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper critiques current pitfalls in interpretability research for large language models (LLMs) and proposes a diagnostic framework based on causal reasoning and Pearl’s causal hierarchy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the ongoing challenges with non-generalizable findings and unsupported causal claims prevalent in interpretability studies of LLMs.

Method: The paper employs Pearl's causal hierarchy, focusing on observable associations, interventions, and unverifiable counterfactuals, as a theoretical framework. It incorporates causal representation learning (CRL) to specify recoverable variables from activations under certain assumptions.

Result: A diagnostic framework is developed to guide researchers in aligning methods and evaluations with claims, ensuring that findings are generalizable and valid.

Conclusion: Causal inference can provide clearer guidelines for mapping model activations to meaningful structures, and the framework aids in improving the reliability of LLM interpretability research.

Abstract: Interpretability research on large language models (LLMs) has yielded important insights into model behaviour, yet recurring pitfalls persist: findings that do not generalise, and causal interpretations that outrun the evidence. Our position is that causal inference specifies what constitutes a valid mapping from model activations to invariant high-level structures, the data or assumptions needed to achieve it, and the inferences it can support. Specifically, Pearl's causal hierarchy clarifies what an interpretability study can justify. Observations establish associations between model behaviour and internal components. Interventions (e.g., ablations or activation patching) support claims how these edits affect a behavioural metric (\eg, average change in token probabilities) over a set of prompts. However, counterfactual claims -- i.e., asking what the model output would have been for the same prompt under an unobserved intervention -- remain largely unverifiable without controlled supervision. We show how causal representation learning (CRL) operationalises this hierarchy, specifying which variables are recoverable from activations and under what assumptions. Together, these motivate a diagnostic framework that helps practitioners select methods and evaluations matching claims to evidence such that findings generalise.

### [235] [Knowledge-Embedded Latent Projection for Robust Representation Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16709)
*Weijing Tang,Ming Yuan,Zongqi Xia,Tianxi Cai*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a latent projection model for analyzing high-dimensional discrete data matrices (commonly found in EHRs) by incorporating external semantic embeddings to improve representation learning in imbalanced data settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in estimating latent space models in imbalanced data, especially in EHRs where disease cohort sizes are limited but feature spaces are large.

Method: The paper proposes a knowledge-embedded latent projection model that leverages semantic embeddings and employs a two-step estimation procedure combining kernel PCA and scalable gradient descent.

Result: The method shows effective representation learning with error bounds, convergence guarantees, and promising performance in both simulations and real-world EHR applications.

Conclusion: Incorporating semantic side information into latent space modeling enhances the analysis of high-dimensional data matrices, particularly in imbalanced settings like EHRs.

Abstract: Latent space models are widely used for analyzing high-dimensional discrete data matrices, such as patient-feature matrices in electronic health records (EHRs), by capturing complex dependence structures through low-dimensional embeddings. However, estimation becomes challenging in the imbalanced regime, where one matrix dimension is much larger than the other. In EHR applications, cohort sizes are often limited by disease prevalence or data availability, whereas the feature space remains extremely large due to the breadth of medical coding system. Motivated by the increasing availability of external semantic embeddings, such as pre-trained embeddings of clinical concepts in EHRs, we propose a knowledge-embedded latent projection model that leverages semantic side information to regularize representation learning. Specifically, we model column embeddings as smooth functions of semantic embeddings via a mapping in a reproducing kernel Hilbert space. We develop a computationally efficient two-step estimation procedure that combines semantically guided subspace construction via kernel principal component analysis with scalable projected gradient descent. We establish estimation error bounds that characterize the trade-off between statistical error and approximation error induced by the kernel projection. Furthermore, we provide local convergence guarantees for our non-convex optimization procedure. Extensive simulation studies and a real-world EHR application demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

### [236] [Heuristic Search as Language-Guided Program Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16038)
*Mingxin Yu,Ruixiao Yang,Chuchu Fan*

Main category: cs.NE

TL;DR: The paper introduces a modular framework for improving LLM-driven Automated Heuristic Design (AHD) in combinatorial optimization (CO), outperforming existing methods across diverse domains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing AHD methods in CO rely heavily on manual trial-and-error or domain expertise, limiting adaptability to complex problems. This is due to tight coupling of internal mechanisms, restricting systematic improvements.

Method: A novel structured framework is introduced, dividing the heuristic discovery into modular stages: forward pass (evaluation), backward pass (analytical feedback), and update step (program refinement). This enables iterative and principled improvements.

Result: The framework was validated on four diverse CO domains, consistently outperforming baselines with up to 0.17 improvement in QYI on unseen test data.

Conclusion: The framework generalizes popular AHD methods, allowing modular upgrades that enhance performance, demonstrating its effectiveness and versatility in improving LLM-driven AHD.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have advanced Automated Heuristic Design (AHD) in combinatorial optimization (CO) in the past few years. However, existing discovery pipelines often require extensive manual trial-and-error or reliance on domain expertise to adapt to new or complex problems. This stems from tightly coupled internal mechanisms that limit systematic improvement of the LLM-driven design process. To address this challenge, we propose a structured framework for LLM-driven AHD that explicitly decomposes the heuristic discovery process into modular stages: a forward pass for evaluation, a backward pass for analytical feedback, and an update step for program refinement. This separation provides a clear abstraction for iterative refinement and enables principled improvements of individual components. We validate our framework across four diverse real-world CO domains, where it consistently outperforms baselines, achieving up to $0.17$ improvement in QYI on unseen test sets. Finally, we show that several popular AHD methods are restricted instantiations of our framework. By integrating them in our structured pipeline, we can upgrade the components modularly and significantly improve their performance.

### [237] [Evolutionary Context Search for Automated Skill Acquisition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16113)
*Qi Sun,Stefan Nielsen,Rio Yokota,Yujin Tang*

Main category: cs.NE

TL;DR: Retrieval-Augmented Generation often struggles with context effectiveness; a new evolutionary method, Evolutionary Context Search (ECS), improves task performance without retraining by discovering effective context combinations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large Language Models struggle to integrate new knowledge post-deployment effectively, with retrieval-based methods often unable to surface useful context for tasks.

Method: The paper introduces Evolutionary Context Search (ECS), which uses evolutionary algorithms to find optimal document pairings for context improvement, guided by development set accuracy without retraining.

Result: ECS enhances model performance, achieving a 27% improvement on BackendBench and 7% on τ-bench airline. The evolved contexts also successfully transfer across different models.

Conclusion: ECS offers an automated, efficient way to discover impactful context combinations, providing a promising alternative to manual prompt engineering or retraining.

Abstract: Large Language Models cannot reliably acquire new knowledge post-deployment -- even when relevant text resources exist, models fail to transform them into actionable knowledge without retraining. Retrieval-Augmented Generation attempts to bridge this gap by surfacing relevant documents at inference time, yet similarity-based retrieval often fails to identify context that actually improves task performance. We introduce Evolutionary Context Search (ECS), an evolutionary method that searches context combinations using accuracy on a small development set, requiring only inference calls without weight updates. ECS moves beyond semantic similarity to discover non-obvious context pairings that significantly boost performance. Our empirical results show that ECS improves BackendBench by 27\% and $τ$-bench airline by 7\%. The evolved contexts are model-agnostic, as those evolved with Gemini-3-Flash transfer effectively to Claude Sonnet and DeepSeek. This suggests that ECS opens a path toward automated context discovery for skill acquisition -- an efficient alternative to manual prompt engineering or costly fine-tuning.

TL;DR: The paper introduces BRIGHT, a multi-objective optimization tool for cervical cancer brachytherapy with an easy-to-use GUI. It shows effectiveness and user preference over conventional clinical plans.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve cervical cancer brachytherapy treatment planning by introducing a user-friendly GUI for BRIGHT, enabling intuitive navigation, comparison, and adjustment of treatment plans.

Method: The researchers developed a custom GUI for BRIGHT, validated it with end-users in a study involving ten patients, and compared its results to clinical practice using usability scores and blinded plan assessments.

Result: The system received a high usability score of 83.3. BRIGHT plans were preferred in 8/10 cases, showing better or equal performance in tumor coverage and organ-sparing trade-offs compared to clinical plans.

Conclusion: BRIGHT, with its dedicated GUI, is a practical, effective, and user-approved solution for cervical cancer brachytherapy treatment planning.

Abstract: Multi-objective optimisation using BRIGHT has proven insightful and effective in prostate cancer brachytherapy treatment planning. BRachytherapy via artificially Intelligent GOMEA-Heuristic based Treatment planning (BRIGHT) generates multiple treatment plans, each with a different trade-off between tumour coverage and organs-at-risk sparing. BRIGHT was recently extended to cervical cancer brachytherapy. In this study, we present a novel, custom-developed graphical user interface (GUI) that enables plan navigation, pairwise comparisons, dose distribution visualisation, and possibility for adjustments - essential for efficient clinical use of BRIGHT. End-user validation of BRIGHT with the dedicated GUI was conducted for cervical cancer brachytherapy by emulating clinical practice in ten previously treated patients. A multidisciplinary brachytherapy team used BRIGHT to create new treatment plans. GUI usability was assessed using the System Usability Scale (SUS). BRIGHT plan quality was compared to clinical practice via blinded one-on-one comparisons. The GUI offered helpful features for plan navigation and evaluation, giving users quick insight into whether planning aims are achievable and what treatment options are available. The overall SUS score was 83.3, indicating an 'excellent' system. BRIGHT outperformed clinical practice in five out of ten patients regarding the coverage-sparing trade-off and performed equally well in the remaining five. The BRIGHT plan was preferred over the clinical plan in eight out of ten patients, four of which showed clinically relevant differences. The clinical plan was preferred in two patients, neither with clinically relevant differences. In conclusion, BRIGHT, with its dedicated GUI, is a clinically viable and user-friendly tool for treatment planning in cervical cancer brachytherapy.

### [239] [A Calculus of Overlays](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16291)
*Bo Yang*

Main category: cs.PL

TL;DR: The paper introduces Overlay-Calculus, a model for declarative programming built on three primitives (record, definition, inheritance), offering simplicity and broad applicability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To establish a foundational calculus for declarative programming, inspired by functional programming's $λ$-calculus, that inherently resolves challenges like multiple inheritance and facilitates diverse programming paradigms.

Method: Overlay-Calculus is conceptualized using naive set theory, embedding $λ$-calculus and defining declarative constructs that benefit from commutative, idempotent, and associative properties.

Result: The framework achieves fully abstract semantics of lazy $λ$-calculus, provides solutions to problems like the Expression Problem, supports various programming needs, and suggests practical applications.

Conclusion: Overlay-Calculus is a foundational declarative programming paradigm with significant theoretical and practical potential across multiple programming concepts and domains.

Abstract: Just as the $λ$-calculus uses three primitives (abstraction, application, variable) as the foundation of functional programming, Overlay-Calculus uses three primitives (record, definition, inheritance) as the foundation of declarative programming. It trivially embeds the $λ$-calculus, although the entire semantics builds on only naive set theory; as a consequence, all constructs including inheritance are inherently commutative, idempotent, and associative; the linearization problem of multiple inheritance simply does not arise. This induces a fully abstract semantics of the lazy $λ$-calculus with respect to Böhm tree equivalence. Overlay-Calculus is distilled from the Overlay language, a practical implementation in which we observed further emergent phenomena: the Expression Problem dissolves, programs are CPS-agnostic, records natively encode random-access memory, and self-reference resolves to multiple targets. These properties suggest applications to configuration languages, dependency injection, object-oriented programming, composable effect systems, modular software architectures, file-system-as-compiler, general-purpose programming, and no-code development.

*Jules Merckx,Alexandre Lopoukhine,Samuel Coward,Jianyi Cheng,Bjorn De Sutter,Tobias Grosser*

Main category: cs.PL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a new method of integrating equality saturation directly into a compiler's intermediate representations, improving its optimization scope and use.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address the limitations of existing equality saturation approaches, which either operate only at a single abstraction level or lose equality information during transformation by other compiler passes.

Method: The approach integrates an e-graph directly into the compiler's intermediate representation within the Python-based MLIR framework xDSL, using a new MLIR dialect called eqsat.

Result: The representation allows the compiler to interleave equality saturation with other transformations and apply it across different levels of intermediate representations concurrently.

Conclusion: This method expands equality saturation's applicability and provides a unified approach for optimizing compilers using this technique at multiple representation levels.

Abstract: Recent algorithmic advances have made equality saturation an appealing approach to program optimization because it avoids the phase-ordering problem. Existing work uses external equality saturation libraries, or custom implementations that are deeply tied to the specific application. However, these works only apply equality saturation at a single level of abstraction, or discard the discovered equalities when code is transformed by other compiler passes. We propose an alternative approach that represents an e-graph natively in the compiler's intermediate representation, facilitating the application of constructive compiler passes that maintain the e-graph state throughout the compilation flow. We build on a Python-based MLIR framework, xDSL, and introduce a new MLIR dialect, eqsat, that represents e-graphs in MLIR code. We show that this representation expands the scope of equality saturation in the compiler, allowing us to interleave pattern rewriting with other compiler transformations. The eqsat dialect provides a unified abstraction for compilers to utilize equality saturation across various levels of intermediate representations concurrently within the same MLIR flow.

*Mengyun Liu,Shanshan Huang,Jianan Jiang*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: EdgeNav-QE optimizes large action models for edge devices using quantization and dynamic early-exit mechanisms, significantly reducing latency and memory usage while maintaining performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the challenge of deploying large action models (LAMs) on edge devices, where memory and latency constraints hinder real-time autonomous navigation.

Method: The paper introduces EdgeNav-QE, a framework using Quantized Low-Rank Adaptation (QLoRA) for 4-bit precision quantization and a Dynamic Early-Exit (DEE) mechanism to optimize high-performance navigation models for edge devices.

Result: EdgeNav-QE reduces inference latency by 82.7% and memory usage by 66.7% while maintaining 81.8% navigation success rate on the Habitat-Sim environment. It outperforms static early-exit methods by 17.9% in latency.

Conclusion: EdgeNav-QE demonstrates the feasibility of deploying high-performance navigation models on edge devices, achieving significant efficiency improvements with minimal performance loss, and showing potential for safety-critical applications.

Abstract: Large Action Models (LAMs) have shown immense potential in autonomous navigation by bridging high-level reasoning with low-level control. However, deploying these multi-billion parameter models on edge devices remains a significant challenge due to memory constraints and latency requirements. In this paper, we propose EdgeNav-QE, a novel framework that integrates Quantized Low-Rank Adaptation (QLoRA) with a dynamic early-exit (DEE) mechanism to optimize LAMs for real-time edge navigation. By quantizing the backbone to 4-bit precision and strategically placing early-exit branches, we enable the model to terminate inference early for simple navigation tasks while retaining full depth for complex decision-making. Experimental results on the Habitat-Sim environment with Matterport3D dataset using OpenVLA-7B backbone, demonstrate that EdgeNav-QE reduces inference latency by 82.7% and memory footprint by 66.7% compared to full-precision baselines, while maintaining 81.8% navigation success rate. Furthermore, it outperforms state-of-the-art static early-exit method by 17.9% in latency, demonstrating the superiority of content-aware adaptive computation for safety-critical applications.

### [242] [From Conflicts to Collisions: A Two-Stage Collision Scenario-Testing Approach for Autonomous Driving Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15837)
*Siyuan Chen,Fuyuan Zhang,Hua Qi,Lei Ma,Tomoyuki Tsuchiya,Michio Hayashi,Manabu Okada*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper proposes a new framework to improve simulation-based testing for autonomous driving systems by using 'conflicts' as intermediate targets before inducing collisions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Autonomous driving systems need rigorous pre-deployment testing, but existing methods focus narrowly on collision scenarios, limiting exploration of broader hazardous situations.

Method: The paper introduces a two-stage testing framework: first searching for conflict scenarios and then mutating them to induce actual collisions, improving scenario exploration.

Result: The method uncovered up to 12 distinct collision types in one run, doubling scenario diversity compared to state-of-the-art methods while reducing simulations needed.

Conclusion: Using conflicts as intermediate objectives enhances scenario diversity, efficiency, and effectiveness in testing autonomous driving system safety.

Abstract: Autonomous driving systems (ADS) are safety-critical and require rigorous testing before public deployment. Simulation-based scenario testing provides a safe and cost-effective alternative to extensive on-road trials, enabling efficient evaluation of ADS under diverse and high-risk conditions. However, existing approaches mainly evaluates the scenarios based on their proximity to collisions and focus on scenarios already close to collision, leaving many other hazardous situations unexplored. To bridge this, we introduce a collision-related concept of conflict as an intermediate search target and propose a two-stage scenario testing framework that first searches for conflicts and then mutates these conflict scenarios to induce actual collisions. Evaluated on Baidu Apollo, our approach reveals up to 12 distinct collision types in a single run, doubling the diversity discovered by state-of-the-art baselines while requiring fewer simulations thanks to conflict-targeted mutations. These results show that using conflicts as intermediate objectives broadens the search horizon and significantly improves the efficiency and effectiveness of ADS safety evaluation.

### [243] [TurboADMM: A Structure-Exploiting Parallel Solver for Multi-Agent Trajectory Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15838)
*Yucheng Chen*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: TurboADMM is a QP solver tailored for multi-agent trajectory optimization using three components: ADMM decomposition, Riccati warmstart, and parametric QP hotstart, achieving near-linear complexity in agent counts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing QP solvers face scalability challenges in multi-agent optimization problems, especially when addressing temporal structure, dense coupling constraints, agent decomposition, and iteration similarity.

Method: TurboADMM combines three components: ADMM decomposition for parallel agent subproblems, Riccati warmstart for initializing QPs based on temporal structure, and parametric QP hotstart to reuse factorizations over iterations.

Result: TurboADMM demonstrates empirically near-linear scalability in agent count for multi-agent trajectory optimization problems.

Conclusion: The solver effectively addresses scalability challenges by co-designing components that optimize decomposition, initialization, and iteration within dense interaction networks.

Abstract: Multi-agent trajectory optimization with dense interaction networks require solving large coupled QPs at control rates, yet existing solvers fail to simultaneously exploit temporal structure, agent decomposition, and iteration similarity. One usually treats multi-agent problems monolithically when using general-purpose QP solvers (OSQP, MOSEK), which encounter scalability difficulties with agent count. Structure-exploiting solvers (HPIPM) leverage temporal structure through Riccati recursion but can be vulnerable to dense coupling constraints. We introduce TurboADMM, a specialized single-machine QP solver that achieves empirically near linear complexity in agent count through systematic co-design of three complementary components: (1) ADMM decomposition creates per-agent subproblems solvable in parallel, preserving block-tridiagonal structure under dense coupling; (2) Riccati warmstart exploits temporal structure to provide high-quality primal-dual initialization for each agent's QP; (3) parametric QP hotstart \footnote{In the paper, we refer warmstart as the technique that uses the Riccati equation results as auxiliary QP initialization for a single QP solve, while hotstart as reusing the QR factorization across QP solve iterations.}in qpOASES reuses similar KKT system factorizations across ADMM iterations.

### [244] [A Decade of Human-Robot Interaction through Immersive Lenses: A Literature Review on Extended Reality as a Research Instrument in Social Robotics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15840)
*André Helgert,Carolin Straßmann,Sabrina C. Eimler*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: XR (extended reality) is promising for human-robot interaction (HRI), but its application for social robotics lacks comprehensive exploration. A review of 33 studies highlights challenges and proposes a roadmap for development.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to explore and map the underutilized potential of XR in social robotics and HRI, identifying the gaps, challenges, and steps needed to improve its reliability as a research instrument.

Method: A systematic review of 6,527 articles from 2015 to 2025 was conducted, with 33 studies meeting strict inclusion criteria for analysis on usage, methodology, demographics, challenges, and future agendas.

Result: Findings reveal XR research in social robotics is often lab-based, focuses less on rich interaction and diverse demographics, and is limited by small samples, outdated hardware, and underreporting of key specifications.

Conclusion: A five-phase roadmap is proposed to improve XR's role in social robotics by advancing methods, ensuring ecological validity, enhancing interaction quality, diversifying samples, and creating a taxonomy.

Abstract: Over the past decade, extended reality (XR), including virtual, augmented, and mixed reality, gained attention as a research instrument in human-robot interaction studies, but remains underexplored in empirical investigations of social robotics. To map the field, we systematically reviewed empirical studies from 2015 to 2025. Of 6,527 peer-reviewed articles, only 33 met strict inclusion criteria. We examined (1) how XR and virtual social robots are used and in which contexts, (2) data collection and analysis methods, (3) demographics of the researchers and participants, and (4) the stated challenges and future agendas. Our findings show that social XR-HRI research is still dominated by laboratory simulations, while crucial specifications like used hardware, software, and robots are often not reported. Robots typically act as passive and less interactive visual stimuli, while the rich biosignal (e.g., eye-tracking) and logging functions of modern head-mounted displays remain largely untapped. The research teams and samples are predominantly tech-centric, Western, young, and male, with frequent gaps in demographic reporting. Key limitations include hardware delays, small homogeneous samples, and short, shallow study cycles. We propose a five-phase roadmap to establish social XR-HRI as a reliable research medium, which includes fostering methodological innovation, a reinforced ecological validity by, e.g., using application contexts, the improvement of the robot's interaction quality, promoting diversity in the sample and the development of a social XR-HRI taxonomy. Advancing in these directions is essential for XR to mature from a lab prototype into an ecologically valid research instrument for social robotics.

### [245] [ReasonNavi: Human-Inspired Global Map Reasoning for Zero-Shot Embodied Navigation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15864)
*Yuzhuo Ao,Anbang Wang,Yu-Wing Tai,Chi-Keung Tang*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: ReasonNavi is a human-inspired navigation framework that integrates Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) with deterministic planners to improve embodied agent navigation by reasoning globally and acting locally, without requiring fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Efficient navigation for embodied agents is challenging as they rely on partial egocentric observations, limiting global foresight and causing inefficient exploration. This paper seeks to address this limitation by mimicking human map-based planning.

Method: ReasonNavi leverages MLLMs for semantic reasoning combined with a deterministic planner. It segments maps into discrete reasoning spaces, identifies optimal goals via multi-stage MLLM queries, and uses an action planner to execute trajectories based on an occupancy map, relying on object detectors and segmenters for robust goal recognition.

Result: ReasonNavi outperforms prior methods across three navigation tasks by eliminating the need for extensive training or heavy scene modeling, showcasing its scalable and interpretable navigation capabilities.

Conclusion: The proposed zero-shot navigation approach is scalable, interpretable, and optimally grounded for embodied navigation, offering significant improvements over traditional methods and naturally benefiting from future advancements in foundation models.

Abstract: Embodied agents often struggle with efficient navigation because they rely primarily on partial egocentric observations, which restrict global foresight and lead to inefficient exploration. In contrast, humans plan using maps: we reason globally first, then act locally. We introduce ReasonNavi, a human-inspired framework that operationalizes this reason-then-act paradigm by coupling Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) with deterministic planners. ReasonNavi converts a top-down map into a discrete reasoning space by room segmentation and candidate target nodes sampling. An MLLM is then queried in a multi-stage process to identify the candidate most consistent with the instruction (object, image, or text goal), effectively leveraging the model's semantic reasoning ability while sidestepping its weakness in continuous coordinate prediction. The selected waypoint is grounded into executable trajectories using a deterministic action planner over an online-built occupancy map, while pretrained object detectors and segmenters ensure robust recognition at the goal. This yields a unified zero-shot navigation framework that requires no MLLM fine-tuning, circumvents the brittleness of RL-based policies and scales naturally with foundation model improvements. Across three navigation tasks, ReasonNavi consistently outperforms prior methods that demand extensive training or heavy scene modeling, offering a scalable, interpretable, and globally grounded solution to embodied navigation.

*Xunlan Zhou,Xuanlin Chen,Shaowei Zhang,Xiangkun Li,ShengHua Wan,Xiaohai Hu,Yuan Lei,Le Gan,De-chuan Zhan*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: MARVL improves robotic reinforcement learning by using Vision-Language Models (VLMs), addressing alignment, spatial, and semantic issues in dense rewards.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to overcome the limitations of manually engineered dense rewards in robotic reinforcement learning, which hinder scalability and automation.

Method: MARVL fine-tunes a Vision-Language Model (VLM) for spatial/semantic consistency and introduces multi-stage task decomposition with trajectory sensitivity.

Result: MARVL outperforms other VLM-reward models in terms of sample efficiency and robustness on the Meta-World benchmark for sparse-reward tasks.

Conclusion: MARVL demonstrates that fine-tuned VLMs with multi-stage task strategies can significantly enhance robotic manipulation in reinforcement learning.

Abstract: Designing dense reward functions is pivotal for efficient robotic Reinforcement Learning (RL). However, most dense rewards rely on manual engineering, which fundamentally limits the scalability and automation of reinforcement learning. While Vision-Language Models (VLMs) offer a promising path to reward design, naive VLM rewards often misalign with task progress, struggle with spatial grounding, and show limited understanding of task semantics. To address these issues, we propose MARVL-Multi-stAge guidance for Robotic manipulation via Vision-Language models. MARVL fine-tunes a VLM for spatial and semantic consistency and decomposes tasks into multi-stage subtasks with task direction projection for trajectory sensitivity. Empirically, MARVL significantly outperforms existing VLM-reward methods on the Meta-World benchmark, demonstrating superior sample efficiency and robustness on sparse-reward manipulation tasks.

### [247] [Test-Time Adaptation for Tactile-Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15873)
*Chuyang Ye,Haoxian Jing,Qinting Jiang,Yixi Lin,Qiang Li,Xing Tang,Jingyan Jiang*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper focuses on improving test-time adaptation (TTA) for tactile-vision-language models during distribution shifts, presenting a framework to handle modality-wise reliability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current TTA methods for multimodal models do not address modality-wise reliability under cross-modal shifts, which can result in poor performance when one or more modalities become unreliable.

Method: The paper introduces a framework to estimate reliability of each modality using prediction uncertainty and perturbation responses. This reliability is used to filter unreliable inputs, fuse modalities adaptively, and regularize test-time optimization.

Result: The framework achieves substantial accuracy improvements (up to 49.9%) on the TAG-C benchmark and other scenarios under severe modality corruption compared to current baselines.

Conclusion: Explicit modeling of modality-wise reliability is essential for robust test-time adaptation in tactile-vision-language settings, especially under significant distribution shifts.

Abstract: Tactile-vision-language (TVL) models are increasingly deployed in real-world robotic and multimodal perception tasks, where test-time distribution shifts are unavoidable. Existing test-time adaptation (TTA) methods provide filtering in unimodal settings but lack explicit treatment of modality-wise reliability under asynchronous cross-modal shifts, leaving them brittle when some modalities become unreliable. We study TTA for TVL models under such shifts and propose a reliability-aware framework that estimates per-modality reliability from prediction uncertainty and perturbation-based responses. This shared reliability signal is used to (i) filter unreliable test samples, (ii) adaptively fuse tactile, visual, and language features, and (iii) regularize test-time optimization with a reliability-guided objective. On the TAG-C benchmark and additional TVL scenarios, our approach consistently outperforms strong TTA baselines, achieving accuracy gains of up to 49.9\% under severe modality corruptions, underscoring the importance of explicit modality-wise reliability modeling for robust test-time adaptation.

### [248] [Fly0: Decoupling Semantic Grounding from Geometric Planning for Zero-Shot Aerial Navigation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15875)
*Zhenxing Xu,Brikit Lu,Weidong Bao,Zhengqiu Zhu,Junsong Zhang,Hui Yan,Wenhao Lu,Ji Wang*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Fly0 is a novel framework for Visual-Language Navigation (VLN) that combines semantic reasoning via Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) with geometric-based planning, achieving better navigation performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VLN faces challenges in balancing semantic understanding with precise navigation control. Deploying MLLMs directly as controllers causes issues like high latency and poor generalization, which this paper addresses by decoupling semantic reasoning and geometric planning.

Method: Fly0 operates through a three-stage pipeline: 1) MLLM-driven semantic grounding for converting language to 2D coordinates, 2) a depth-based localization module transforming targets into 3D space, and 3) a geometric planner generating collision-free trajectories.

Result: Fly0 outperformed existing methods in simulations and real world, achieving a 20% higher Success Rate and reducing Navigation Error by 50% in unstructured settings.

Conclusion: Fly0 effectively improves efficiency, stability, and navigation accuracy by separating semantic reasoning and geometric planning, proving robust in diverse environments.

Abstract: Current Visual-Language Navigation (VLN) methodologies face a trade-off between semantic understanding and control precision. While Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) offer superior reasoning, deploying them as low-level controllers leads to high latency, trajectory oscillations, and poor generalization due to weak geometric grounding. To address these limitations, we propose Fly0, a framework that decouples semantic reasoning from geometric planning. The proposed method operates through a three-stage pipeline: (1) an MLLM-driven module for grounding natural language instructions into 2D pixel coordinates; (2) a geometric projection module that utilizes depth data to localize targets in 3D space; and (3) a geometric planner that generates collision-free trajectories. This mechanism enables robust navigation even when visual contact is lost. By eliminating the need for continuous inference, Fly0 reduces computational overhead and improves system stability. Extensive experiments in simulation and real-world environments demonstrate that Fly0 outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, improving the Success Rate by over 20\% and reducing Navigation Error (NE) by approximately 50\% in unstructured environments.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: FUTURE-VLA is a vision-language architecture designed for spatiotemporal reasoning in robotics, offering efficient long-horizon control and real-time forecasting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the challenge of high latency in processing robotic tasks requiring long video history and future predictions.

Method: FUTURE-VLA adopts temporally adaptive compression for spatiotemporal density and latent-space autoregression within a unified sequence-generation framework.

Result: The model achieves state-of-the-art performance on LIBERO, RoboTwin, and the real-world Piper, with excellent success rates and extended spatiotemporal window capabilities.

Conclusion: FUTURE-VLA effectively balances efficiency, predictive accuracy, and scalability, enabling advancements in robotic real-time decision-making and operator interaction.

Abstract: General vision-language models increasingly support unified spatiotemporal reasoning over long video streams, yet deploying such capabilities on robots remains constrained by the prohibitive latency of processing long-horizon histories and generating high-dimensional future predictions. To bridge this gap, we present FUTURE-VLA, a unified architecture that reformulates long-horizon control and future forecasting as a monolithic sequence-generation task. Adopting a dual-sided efficiency paradigm, FUTURE-VLA leverages a temporally adaptive compression strategy to maximize spatiotemporal information density, enabling the ingestion of extensive multi-view histories while maintaining constant inference latency. Simultaneously, it performs latent-space autoregression to align actionable dynamics with reviewable visual look-aheads in a single forward pass. These real-time predictive capabilities further enable a prediction-guided Human-In-the-Loop mechanism via interactive execution gating, allowing operators to dynamically validate behaviors based on interpretable future previews. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that FUTURE-VLA establishes new state-of-the-art performance, attaining success rates of 99.2% on LIBERO, 75.4% on RoboTwin, and 78.0% on a real-world Piper platform, all with a $16\times$ extended spatiotemporal window while maintaining the inference latency of a single-frame baseline.

Using this concept, a mechanism presented with a 3T2R motion that is required for the manipulation of the surgical drill. It is mainly composed three stages: one translational, one transmitting and one rotational. Their respective kinematic and velocity models are separately derived, then combined. Based on the drilling trajectories obtained from a real patient case, the mechanism is optimized for generating the highest kinematic performances.

*Zilin Wang,Saeed Rahmani,Daphne Cornelisse,Bidipta Sarkar,Alexander David Goldie,Jakob Nicolaus Foerster,Shimon Whiteson*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper proposes a scalable approach for adapting autonomous driving policies to new cities without human demonstration data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deploying autonomous vehicles in new cities is costly due to variations in road geometry, traffic rules, and interaction patterns requiring numerous human demonstration trajectories.

Method: The authors use a self-play multi-agent reinforcement learning framework, NOMAD, which adapts driving policies in a simulator built from the target city's map and meta-information, using a simple reward system.

Result: NOMAD significantly enhances task success rates and trajectory realism in simulation-based city transfers without depending on human demonstration data.

Conclusion: The proposed approach promises an effective and scalable alternative to current data-intensive methods for city-to-city adaptation in autonomous driving.

Abstract: While autonomous vehicles have achieved reliable performance within specific operating regions, their deployment to new cities remains costly and slow. A key bottleneck is the need to collect many human demonstration trajectories when adapting driving policies to new cities that differ from those seen in training in terms of road geometry, traffic rules, and interaction patterns. In this paper, we show that self-play multi-agent reinforcement learning can adapt a driving policy to a substantially different target city using only the map and meta-information, without requiring any human demonstrations from that city. We introduce NO data Map-based self-play for Autonomous Driving (NOMAD), which enables policy adaptation in a simulator constructed based on the target-city map. Using a simple reward function, NOMAD substantially improves both task success rate and trajectory realism in target cities, demonstrating an effective and scalable alternative to data-intensive city-transfer methods.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper addresses the challenge of survivor localization using UAVs in post-disaster zones, proposing a novel solution to overcome physical biases caused by NLOS signal propagation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a need for effective survivor localization in disaster scenarios using UAVs, which is hindered by Non-Line-of-Sight transmission biases from collapsed structures.

Method: The authors introduce the AsymmetricHuberEKF, a physically-informed filter with an asymmetric loss function addressing NLOS biases and enhanced bilateral sensing strategy.

Result: The proposed method accelerates localization convergence compared to existing symmetric filters in a 2D scanning scenario.

Conclusion: The approach demonstrates resilience and effectiveness in constrained environments, bridging gaps in data scarcity and geometric limitations.

Abstract: Post-disaster survivor localization using Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) faces a fundamental physical challenge: the prevalence of Non-Line-of-Sight (NLOS) propagation in collapsed structures. Unlike standard Gaussian noise, signal reflection from debris introduces strictly non-negative ranging biases. Existing robust estimators, typically designed with symmetric loss functions (e.g., Huber or Tukey), implicitly rely on the assumption of error symmetry. Consequently, they experience a theoretical mismatch in this regime, leading to a phenomenon we formally identify as Statistical-Geometric Degeneracy (SGD)-a state where the estimator stagnates due to the coupling of persistent asymmetric bias and limited observation geometry. While emerging data-driven approaches offer alternatives, they often struggle with the scarcity of training data and the sim-to-real gap inherent in unstructured disaster zones. In this work, we propose a physically-grounded solution, the AsymmetricHuberEKF, which explicitly incorporates the non-negative physical prior of NLOS biases via a derived asymmetric loss function. Theoretically, we show that standard symmetric filters correspond to a degenerate case of our framework where the physical constraint is relaxed. Furthermore, we demonstrate that resolving SGD requires not just a robust filter, but specific bilateral information, which we achieve through a co-designed active sensing strategy. Validated in a 2D nadir-view scanning scenario, our approach significantly accelerates convergence compared to symmetric baselines, offering a resilient building block for search operations where data is scarce and geometry is constrained.

Method: Integrates SLAM with semantic mapping in a sliding-window, spatio-temporal framework. Utilizes VGGT for temporal consistency and submap alignment for efficiency.

Result: Achieved efficient mapping with under 17 GB GPU memory usage and strong performance on ScanNet++ benchmark.

Conclusion: SceneVGGT offers robust and interactive 3D scene understanding, supporting assistive navigation with semantic and geometric precision.

Abstract: We present SceneVGGT, a spatio-temporal 3D scene understanding framework that combines SLAM with semantic mapping for autonomous and assistive navigation. Built on VGGT, our method scales to long video streams via a sliding-window pipeline. We align local submaps using camera-pose transformations, enabling memory- and speed-efficient mapping while preserving geometric consistency. Semantics are lifted from 2D instance masks to 3D objects using the VGGT tracking head, maintaining temporally coherent identities for change detection. As a proof of concept, object locations are projected onto an estimated floor plane for assistive navigation. The pipeline's GPU memory usage remains under 17 GB, irrespectively of the length of the input sequence and achieves competitive point-cloud performance on the ScanNet++ benchmark. Overall, SceneVGGT ensures robust semantic identification and is fast enough to support interactive assistive navigation with audio feedback.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper presents 'Lightning,' a framework to enhance robot vision under challenging lighting conditions by using a programmable onboard light and closed-loop control.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Robots struggle with perception in low light or high dynamic range conditions, leading to limitations in visual SLAM performance using conventional methods.

Method: The authors propose a three-stage approach combining relighting models, offline optimization for lighting schedules, and real-time illumination control policies to enhance robot vision.

Result: The Lightning framework improves SLAM trajectory robustness and reduces unnecessary power consumption during robot operation.

Conclusion: Programmable illumination and closed-loop control can significantly enhance robot perception under challenging light conditions, benefiting visual SLAM tasks.

Abstract: Robot perception under low light or high dynamic range is usually improved downstream - via more robust feature extraction, image enhancement, or closed-loop exposure control. However, all of these approaches are limited by the image captured these conditions. An alternate approach is to utilize a programmable onboard light that adds to ambient illumination and improves captured images. However, it is not straightforward to predict its impact on image formation. Illumination interacts nonlinearly with depth, surface reflectance, and scene geometry. It can both reveal structure and induce failure modes such as specular highlights and saturation. We introduce Lightning, a closed-loop illumination-control framework for visual SLAM that combines relighting, offline optimization, and imitation learning. This is performed in three stages. First, we train a Co-Located Illumination Decomposition (CLID) relighting model that decomposes a robot observation into an ambient component and a light-contribution field. CLID enables physically consistent synthesis of the same scene under alternative light intensities and thereby creates dense multi-intensity training data without requiring us to repeatedly re-run trajectories. Second, using these synthesized candidates, we formulate an offline Optimal Intensity Schedule (OIS) problem that selects illumination levels over a sequence trading off SLAM-relevant image utility against power consumption and temporal smoothness. Third, we distill this ideal solution into a real-time controller through behavior cloning, producing an Illumination Control Policy (ILC) that generalizes beyond the initial training distribution and runs online on a mobile robot to command discrete light-intensity levels. Across our evaluation, Lightning substantially improves SLAM trajectory robustness while reducing unnecessary illumination power.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a coverage path planning framework for autonomous sailboats to efficiently navigate in dynamic ocean conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Autonomous sailboats face challenges due to anisotropic performance and changing ocean conditions, which limit traditional coverage methods.

Method: A spatiotemporal coverage framework combining spatial topology-based constraints and temporal forecast-aware planning.

Result: The framework generates effective coverage paths in simulations with challenging ocean conditions, outperforming traditional strategies.

Conclusion: This study introduces the first specialized solution for autonomous sailboat coverage planning in dynamic oceans, paving the way for future advancements.

Abstract: Autonomous sailboats are well suited for long-duration ocean observation due to their wind-driven endurance. However, their performance is highly anisotropic and strongly influenced by inhomogeneous and time-varying wind and current fields, limiting the effectiveness of existing coverage methods such as boustrophedon sweeping. Planning under these environmental and maneuvering constraints remains underexplored. This paper presents a spatiotemporal coverage path planning framework tailored to autonomous sailboats, combining (1) topology-based morphological constraints in the spatial domain to promote compact and continuous coverage, and (2) forecast-aware look-ahead planning in the temporal domain to anticipate environmental evolution and enable foresighted decision-making. Simulations conducted under stochastic inhomogeneous and time-varying ocean environments, including scenarios with partial directional accessibility, demonstrate that the proposed method generates efficient and feasible coverage paths where traditional strategies often fail. To the best of our knowledge, this study provides the first dedicated solution to the coverage path planning problem for autonomous sailboats operating in inhomogeneous and time-varying ocean environments, establishing a foundation for future cooperative multi-sailboat coverage.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of Vision-Language-Action models in generalizing to unseen physical motions and tasks.

Method: Utilize a pretrained video diffusion backbone to jointly model physical dynamics and actions through dense video representations, enabling real-time control and few-shot adaptation.

Result: Achieved over 2x improvement in task generalization, 14B model performing real-time control at 7Hz, and significant improvement in few-shot and cross-embodiment transfer.

Conclusion: DreamZero effectively learns diverse skills, improves robotic task adaptability, and sets a benchmark for generalization and embodiment transfer in robotics.

Abstract: State-of-the-art Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models excel at semantic generalization but struggle to generalize to unseen physical motions in novel environments. We introduce DreamZero, a World Action Model (WAM) built upon a pretrained video diffusion backbone. Unlike VLAs, WAMs learn physical dynamics by predicting future world states and actions, using video as a dense representation of how the world evolves. By jointly modeling video and action, DreamZero learns diverse skills effectively from heterogeneous robot data without relying on repetitive demonstrations. This results in over 2x improvement in generalization to new tasks and environments compared to state-of-the-art VLAs in real robot experiments. Crucially, through model and system optimizations, we enable a 14B autoregressive video diffusion model to perform real-time closed-loop control at 7Hz. Finally, we demonstrate two forms of cross-embodiment transfer: video-only demonstrations from other robots or humans yield a relative improvement of over 42% on unseen task performance with just 10-20 minutes of data. More surprisingly, DreamZero enables few-shot embodiment adaptation, transferring to a new embodiment with only 30 minutes of play data while retaining zero-shot generalization.

*Carlo Cena,Mauro Martini,Marcello Chiaberge*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The study examines Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) for spacecraft attitude dynamics modeling and compares it to traditional data-driven methods, showcasing the PINN’s superior predictive reliability and robustness when paired with Model Predictive Control (MPC).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Spacecraft attitude control requires accurate prediction of dynamics, which can be challenging for complex systems due to difficulties in creating precise physics-based models. This study aims to address unreliable stability and limited extrapolation capabilities seen in purely data-driven approaches.

Method: The authors use high-fidelity numerical simulations to generate a dataset and investigate two methodologies: a data-driven approach and a physics-informed approach integrating prior knowledge during training. PINNs are tested within a Model Predictive Control (MPC) framework.

Result: Physics-informed models reduced mean relative error by 68.17% and demonstrated better closed-loop tracking and robustness. A hybrid control formulation further improved the response time, reducing settling times by 61.52%-76.42%, even under disturbances.

Conclusion: Embedding physical constraints during model training enhances spacecraft attitude dynamics prediction accuracy and robustness when implemented in MPC. PINNs outperform traditional learning-based methods and offer faster, more reliable control responses.

Abstract: Reliable spacecraft attitude control depends on accurate prediction of attitude dynamics, particularly when model-based strategies such as Model Predictive Control (MPC) are employed, where performance is limited by the quality of the internal system model. For spacecraft with complex dynamics, obtaining accurate physics-based models can be difficult, time-consuming, or computationally heavy. Learning-based system identification presents a compelling alternative; however, models trained exclusively on data frequently exhibit fragile stability properties and limited extrapolation capability. This work explores Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) for modeling spacecraft attitude dynamics and contrasts it with a conventional data-driven approach. A comprehensive dataset is generated using high-fidelity numerical simulations, and two learning methodologies are investigated: a purely data-driven pipeline and a physics-regularized approach that incorporates prior knowledge into the optimization process. The results indicate that embedding physical constraints during training leads to substantial improvements in predictive reliability, achieving a 68.17% decrease in mean relative error relative. When deployed within an MPC architecture, the physics-informed models yield superior closed-loop tracking performance and improved robustness to uncertainty. Furthermore, a hybrid control formulation that merges the learned nonlinear dynamics with a nominal linear model enables consistent steady-state convergence and significantly faster response, reducing settling times by 61.52%-76.42% under measurement noise and reaction wheel friction.

Abstract: Despite a surge in robotics research dedicated to inferring and understanding human intent, a universally accepted definition remains elusive since existing works often equate human intention with specific task-related goals. This article seeks to address this gap by examining the multifaceted nature of intention. Drawing on insights from psychology, it attempts to consolidate a definition of intention into a comprehensible framework for a broader audience. The article classifies different types of intention based on psychological and communication studies, offering guidance to researchers shifting from pure technical enhancements to a more human-centric perspective in robotics. It then demonstrates how various robotics studies can be aligned with these intention categories.

Abstract: We introduce ODYN, a novel all-shifted primal-dual non-interior-point quadratic programming (QP) solver designed to efficiently handle challenging dense and sparse QPs. ODYN combines all-shifted nonlinear complementarity problem (NCP) functions with proximal method of multipliers to robustly address ill-conditioned and degenerate problems, without requiring linear independence of the constraints.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper investigates how perceptual uncertainty and its proper calibration affect autonomous vehicle motion planning using new pipelines and the nuPlan benchmark.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The lack of studies on the influence of perceptual uncertainty calibration in AVs' decision-making process necessitated this research.

Method: The authors analyzed two new prediction-planning pipelines with different uncertainty propagation levels using the nuPlan planning benchmark and closed-loop evaluation.

Result: The approach that incorporates upstream uncertainty propagation performs better in generalizing to complex closed-loop scenarios.

Conclusion: Propagating and properly calibrating perceptual uncertainty enhances the decision-making reliability of AVs in complex scenarios.

Abstract: Autonomous vehicles (AVs) are being increasingly deployed in urban environments. In order to operate safely and reliably, AVs need to account for the inherent uncertainty associated with perceiving the world through sensor data and incorporate that into their decision-making process. Uncertainty-aware planners have recently been developed to account for upstream perception and prediction uncertainty. However, such planners may be sensitive to prediction uncertainty miscalibration, the magnitude of which has not yet been characterized. Towards this end, we perform a detailed analysis on the impact that perceptual uncertainty propagation and calibration has on perception-based motion planning. We do so by comparing two novel prediction-planning pipelines with varying levels of uncertainty propagation on the recently-released nuPlan planning benchmark. We study the impact of upstream uncertainty calibration using closed-loop evaluation on the nuPlan challenge scenarios. We find that the method incorporating upstream uncertainty propagation demonstrates superior generalization to complex closed-loop scenarios.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces ScenicRules, a benchmark for evaluating autonomous driving systems in stochastic environments considering prioritized multi-objective specifications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The research addresses the need for formalized, prioritized multi-objective rule evaluation and environment modeling absent in existing autonomous driving benchmarks.

Method: The authors formalized quantitative objectives, designed a Hierarchical Rulebook framework to encode priorities, and created a scenario collection modeled in the Scenic language.

Result: Experimental results demonstrate that the approach aligns well with human driving judgments and highlights agent failures in prioritized objectives.

Conclusion: ScenicRules offers a valuable benchmark for testing autonomous driving systems, exposing challenges in managing prioritized objectives.

Abstract: Developing autonomous driving systems for complex traffic environments requires balancing multiple objectives, such as avoiding collisions, obeying traffic rules, and making efficient progress. In many situations, these objectives cannot be satisfied simultaneously, and explicit priority relations naturally arise. Also, driving rules require context, so it is important to formally model the environment scenarios within which such rules apply. Existing benchmarks for evaluating autonomous vehicles lack such combinations of multi-objective prioritized rules and formal environment models. In this work, we introduce ScenicRules, a benchmark for evaluating autonomous driving systems in stochastic environments under prioritized multi-objective specifications. We first formalize a diverse set of objectives to serve as quantitative evaluation metrics. Next, we design a Hierarchical Rulebook framework that encodes multiple objectives and their priority relations in an interpretable and adaptable manner. We then construct a compact yet representative collection of scenarios spanning diverse driving contexts and near-accident situations, formally modeled in the Scenic language. Experimental results show that our formalized objectives and Hierarchical Rulebooks align well with human driving judgments and that our benchmark effectively exposes agent failures with respect to the prioritized objectives.

*Théo Ayral,Saifeddine Aloui,Mathieu Grossard*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper presents a hybrid approach combining learning and model-based methods to stabilize in-hand object slips using a multifingered robotic gripper.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to improve robotic in-hand manipulation by quickly and robustly halting object slips to enhance control performance and stability.

Method: A hybrid framework integrates piezoelectric sensors for fast slip detection and piezoresistive arrays for contact localization, coupled with a force adjustment pipeline governed by a quadratic program.

Result: The system achieves slip detection within 20 ms and theoretical sensing-to-command latency of 35-40 ms, demonstrating closed-loop stabilization under external disturbances.

Conclusion: Combining analytic force control with learned tactile cues results in both fast and robust in-hand stabilization, with potential for sub-50 ms reaction times.

Abstract: We present a hybrid learning and model-based approach that adapts internal grasp forces to halt in-hand slip on a multifingered robotic gripper. A multimodal tactile stack combines piezoelectric (PzE) sensing for fast slip cues with piezoresistive (PzR) arrays for contact localization, enabling online construction of the grasp matrix. Upon slip, we update internal forces computed in the null space of the grasp via a quadratic program that preserves the object wrench while enforcing actuation limits. The pipeline yields a theoretical sensing-to-command latency of 35-40 ms, with 5 ms for PzR-based contact and geometry updates and about 4 ms for the quadratic program solve. In controlled trials, slip onset is detected at 20ms. We demonstrate closed-loop stabilization on multifingered grasps under external perturbations. Augmenting efficient analytic force control with learned tactile cues yields both robustness and rapid reactions, as confirmed in our end-to-end evaluation. Measured delays are dominated by the experimental data path rather than actual computation. The analysis outlines a clear route to sub-50 ms closed-loop stabilization.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To automate the process of aligning a forklift's fork with a pallet hole, which currently requires precise manual control of height, reach, and tilt.

Method: Proposed an image measurement method using a wide-angle camera to detect pallet pitch inclination and an easy calibration approach between camera and fork coordinate systems. Experiments were conducted with wide-angle images on a reach type forklift.

Result: Experimental results showed the proposed methods provided accurate measurements within an acceptable error range for safe fork insertion.

Conclusion: The proposed methods enable autonomous guided forklifts (AGFs) to align and insert their forks safely, thereby facilitating pallet handling automation.

Abstract: In order to insert a fork into a hole of a pallet by a forklift located in front of a pallet, it is necessary to control the height position, reach position, and tilt angle of the fork to match the position and orientation of the hole of the pallet. In order to make AGF (Autonomous Guided Forklift) do this automatically, we propose an image measurement method to measure the pitch inclination of the pallet in the camera coordinate system from an image obtained by using a wide-angle camera. In addition, we propose an image measurement method to easily acquire the calibration information between the camera coordinate system and the fork coordinate system necessary to apply the measurements in the camera coordinate system to the fork control. In the experiment space, a wide-angle camera was fixed at the backrest of a reach type forklift. The wide-angle images taken by placing a pallet in front of the camera were processed. As a result of evaluating the error by comparing the image measurement value with the hand measurement value when changing the pitch inclination angle of the pallet, the relative height of the pallet and the fork, and whether the pallet is loaded or not, it was confirmed that the error was within the allowable range for safely inserting the fork.

Result: Achieved over 90% accuracy in classifying inspection tasks as success, failure, or anomaly and real-time deployment on Boston Dynamics Spot, outperforming human timing.

Conclusion: The framework demonstrates promise in robust, anticipatory failure detection for autonomous inspection and provides value in improving training data quality for machine learning models.

Abstract: Autonomous inspection robots for monitoring industrial sites can reduce costs and risks associated with human-led inspection. However, accurate readings can be challenging due to occlusions, limited viewpoints, or unexpected environmental conditions. We propose a hybrid framework that combines supervised failure classification with anomaly detection, enabling classification of inspection tasks as a success, known failure, or anomaly (i.e., out-of-distribution) case. Our approach uses a world model backbone with compressed video inputs. This policy-agnostic, distribution-free framework determines classifications based on two decision functions set by conformal prediction (CP) thresholds before a human observer does. We evaluate the framework on gauge inspection feeds collected from office and industrial sites and demonstrate real-time deployment on a Boston Dynamics Spot. Experiments show over 90% accuracy in distinguishing between successes, failures, and OOD cases, with classifications occurring earlier than a human observer. These results highlight the potential for robust, anticipatory failure detection in autonomous inspection tasks or as a feedback signal for model training to assess and improve the quality of training data.

Abstract: Robots executing iterative tasks in complex, uncertain environments require control strategies that balance robustness, safety, and high performance. This paper introduces a safe information-theoretic learning model predictive control (SIT-LMPC) algorithm for iterative tasks. Specifically, we design an iterative control framework based on an information-theoretic model predictive control algorithm to address a constrained infinite-horizon optimal control problem for discrete-time nonlinear stochastic systems. An adaptive penalty method is developed to ensure safety while balancing optimality. Trajectories from previous iterations are utilized to learn a value function using normalizing flows, which enables richer uncertainty modeling compared to Gaussian priors. SIT-LMPC is designed for highly parallel execution on graphics processing units, allowing efficient real-time optimization. Benchmark simulations and hardware experiments demonstrate that SIT-LMPC iteratively improves system performance while robustly satisfying system constraints.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional multi-robot SLAM systems face difficulties in establishing data association due to issues like perceptual aliasing, varying perspectives, or unreliable fiducial markers under harsh conditions, necessitating a more robust and adaptable system.

Method: The authors integrate deep learning-based 6D pose estimation within a decentralized multi-robot SLAM framework to enable markerless robot localization and enhance relative accuracy.

Result: Experimental validation was conducted in a planetary analog environment, demonstrating the improved localization accuracy and reliability of the proposed solution.

Conclusion: The proposed markerless deep learning-based pose estimation solution effectively enhances data association and localization accuracy in multi-robot SLAM systems under challenging conditions.

Abstract: The capability of multi-robot SLAM approaches to merge localization history and maps from different observers is often challenged by the difficulty in establishing data association. Loop closure detection between perceptual inputs of different robotic agents is easily compromised in the context of perceptual aliasing, or when perspectives differ significantly. For this reason, direct mutual observation among robots is a powerful way to connect partial SLAM graphs, but often relies on the presence of calibrated arrays of fiducial markers (e.g., AprilTag arrays), which severely limits the range of observations and frequently fails under sharp lighting conditions, e.g., reflections or overexposure. In this work, we propose a novel solution to this problem leveraging recent advances in Deep-Learning-based 6D pose estimation. We feature markerless pose estimation as part of a decentralized multi-robot SLAM system and demonstrate the benefit to the relative localization accuracy among the robotic team. The solution is validated experimentally on data recorded in a test field campaign on a planetary analogous environment.

Result: Achieved high predictive accuracy: R2 of 0.9425 for static models and R2 of 0.9956 for dynamic models.

Conclusion: The findings provide tools for optimization and robust adaptive control strategies in biohybrid robotics, enhancing functionality and predictability.

Abstract: Skeletal muscle-based biohybrid actuators have proved to be a promising component in soft robotics, offering efficient movement. However, their intrinsic biological variability and nonlinearity pose significant challenges for controllability and predictability. To address these issues, this study investigates the application of supervised learning, a form of machine learning, to model and predict the behavior of biohybrid machines (BHMs), focusing on a muscle ring anchored on flexible polymer pillars. First, static prediction models (i.e., random forest and neural network regressors) are trained to estimate the maximum exerted force achieved from input variables such as muscle sample, electrical stimulation parameters, and baseline exerted force. Second, a dynamic modeling framework, based on Long Short-Term Memory networks, is developed to serve as a digital twin, replicating the time series of exerted forces observed in response to electrical stimulation. Both modeling approaches demonstrate high predictive accuracy. The best performance of the static models is characterized by R2 of 0.9425, whereas the dynamic model achieves R2 of 0.9956. The static models can enable optimization of muscle actuator performance for targeted applications and required force outcomes, while the dynamic model provides a foundation for developing robustly adaptive control strategies in future biohybrid robotic systems.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to ensure safe and high-performance inter-robot collaboration during payload transportation, particularly in limited environments.

Method: The paper models collaborative transportation as a fully cooperative constrained Markov game, using a cost-advantage decomposition method for safety and a constraint allocation method for autonomous task assignment.

Result: Simulation and experimental results showcase improved performance and higher success rates in collaborative transportation compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: The approach achieves effective and safe transportation by advancing robot collaboration capabilities, especially in challenging environments.

Abstract: Collaborative transportation, where multiple robots collaboratively transport a payload, has garnered significant attention in recent years. While ensuring safe and high-performance inter-robot collaboration is critical for effective task execution, it is difficult to pursue in narrow environments where the feasible region is extremely limited. To address this challenge, we propose a novel approach for dual-quadruped collaborative transportation via safe reinforcement learning (RL). Specifically, we model the task as a fully cooperative constrained Markov game, where collision avoidance is formulated as constraints. We introduce a cost-advantage decomposition method that enforces the sum of team constraints to remain below an upper bound, thereby guaranteeing task safety within an RL framework. Furthermore, we propose a constraint allocation method that assigns shared constraints to individual robots to maximize the overall task reward, encouraging autonomous task-assignment among robots, thereby improving collaborative task performance. Simulation and real-time experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves superior performance and a higher success rate in dual-quadruped collaborative transportation compared to existing methods.

Result: MoMa-SG was validated on two datasets, including the newly introduced Arti4D-Semantic dataset with hierarchical semantics, showing its robust performance. Real-world demonstrations showcased successful manipulation of articulated objects by robots in home environments.

Conclusion: The proposed framework, MoMa-SG, enhances the manipulation capabilities of robots in real-world settings by accurately combining semantics and kinematic understanding of articulated objects. The introduction of the Arti4D-Semantic dataset further contributes to advancing research in this domain.

Abstract: Semantics has enabled 3D scene understanding and affordance-driven object interaction. However, robots operating in real-world environments face a critical limitation: they cannot anticipate how objects move. Long-horizon mobile manipulation requires closing the gap between semantics, geometry, and kinematics. In this work, we present MoMa-SG, a novel framework for building semantic-kinematic 3D scene graphs of articulated scenes containing a myriad of interactable objects. Given RGB-D sequences containing multiple object articulations, we temporally segment object interactions and infer object motion using occlusion-robust point tracking. We then lift point trajectories into 3D and estimate articulation models using a novel unified twist estimation formulation that robustly estimates revolute and prismatic joint parameters in a single optimization pass. Next, we associate objects with estimated articulations and detect contained objects by reasoning over parent-child relations at identified opening states. We also introduce the novel Arti4D-Semantic dataset, which uniquely combines hierarchical object semantics including parent-child relation labels with object axis annotations across 62 in-the-wild RGB-D sequences containing 600 object interactions and three distinct observation paradigms. We extensively evaluate the performance of MoMa-SG on two datasets and ablate key design choices of our approach. In addition, real-world experiments on both a quadruped and a mobile manipulator demonstrate that our semantic-kinematic scene graphs enable robust manipulation of articulated objects in everyday home environments.

TL;DR: The paper presents a Bayesian framework for identifying robot states and parameters precisely, paired with scalable implementations and proven benefits in robotics applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The research was motivated by the need to improve the precision of robot trajectory and parameter estimation, addressing challenges such as friction modeling, parameter observability, and dynamic consistency to enhance control and functionality.

Method: A Bayesian system identification framework was developed, incorporating inverse dynamics, contact constraints, and advanced models, with scalable algorithms ensuring efficient computations and accurate parameter estimation.

Result: Through simulations and hardware experiments, the framework demonstrated faster convergence, reduced parameter estimation errors, and better contact consistency when compared to existing techniques.

Conclusion: This framework improves state and parameter estimation, enhances contact modeling, and delivers measurable benefits to predictive control applications, such as improved performance in robot locomotion over complex terrains.

Abstract: We introduce a Bayesian system identification (SysID) framework for jointly estimating robot's state trajectories and physical parameters with high accuracy. It embeds physically consistent inverse dynamics, contact and loop-closure constraints, and fully featured joint friction models as hard, stage-wise equality constraints. It relies on energy-based regressors to enhance parameter observability, supports both equality and inequality priors on inertial and actuation parameters, enforces dynamically consistent disturbance projections, and augments proprioceptive measurements with energy observations to disambiguate nonlinear friction effects. To ensure scalability, we derive a parameterized equality-constrained Riccati recursion that preserves the banded structure of the problem, achieving linear complexity in the time horizon, and develop computationally efficient derivatives. Simulation studies on representative robotic systems, together with hardware experiments on a Unitree B1 equipped with a Z1 arm, demonstrate faster convergence, lower inertial and friction estimation errors, and improved contact consistency compared to forward-dynamics and decoupled identification baselines. When deployed within model predictive control frameworks, the resulting models yield measurable improvements in tracking performance during locomotion over challenging environments.

TL;DR: This paper demonstrates a resident underwater monitoring system using a docking station and an autonomous mini-class ROV, achieving significant success in autonomous docking and inspection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current underwater monitoring is limited due to high costs and logistical challenges, requiring solutions for persistent, autonomous operations in remote and harsh conditions.

Method: The authors developed a resident infrastructure featuring a docking station at 90m depth and an autonomous mini-class ROV equipped with enhanced onboard processing, USBL navigation, and ArUco marker-based docking capabilities.

Result: The system achieved a 90% success rate in autonomous docking and completed inspection missions in four minutes, validating its effectiveness in real-world underwater conditions.

Conclusion: Reliable, untethered underwater operations are feasible with this system, offering scalable and cost-effective solutions for ocean monitoring.

Abstract: Our understanding of the oceans remains limited by sparse and infrequent observations, primarily because current methods are constrained by the high cost and logistical effort of underwater monitoring, relying either on sporadic surveys across broad areas or on long-term measurements at fixed locations. To overcome these limitations, monitoring systems must enable persistent and autonomous operations without the need for continuous surface support. Despite recent advances, resident underwater vehicles remain uncommon due to persistent challenges in autonomy, robotic resilience, and mechanical robustness, particularly under long-term deployment in harsh and remote environments. This work addresses these problems by presenting the development, deployment, and operation of a resident infrastructure using a docking station with a mini-class Remotely Operated Vehicle (ROV) at 90m depth. The ROVis equipped with enhanced onboard processing and perception, allowing it to autonomously navigate using USBL signals, dock via ArUco marker-based visual localisation fused through an Extended Kalman Filter, and carry out local inspection routines. The system demonstrated a 90% autonomous docking success rate and completed full inspection missions within four minutes, validating the integration of acoustic and visual navigation in real-world conditions. These results show that reliable, untethered operations at depth are feasible, highlighting the potential of resident ROV systems for scalable, cost-effective underwater monitoring.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Overcoming challenges in flexible endoscopic systems such as inaccurate pose estimation and control due to compliance, hysteresis, and sensor limitations.

Method: Developing a markerless stereo-based 6D pose estimation model using a multi-feature fusion network, photorealistic simulation for training, and a self-supervised sim-to-real adaptation strategy.

Result: Highly precise real-world outcomes: 0.83 mm translation error, 2.76° rotation error for pose estimation, and accurate trajectory tracking with significant error reductions in closed-loop control.

Conclusion: The research delivers the first markerless pose-estimation-driven visual servoing framework for continuum manipulators, achieving accurate, repeatable control without relying on physical markers or embedded sensors.

Abstract: Continuum manipulators in flexible endoscopic surgical systems offer high dexterity for minimally invasive procedures; however, accurate pose estimation and closed-loop control remain challenging due to hysteresis, compliance, and limited distal sensing. Vision-based approaches reduce hardware complexity but are often constrained by limited geometric observability and high computational overhead, restricting real-time closed-loop applicability. This paper presents a unified framework for markerless stereo 6D pose estimation and position-based visual servoing of continuum manipulators. A photo-realistic simulation pipeline enables large-scale automatic training with pixel-accurate annotations. A stereo-aware multi-feature fusion network jointly exploits segmentation masks, keypoints, heatmaps, and bounding boxes to enhance geometric observability. To enforce geometric consistency without iterative optimization, a feed-forward rendering-based refinement module predicts residual pose corrections in a single pass. A self-supervised sim-to-real adaptation strategy further improves real-world performance using unlabeled data. Extensive real-world validation achieves a mean translation error of 0.83 mm and a mean rotation error of 2.76° across 1,000 samples. Markerless closed-loop visual servoing driven by the estimated pose attains accurate trajectory tracking with a mean translation error of 2.07 mm and a mean rotation error of 7.41°, corresponding to 85% and 59% reductions compared to open-loop control, together with high repeatability in repeated point-reaching tasks. To the best of our knowledge, this work presents the first fully markerless pose-estimation-driven position-based visual servoing framework for continuum manipulators, enabling precise closed-loop control without physical markers or embedded sensing.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To advance scalable modeling and control methods for soft quadruped robots by addressing challenges in integrating deformable, continuum soft legs with rigid-body locomotion dynamics.

Method: The authors developed a modular whole-body modeling framework using Cosserat rod theory for compliant leg dynamics, integrated with convex model predictive control for efficient locomotion and real-time control.

Result: The proposed framework demonstrated high accuracy (less than 5 mm RMSE) in locomotion tasks and successfully achieved asymptotic stability during crawling and walking experiments.

Conclusion: This research presents a generalizable, physics-informed modeling and control approach for soft quadruped robots with compliant legs, enabling scalable and reusable methods for advanced locomotion control.

Abstract: SLOT (Soft Legged Omnidirectional Tetrapod), a tendon-driven soft quadruped robot with 3D-printed TPU legs, is presented to study physics-informed modeling and control of compliant legged locomotion using only four actuators. Each leg is modeled as a deformable continuum using discrete Cosserat rod theory, enabling the capture of large bending deformations, distributed elasticity, tendon actuation, and ground contact interactions. A modular whole-body modeling framework is introduced, in which compliant leg dynamics are represented through physically consistent reaction forces applied to a rigid torso, providing a scalable interface between continuum soft limbs and rigid-body locomotion dynamics. This formulation allows efficient whole-body simulation and real-time control without sacrificing physical fidelity. The proposed model is embedded into a convex model predictive control framework that optimizes ground reaction forces over a 0.495 s prediction horizon and maps them to tendon actuation through a physics-informed force-angle relationship. The resulting controller achieves asymptotic stability under diverse perturbations. The framework is experimentally validated on a physical prototype during crawling and walking gaits, achieving high accuracy with less than 5 mm RMSE in center of mass trajectories. These results demonstrate a generalizable approach for integrating continuum soft legs into model-based locomotion control, advancing scalable and reusable modeling and control methods for soft quadruped robots.

TL;DR: RoboGene automates the generation of physically feasible and diverse manipulation tasks for robots, surpassing existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The scarcity of diverse real-world interaction data limits the development of general-purpose robotic manipulation, while current methods for task curation are unscalable or biased.

Method: RoboGene employs diversity-driven sampling, self-reflection mechanisms for constraints, and human-in-the-loop refinement to generate feasible tasks.

Result: The framework collects 18k trajectory datasets, introduces new metrics for task evaluation, and performs better than state-of-the-art models (e.g., GPT-4o, Gemini 2.5 Pro).

Conclusion: RoboGene enhances task generation quality and boosts pre-trained model performance, optimizing real-world robotic manipulation.

Abstract: The pursuit of general-purpose robotic manipulation is hindered by the scarcity of diverse, real-world interaction data. Unlike data collection from web in vision or language, robotic data collection is an active process incurring prohibitive physical costs. Consequently, automated task curation to maximize data value remains a critical yet under-explored challenge. Existing manual methods are unscalable and biased toward common tasks, while off-the-shelf foundation models often hallucinate physically infeasible instructions. To address this, we introduce RoboGene, an agentic framework designed to automate the generation of diverse, physically plausible manipulation tasks across single-arm, dual-arm, and mobile robots. RoboGene integrates three core components: diversity-driven sampling for broad task coverage, self-reflection mechanisms to enforce physical constraints, and human-in-the-loop refinement for continuous improvement. We conduct extensive quantitative analysis and large-scale real-world experiments, collecting datasets of 18k trajectories and introducing novel metrics to assess task quality, feasibility, and diversity. Results demonstrate that RoboGene significantly outperforms state-of-the-art foundation models (e.g., GPT-4o, Gemini 2.5 Pro). Furthermore, real-world experiments show that VLA models pre-trained with RoboGene achieve higher success rates and superior generalization, underscoring the importance of high-quality task generation.

TL;DR: This paper integrates dynamic mapping with reactive motion planning for manipulators by explicitly modeling obstacle velocities and covariance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Ensure safe and reactive motion generation in dynamic and unstructured environments with improved obstacle modeling and uncertainty handling.

Method: Develop a dynamic representation via tensorized particle weight update and integrate it into obstacle-aware MPPI-based planning, enabling predictive evaluation under uncertainty.

Result: Simulation and real-world experiments show improved safety and reactivity in dynamic environments compared to existing MPPI-based frameworks.

Conclusion: Explicit modeling of robot-obstacle dynamics enhances the performance of reactive planning systems in challenging scenarios.

Abstract: Reactive motion generation in dynamic and unstructured scenarios is typically subject to essentially static perception and system dynamics. Reliably modeling dynamic obstacles and optimizing collision-free trajectories under perceptive and control uncertainty are challenging. This article focuses on revealing tight connection between reactive planning and dynamic mapping for manipulators from a model-based perspective. To enable efficient particle-based perception with expressively dynamic property, we present a tensorized particle weight update scheme that explicitly maintains obstacle velocities and covariance meanwhile. Building upon this dynamic representation, we propose an obstacle-aware MPPI-based planning formulation that jointly propagates robot-obstacle dynamics, allowing future system motion to be predicted and evaluated under uncertainty. The model predictive method is shown to significantly improve safety and reactivity with dynamic surroundings. By applying our complete framework in simulated and noisy real-world environments, we demonstrate that explicit modeling of robot-obstacle dynamics consistently enhances performance over state-of-the-art MPPI-based perception-planning baselines avoiding multiple static and dynamic obstacles.

*Osher Azulay,Zhengjie Xu,Andrew Scheffer,Stella X. Yu*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper proposes a unified fall recovery approach for humanoid robots that spans all phases of fall safety using perceptual-motor integration and transferable poses from flat to complex terrain.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Humanoid robots face challenges during falls due to complex dynamics and environmental interactions, necessitating reliable fall recovery to ensure operational continuity in cluttered settings.

Method: The method employs sparse human demonstrations on flat and simulated complex terrains to train a privileged teacher model. A deployable student model is distilled, relying purely on egocentric depth and proprioception, and encoding goal-in-context latent representations for robust reactions.

Result: Simulation and physical tests on the Unitree G1 humanoid showed robust fall recovery across diverse terrains, achieving zero-shot performance without requiring real-world fine-tuning.

Conclusion: The approach integrates constrained human poses and perceptual-motor representations, enabling effective and scalable fall safety, generalizing across varying terrains and conditions.

Abstract: Reliable fall recovery is critical for humanoids operating in cluttered environments. Unlike quadrupeds or wheeled robots, humanoids experience high-energy impacts, complex whole-body contact, and large viewpoint changes during a fall, making recovery essential for continued operation. Existing methods fragment fall safety into separate problems such as fall avoidance, impact mitigation, and stand-up recovery, or rely on end-to-end policies trained without vision through reinforcement learning or imitation learning, often on flat terrain. At a deeper level, fall safety is treated as monolithic data complexity, coupling pose, dynamics, and terrain and requiring exhaustive coverage, limiting scalability and generalization. We present a unified fall safety approach that spans all phases of fall recovery. It builds on two insights: 1) Natural human fall and recovery poses are highly constrained and transferable from flat to complex terrain through alignment, and 2) Fast whole-body reactions require integrated perceptual-motor representations. We train a privileged teacher using sparse human demonstrations on flat terrain and simulated complex terrains, and distill it into a deployable student that relies only on egocentric depth and proprioception. The student learns how to react by matching the teacher's goal-in-context latent representation, which combines the next target pose with the local terrain, rather than separately encoding what it must perceive and how it must act. Results in simulation and on a real Unitree G1 humanoid demonstrate robust, zero-shot fall safety across diverse non-flat environments without real-world fine-tuning.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper proposes a decentralized approach for robot teams to perform range-aided localization and formation control, achieving high accuracy without strict coordination or reliance on external systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Centralized control systems for multi-robot teams struggle with scalability and reliance on external localization systems, prompting the need for decentralized, efficient solutions for localization and formation control.

Method: The authors developed a block coordinate descent method for decentralized localization, combined with a factor graph-based formulation for formation control that incorporates state estimation uncertainty.

Result: The approach achieved decimeter-level accuracy in positioning and formation control, validated through real-world experiments in indoor and outdoor environments.

Conclusion: The proposed method showcases the feasibility of decentralized, accurate, and efficient robot team localization and formation control without reliance on external systems or highly coordinated behavior.

Abstract: Controlling a team of robots in a coordinated manner is challenging because centralized approaches (where all computation is performed on a central machine) scale poorly, and globally referenced external localization systems may not always be available. In this work, we consider the problem of range-aided decentralized localization and formation control. In such a setting, each robot estimates its relative pose by combining data only from onboard odometry sensors and distance measurements to other robots in the team. Additionally, each robot calculates the control inputs necessary to collaboratively navigate an environment to accomplish a specific task, for example, moving in a desired formation while monitoring an area. We present a block coordinate descent approach to localization that does not require strict coordination between the robots. We present a novel formulation for formation control as inference on factor graphs that takes into account the state estimation uncertainty and can be solved efficiently. Our approach to range-aided localization and formation-based navigation is completely decentralized, does not require specialized trajectories to maintain formation, and achieves decimeter-level positioning and formation control accuracy. We demonstrate our approach through multiple real experiments involving formation flights in diverse indoor and outdoor environments.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper presents a method to determine sensor schedules and covariances needed to achieve specific trajectory estimation accuracies, considering constraints like cost and resources.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance trajectory estimation accuracy under constraints of resources, such as sensor measurement rate and noise covariance, by systematically determining achievable parameters.

Method: The researchers propose semidefinite programming to estimate the sensor rate and covariance required for achieving specified estimation accuracy. Simulations and real experiments validate the method.

Result: Their approach determines sensor schedules and covariances that meet accuracy objectives and identifies cases where such accuracy is unattainable due to system limitations.

Conclusion: The method effectively calculates sensor configurations for desired performance and provides insight into the feasibility of achieving certain accuracy, subject to system and sensor limitations.

Abstract: Trajectory estimation involves determining the trajectory of a mobile robot by combining prior knowledge about its dynamic model with noisy observations of its state obtained using sensors. The accuracy of such a procedure is dictated by the system model fidelity and the sensor parameters, such as the accuracy of the sensor (as represented by its noise covariance) and the rate at which it can generate observations, referred to as the sensor query schedule. Intuitively, high-rate measurements from accurate sensors lead to accurate trajectory estimation. However, cost and resource constraints limit the sensor accuracy and its measurement rate. Our work's novel contribution is the estimation of sensor schedules and sensor covariances necessary to achieve a specific estimation accuracy. Concretely, we focus on estimating: (i) the rate or schedule with which a sensor of known covariance must generate measurements to achieve specific estimation accuracy, and alternatively, (ii) the sensor covariance necessary to achieve specific estimation accuracy for a given sensor update rate. We formulate the problem of estimating these sensor parameters as semidefinite programs, which can be solved by off-the-shelf solvers. We validate our approach in simulation and real experiments by showing that the sensor schedules and the sensor covariances calculated using our proposed method achieve the desired trajectory estimation accuracy. Our method also identifies scenarios where certain estimation accuracy is unachievable with the given system and sensor characteristics.

*Xihan Ma,Haichong Zhang*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper addresses challenges in traditional ultrasound imaging for kidney diagnosis by proposing an autonomous robotic system that improves efficiency and imaging accuracy through template-guided pivoting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current ultrasound methods for kidney diagnosis are inconsistent, operator-dependent, lack 3D localization, and pose ergonomic risks to operators. Robotic systems exist but lack efficient imaging strategies.

Method: Authors developed an autonomous workflow where a robotic ultrasound system explores and maps kidney observations to a template for pose estimation, then conducts optimal pivoting sweeps for efficient imaging of kidneys.

Result: Simulations showed a balance at 60% exploration for efficiency and accuracy, while in-vivo tests demonstrated localization accuracy up to 7.36 mm and reduced probe footprint by 75 mm.

Conclusion: The proposed approach effectively uses anatomical templates for robotic ultrasound imaging, standardizing kidney coverage, reducing unnecessary movements, and improving efficiency.

Abstract: Medical ultrasound (US) imaging is a frontline tool for the diagnosis of kidney diseases. However, traditional freehand imaging procedure suffers from inconsistent, operator-dependent outcomes, lack of 3D localization information, and risks of work-related musculoskeletal disorders. While robotic ultrasound (RUS) systems offer the potential for standardized, operator-independent 3D kidney data acquisition, the existing scanning methods lack the ability to determine the optimal imaging window for efficient imaging. As a result, the scan is often blindly performed with excessive probe footprint, which frequently leads to acoustic shadowing and incomplete organ coverage. Consequently, there is a critical need for a spatially efficient imaging technique that can maximize the kidney coverage through minimum probe footprint. Here, we propose an autonomous workflow to achieve efficient kidney imaging via template-guided optimal pivoting. The system first performs an explorative imaging to generate partial observations of the kidney. This data is then registered to a kidney template to estimate the organ pose. With the kidney localized, the robot executes a fixed-point pivoting sweep where the imaging plane is aligned with the kidney long axis to minimize the probe translation. The proposed method was validated in simulation and in-vivo. Simulation results indicate that a 60% exploration ratio provides optimal balance between kidney localization accuracy and scanning efficiency. In-vivo evaluation on two male subjects demonstrates a kidney localization accuracy up to 7.36 mm and 13.84 degrees. Moreover, the optimal pivoting approach shortened the probe footprint by around 75 mm when compared with the baselines. These results valid our approach of leveraging anatomical templates to align the probe optimally for volumetric sweep.

Result: The proposed system is evaluated in simulations and in a physical robot's zero-shot setup, showing improved performance and generalization in handling various cloth types and unfolding tasks.

Conclusion: The modified approach successfully addresses the complexities of cloth manipulation, marking progress in generalized robotic capabilities for deformable object handling.

Abstract: Learning to manipulate cloth is both a paradigmatic problem for robotic research and a problem of immediate relevance to a variety of applications ranging from assistive care to the service industry. The complex physics of the deformable object makes this problem of cloth manipulation nontrivial. In order to create a general manipulation strategy that addresses a variety of shapes, sizes, fold and wrinkle patterns, in addition to the usual problems of appearance variations, it becomes important to carefully consider model structure and their implications for generalisation performance. In this paper, we present an approach to in-air cloth manipulation that uses a variation of a recently proposed reinforcement learning architecture, DreamerV2. Our implementation modifies this architecture to utilise surface normals input, in addition to modiying the replay buffer and data augmentation procedures. Taken together these modifications represent an enhancement to the world model used by the robot, addressing the physical complexity of the object being manipulated by the robot. We present evaluations both in simulation and in a zero-shot deployment of the trained policies in a physical robot setup, performing in-air unfolding of a variety of different cloth types, demonstrating the generalisation benefits of our proposed architecture.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address the limitations of existing methods for object loco-manipulation in humanoid robots, which struggle with generalization due to the difficulty of collecting large-scale, real-world training datasets.

Method: The paper proposes a residual-aware end-effector (EE) tracking policy that merges classical robotics techniques with machine learning. It uses inverse kinematics, a forward neural model, goal adjustment, and replanning. It also leverages open-vocabulary large vision models for visual generalization.

Result: HERO reduced end-effector tracking error by 3.2x, enabling the robot to manipulate diverse objects reliably in real-world settings like offices and coffee shops, demonstrating significant advancements in loco-manipulation performance.

Conclusion: The research presents a promising step toward more capable humanoid robots by combining visual generalization and control precision, potentially reshaping approaches to training robots for daily object interaction.

Abstract: Visual loco-manipulation of arbitrary objects in the wild with humanoid robots requires accurate end-effector (EE) control and a generalizable understanding of the scene via visual inputs (e.g., RGB-D images). Existing approaches are based on real-world imitation learning and exhibit limited generalization due to the difficulty in collecting large-scale training datasets. This paper presents a new paradigm, HERO, for object loco-manipulation with humanoid robots that combines the strong generalization and open-vocabulary understanding of large vision models with strong control performance from simulated training. We achieve this by designing an accurate residual-aware EE tracking policy. This EE tracking policy combines classical robotics with machine learning. It uses a) inverse kinematics to convert residual end-effector targets into reference trajectories, b) a learned neural forward model for accurate forward kinematics, c) goal adjustment, and d) replanning. Together, these innovations help us cut down the end-effector tracking error by 3.2x. We use this accurate end-effector tracker to build a modular system for loco-manipulation, where we use open-vocabulary large vision models for strong visual generalization. Our system is able to operate in diverse real-world environments, from offices to coffee shops, where the robot is able to reliably manipulate various everyday objects (e.g., mugs, apples, toys) on surfaces ranging from 43cm to 92cm in height. Systematic modular and end-to-end tests in simulation and the real world demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed design. We believe the advances in this paper can open up new ways of training humanoid robots to interact with daily objects.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address the challenge of effectively utilizing large-scale human behavioral data for fine-grained, high-degree-of-freedom dexterous robotic manipulation.

Method: They develop a Vision Language Action (VLA) model trained on over 20,854 hours of labeled human egocentric video data, uncovering scaling laws, combined with a two-stage transfer process: human pretraining followed by lightweight aligned human-robot mid-training.

Result: The proposed approach resulted in a 54% improvement in success rate over a baseline without pretraining using a 22 DoF robotic hand. It also demonstrated effective transfer to robots with less degrees of freedom.

Conclusion: The findings show that large-scale human motion data acts as a reusable, embodiment-agnostic motor prior, advancing dexterous manipulation capabilities in robotics.

Abstract: Human behavior is among the most scalable sources of data for learning physical intelligence, yet how to effectively leverage it for dexterous manipulation remains unclear. While prior work demonstrates human to robot transfer in constrained settings, it is unclear whether large scale human data can support fine grained, high degree of freedom dexterous manipulation. We present EgoScale, a human to dexterous manipulation transfer framework built on large scale egocentric human data. We train a Vision Language Action (VLA) model on over 20,854 hours of action labeled egocentric human video, more than 20 times larger than prior efforts, and uncover a log linear scaling law between human data scale and validation loss. This validation loss strongly correlates with downstream real robot performance, establishing large scale human data as a predictable supervision source. Beyond scale, we introduce a simple two stage transfer recipe: large scale human pretraining followed by lightweight aligned human robot mid training. This enables strong long horizon dexterous manipulation and one shot task adaptation with minimal robot supervision. Our final policy improves average success rate by 54% over a no pretraining baseline using a 22 DoF dexterous robotic hand, and transfers effectively to robots with lower DoF hands, indicating that large scale human motion provides a reusable, embodiment agnostic motor prior.

Method: A parameterized canonical representation unifies various hand architectures with a unified parameter space, canonical URDF format, and structured latent manifold to facilitate effective policy learning.

Result: Experiments validate the framework's advantages, demonstrating high zero-shot success rates on unseen morphologies (e.g., 81.9% on 3-finger LEAP Hand).

Conclusion: The framework provides a scalable approach for cross-hand learning and universal dexterous manipulation through unified action and representational spaces.

Abstract: Dexterous manipulation policies today largely assume fixed hand designs, severely restricting their generalization to new embodiments with varied kinematic and structural layouts. To overcome this limitation, we introduce a parameterized canonical representation that unifies a broad spectrum of dexterous hand architectures. It comprises a unified parameter space and a canonical URDF format, offering three key advantages. 1) The parameter space captures essential morphological and kinematic variations for effective conditioning in learning algorithms. 2) A structured latent manifold can be learned over our space, where interpolations between embodiments yield smooth and physically meaningful morphology transitions. 3) The canonical URDF standardizes the action space while preserving dynamic and functional properties of the original URDFs, enabling efficient and reliable cross-embodiment policy learning. We validate these advantages through extensive analysis and experiments, including grasp policy replay, VAE latent encoding, and cross-embodiment zero-shot transfer. Specifically, we train a VAE on the unified representation to obtain a compact, semantically rich latent embedding, and develop a grasping policy conditioned on the canonical representation that generalizes across dexterous hands. We demonstrate, through simulation and real-world tasks on unseen morphologies (e.g., 81.9% zero-shot success rate on 3-finger LEAP Hand), that our framework unifies both the representational and action spaces of structurally diverse hands, providing a scalable foundation for cross-hand learning toward universal dexterous manipulation.

### [287] [From Reflection to Repair: A Scoping Review of Dataset Documentation Tools](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15968)
*Pedro Reynolds-Cuéllar,Marisol Wong-Villacres,Adriana Alvarado Garcia,Heila Precel*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper reviews motivations and factors affecting dataset documentation tools, identifying barriers to adoption and proposing institutional solutions for sustainable practices.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand and address the barriers hindering the effective adoption and design of dataset documentation tools.

Method: Systematic review and mixed-methods analysis of 59 publications on dataset documentation.

Result: Identified four barriers to adoption: unclear value of documentation, decontextualized designs, high labor demands, and lack of integration planning.

Conclusion: Proposes shifting the focus of Responsible AI tool design from individuals to institutional solutions, recommending actions for the HCI community to foster sustainable practices.

Abstract: Dataset documentation is widely recognized as essential for the responsible development of automated systems. Despite growing efforts to support documentation through different kinds of artifacts, little is known about the motivations shaping documentation tool design or the factors hindering their adoption. We present a systematic review supported by mixed-methods analysis of 59 dataset documentation publications to examine the motivations behind building documentation tools, how authors conceptualize documentation practices, and how these tools connect to existing systems, regulations, and cultural norms. Our analysis shows four persistent patterns in dataset documentation conceptualization that potentially impede adoption and standardization: unclear operationalizations of documentation's value, decontextualized designs, unaddressed labor demands, and a tendency to treat integration as future work. Building on these findings, we propose a shift in Responsible AI tool design toward institutional rather than individual solutions, and outline actions the HCI community can take to enable sustainable documentation practices.

### [288] [ReLoop: Structured Modeling and Behavioral Verification for Reliable LLM-Based Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15983)
*Junbo Jacob Lian,Yujun Sun,Huiling Chen,Chaoyu Zhang,Chung-Piaw Teo*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: Large language models (LLMs) often produce optimization code with latent errors, leading to significant correctness issues. ReLoop addresses these silent failures through structured generation and behavioral verification, improving code correctness and execution rates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the critical issue of silent failures in code generated by large language models (LLMs), where incorrect formulations can appear correct due to solver feasibility. This creates a significant gap in the reliability of such models for compositional problems.

Method: ReLoop employs a structured generation approach which includes a four-stage reasoning chain: understand, formalize, synthesize, and verify. It integrates explicit variable-type reasoning and self-verification to address formulation errors. Additionally, it uses behavioral verification, testing problem responses to parameter perturbations without needing ground truth.

Result: ReLoop improves code correctness from 22.6% to 31.1% and execution rates from 72.1% to 100.0% when tested on the strongest model. These improvements are consistent across five models from three paradigms and three benchmarks. RetailOpt-190, a new benchmark dataset, is also introduced.

Conclusion: ReLoop effectively combines structured code generation and error detection strategies to mitigate silent failures in optimization code generated by LLMs, and sets new benchmarks for validation and correctness in this domain.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) can translate natural language into optimization code, but silent failures pose a critical risk: code that executes and returns solver-feasible solutions may encode semantically incorrect formulations, creating a feasibility-correctness gap of up to 90 percentage points on compositional problems. We introduce ReLoop, addressing silent failures from two complementary directions. Structured generation decomposes code production into a four-stage reasoning chain (understand, formalize, synthesize, verify) that mirrors expert modeling practice, with explicit variable-type reasoning and self-verification to prevent formulation errors at their source. Behavioral verification detects errors that survive generation by testing whether the formulation responds correctly to solver-based parameter perturbation, without requiring ground truth -- an external semantic signal that bypasses the self-consistency problem inherent in LLM-based code review. The two mechanisms are complementary: structured generation dominates on complex compositional problems, while behavioral verification becomes the largest single contributor on problems with localized formulation defects. Together with execution recovery via IIS-enhanced diagnostics, ReLoop raises correctness from 22.6% to 31.1% and execution from 72.1% to 100.0% on the strongest model, with consistent gains across five models spanning three paradigms (foundation, SFT, RL) and three benchmarks. We additionally release RetailOpt-190, 190 compositional retail optimization scenarios targeting the multi-constraint interactions where LLMs most frequently fail.

### [289] [The Limits of Long-Context Reasoning in Automated Bug Fixing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16069)
*Ravi Raju,Mengmeng Ji,Shubhangi Upasani,Bo Li,Urmish Thakker*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: Current LLMs struggle with genuinely long-context code debugging and patch generation, showing degraded performance despite advancements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess whether the large context lengths of LLMs allow for reliable long-context code debugging and patch generation.

Method: Experimentation using SWE-bench Verified and mini-SWE-agent harness to compare agentic workflows with artificially inflated context settings for long-context testing.

Result: Agentic workflows achieve better results but rely on task decomposition. Long-context tests show sharp performance degradation, with systematic failure modes identified.

Conclusion: There is a disparity between nominal and usable context capacity in LLMs, and current benchmarks fail to measure genuine long-context reasoning capabilities effectively.

Abstract: Rapidly increasing context lengths have led to the assumption that large language models (LLMs) can directly reason over entire codebases. Concurrently, recent advances in LLMs have enabled strong performance on software engineering benchmarks, particularly when paired with agentic workflows. In this work, we systematically evaluate whether current LLMs can reliably perform long-context code debugging and patch generation. Using SWE-bench Verified as a controlled experimental setting, we first evaluate state-of-the-art models within an agentic harness (mini-SWE-agent), where performance improves substantially: GPT-5-nano achieves up to a 31\% resolve rate on 100 samples, and open-source models such as Deepseek-R1-0528 obtain competitive results. However, token-level analysis shows that successful agentic trajectories typically remain under 20k tokens, and that longer accumulated contexts correlate with lower success rates, indicating that agentic success primarily arises from task decomposition into short-context steps rather than effective long-context reasoning. To directly test long-context capability, we construct a data pipeline where we artificially inflate the context length of the input by placing the relevant files into the context (ensuring perfect retrieval recall); we then study single-shot patch generation under genuinely long contexts (64k-128k tokens). Despite this setup, performance degrades sharply: Qwen3-Coder-30B-A3B achieves only a 7\% resolve rate at 64k context, while GPT-5-nano solves none of the tasks. Qualitative analysis reveals systematic failure modes, including hallucinated diffs, incorrect file targets, and malformed patch headers. Overall, our findings highlight a significant gap between nominal context length and usable context capacity in current LLMs, and suggest that existing agentic coding benchmarks do not meaningfully evaluate long-context reasoning.

### [290] [Can Causality Cure Confusion Caused By Correlation (in Software Analytics)?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16091)
*Amirali Rayegan,Tim Menzies*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper addresses the instability in symbolic models, investigating causality-aware split criteria for decision trees to improve stability and robustness without compromising performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Symbolic models, especially decision trees in software engineering, are unstable due to the conflation of association with causation and heuristic reliance in causal discovery algorithms.

Method: The study uses 120+ multi-objective optimization tasks and a bootstrap-ensemble protocol to compare correlational decision trees, causality-aware trees, and human causal assessments.

Result: Causality-aware trees are evaluated for stability through variance analysis and metrics like Gini impurity and Cliff's delta, compared against correlational models and human judgments.

Conclusion: Causality-aware decision trees show promise in addressing stability issues in symbolic models, enhancing trust and reliability in software engineering tasks.

Abstract: Background: Symbolic models, particularly decision trees, are widely used in software engineering for explainable analytics in defect prediction, configuration tuning, and software quality assessment. Most of these models rely on correlational split criteria, such as variance reduction or information gain, which identify statistical associations but cannot imply causation between X and Y. Recent empirical studies in software engineering show that both correlational models and causal discovery algorithms suffer from pronounced instability. This instability arises from two complementary issues: 1-Correlation-based methods conflate association with causation. 2-Causal discovery algorithms rely on heuristic approximations to cope with the NP-hard nature of structure learning, causing their inferred graphs to vary widely under minor input perturbations. Together, these issues undermine trust, reproducibility, and the reliability of explanations in real-world SE tasks. Objective: This study investigates whether incorporating causality-aware split criteria into symbolic models can improve their stability and robustness, and whether such gains come at the cost of predictive or optimization performance. We additionally examine how the stability of human expert judgments compares to that of automated models. Method: Using 120+ multi-objective optimization tasks from the MOOT repository of multi-objective optimization tasks, we evaluate stability through a preregistered bootstrap-ensemble protocol that measures variance with win-score assignments. We compare the stability of human causal assessments with correlation-based decision trees (EZR). We would also compare the causality-aware trees, which leverage conditional-entropy split criteria and confounder filtering. Stability and performance differences are analyzed using statistical methods (variance, Gini Impurity, KS test, Cliff's delta)

### [291] [Algorithm-Based Pipeline for Reliable and Intent-Preserving Code Translation with LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16106)
*Shahriar Rumi Dipto,Saikat Mondal,Chanchal K. Roy*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper introduces an algorithm-based approach for code translation to improve the accuracy and reliability of cross-language programming using a language-neutral intermediate specification, achieving a 10.8% accuracy improvement compared to direct translation methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the shortcomings of direct one-shot code translations that fail to preserve program intent, leading to errors in control flow, type handling, and I/O behavior.

Method: The paper proposes using a language-neutral intermediate specification as part of an algorithm-based pipeline for code translation. Evaluations compare this method against direct translation across five LLMs and test datasets by analyzing compilation success, runtime behavior, and test accuracy.

Result: Results show that the algorithm-based approach improves accuracy from 67.7% to 78.5%, eliminates lexical and token errors entirely, and significantly reduces structural, runtime, and dependency-related failures.

Conclusion: Algorithm-based pipelines enhance the reliability and accuracy of code translation, supporting the development of more robust multilingual programming solutions.

Abstract: Code translation, the automatic conversion of programs between languages, is a growing use case for Large Language Models (LLMs). However, direct one-shot translation often fails to preserve program intent, leading to errors in control flow, type handling, and I/O behavior. We propose an algorithm-based pipeline that introduces a language-neutral intermediate specification to capture these details before code generation. This study empirically evaluates the extent to which structured planning can improve translation accuracy and reliability relative to direct translation. We conduct an automated paired experiment - direct and algorithm-based to translate between Python and Java using five widely used LLMs on the Avatar and CodeNet datasets. For each combination (model, dataset, approach, and direction), we compile and execute the translated program and run the tests provided. We record compilation results, runtime behavior, timeouts (e.g., infinite loop), and test outcomes. We compute accuracy from these tests, counting a translation as correct only if it compiles, runs without exceptions or timeouts, and passes all tests. We then map every failed compile-time and runtime case to a unified, language-aware taxonomy and compare subtype frequencies between the direct and algorithm-based approaches. Overall, the Algorithm-based approach increases micro-average accuracy from 67.7% to 78.5% (10.8% increase). It eliminates lexical and token errors by 100%, reduces incomplete constructs by 72.7%, and structural and declaration issues by 61.1%. It also substantially lowers runtime dependency and entry-point failures by 78.4%. These results demonstrate that algorithm-based pipelines enable more reliable, intent-preserving code translation, providing a foundation for robust multilingual programming assistants.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper investigates how to integrate software services directly into the Asset Administration Shell (AAS), filling a research gap regarding systematic analysis of software-heavy AAS architectures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is driven by the increased role of software in digital manufacturing, particularly with the rise of artificial intelligence and the need to model and integrate services into AAS effectively.

Method: The study conducts a systematic analysis of software architectures that integrate software services within the AAS, comparing them based on software quality criteria and real-world manufacturing use cases.

Result: The paper offers a differentiation and evaluation of architectures for software-heavy AAS, focusing on their performance in manufacturing contexts and software quality assessment.

Conclusion: The findings serve as a guideline for designing and interpreting software-heavy AAS models, applicable in research and practical manufacturing environments.

Abstract: The Asset Administration Shell (AAS) is an emerging technology for the implementation of digital twins in the field of manufacturing. Software is becoming increasingly important, not only in general but specifically in relation to manufacturing, especially with regard to digital manufacturing and a shift towards the usage of artificial intelligence. This increases the need not only to model software, but also to integrate services directly into the AAS. The existing literature contains individual solutions to implement such software-heavy AAS. However, there is no systematic analysis of software architectures that integrate software services directly into the AAS. This paper aims to fill this research gap and differentiate architectures based on software quality criteria as well as typical manufacturing use cases. This work may be considered as an interpretation guideline for software-heavy AAS, both in academia and for practitioners.

### [293] [SPARC: Scenario Planning and Reasoning for Automated C Unit Test Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16671)
*Jaid Monwar Chowdhury,Chi-An Fu,Reyhaneh Jabbarvand*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: SPARC proposes a framework to address challenges in automated unit test generation for C by improving test synthesis and validation using neuro-symbolic approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Automated unit testing for C is challenging due to issues like semantic gaps, failing direct code synthesis attempts, and resulting in non-usable tests with low coverage and irrelevant assertions.

Method: SPARC utilizes a four-stage process: CFG analysis, utility helper grounding via an Operation Map, path-targeted test synthesis, and iterative validation using compiler/runtime feedback.

Result: SPARC achieves better test coverage, mutation scores, and developer-rated readability compared to baseline LLM approaches and symbolic execution tools like KLEE.

Conclusion: SPARC demonstrates potential for scalable industrial-grade testing for legacy C codebases by aligning language models with program structure and semantics.

Abstract: Automated unit test generation for C remains a formidable challenge due to the semantic gap between high-level program intent and the rigid syntactic constraints of pointer arithmetic and manual memory management. While Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit strong generative capabilities, direct intent-to-code synthesis frequently suffers from the leap-to-code failure mode, where models prematurely emit code without grounding in program structure, constraints, and semantics. This will result in non-compilable tests, hallucinated function signatures, low branch coverage, and semantically irrelevant assertions that cannot properly capture bugs. We introduce SPARC, a neuro-symbolic, scenario-based framework that bridges this gap through four stages: (1) Control Flow Graph (CFG) analysis, (2) an Operation Map that grounds LLM reasoning in validated utility helpers, (3) Path-targeted test synthesis, and (4) an iterative, self-correction validation loop using compiler and runtime feedback. We evaluate SPARC on 59 real-world and algorithmic subjects, where it outperforms the vanilla prompt generation baseline by 31.36% in line coverage, 26.01% in branch coverage, and 20.78% in mutation score, matching or exceeding the symbolic execution tool KLEE on complex subjects. SPARC retains 94.3% of tests through iterative repair and produces code with significantly higher developer-rated readability and maintainability. By aligning LLM reasoning with program structure, SPARC provides a scalable path for industrial-grade testing of legacy C codebases.

### [294] [Time-Varying Directed Interactions in Functional Brain Networks: Modeling and Validation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16004)
*Nan Xu,Xiaodi Zhang,Wen-Ju Pan,Jeremy L. Smith,Eric H. Schumacher,Jason W. Allen,Vince D. Calhoun,Shella D. Keilholz*

Main category: q-bio.NC

TL;DR: This paper introduces the SWpC method to analyze time-varying directed functional connectivity in the brain, outperforming traditional approaches in sensitivity and applicability across studies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional methods lack the ability to resolve directional interactions in time-varying brain connectivity, limiting understanding of how information flows in neural networks.

Method: The paper proposes the SWpC method, embedding a linear time-invariant (LTI) model within sliding windows to estimate directed functional connectivity descriptors: strength and duration of information transfer.

Result: SWpC demonstrated stable estimates of directionality in rat experiments, identified task-specific directed connectivity changes in human fMRI studies, and revealed diagnostic patterns in concussion-related disorders.

Conclusion: SWpC is an effective tool for providing biologically meaningful, time-resolved patterns of directed connectivity, advancing neuroscience research and clinical applications.

Abstract: Understanding the dynamic nature of brain connectivity is critical for elucidating neural processing, behavior, and brain disorders. Traditional approaches such as sliding-window correlation (SWC) characterize time-varying undirected associations but do not resolve directional interactions, limiting inference about time-resolved information flow in brain networks. We introduce sliding-window prediction correlation (SWpC), which embeds a directional linear time-invariant (LTI) model within each sliding window to estimate time-varying directed functional connectivity (FC). SWpC yields two complementary descriptors of directed interactions: a strength measure (prediction correlation) and a duration measure (window-wise duration of information transfer). Using concurrent local field potential (LFP) and fMRI BOLD recordings from rat somatosensory cortices, we demonstrate stable directionality estimates in both LFP band-limited power and BOLD. Using Human Connectome Project (HCP) motor task fMRI, SWpC detects significant task-evoked changes in directed FC strength and duration and shows higher sensitivity than SWC for identifying task-evoked connectivity differences. Finally, in post-concussion vestibular dysfunction (PCVD), SWpC reveals reproducible vestibular-multisensory brain-state shifts and improves healthy-control vs subacute patient (HC-ST) discrimination using state-derived features. Together, these results show that SWpC provides biologically interpretable, time-resolved directed connectivity patterns across multimodal validation and clinical application settings, supporting both basic and translational neuroscience.

### [295] [The Representational Alignment Hypothesis: Evidence for and Consequences of Invariant Semantic Structure Across Embedding Modalities](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16584)
*Akhil Ramidi,Kevin Scharp*

Main category: q-bio.NC

TL;DR: The paper investigates the concept of Representational Alignment Hypothesis (RAH), according to which independently trained AI embeddings from text, vision, audio, and neural signals share similar geometries.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore why independently trained AI systems seem to share underlying representations of the world, despite varying data modalities and training procedures.

Method: Analyzes two forms of evidence: (i) internal structure comparison using techniques like representational similarity analysis, and (ii) cross-modal embedding alignment demonstrating near-isomorphism via linear transformations.

Result: Identifies a robust structural correspondence across modalities, suggesting an organizational principle underlies these structures and rebuffs claims connecting them to a 'Platonic reality.'

Conclusion: Suggests rethinking the alignment through a metasemantics framework and proposes methods to distinguish genuinely invariant semantic structures from human-specific ones.

Abstract: There is growing evidence that independently trained AI systems come to represent the world in the same way. In other words, independently trained embeddings from text, vision, audio, and neural signals share an underlying geometry. We call this the Representational Alignment Hypothesis (RAH) and investigate evidence for and consequences of this claim. The evidence is of two kinds: (i) internal structure comparison techniques, such as representational similarity analysis and topological data analysis, reveal matching relational patterns across modalities without explicit mapping; and (ii) methods based on cross-modal embedding alignment, which learn mappings between representation spaces, show that simple linear transformations can bring different embedding spaces into close correspondence, suggesting near-isomorphism. Taken together, the evidence suggests that, even after controlling for trivial commonalities inherent in standard data preprocessing and embedding procedures, a robust structural correspondence persists, hinting at an underlying organizational principle. Some have argued that this result shows that the shared structure is getting at a fundamental, Platonic level of reality. We argue that this conclusion is unjustified. Moreover, we aim to give the idea an alternative philosophical home, rooted in contemporary metasemantics (i.e., theories of what makes a representation and what makes something meaningful) and responses to the symbol grounding problem. We conclude by considering the scope of the RAH and proposing new ways of distinguishing semantic structures that are genuinely invariant from those that inevitably arise due to the fact that all our data is generated under human-specific conditions on Earth.

*Valentin Dorseuil,Jamal Atif,Olivier Cappé*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper presents a method to evaluate the privacy vulnerability of individual data points without retraining models or simulating attacks, based on leverage scores.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address the challenge of assessing individual data points' exposure to membership inference attacks without incurring high computational costs.

Method: They establish a theoretical connection between MIA risk and leverage scores in a linear setting, extending it to deep learning through a computationally efficient generalization.

Result: The proposed leverage score metric correlates strongly with the success of MIA attacks, as confirmed by empirical evaluations.

Conclusion: Leverage scores serve as a practical and efficient proxy for assessing individual privacy risks in machine learning models.

Abstract: Can the privacy vulnerability of individual data points be assessed without retraining models or explicitly simulating attacks? We answer affirmatively by showing that exposure to membership inference attack (MIA) is fundamentally governed by a data point's influence on the learned model. We formalize this in the linear setting by establishing a theoretical correspondence between individual MIA risk and the leverage score, identifying it as a principled metric for vulnerability. This characterization explains how data-dependent sensitivity translates into exposure, without the computational burden of training shadow models. Building on this, we propose a computationally efficient generalization of the leverage score for deep learning. Empirical evaluations confirm a strong correlation between the proposed score and MIA success, validating this metric as a practical surrogate for individual privacy risk assessment.

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: This paper introduces a graph learning method for Gaussian Graphical Models (GGMs) that integrates node signals and metadata, achieving better clustering outcomes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance graph learning in GGMs by incorporating often-ignored auxiliary node metadata (e.g., textual information) into the estimation process.

Method: A graph learning approach based on Laplacian-constrained GGMs was proposed, alongside a majorization-minimization (MM) algorithm with closed-form updates.

Result: The method significantly improved graph clustering performance on a real-world financial dataset compared to methods relying on single information sources.

Conclusion: Fusing node signals and auxiliary metadata enhances the effectiveness of graph learning in GGMs, demonstrating its practical utility.

Abstract: This paper addresses graph learning in Gaussian Graphical Models (GGMs). In this context, data matrices often come with auxiliary metadata (e.g., textual descriptions associated with each node) that is usually ignored in traditional graph estimation processes. To fill this gap, we propose a graph learning approach based on Laplacian-constrained GGMs that jointly leverages the node signals and such metadata. The resulting formulation yields an optimization problem, for which we develop an efficient majorization-minimization (MM) algorithm with closed-form updates at each iteration. Experimental results on a real-world financial dataset demonstrate that the proposed method significantly improves graph clustering performance compared to state-of-the-art approaches that use either signals or metadata alone, thus illustrating the interest of fusing both sources of information.

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper introduces Stochastic Gradient Lattice Random Walk (SGLRW), a robust Bayesian sampling method addressing issues of sensitivity to minibatch size and gradient noise.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve stochastic-gradient-based Bayesian sampling methods, which often struggle with high sensitivity to minibatch size and gradient noise, thereby limiting their robustness and stability.

Method: The proposed SGLRW extends the Lattice Random Walk discretization and modifies conventional SGLD by introducing stochastic noise only in the off-diagonal elements of the covariance matrix during updates.

Result: SGLRW demonstrates stability under adverse conditions like heavy-tailed gradient noise and shows improved or comparable predictive performance against SGLD in Bayesian regression and classification experiments.

Conclusion: SGLRW effectively counters the challenges associated with SGLD, offering greater robustness to gradient noise and minibatch size while maintaining accuracy and asymptotic correctness.

Abstract: Stochastic-gradient MCMC methods enable scalable Bayesian posterior sampling but often suffer from sensitivity to minibatch size and gradient noise. To address this, we propose Stochastic Gradient Lattice Random Walk (SGLRW), an extension of the Lattice Random Walk discretization. Unlike conventional Stochastic Gradient Langevin Dynamics (SGLD), SGLRW introduces stochastic noise only through the off-diagonal elements of the update covariance; this yields greater robustness to minibatch size while retaining asymptotic correctness. Furthermore, as comparison we analyze a natural analogue of SGLD utilizing gradient clipping. Experimental validation on Bayesian regression and classification demonstrates that SGLRW remains stable in regimes where SGLD fails, including in the presence of heavy-tailed gradient noise, and matches or improves predictive performance.

*Hongyu Chen,David Simchi-Levi,Ruoxuan Xiong*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: This paper addresses the bias in estimating population quantities from MNAR feedback by developing a partial identification framework using linear programs and predictions from pretrained models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To solve the issue of bias in standard estimators caused by MNAR feedback and to overcome the limitations of strong parametric assumptions or unavailable auxiliary variables in existing methods.

Method: The authors propose a partial identification framework using linear programs constrained by observed data and incorporating outcome predictions from pretrained models (like LLMs) as weak shadow variables.

Result: The proposed method performs well in simulations, shrinking identification intervals by 75–83% while maintaining valid coverage under realistic MNAR conditions.

Conclusion: This framework offers a robust and practical way to handle MNAR feedback, using predictive models to tighten bounds and achieve valid coverage.

Abstract: Estimating population quantities such as mean outcomes from user feedback is fundamental to platform evaluation and social science, yet feedback is often missing not at random (MNAR): users with stronger opinions are more likely to respond, so standard estimators are biased and the estimand is not identified without additional assumptions. Existing approaches typically rely on strong parametric assumptions or bespoke auxiliary variables that may be unavailable in practice. In this paper, we develop a partial identification framework in which sharp bounds on the estimand are obtained by solving a pair of linear programs whose constraints encode the observed data structure. This formulation naturally incorporates outcome predictions from pretrained models, including large language models (LLMs), as additional linear constraints that tighten the feasible set. We call these predictions weak shadow variables: they satisfy a conditional independence assumption with respect to missingness but need not meet the completeness conditions required by classical shadow-variable methods. When predictions are sufficiently informative, the bounds collapse to a point, recovering standard identification as a special case. In finite samples, to provide valid coverage of the identified set, we propose a set-expansion estimator that achieves slower-than-$\sqrt{n}$ convergence rate in the set-identified regime and the standard $\sqrt{n}$ rate under point identification. In simulations and semi-synthetic experiments on customer-service dialogues, we find that LLM predictions are often ill-conditioned for classical shadow-variable methods yet remain highly effective in our framework. They shrink identification intervals by 75--83\% while maintaining valid coverage under realistic MNAR mechanisms.

### [300] [Empirical Cumulative Distribution Function Clustering for LLM-based Agent System Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16131)
*Chihiro Watanabe,Jingyu Sun*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: This paper introduces a new evaluation framework using ECDFs and clustering methods to assess the response quality of large language models beyond traditional metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The current standard evaluation process for large language model agents often oversimplifies response quality by focusing on majority voting, obscuring nuances in response distributions.

Method: The authors propose using the empirical cumulative distribution function (ECDF) of cosine similarities between responses and reference answers, combined with $k$-medoids clustering, to analyze response distributions.

Result: Experiments on a QA dataset showed that ECDFs effectively identify differences in response quality distributions and clustering analysis highlights interpretable group structures in responses based on factors like temperature, persona, and question topics.

Conclusion: The proposed ECDF and clustering approach can provide a deeper and more interpretable understanding of response qualities and agent configurations beyond standard evaluation practices.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used as agents to solve complex tasks such as question answering (QA), scientific debate, and software development. A standard evaluation procedure aggregates multiple responses from LLM agents into a single final answer, often via majority voting, and compares it against reference answers. However, this process can obscure the quality and distributional characteristics of the original responses. In this paper, we propose a novel evaluation framework based on the empirical cumulative distribution function (ECDF) of cosine similarities between generated responses and reference answers. This enables a more nuanced assessment of response quality beyond exact match metrics. To analyze the response distributions across different agent configurations, we further introduce a clustering method for ECDFs using their distances and the $k$-medoids algorithm. Our experiments on a QA dataset demonstrate that ECDFs can distinguish between agent settings with similar final accuracies but different quality distributions. The clustering analysis also reveals interpretable group structures in the responses, offering insights into the impact of temperature, persona, and question topics.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a theoretical framework that explains why and how deep neural networks achieve global optimization and generalize well despite their non-convex nature.

Method: Developed a conjugate learning framework leveraging convex conjugate duality and analyzed stochastic gradient descent (SGD) behavior, incorporating factors like eigenvalues, batch size, architecture, and entropy measures.

Result: Provided theoretical convergence results showing SGD attains global optima, established generalization bounds, derived empirical risk limits, and experimentally validated the theory.

Conclusion: The framework offers a comprehensive explanation of training and generalization in DNNs, linking optimization behavior to network architecture and data characteristics while providing predictive insights.

Abstract: In this work, we propose a notion of practical learnability grounded in finite sample settings, and develop a conjugate learning theoretical framework based on convex conjugate duality to characterize this learnability property. Building on this foundation, we demonstrate that training deep neural networks (DNNs) with mini-batch stochastic gradient descent (SGD) achieves global optima of empirical risk by jointly controlling the extreme eigenvalues of a structure matrix and the gradient energy, and we establish a corresponding convergence theorem. We further elucidate the impact of batch size and model architecture (including depth, parameter count, sparsity, skip connections, and other characteristics) on non-convex optimization. Additionally, we derive a model-agnostic lower bound for the achievable empirical risk, theoretically demonstrating that data determines the fundamental limit of trainability. On the generalization front, we derive deterministic and probabilistic bounds on generalization error based on generalized conditional entropy measures. The former explicitly delineates the range of generalization error, while the latter characterizes the distribution of generalization error relative to the deterministic bounds under independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) sampling conditions. Furthermore, these bounds explicitly quantify the influence of three key factors: (i) information loss induced by irreversibility in the model, (ii) the maximum attainable loss value, and (iii) the generalized conditional entropy of features with respect to labels. Moreover, they offer a unified theoretical lens for understanding the roles of regularization, irreversible transformations, and network depth in shaping the generalization behavior of deep neural networks. Extensive experiments validate all theoretical predictions, confirming the framework's correctness and consistency.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate the theoretical properties of GW distance, such as sparsity, permutation support, and cyclical monotonicity, and differentiate it from linear OT.

Method: The study examines the conditionally negative semi-definite property and its implications for GW optimal transport plans.

Result: GW optimal transport plans are shown to be sparse and supported on a permutation when the conditionally negative semi-definite property holds.

Conclusion: The findings highlight unique characteristics of GW distance, offering insights into its theoretical structure in specific conditions.

Abstract: This note gives a self-contained overview of some important properties of the Gromov-Wasserstein (GW) distance, compared with the standard linear optimal transport (OT) framework. More specifically, I explore the following questions: are GW optimal transport plans sparse? Under what conditions are they supported on a permutation? Do they satisfy a form of cyclical monotonicity? In particular, I present the conditionally negative semi-definite property and show that, when it holds, there are GW optimal plans that are sparse and supported on a permutation.

*Yu-Chang Chen,Chen Chian Fuh,Shang En Tsai*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper introduces a method for estimating consumer preferences using partial rankings, logistic choice models, and correcting for exposure bias, yielding better predictions in an online wine retail application.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of understanding individual consumer preferences amidst partial ranking data and exposure bias while providing interpretable and scalable solutions.

Method: The paper integrates logistic choice probabilities with a user-item factor model, incorporates inverse-probability weighting to correct for exposure bias, and uses stochastic gradient descent for computational scalability.

Result: The proposed framework showed improved out-of-sample recommendation performance, especially in predicting purchases of non-previously consumed products.

Conclusion: The approach effectively balances interpretability, bias correction, and scalability, demonstrating utility in real-world ecommerce applications.

Abstract: Estimating consumer preferences is central to many problems in economics and marketing. This paper develops a flexible framework for learning individual preferences from partial ranking information by interpreting observed rankings as collections of pairwise comparisons with logistic choice probabilities. We model latent utility as the sum of interpretable product attributes, item fixed effects, and a low-rank user-item factor structure, enabling both interpretability and information sharing across consumers and items. We further correct for selection in which comparisons are observed: a comparison is recorded only if both items enter the consumer's consideration set, inducing exposure bias toward frequently encountered items. We model pair observability as the product of item-level observability propensities and estimate these propensities with a logistic model for the marginal probability that an item is observable. Preference parameters are then estimated by maximizing an inverse-probability-weighted (IPW), ridge-regularized log-likelihood that reweights observed comparisons toward a target comparison population. To scale computation, we propose a stochastic gradient descent (SGD) algorithm based on inverse-probability resampling, which draws comparisons in proportion to their IPW weights. In an application to transaction data from an online wine retailer, the method improves out-of-sample recommendation performance relative to a popularity-based benchmark, with particularly strong gains in predicting purchases of previously unconsumed products.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitation of standard additive explanation methods in survival models and the non-additivity of hazard and survival functions.

Method: Introduces SurvFD, a decomposition approach for survival models, and SurvSHAP-IQ, extending Shapley interactions to time-indexed functions.

Result: The proposed methods characterize the failure of additive explanations and provide practical estimation for higher-order, time-dependent interactions.

Conclusion: SurvFD and SurvSHAP-IQ improve interpretability in survival modeling and advance analysis for time-to-event prediction tasks.

Abstract: Hazard and survival functions are natural, interpretable targets in time-to-event prediction, but their inherent non-additivity fundamentally limits standard additive explanation methods. We introduce Survival Functional Decomposition (SurvFD), a principled approach for analyzing feature interactions in machine learning survival models. By decomposing higher-order effects into time-dependent and time-independent components, SurvFD offers a previously unrecognized perspective on survival explanations, explicitly characterizing when and why additive explanations fail. Building on this theoretical decomposition, we propose SurvSHAP-IQ, which extends Shapley interactions to time-indexed functions, providing a practical estimator for higher-order, time-dependent interactions. Together, SurvFD and SurvSHAP-IQ establish an interaction- and time-aware interpretability approach for survival modeling, with broad applicability across time-to-event prediction tasks.

TL;DR: The paper theoretically analyzes and provides bounds on the phenomenon of performance degradation due to recursive training on synthetic data, focusing on score-based diffusion models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Recursive training on synthetic data leads to performance degradation, and understanding why this occurs is crucial for designing robust machine learning pipelines.

Method: The authors analyze score-based diffusion models with a combination of theoretical bounds and empirical validation, focusing on accumulated divergence between generated and target distributions.

Result: Bounds on accumulated divergence were established, characterizing how score estimation error and fresh data proportion influence distribution drift. Empirical tests validated the theoretical analysis using synthetic data and images.

Conclusion: The study provides insights into the regimes of drift in recursive training when using synthetic data, highlighting the importance of balancing fresh data integration to mitigate distribution drift.

Abstract: Machine learning models are increasingly trained or fine-tuned on synthetic data. Recursively training on such data has been observed to significantly degrade performance in a wide range of tasks, often characterized by a progressive drift away from the target distribution. In this work, we theoretically analyze this phenomenon in the setting of score-based diffusion models. For a realistic pipeline where each training round uses a combination of synthetic data and fresh samples from the target distribution, we obtain upper and lower bounds on the accumulated divergence between the generated and target distributions. This allows us to characterize different regimes of drift, depending on the score estimation error and the proportion of fresh data used in each generation. We also provide empirical results on synthetic data and images to illustrate the theory.

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper proposes enhanced diffusion sampling techniques addressing rare-event sampling challenges in molecular dynamics, enabling efficient exploration of rare regions while maintaining unbiased thermodynamic estimators.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Rare-event sampling remains a limitation in MD, especially for computing observables dependent on rare equilibrium states (e.g., folding free energies). The study aims to overcome this gap even after advancements with diffusion model equilibrium samplers.

Method: Introducing enhanced diffusion sampling with accurate steering protocols to generate biased ensembles. The equilibrium statistics are recovered via exact reweighting. Three algorithms are developed: UmbrellaDiff, $Δ$G-Diff, and MetaDiff.

Result: The methods demonstrate fast, accurate, and scalable estimation of equilibrium properties across diverse systems, including protein folding landscapes, within practical GPU computation times.

Conclusion: The approach resolves the rare-event sampling problem, improving molecular dynamics simulation for rare-equilibrium event exploration along with unbiased thermodynamic estimations.

Abstract: The rare-event sampling problem has long been the central limiting factor in molecular dynamics (MD), especially in biomolecular simulation. Recently, diffusion models such as BioEmu have emerged as powerful equilibrium samplers that generate independent samples from complex molecular distributions, eliminating the cost of sampling rare transition events. However, a sampling problem remains when computing observables that rely on states which are rare in equilibrium, for example folding free energies. Here, we introduce enhanced diffusion sampling, enabling efficient exploration of rare-event regions while preserving unbiased thermodynamic estimators. The key idea is to perform quantitatively accurate steering protocols to generate biased ensembles and subsequently recover equilibrium statistics via exact reweighting. We instantiate our framework in three algorithms: UmbrellaDiff (umbrella sampling with diffusion models), $Δ$G-Diff (free-energy differences via tilted ensembles), and MetaDiff (a batchwise analogue for metadynamics). Across toy systems, protein folding landscapes and folding free energies, our methods achieve fast, accurate, and scalable estimation of equilibrium properties within GPU-minutes to hours per system -- closing the rare-event sampling gap that remained after the advent of diffusion-model equilibrium samplers.

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: The paper introduces NeuroSleep, a neuromorphic system for energy-efficient EEG-based sleep staging on wearables.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable energy-efficient, continuous EEG-based sleep monitoring on wearable platforms with limited computational resources.

Method: NeuroSleep utilizes Residual Adaptive Multi-Scale Delta Modulation and a hierarchical inference structure comprising event-driven feature extraction, context aggregation, and long-term state modeling.

Result: NeuroSleep achieved a 74.2% accuracy on EEG sleep staging, reduced computational load by 45.8%, and maintained high efficiency even with resource constraints.

Conclusion: NeuroSleep successfully connects neuromorphic encoding with energy-efficient modeling, providing a scalable solution for wearable sleep monitoring.

Abstract: Reliable, continuous neural sensing on wearable edge platforms is fundamental to long-term health monitoring; however, for electroencephalography (EEG)-based sleep monitoring, dense high-frequency processing is often computationally prohibitive under tight energy budgets. To address this bottleneck, this paper proposes NeuroSleep, an integrated event-driven sensing and inference system for energy-efficient sleep staging. NeuroSleep first converts raw EEG into complementary multi-scale bipolar event streams using Residual Adaptive Multi-Scale Delta Modulation (R-AMSDM), enabling an explicit fidelity-sparsity trade-off at the sensing front end. Furthermore, NeuroSleep adopts a hierarchical inference architecture that comprises an Event-based Adaptive Multi-scale Response (EAMR) module for local feature extraction, a Local Temporal-Attention Module (LTAM) for context aggregation, and an Epoch-Leaky Integrate-and-Fire (ELIF) module to capture long-term state persistence. Experimental results using subject-independent 5-fold cross-validation on the Sleep-EDF Expanded dataset demonstrate that NeuroSleep achieves a mean accuracy of 74.2% with only 0.932 M parameters while reducing sparsity-adjusted effective operations by approximately 53.6% relative to dense processing. Compared with the representative dense Transformer baseline, NeuroSleep improves accuracy by 7.5% with a 45.8% reduction in computational load. By bridging neuromorphic encoding with state-aware modeling, NeuroSleep provides a scalable solution for always-on sleep analysis in resource-constrained wearable scenarios.

### [309] [On the Hardness of Approximation of the Fair k-Center Problem](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16688)
*Suhas Thejaswi*

Main category: cs.CC

TL;DR: This paper proves that the fair $k$-center problem cannot be approximated better than a factor of $3$, establishing that current algorithms are optimal.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The goal is to understand whether the known $3$-approximation for the fair $k$-center problem can be improved given that the unconstrained $k$-center problem admits a better $2$-approximation.

Method: The authors analyze the fair $k$-center problem using complexity theory, proving NP-hardness for achieving better than factor-$3$ approximation under general metrics.

Result: It is shown that achieving a $(3-ε)$-approximation for the fair $k$-center problem is NP-hard, solidifying the $3$-approximation as the best possible, even in restricted setups.

Conclusion: The factor-$3$ barrier is inherent for approximating the fair $k$-center problem in general metric spaces, confirming that existing algorithms are optimal even under constraints like group disjointness.

Abstract: In this work, we study the hardness of approximation of the fair $k$-center problem. Here the data points are partitioned into groups and the task is to choose a prescribed number of data points from each group, called centers, while minimizing the maximum distance from any point to its closest center. Although a polynomial-time $3$-approximation is known for this problem in general metrics, it has remained open whether this approximation guarantee is tight or could be further improved, especially since the unconstrained $k$-center problem admits a polynomial-time factor-$2$ approximation. We resolve this open question by proving that, for every $ε>0$, achieving a $(3-ε)$-approximation is NP-hard, assuming $\text{P} \neq \text{NP}$.
  Our inapproximability results hold even when only two disjoint groups are present and at least one center must be chosen from each group. Further, it extends to the canonical one-per-group setting with $k$-groups (for arbitrary $k$), where exactly one center must be selected from each group. Consequently, the factor-$3$ barrier for fair $k$-center in general metric spaces is inherent, and existing $3$-approximation algorithms are optimal up to lower-order terms even in these restricted regimes. This result stands in sharp contrast to the $k$-supplier formulation, where both the unconstrained and fair variants admit factor-$3$ approximation in polynomial time.

### [310] [SRFed: Mitigating Poisoning Attacks in Privacy-Preserving Federated Learning with Heterogeneous Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16480)
*Yiwen Lu*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This paper introduces SRFed, a privacy-preserving and Byzantine-robust federated learning framework tailored for Non-IID scenarios, utilizing decentralized encryption and aggregation techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address critical security threats in Federated Learning, such as inference attacks from curious servers and poisoning attacks from compromised clients, while maintaining efficiency in privacy protection and data heterogeneity settings.

Method: The proposed method, SRFed, includes a Decentralized Efficient Functional Encryption (DEFE) scheme to ensure efficient encryption and defense against inference attacks, and a privacy-preserving defense mechanism using layer-wise projection and clustering-based analysis for robust model aggregation.

Result: Theoretical analysis and experiments demonstrate that SRFed surpasses existing solutions in privacy protection, robustness against Byzantine attacks, and computational efficiency, particularly under Non-IID data scenarios.

Conclusion: SRFed efficiently addresses security vulnerabilities in Federated Learning by integrating novel encryption and aggregation mechanisms, making it a robust and efficient solution for heterogeneous data environments.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables collaborative model training without exposing clients' private data, and has been widely adopted in privacy-sensitive scenarios. However, FL faces two critical security threats: curious servers that may launch inference attacks to reconstruct clients' private data, and compromised clients that can launch poisoning attacks to disrupt model aggregation. Existing solutions mitigate these attacks by combining mainstream privacy-preserving techniques with defensive aggregation strategies. However, they either incur high computation and communication overhead or perform poorly under non-independent and identically distributed (Non-IID) data settings. To tackle these challenges, we propose SRFed, an efficient Byzantine-robust and privacy-preserving FL framework for Non-IID scenarios. First, we design a decentralized efficient functional encryption (DEFE) scheme to support efficient model encryption and non-interactive decryption. DEFE also eliminates third-party reliance and defends against server-side inference attacks. Second, we develop a privacy-preserving defensive model aggregation mechanism based on DEFE. This mechanism filters poisonous models under Non-IID data by layer-wise projection and clustering-based analysis. Theoretical analysis and extensive experiments show that SRFed outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in privacy protection, Byzantine robustness, and efficiency.

*Ahmed Ryan,Ibrahim Khalil,Abdullah Al Jahid,Md Erfan,Akond Ashfaque Ur Rahman,Md Rayhanur Rahman*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This paper evaluates the effectiveness of 13 Large Language Models (LLMs) for detecting malicious software packages, revealing LLMs excel at binary classification but face challenges in detailed malicious indicator identification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The growing threat posed by malicious packages in open-source repositories like PyPI underlines a critical need for effective detection solutions. Evaluating LLMs for this specific security task has been underexplored.

Method: The authors conducted a systematic evaluation of 13 LLMs using a dataset of 4,070 software packages. They tested binary classification abilities to detect malicious packages and multi-label classification to identify malicious indicators while varying prompting strategies, temperature settings, and model types.

Result: GPT-4.1 exhibited near-perfect binary classification performance (F1 ≈ 0.99). However, performance significantly dropped (by about 41%) in identifying specific malicious indicators. General models were effective at broad threat detection, while specialized coder models excelled at detecting predictable attacks.

Conclusion: LLMs are effective at binary-level detection of malicious software packages but require improvements to better handle granular, indicator-level tasks. Parameter size and context width were found to have little impact on accuracy.

Abstract: The prevalence of malicious packages in open-source repositories, such as PyPI, poses a critical threat to the software supply chain. While Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as a promising tool for automated security tasks, their effectiveness in detecting malicious packages and indicators remains underexplored. This paper presents a systematic evaluation of 13 LLMs for detecting malicious software packages. Using a curated dataset of 4,070 packages (3,700 benign and 370 malicious), we evaluate model performance across two tasks: binary classification (package detection) and multi-label classification (identification of specific malicious indicators). We further investigate the impact of prompting strategies, temperature settings, and model specifications on detection accuracy. We find a significant "granularity gap" in LLMs' capabilities. While GPT-4.1 achieves near-perfect performance in binary detection (F1 $\approx$ 0.99), performance degrades by approximately 41\% when the task shifts to identifying specific malicious indicators. We observe that general models are best for filtering out the majority of threats, while specialized coder models are better at detecting attacks that follow a strict, predictable code structure. Our correlation analysis indicates that parameter size and context width have negligible explanatory power regarding detection accuracy. We conclude that while LLMs are powerful detectors at the package level, they lack the semantic depth required for precise identification at the granular indicator level.

TL;DR: The paper introduces Code Execution MCP (CE-MCP) to address scalability issues in Model Context Protocols (MCPs), focusing on efficiency, scalability trade-offs, and security vulnerabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address scalability challenges in MCP systems, enabling larger tool catalogs and more efficient workflows by introducing code execution as a first-class capability.

Method: The paper includes formal architectural analysis, empirical evaluation using MCP-Bench framework, and security validation across multiple attack scenarios.

Result: CE-MCP enhances efficiency, reduces execution latency, and token usage, but expands the attack surface. Security vulnerabilities are identified and validated, leading to proposed defenses.

Conclusion: CE-MCPs significantly improve scalability and efficiency but require robust security measures. A layered defense architecture is proposed to achieve production-ready balance.

Abstract: Model Context Protocols (MCPs) provide a unified platform for agent systems to discover, select, and orchestrate tools across heterogeneous execution environments. As MCP-based systems scale to incorporate larger tool catalogs and multiple concurrently connected MCP servers, traditional tool-by-tool invocation increases coordination overhead, fragments state management, and limits support for wide-context operations. To address these scalability challenges, recent MCP designs have incorporated code execution as a first-class capability, an approach called Code Execution MCP (CE-MCP). This enables agents to consolidate complex workflows, such as SQL querying, file analysis, and multi-step data transformations, into a single program that executes within an isolated runtime environment. In this work, we formalize the architectural distinction between context-coupled (traditional) and context-decoupled (CE-MCP) models, analyzing their fundamental scalability trade-offs. Using the MCP-Bench framework across 10 representative servers, we empirically evaluate task behavior, tool utilization patterns, execution latency, and protocol efficiency as the scale of connected MCP servers and available tools increases, demonstrating that while CE-MCP significantly reduces token usage and execution latency, it introduces a vastly expanded attack surface. We address this security gap by applying the MAESTRO framework, identifying sixteen attack classes across five execution phases-including specific code execution threats such as exception-mediated code injection and unsafe capability synthesis. We validate these vulnerabilities through adversarial scenarios across multiple LLMs and propose a layered defense architecture comprising containerized sandboxing and semantic gating. Our findings provide a rigorous roadmap for balancing scalability and security in production-ready executable agent workflows.

TL;DR: The paper introduces FedGraph-AGI, an innovative framework combining AGI reasoning and federated graph neural networks to tackle cross-border insider threats in financial networks, achieving superior accuracy while preserving privacy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges of cross-border insider threats in financial schemes, including limitations in privacy-preserving intelligence sharing, lack of reasoning for multi-step attack analysis, and insufficient modeling of graph-structured financial relationships.

Method: The proposed framework, FedGraph-AGI, integrates federated graph neural networks preserving data sovereignty, Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) for handling jurisdictional heterogeneity, and AGI-powered reasoning via Large Action Models (LAM) for causal inference on graph data.

Result: FedGraph-AGI achieved 92.3% accuracy on a 50,000-transaction dataset spread over 10 jurisdictions, outperforming federated baselines (86.1%) and centralized methods (84.7%). AGI reasoning improved accuracy by 6.8%, and MoE contributed an additional 4.4% improvement. The system also upheld epsilon = 1.0 differential privacy and demonstrated scalability.

Conclusion: The integration of AGI reasoning with federated graph learning represents an effective solution for privacy-preserving cross-border insider threat detection, offering significant improvements in accuracy while ensuring data privacy.

Abstract: Cross-border insider threats pose a critical challenge to government financial schemes, particularly when dealing with distributed, privacy-sensitive data across multiple jurisdictions. Existing approaches face fundamental limitations: they cannot effectively share intelligence across borders due to privacy constraints, lack reasoning capabilities to understand complex multi-step attack patterns, and fail to capture intricate graph-structured relationships in financial networks. We introduce FedGraph-AGI, a novel federated learning framework integrating Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) reasoning with graph neural networks for privacy-preserving cross-border insider threat detection. Our approach combines: (1) federated graph neural networks preserving data sovereignty; (2) Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) aggregation for heterogeneous jurisdictions; and (3) AGI-powered reasoning via Large Action Models (LAM) performing causal inference over graph data. Through experiments on a 50,000-transaction dataset across 10 jurisdictions, FedGraph-AGI achieves 92.3% accuracy, significantly outperforming federated baselines (86.1%) and centralized approaches (84.7%). Our ablation studies reveal AGI reasoning contributes 6.8% improvement, while MoE adds 4.4%. The system maintains epsilon = 1.0 differential privacy while achieving near-optimal performance and scales efficiently to 50+ clients. This represents the first integration of AGI reasoning with federated graph learning for insider threat detection, opening new directions for privacy-preserving cross-border intelligence sharing.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This paper explores the impact of different number representations (32-bit, 16-bit floating-point, and 8-bit, 4-bit integer) on the success of electromagnetic fault injection (EMFI) attacks targeting neural networks. Integer representations, particularly 8-bit, demonstrate greater fault resistance compared to floating-point numbers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of a comprehensive study on how number representations affect the resilience of neural networks against EMFI attacks, which are a significant security threat.

Method: The authors tested four neural network architectures (ResNet-18, ResNet-34, ResNet-50, and VGG-11) using four number representations. They deployed these models on an embedded chip and conducted experiments using a cost-effective EMFI platform to induce faults.

Result: Floating-point representations (32-bit and 16-bit) showed substantial accuracy degradation after a single fault injection. Integer-based representations, particularly the 8-bit representation, showed better resilience, maintaining approximately 70% Top-1 and 90% Top-5 accuracy on VGG-11.

Conclusion: The choice of numerical representation has a large effect on the fault tolerance of neural networks. Integer representations, especially 8-bit integers, are more resilient to EMFI attacks than floating-point representations.

Abstract: Fault injection attacks on embedded neural network models have been shown as a potent threat. Numerous works studied resilience of models from various points of view. As of now, there is no comprehensive study that would evaluate the influence of number representations used for model parameters against electromagnetic fault injection (EMFI) attacks.
  In this paper, we investigate how four different number representations influence the success of an EMFI attack on embedded neural network models. We chose two common floating-point representations (32-bit, and 16-bit), and two integer representations (8-bit, and 4-bit). We deployed four common image classifiers, ResNet-18, ResNet-34, ResNet-50, and VGG-11, on an embedded memory chip, and utilized a low-cost EMFI platform to trigger faults. Our results show that while floating-point representations exhibit almost a complete degradation in accuracy (Top-1 and Top-5) after a single fault injection, integer representations offer better resistance overall. Especially, when considering the the 8-bit representation on a relatively large network (VGG-11), the Top-1 accuracies stay at around 70% and the Top-5 at around 90%.

### [315] [Recursive language models for jailbreak detection: a procedural defense for tool-augmented agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16520)
*Doron Shavit*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper proposes RLM-JB, an end-to-end jailbreak detection framework using Recursive Language Models (RLMs), achieving high effectiveness and precision in detecting adversarial attacks on language models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Jailbreak prompts pose a significant threat to large language models, especially in systems engaging with untrusted content. There is a need for robust detection given the evolving nature of these attacks, which often evade traditional guardrails.

Method: The researchers designed RLM-JB, which treats jailbreak detection as a procedural task. It applies bounded analysis by segmenting and normalizing inputs, deobfuscating content, and screening text in chunks. The evidence from various model queries is then aggregated into a decision, ensuring coverage and the ability to detect split-payload attacks.

Result: When tested on adversarial inputs, RLM-JB demonstrates high detection performance (92.5-98.0% ASR/Recall), maintains high precision (98.99-100%), and achieves low false positive rates (0.0-2.0%) across multiple language model backends.

Conclusion: RLM-JB provides a highly effective solution for detecting jailbreak prompts in large language models, balancing sensitivity and specificity effectively for practical use cases.

Abstract: Jailbreak prompts are a practical and evolving threat to large language models (LLMs), particularly in agentic systems that execute tools over untrusted content. Many attacks exploit long-context hiding, semantic camouflage, and lightweight obfuscations that can evade single-pass guardrails. We present RLM-JB, an end-to-end jailbreak detection framework built on Recursive Language Models (RLMs), in which a root model orchestrates a bounded analysis program that transforms the input, queries worker models over covered segments, and aggregates evidence into an auditable decision. RLM-JB treats detection as a procedure rather than a one-shot classification: it normalizes and de-obfuscates suspicious inputs, chunks text to reduce context dilution and guarantee coverage, performs parallel chunk screening, and composes cross-chunk signals to recover split-payload attacks. On AutoDAN-style adversarial inputs, RLM-JB achieves high detection effectiveness across three LLM backends (ASR/Recall 92.5-98.0%) while maintaining very high precision (98.99-100%) and low false positive rates (0.0-2.0%), highlighting a practical sensitivity-specificity trade-off as the screening backend changes.

*Amirmohammad Pasdar,Shabnam Kasra Kermanshahi,Nour Moustafa,Van-Thuan Pham*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: ZAID is a framework designed to improve intrusion detection in the challenging IoBT environment by addressing unseen attack types, using universal models, lightweight zone adaptation, and constrained communication methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the challenge of detecting cyber threats in heterogeneous, disrupted IoBT environments where traditional intrusion detection methods are ineffective.

Method: ZAID leverages universal convolutional models, autoencoder-based anomaly scoring, lightweight adapter modules, federated aggregation, and pseudo-labelling for zone-specific adaptation.

Result: ZAID achieved up to 83.16% accuracy for detecting zero-day attacks in ToN_IoT and 71.64% accuracy in UNSW-NB15, demonstrating effective zone-personalized collaboration under challenging conditions.

Conclusion: ZAID improves detection of unseen attacks in IoBT environments by combining generalizable models and lightweight adaptation techniques that work across zones with limited connectivity.

Abstract: The Internet of Battlefield Things (IoBT) relies on heterogeneous, bandwidth-constrained, and intermittently connected tactical networks that face rapidly evolving cyber threats. In this setting, intrusion detection cannot depend on continuous central collection of raw traffic due to disrupted links, latency, operational security limits, and non-IID traffic across zones. We present Zone-Adaptive Intrusion Detection (ZAID), a collaborative detection and model-improvement framework for unseen attack types, where "zero-day" refers to previously unobserved attack families and behaviours (not vulnerability disclosure timing). ZAID combines a universal convolutional model for generalisable traffic representations, an autoencoder-based reconstruction signal as an auxiliary anomaly score, and lightweight adapter modules for parameter-efficient zone adaptation. To support cross-zone generalisation under constrained connectivity, ZAID uses federated aggregation and pseudo-labelling to leverage locally observed, weakly labelled behaviours. We evaluate ZAID on ToN_IoT using a zero-day protocol that excludes MITM, DDoS, and DoS from supervised training and introduces them during zone-level deployment and adaptation. ZAID achieves up to 83.16% accuracy on unseen attack traffic and transfers to UNSW-NB15 under the same procedure, with a best accuracy of 71.64%. These results indicate that parameter-efficient, zone-personalised collaboration can improve the detection of previously unseen attacks in contested IoBT environments.

*Nils Palumbo,Sarthak Choudhary,Jihye Choi,Prasad Chalasani,Mihai Christodorescu,Somesh Jha*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: PCAS is a tool designed for enforcing deterministic policy compliance in LLM-based systems, improving compliance significantly across various use cases.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM agents lack inherent deterministic enforcement of complex authorization policies, posing risks for systems requiring strict compliance.

Method: The paper introduces PCAS, which uses dependency graphs for system state modeling, a Datalog-derived language for policy rules, and a reference monitor for action interception to ensure compliance.

Result: PCAS shows dramatic compliance improvements in case studies, including raising policy compliance from 48% to 93% for customer service tasks and achieving zero violations during instrumented runs.

Conclusion: PCAS offers a practical, security-focused solution for integrating strict policy compliance without restructuring existing LLM-based systems.

Abstract: LLM-based agents are increasingly being deployed in contexts requiring complex authorization policies: customer service protocols, approval workflows, data access restrictions, and regulatory compliance. Embedding these policies in prompts provides no enforcement guarantees. We present PCAS, a Policy Compiler for Agentic Systems that provides deterministic policy enforcement.
  Enforcing such policies requires tracking information flow across agents, which linear message histories cannot capture. Instead, PCAS models the agentic system state as a dependency graph capturing causal relationships among events such as tool calls, tool results, and messages. Policies are expressed in a Datalog-derived language, as declarative rules that account for transitive information flow and cross-agent provenance. A reference monitor intercepts all actions and blocks violations before execution, providing deterministic enforcement independent of model reasoning.
  PCAS takes an existing agent implementation and a policy specification, and compiles them into an instrumented system that is policy-compliant by construction, with no security-specific restructuring required. We evaluate PCAS on three case studies: information flow policies for prompt injection defense, approval workflows in a multi-agent pharmacovigilance system, and organizational policies for customer service. On customer service tasks, PCAS improves policy compliance from 48% to 93% across frontier models, with zero policy violations in instrumented runs.

### [318] [Nonparametric Identification and Inference for Counterfactual Distributions with Confounding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15916)
*Jianle Sun,Kun Zhang*

Main category: stat.ME

TL;DR: This study proposes methods for identifying and estimating joint potential outcome distributions in the presence of both observed and unmeasured confounding, leveraging techniques like conditional copulas, causal representation learning, and triple machine learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the challenge of making distributional and counterfactual inferences in settings with both observed and unmeasured confounding, which are longstanding obstacles in causal inference.

Method: The authors derive covariate-informed bounds using conditional copulas, develop smooth approximation techniques for non-differentiable problems, and introduce a causal representation learning framework using instrumental variables. They also propose a triple machine learning estimator and a VAE-based algorithm for handling confounding.

Result: The methods developed allow for semiparametric efficiency, valid inference, and robust statistical results. Simulations and real-world applications confirm the methods' effectiveness.

Conclusion: By combining semiparametric theory with modern representation learning, the paper establishes a foundation for robust causal inference in complex systems and demonstrates practical applications through simulations and real-world analysis.

Abstract: We propose nonparametric identification and semiparametric estimation of joint potential outcome distributions in the presence of confounding. First, in settings with observed confounding, we derive tighter, covariate-informed bounds on the joint distribution by leveraging conditional copulas. To overcome the non-differentiability of bounding min/max operators, we establish the asymptotic properties for both a direct estimator with polynomial margin condition and a smooth approximation with log-sum-exp operator, facilitating valid inference for individual-level effects under the canonical rank-preserving assumption. Second, we tackle the challenge of unmeasured confounding by introducing a causal representation learning framework. By utilizing instrumental variables, we prove the nonparametric identifiability of the latent confounding subspace under injectivity and completeness conditions. We develop a ``triple machine learning" estimator that employs cross-fitting scheme to sequentially handle the learned representation, nuisance parameters, and target functional. We characterize the asymptotic distribution with variance inflation induced by representation learning error, and provide conditions for semiparametric efficiency. We also propose a practical VAE-based algorithm for confounding representation learning. Simulations and real-world analysis validate the effectiveness of proposed methods. By bridging classical semiparametric theory with modern representation learning, this work provides a robust statistical foundation for distributional and counterfactual inference in complex causal systems.

*Yonghoon Lee,Meshi Bashari,Edgar Dobriban,Yaniv Romano*

Main category: stat.ME

TL;DR: The paper introduces SynthBH, leveraging synthetic data for multiple hypothesis testing with FDR control, backed by theoretical guarantees and empirical validations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the need for improved methodology in multiple hypothesis testing by utilizing auxiliary or synthetic data, enhancing sample efficiency and statistical power.

Method: The authors propose SynthBH, using synthetic data while ensuring finite-sample, distribution-free FDR control under positive dependence conditions, adapting to the synthetic data's quality.

Result: SynthBH effectively controls FDR and improves sample efficiency, with demonstrated success in outlier detection benchmarks, genomic analyses, and simulated experiments.

Conclusion: SynthBH offers a robust, efficient solution for FDR control in multiple hypothesis testing, particularly when synthetic data of high quality are available.

Abstract: Multiple hypothesis testing with false discovery rate (FDR) control is a fundamental problem in statistical inference, with broad applications in genomics, drug screening, and outlier detection. In many such settings, researchers may have access not only to real experimental observations but also to auxiliary or synthetic data -- from past, related experiments or generated by generative models -- that can provide additional evidence about the hypotheses of interest. We introduce SynthBH, a synthetic-powered multiple testing procedure that safely leverages such synthetic data. We prove that SynthBH guarantees finite-sample, distribution-free FDR control under a mild PRDS-type positive dependence condition, without requiring the pooled-data p-values to be valid under the null. The proposed method adapts to the (unknown) quality of the synthetic data: it enhances the sample efficiency and may boost the power when synthetic data are of high quality, while controlling the FDR at a user-specified level regardless of their quality. We demonstrate the empirical performance of SynthBH on tabular outlier detection benchmarks and on genomic analyses of drug-cancer sensitivity associations, and further study its properties through controlled experiments on simulated data.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide an algorithm discovery framework that can optimize and improve scientific algorithms, particularly in computational cosmology.

Method: MadEvolve refines base human-implemented algorithms through iterative changes and optimizes performance metrics by employing both gradient-based and gradient-free methods. It also reports comparisons, innovations, and details of parameters.

Result: MadEvolve demonstrated substantial improvement in three computational cosmology tasks: cosmological initial conditions reconstruction, 21cm foreground contamination, and baryonic physics simulations.

Conclusion: The research presents MadEvolve as a novel and effective tool for scientists to optimize algorithms, achieving significant advancements in computational cosmology problems and offering it publicly for broader adoption.

Abstract: We develop a general framework to discover scientific algorithms and apply it to three problems in computational cosmology. Our code, MadEvolve, is similar to Google's AlphaEvolve, but places a stronger emphasis on free parameters and their optimization. Our code starts with a baseline human algorithm implementation, and then optimizes its performance metrics by making iterative changes to its code. As a further convenient feature, MadEvolve automatically generates a report that compares the input algorithm with the evolved algorithm, describes the algorithmic innovations and lists the free parameters and their function. Our code supports both auto-differentiable, gradient-based parameter optimization and gradient-free optimization methods. We apply MadEvolve to the reconstruction of cosmological initial conditions, 21cm foreground contamination reconstruction and effective baryonic physics in N-body simulations. In all cases, we find substantial improvements over the base algorithm. We make MadEvolve and our three tasks publicly available at madevolve.org.

TL;DR: The paper reformulates the Vertical Federated Learning (VFL) problem using a saddle point approach and introduces deterministic and stochastic methods for practical adaptations and efficient computation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop methods that enhance Vertical Federated Learning (VFL) by addressing practical challenges such as efficient communication, asynchronous participation, and faster computation.

Method: The paper utilizes saddle point reformulation with deterministic methods and proposes stochastic modifications like compression, partial participation, and coordinate selection.

Result: The paper provides convergence estimates for the algorithms and demonstrates their efficiency through numerical experiments.

Conclusion: The saddle point reformulation is key to enabling modifications in VFL, which were not feasible under traditional formulations, and proves effective in improving performance.

Abstract: The objective of Vertical Federated Learning (VFL) is to collectively train a model using features available on different devices while sharing the same users. This paper focuses on the saddle point reformulation of the VFL problem via the classical Lagrangian function. We first demonstrate how this formulation can be solved using deterministic methods. More importantly, we explore various stochastic modifications to adapt to practical scenarios, such as employing compression techniques for efficient information transmission, enabling partial participation for asynchronous communication, and utilizing coordinate selection for faster local computation. We show that the saddle point reformulation plays a key role and opens up possibilities to use mentioned extension that seem to be impossible in the standard minimization formulation. Convergence estimates are provided for each algorithm, demonstrating their effectiveness in addressing the VFL problem. Additionally, alternative reformulations are investigated, and numerical experiments are conducted to validate performance and effectiveness of the proposed approach.

Main category: math.OC

TL;DR: This paper introduces FlexATC, a distributed optimization framework for networks, showing its strong potential for communication efficiency with provable convergence rates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the problem of distributed optimization over networks while minimizing communication costs and enhancing convergence efficiency.

Method: The paper introduces FlexATC, an adaptable framework leveraging probabilistic local updates. It unifies various distributed algorithms and establishes convergence rates for different problem settings.

Result: Sublinear and linear convergence rates are achieved in convex and strongly convex settings. Remarkably, in strong convex settings, communication can be skipped frequently without affecting results.

Conclusion: FlexATC is effective, communication-efficient, and demonstrates for the first time the advantage of local updates in boosting communication acceleration for ATC-based methods.

Abstract: This paper is concerned with the distributed composite optimization problem over networks, where agents aim to minimize a sum of local smooth components and a common nonsmooth term. Leveraging the probabilistic local updates mechanism, we propose a communication-efficient Adapt-Then-Combine (ATC) framework, FlexATC, unifying numerous ATC-based distributed algorithms. Under stepsizes independent of the network topology and the number of local updates, we establish sublinear and linear convergence rates for FlexATC in convex and strongly convex settings, respectively. Remarkably, in the strong convex setting, the linear rate is decoupled from the objective functions and network topology, and FlexATC permits communication to be skipped in most iterations without any deterioration of the linear rate. In addition, the proposed unified theory demonstrates for the first time that local updates provably lead to communication acceleration for ATC-based distributed algorithms. Numerical experiments further validate the efficacy of the proposed framework and corroborate the theoretical results.

TL;DR: The paper investigates the convergence of independent policy-gradient learning in multi-player linear-quadratic games.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the behavior of independent PG methods in distributed multi-player stochastic games and establishing convergence guarantees.

Method: Analysis of the $α$-potential structure in LQ games based on pairwise interaction asymmetry and studying global linear convergence for symmetric and asymmetric cases.

Result: For symmetric interactions, PG methods converge globally to an affine distributed equilibrium. For asymmetric cases, the algorithms converge to an approximate equilibrium with suboptimality dependent on asymmetry.

Conclusion: Independent PG methods are scalable and efficient for distributed learning across symmetric and asymmetric interaction networks.

Abstract: We analyze independent policy-gradient (PG) learning in $N$-player linear-quadratic (LQ) stochastic differential games. Each player employs a distributed policy that depends only on its own state and updates the policy independently using the gradient of its own objective. We establish global linear convergence of these methods to an equilibrium by showing that the LQ game admits an $α$-potential structure, with $α$ determined by the degree of pairwise interaction asymmetry. For pairwise-symmetric interactions, we construct an affine distributed equilibrium by minimizing the potential function and show that independent PG methods converge globally to this equilibrium, with complexity scaling linearly in the population size and logarithmically in the desired accuracy. For asymmetric interactions, we prove that independent projected PG algorithms converge linearly to an approximate equilibrium, with suboptimality proportional to the degree of asymmetry. Numerical experiments confirm the theoretical results across both symmetric and asymmetric interaction networks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve natural communication and human-computer interaction through better understanding and modeling of multimodal emotional and sentiment expressions.

Method: The framework uses hyperbolic Poincare-ball embeddings to represent modality hierarchies and hypergraph mechanisms for bidirectional message passing. It incorporates hyperbolic contrastive learning with decoupled radial and angular objectives and adaptive hyperedge construction to preserve temporal and multimodal relations.

Result: Empirical results on multimodal emotion benchmarks demonstrate that EC-Net achieves robust and consistent accuracy, even when handling incomplete or noisy modality data.

Conclusion: Hierarchical geometry combined with hypergraph-based fusion enables effective and resilient modeling of multimodal emotions and sentiments.

Abstract: Emotional expression underpins natural communication and effective human-computer interaction. We present Emotion Collider (EC-Net), a hyperbolic hypergraph framework for multimodal emotion and sentiment modeling. EC-Net represents modality hierarchies using Poincare-ball embeddings and performs fusion through a hypergraph mechanism that passes messages bidirectionally between nodes and hyperedges. To sharpen class separation, contrastive learning is formulated in hyperbolic space with decoupled radial and angular objectives. High-order semantic relations across time steps and modalities are preserved via adaptive hyperedge construction. Empirical results on standard multimodal emotion benchmarks show that EC-Net produces robust, semantically coherent representations and consistently improves accuracy, particularly when modalities are partially available or contaminated by noise. These findings indicate that explicit hierarchical geometry combined with hypergraph fusion is effective for resilient multimodal affect understanding.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To determine if accurate results in scRNA-seq tasks can be achieved using simpler, interpretable methods rather than computationally expensive deep learning architectures.

Method: Developed pipelines using careful normalization and linear methods, and compared their performance against foundation models on various benchmarks including out-of-distribution tasks.

Result: Demonstrated that simple, interpretable linear methods achieve SOTA or near SOTA performance, outperforming deep learning models in novel cell types and organisms.

Conclusion: The statistical structure in single-cell gene expression can be effectively captured using simple linear representations, challenging the necessity of complex deep learning approaches.

Abstract: Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data exhibit strong and reproducible statistical structure. This has motivated the development of large-scale foundation models, such as TranscriptFormer, that use transformer-based architectures to learn a generative model for gene expression by embedding genes into a latent vector space. These embeddings have been used to obtain state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on downstream tasks such as cell-type classification, disease-state prediction, and cross-species learning. Here, we ask whether similar performance can be achieved without utilizing computationally intensive deep learning-based representations. Using simple, interpretable pipelines that rely on careful normalization and linear methods, we obtain SOTA or near SOTA performance across multiple benchmarks commonly used to evaluate single-cell foundation models, including outperforming foundation models on out-of-distribution tasks involving novel cell types and organisms absent from the training data. Our findings highlight the need for rigorous benchmarking and suggest that the biology of cell identity can be captured by simple linear representations of single cell gene expression data.

Result: The proposed method improved the compression ratio by 12.34x on average across seven X-ray CT datasets compared to standard compression methods.

Conclusion: ROIX-Comp effectively reduces data volume while preserving critical features, enhancing computational efficiency and enabling more efficient data storage and transmission for X-ray CT workflows.

Abstract: In high-performance computing (HPC) environments, particularly in synchrotron radiation facilities, vast amounts of X-ray images are generated. Processing large-scale X-ray Computed Tomography (X-CT) datasets presents significant computational and storage challenges due to their high dimensionality and data volume. Traditional approaches often require extensive storage capacity and high transmission bandwidth, limiting real-time processing capabilities and workflow efficiency. To address these constraints, we introduce a region-of-interest (ROI)-driven extraction framework (ROIX-Comp) that intelligently compresses X-CT data by identifying and retaining only essential features. Our work reduces data volume while preserving critical information for downstream processing tasks. At pre-processing stage, we utilize error-bounded quantization to reduce the amount of data to be processed and therefore improve computational efficiencies. At the compression stage, our methodology combines object extraction with multiple state-of-the-art lossless and lossy compressors, resulting in significantly improved compression ratios. We evaluated this framework against seven X-CT datasets and observed a relative compression ratio improvement of 12.34x compared to the standard compression.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Ureteroscopic navigation is difficult and has a steep learning curve, and current clinical training methods are limited by the need for expert supervision and operating room availability.

Method: The study proposes a video-based scope localization framework using prior exploration videos to generate a reference reconstruction of a phantom kidney. This reconstruction aids in identifying missed calyces in subsequent exploration videos.

Result: The framework correctly identified 69 out of 74 calyces across 15 exploration videos with < 4mm camera pose localization error. The system processes results in approximately 10 minutes for typical explorations.

Conclusion: The framework offers effective camera localization and automated feedback, enabling out-of-OR kidney phantom training without expert supervision.

Abstract: Purpose: Kidney ureteroscopic navigation is challenging with a steep learning curve. However, current clinical training has major deficiencies, as it requires one-on-one feedback from experts and occurs in the operating room (OR). Therefore, there is a need for a phantom training system with automated feedback to greatly \revision{expand} training opportunities.
  Methods: We propose a novel, purely ureteroscope video-based scope localization framework that automatically identifies calyces missed by the trainee in a phantom kidney exploration. We use a slow, thorough, prior exploration video of the kidney to generate a reference reconstruction. Then, this reference reconstruction can be used to localize any exploration video of the same phantom.
  Results: In 15 exploration videos, a total of 69 out of 74 calyces were correctly classified. We achieve < 4mm camera pose localization error. Given the reference reconstruction, the system takes 10 minutes to generate the results for a typical exploration (1-2 minute long).
  Conclusion: We demonstrate a novel camera localization framework that can provide accurate and automatic feedback for kidney phantom explorations. We show its ability as a valid tool that enables out-of-OR training without requiring supervision from an expert.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Achieving accurate yet computationally efficient 3D medical image segmentation is crucial for clinical workflows but challenging due to the high parameter and memory demands of current transformer-based models.

Method: The proposed RefineFormer3D model uses GhostConv3D for efficient feature extraction, MixFFN3D to reduce parameters while maintaining extraction efficiency, and a cross-attention fusion decoder for adaptive multi-scale integration.

Result: RefineFormer3D achieves 93.44% and 85.9% Dice scores on ACDC and BraTS datasets, respectively, surpassing or matching contemporary models with just 2.94M parameters and fast inference of 8.35ms per volume.

Conclusion: RefineFormer3D is a scalable, lightweight, and effective solution for 3D medical image segmentation, suitable for use in computationally constrained clinical environments.

Abstract: Accurate and computationally efficient 3D medical image segmentation remains a critical challenge in clinical workflows. Transformer-based architectures often demonstrate superior global contextual modeling but at the expense of excessive parameter counts and memory demands, restricting their clinical deployment. We propose RefineFormer3D, a lightweight hierarchical transformer architecture that balances segmentation accuracy and computational efficiency for volumetric medical imaging. The architecture integrates three key components: (i) GhostConv3D-based patch embedding for efficient feature extraction with minimal redundancy, (ii) MixFFN3D module with low-rank projections and depthwise convolutions for parameter-efficient feature extraction, and (iii) a cross-attention fusion decoder enabling adaptive multi-scale skip connection integration. RefineFormer3D contains only 2.94M parameters, substantially fewer than contemporary transformer-based methods. Extensive experiments on ACDC and BraTS benchmarks demonstrate that RefineFormer3D achieves 93.44\% and 85.9\% average Dice scores respectively, outperforming or matching state-of-the-art methods while requiring significantly fewer parameters. Furthermore, the model achieves fast inference (8.35 ms per volume on GPU) with low memory requirements, supporting deployment in resource-constrained clinical environments. These results establish RefineFormer3D as an effective and scalable solution for practical 3D medical image segmentation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of generating precise diagnostic text from gigapixel whole slide images, which requires both computational scalability and domain-specific language accuracy.

Method: The method employs multi-resolution patch selection, background artifact removal, and feature extraction using a Vision Transformer. A Transformer decoder generates text tokenized with BioGPT, followed by a retrieval-based verification using Sentence BERT to improve reliability.

Result: The framework integrates scalable image processing with domain-informed text generation and improves report reliability through retrieval-based corrections.

Conclusion: The proposed methodology effectively handles gigapixel images and ensures higher reliability in diagnostic text generation, addressing scalability and accuracy challenges in biomedical imaging.

Abstract: Generating diagnostic text from histopathology whole slide images (WSIs) is challenging due to the gigapixel scale of the input and the requirement for precise, domain specific language. We propose a hierarchical vision language framework that combines a frozen pathology foundation model with a Transformer decoder for report generation. To make WSI processing tractable, we perform multi resolution pyramidal patch selection (downsampling factors 2^3 to 2^6) and remove background and artifacts using Laplacian variance and HSV based criteria. Patch features are extracted with the UNI Vision Transformer and projected to a 6 layer Transformer decoder that generates diagnostic text via cross attention. To better represent biomedical terminology, we tokenize the output using BioGPT. Finally, we add a retrieval based verification step that compares generated reports with a reference corpus using Sentence BERT embeddings; if a high similarity match is found, the generated report is replaced with the retrieved ground truth reference to improve reliability.

Conclusion: Nonlinear dynamic measures of speech embeddings offer reliable insights into cognitive disorders and exhibit consistency across multiple embedding models.

Abstract: We analyze speech embeddings from structured clinical interviews of psychotic patients and healthy controls by treating language production as a high-dimensional dynamical process. Lyapunov exponent (LE) spectra are computed from word-level and answer-level embeddings generated by two distinct large language models, allowing us to assess the stability of the conclusions with respect to different embedding presentations. Word-level embeddings exhibit uniformly contracting dynamics with no positive LE, while answer-level embeddings, in spite of the overall contraction, display a number of positive LEs and higher-dimensional attractors. The resulting LE spectra robustly separate psychotic from healthy speech, while differentiation within the psychotic group is not statistically significant overall, despite a tendency of the most severe cases to occupy distinct dynamical regimes. These findings indicate that nonlinear dynamical invariants of speech embeddings provide a physics-inspired probe of disordered cognition whose conclusions remain stable across embedding models.

### [332] [On the distance between mean and geometric median in high dimensions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12926)
*Richard Schwank,Mathias Drton*

Main category: math.ST

TL;DR: The paper explores the relationship between the geometric median and the mean in high dimensions, showing their closeness under controlled conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to understand whether the geometric median and the mean, as distinct notions of center, exhibit similar behavior in high dimensions, relevant for robust statistics and machine learning.

Method: The authors provide theoretical upper bounds on their distance, derive a first-order expansion of the geometric median components, and validate results through simulations.

Result: The findings reveal that the geometric median and mean are asymptotically close in high-dimensional settings under certain distributional controls.

Conclusion: The study provides theoretical insights and empirical evidence that the geometric median nearly coincides with the mean in high-dimensional robust statistics.

Abstract: The geometric median, a notion of center for multivariate distributions, has gained recent attention in robust statistics and machine learning. Although conceptually distinct from the mean (i.e., expectation), we demonstrate that both are very close in high dimensions when the dependence between the distribution components is suitably controlled. Concretely, we find an upper bound on the distance that vanishes with the dimension asymptotically, and derive a rate-matching first order expansion of the geometric median components. Simulations illustrate and confirm our results.

### [333] [Optimal training-conditional regret for online conformal prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16537)
*Jiadong Liang,Zhimei Ren,Yuxin Chen*

Main category: math.ST

TL;DR: This paper proposes algorithms for online conformal prediction in non-stationary data streams facing unknown distribution drift, achieving minimax-optimal regret using drift detection for adapting calibration sets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the challenges in online conformal prediction for data streams undergoing distribution drift, emphasizing performance evaluation through training-conditional cumulative regret rather than traditional approaches like time-averaged marginal coverage.

Method: The method involves two algorithms: (1) a split-conformal style algorithm with drift detection for datasets with pretrained non-conformity scores, and (2) a full-conformal style algorithm for online-trained non-conformity scores using stability-based adaptation for evolving environments.

Result: The proposed methods achieve minimax-optimal regret and provide non-asymptotic regret guarantees. Numerical experiments validate the theoretical findings.

Conclusion: The research introduces innovative approaches using drift detection to adapt online conformal prediction in the presence of distribution shifts, establishing strong theoretical and practical performance.

Abstract: We study online conformal prediction for non-stationary data streams subject to unknown distribution drift. While most prior work studied this problem under adversarial settings and/or assessed performance in terms of gaps of time-averaged marginal coverage, we instead evaluate performance through training-conditional cumulative regret. We specifically focus on independently generated data with two types of distribution shift: abrupt change points and smooth drift.
  When non-conformity score functions are pretrained on an independent dataset, we propose a split-conformal style algorithm that leverages drift detection to adaptively update calibration sets, which provably achieves minimax-optimal regret. When non-conformity scores are instead trained online, we develop a full-conformal style algorithm that again incorporates drift detection to handle non-stationarity; this approach relies on stability - rather than permutation symmetry - of the model-fitting algorithm, which is often better suited to online learning under evolving environments. We establish non-asymptotic regret guarantees for our online full conformal algorithm, which match the minimax lower bound under appropriate restrictions on the prediction sets. Numerical experiments corroborate our theoretical findings.

### [334] [Separating Oblivious and Adaptive Models of Variable Selection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16568)
*Ziyun Chen,Jerry Li,Kevin Tian,Yusong Zhu*

Main category: math.ST

TL;DR: This paper explores sparse recovery with $\ell_\infty$ error guarantees, proving a distinct separation between oblivious and adaptive models, and analyzing their sample complexities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to understand sparse recovery tasks with $\ell_\infty$ error guarantees, specifically for variable selection in high-dimensional data.

Method: The authors establish theoretical distinctions between oblivious (``for each'') and adaptive (``for all'') sparse recovery models using statistical and computational approaches, highlighting differences in sample complexity.

Result: It is shown that near-linear time recovery with $\sim k \log d$ samples is possible under the oblivious model, whereas $\sim k^2$ samples are required in the adaptive model. A partially-adaptive model is also introduced, achieving intermediate results.

Conclusion: The paper uncovers a significant difference in sample requirements for $\ell_\infty$ sparse recovery across different models, with implications for variable selection tasks in both theory and practice.

Abstract: Sparse recovery is among the most well-studied problems in learning theory and high-dimensional statistics. In this work, we investigate the statistical and computational landscapes of sparse recovery with $\ell_\infty$ error guarantees. This variant of the problem is motivated by \emph{variable selection} tasks, where the goal is to estimate the support of a $k$-sparse signal in $\mathbb{R}^d$. Our main contribution is a provable separation between the \emph{oblivious} (``for each'') and \emph{adaptive} (``for all'') models of $\ell_\infty$ sparse recovery. We show that under an oblivious model, the optimal $\ell_\infty$ error is attainable in near-linear time with $\approx k\log d$ samples, whereas in an adaptive model, $\gtrsim k^2$ samples are necessary for any algorithm to achieve this bound. This establishes a surprising contrast with the standard $\ell_2$ setting, where $\approx k \log d$ samples suffice even for adaptive sparse recovery. We conclude with a preliminary examination of a \emph{partially-adaptive} model, where we show nontrivial variable selection guarantees are possible with $\approx k\log d$ measurements.

*Spencer Compton,Gábor Lugosi,Jaouad Mourtada,Jian Qian,Nikita Zhivotovskiy*

Main category: math.ST

TL;DR: This paper investigates density estimation in Kullback-Leibler divergence using a finite dictionary of densities in two settings, identifying optimal high-probability guarantees and introducing key covering results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address density estimation challenges in Kullback-Leibler divergence without restrictive assumptions on base densities, aiming for optimal rates in dictionary-based settings.

Method: The paper studies two density estimation problems—model aggregation and convex aggregation—by deriving high-probability optimal guarantees. New covering results for mixtures are introduced to enable the analysis.

Result: Optimal rates for density estimation are established, matching existing lower bounds in discrete cases for mixtures. Two covering results are proven, including a universal constant factor covering for convex sets.

Conclusion: The findings enhance the understanding of density estimation with unbounded density ratios and differing supports, providing geometric insights with broader applications in optimization.

Abstract: We study density estimation in Kullback-Leibler divergence: given an i.i.d. sample from an unknown density $p$, the goal is to construct an estimator $\widehat p$ such that $\mathrm{KL}(p,\widehat p)$ is small with high probability. We consider two settings involving a finite dictionary of $M$ densities: (i) model aggregation, where $p$ belongs to the dictionary, and (ii) convex aggregation (mixture density estimation), where $p$ is a mixture of densities from the dictionary. Crucially, we make no assumption on the base densities: their ratios may be unbounded and their supports may differ. For both problems, we identify the best possible high-probability guarantees in terms of the dictionary size, sample size, and confidence level. These optimal rates are higher than those achievable when density ratios are bounded by absolute constants; for mixture density estimation, they match existing lower bounds in the special case of discrete distributions.
  Our analysis of the mixture case hinges on two new covering results. First, we provide a sharp, distribution-free upper bound on the local Hellinger entropy of the class of mixtures of $M$ distributions. Second, we prove an optimal ratio covering theorem for convex sets: for every convex compact set $K\subset \mathbb{R}_+^d$, there exists a subset $A\subset K$ with at most $2^{8d}$ elements such that each element of $K$ is coordinate-wise dominated by an element of $A$ up to a universal constant factor. This geometric result is of independent interest; notably, it yields new cardinality estimates for $\varepsilon$-approximate Pareto sets in multi-objective optimization when the attainable set of objective vectors is convex.

### [336] [Steering Dynamical Regimes of Diffusion Models by Breaking Detailed Balance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15914)
*Haiqi Lu,Ying Tang*

Main category: cond-mat.stat-mech

TL;DR: This paper demonstrates how breaking detailed balance in generative diffusion processes can accelerate their reverse dynamics while maintaining the stationary distribution, using non-reversible perturbations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The research aims to address inefficiencies in generative diffusion processes and explore how introducing non-reversible dynamics can enhance relaxation rates without altering the target stationary distribution.

Method: The authors use the Ornstein--Uhlenbeck process, decomposing it into reversible and non-reversible components, and construct an optimal non-reversible perturbation. They analyze its effects on phase transitions (speciation and collapse) and validate their findings through numerical experiments.

Result: They demonstrate that non-reversible perturbations can accelerate the relaxation process (e.g., speciation time) but leave other dynamics, like collapse time, unchanged. Numerical experiments confirm the theoretical predictions.

Conclusion: Non-reversible adjustments to generative diffusion models provide a method to enhance performance by accelerating certain transitions without compromising the stability or stationary characteristics of the system.

Abstract: We show that deliberately breaking detailed balance in generative diffusion processes can accelerate the reverse process without changing the stationary distribution. Considering the Ornstein--Uhlenbeck process, we decompose the dynamics into a symmetric component and a non-reversible anti-symmetric component that generates rotational probability currents. We then construct an exponentially optimal non-reversible perturbation that improves the long-time relaxation rate while preserving the stationary target. We analyze how such non-reversible control reshapes the macroscopic dynamical regimes of the phase transitions recently identified in generative diffusion models. We derive a general criterion for the speciation time and show that suitable non-reversible perturbations can accelerate speciation. In contrast, the collapse transition is governed by a trace-controlled phase-space contraction mechanism that is fixed by the symmetric component, and the corresponding collapse time remains unchanged under anti-symmetric perturbations. Numerical experiments on Gaussian mixture models support these findings.

Main category: cs.LO

TL;DR: MerLean, a fully automated framework, formalizes quantum computation research papers into verified Lean code and back for review, demonstrating autoformalization's scalability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a tool that automates the formalization of mathematical statements in quantum computation, aiding machine-verified peer review and data generation.

Method: MerLean extracts mathematical content from LaTeX, formalizes it in Lean 4 with Mathlib, and converts it back to LaTeX for semantic validation.

Result: Evaluated on three quantum computing papers, MerLean produced 2,050 Lean declarations from 114 statements, achieving automated formalization with minimal verification requirements.

Conclusion: Agentic autoformalization, as shown by MerLean, scales effectively, aiding verified review and creating data for reasoning model training while being extendable to mathematics and theoretical physics.

Abstract: We introduce MerLean, a fully automated agentic framework for autoformalization in quantum computation. MerLean extracts mathematical statements from \LaTeX{} source files, formalizes them into verified Lean~4 code built on Mathlib, and translates the result back into human-readable \LaTeX{} for semantic review. We evaluate MerLean on three theoretical quantum computing papers producing 2,050 Lean declarations from 114 statements in total. MerLean achieves end-to-end formalization on all three papers, reducing the verification burden to only the newly introduced definitions and axioms. Our results demonstrate that agentic autoformalization can scale to frontier research, offering both a practical tool for machine-verified peer review and a scalable engine for mining high-quality synthetic data to train future reasoning models. Our approach can also be generalized to any other rigorous research in mathematics and theoretical physics.

### [338] [Causal and Compositional Abstraction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16612)
*Robin Lorenz,Sean Tull*

Main category: cs.LO

TL;DR: This paper introduces a formalization of abstractions between models using category theory, particularly for causal models, unifying existing notions and proposing a novel perspective on abstractions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to enhance scientific practice, causal inference, and AI systems by providing a structured and interpretable way of abstracting between low-level and high-level models while preserving causal structures.

Method: Category theory is used to formalize causal abstractions, examining downward and upward abstractions and proposing stronger notions such as component-level abstraction. The study expands to quantum compositional models for explainable quantum AI.

Result: The authors unify different views on causal abstraction, propose mechanism-level abstraction with characterization results, and extend abstraction principles to compositional models with quantum semantics.

Conclusion: This work strengthens causal abstraction understanding and broadens its application, potentially improving AI interpretability and advancing models from classical to quantum-level applications.

Abstract: Abstracting from a low level to a more explanatory high level of description, and ideally while preserving causal structure, is fundamental to scientific practice, to causal inference problems, and to robust, efficient and interpretable AI. We present a general account of abstractions between low and high level models as natural transformations, focusing on the case of causal models. This provides a new formalisation of causal abstraction, unifying several notions in the literature, including constructive causal abstraction, Q-$τ$ consistency, abstractions based on interchange interventions, and `distributed' causal abstractions. Our approach is formalised in terms of category theory, and uses the general notion of a compositional model with a given set of queries and semantics in a monoidal, cd- or Markov category; causal models and their queries such as interventions being special cases. We identify two basic notions of abstraction: downward abstractions mapping queries from high to low level; and upward abstractions, mapping concrete queries such as Do-interventions from low to high. Although usually presented as the latter, we show how common causal abstractions may, more fundamentally, be understood in terms of the former. Our approach also leads us to consider a new stronger notion of `component-level' abstraction, applying to the individual components of a model. In particular, this yields a novel, strengthened form of constructive causal abstraction at the mechanism-level, for which we prove characterisation results. Finally, we show that abstraction can be generalised to further compositional models, including those with a quantum semantics implemented by quantum circuits, and we take first steps in exploring abstractions between quantum compositional circuit models and high-level classical causal models as a means to explainable quantum AI.

*Dimitri Yatsenko,Thinh T. Nguyen*

Main category: cs.DB

TL;DR: DataJoint 2.0 introduces a new model to unify scientific workflows using relational tables to ensure data integrity and seamless collaboration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the lack of integrated and consistent tools for handling scientific workflows, which often result in fragmented provenance and weak transactional guarantees.

Method: DataJoint 2.0 employs the relational workflow model, representing workflows as tables with embedded computational dependencies and integrity rules, while integrating object storage and coordination elements.

Result: This approach ensures data structure, dependencies, and transformations are unified, enforceable, and queryable, with added innovations like distributed job coordination.

Conclusion: DataJoint 2.0 provides a cohesive SciOps framework, enabling effective human-agent collaboration in scientific workflows while eliminating risks of data corruption.

Abstract: Operational rigor determines whether human-agent collaboration succeeds or fails. Scientific data pipelines need the equivalent of DevOps -- SciOps -- yet common approaches fragment provenance across disconnected systems without transactional guarantees. DataJoint 2.0 addresses this gap through the relational workflow model: tables represent workflow steps, rows represent artifacts, foreign keys prescribe execution order. The schema specifies not only what data exists but how it is derived -- a single formal system where data structure, computational dependencies, and integrity constraints are all queryable, enforceable, and machine-readable. Four technical innovations extend this foundation: object-augmented schemas integrating relational metadata with scalable object storage, semantic matching using attribute lineage to prevent erroneous joins, an extensible type system for domain-specific formats, and distributed job coordination designed for composability with external orchestration. By unifying data structure, data, and computational transformations, DataJoint creates a substrate for SciOps where agents can participate in scientific workflows without risking data corruption.

*Sonakshi Gupta,Akhlak Mahmood,Wei Xiong,Rampi Ramprasad*

Main category: cs.CE

TL;DR: The paper focuses on using retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) methods to enhance the extraction of domain-specific knowledge from polymer literature, comparing two approaches: VectorRAG and GraphRAG. It demonstrates that GraphRAG provides higher precision and interpretability while VectorRAG ensures broader recall.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the challenge of retrieving and reasoning over domain-specific polymer research buried in unstructured text, using tools that combine large language models with structured external retrieval for broader scientific reasoning.

Method: The authors develop two retrieval pipelines: VectorRAG using a dense semantic vector-based approach and GraphRAG based on a canonicalized structured knowledge graph. They evaluate the pipelines using standard metrics, comparisons with general AI systems, and validation by domain experts.

Result: GraphRAG showed higher precision and interpretability, while VectorRAG offered broader recall. Expert chemists validated that GraphRAG provided well-grounded, domain-relevant responses, establishing evidence-based retrieval with reliable citations.

Conclusion: This paper establishes a framework for leveraging RAG techniques like GraphRAG and VectorRAG to analyze polymer literature systematically. These methods enable trustworthy and scalable literature analysis while reducing dependence on proprietary models.

Abstract: Polymer literature contains a large and growing body of experimental knowledge, yet much of it is buried in unstructured text and inconsistent terminology, making systematic retrieval and reasoning difficult. Existing tools typically extract narrow, study-specific facts in isolation, failing to preserve the cross-study context required to answer broader scientific questions. Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) offers a promising way to overcome this limitation by combining large language models (LLMs) with external retrieval, but its effectiveness depends strongly on how domain knowledge is represented. In this work, we develop two retrieval pipelines: a dense semantic vector-based approach (VectorRAG) and a graph-based approach (GraphRAG). Using over 1,000 polyhydroxyalkanoate (PHA) papers, we construct context-preserving paragraph embeddings and a canonicalized structured knowledge graph supporting entity disambiguation and multi-hop reasoning. We evaluate these pipelines through standard retrieval metrics, comparisons with general state-of-the-art systems such as GPT and Gemini, and qualitative validation by a domain chemist. The results show that GraphRAG achieves higher precision and interpretability, while VectorRAG provides broader recall, highlighting complementary trade-offs. Expert validation further confirms that the tailored pipelines, particularly GraphRAG, produce well-grounded, citation-reliable responses with strong domain relevance. By grounding every statement in evidence, these systems enable researchers to navigate the literature, compare findings across studies, and uncover patterns that are difficult to extract manually. More broadly, this work establishes a practical framework for building materials science assistants using curated corpora and retrieval design, reducing reliance on proprietary models while enabling trustworthy literature analysis at scale.

*Paul Tschisgale,Peter Wulff*

Main category: stat.AP

TL;DR: The paper investigates the time variability in GPT-4o's performance under fixed conditions and finds periodic patterns impacting reliability and reproducibility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the assumption that LLMs exhibit time-invariant performance, which is critical for ensuring the reliability, validity, and replicability of research findings.

Method: A longitudinal study was conducted where GPT-4o was repeatedly tested on the same task every three hours over three months using fixed settings, and spectral analysis was used to assess performance variability.

Result: The findings reveal periodic variability in LLM performance, attributed to daily and weekly rhythms, which accounted for about 20% of the variance.

Conclusion: LLM performance is not entirely time-invariant even under controlled conditions, which raises concerns about the validity and reproducibility of research relying on such models.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used in research both as tools and as objects of investigation. Much of this work implicitly assumes that LLM performance under fixed conditions (identical model snapshot, hyperparameters, and prompt) is time-invariant. If average output quality changes systematically over time, this assumption is violated, threatening the reliability, validity, and reproducibility of findings. To empirically examine this assumption, we conducted a longitudinal study on the temporal variability of GPT-4o's average performance. Using a fixed model snapshot, fixed hyperparameters, and identical prompting, GPT-4o was queried via the API to solve the same multiple-choice physics task every three hours for approximately three months. Ten independent responses were generated at each time point and their scores were averaged. Spectral (Fourier) analysis of the resulting time series revealed notable periodic variability in average model performance, accounting for approximately 20% of the total variance. In particular, the observed periodic patterns are well explained by the interaction of a daily and a weekly rhythm. These findings indicate that, even under controlled conditions, LLM performance may vary periodically over time, calling into question the assumption of time invariance. Implications for ensuring validity and replicability of research that uses or investigates LLMs are discussed.

### [342] [Surrogate-Based Prevalence Measurement for Large-Scale A/B Testing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16111)
*Zehao Xu,Tony Paek,Kevin O'Sullivan,Attila Dobi*

Main category: stat.AP

TL;DR: The paper introduces a scalable framework for prevalence measurement using surrogates, allowing efficient estimation across multiple A/B test arms without repetitive labeling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to reduce the cost and time required for measuring user exposure to specific content in A/B experiments, as repetitive labeling for every test is impractical at scale.

Method: The framework uses surrogate-based prevalence measurement by calibrating offline surrogate signals to reference labels. It employs score bucketing to estimate and combine calibrated bucket prevalences with impression logs for fast evaluations.

Result: The proposed method is validated across large-scale A/B tests, demonstrating accurate surrogate estimation comparable to reference estimates for both prevalence and deltas between treatment and control.

Conclusion: This framework provides a scalable, efficient method for prevalence measurement in A/B experimentation, eliminating the need for costly and time-intensive per-experiment labeling.

Abstract: Online media platforms often need to measure how frequently users are exposed to specific content attributes in order to evaluate trade-offs in A/B experiments. A direct approach is to sample content, label it using a high-quality rubric (e.g., an expert-reviewed LLM prompt), and estimate impression-weighted prevalence. However, repeatedly running such labeling for every experiment arm and segment is too costly and slow to serve as a default measurement at scale.
  We present a scalable \emph{surrogate-based prevalence measurement} framework that decouples expensive labeling from per-experiment evaluation. The framework calibrates a surrogate signal to reference labels offline and then uses only impression logs to estimate prevalence for arbitrary experiment arms and segments. We instantiate this framework using \emph{score bucketing} as the surrogate: we discretize a model score into buckets, estimate bucket-level prevalences from an offline labeled sample, and combine these calibrated bucket level prevalences with the bucket distribution of impressions in each arm to obtain fast, log-based estimates.
  Across multiple large-scale A/B tests, we validate that the surrogate estimates closely match the reference estimates for both arm-level prevalence and treatment--control deltas. This enables scalable, low-latency prevalence measurement in experimentation without requiring per-experiment labeling jobs.

*Dan Adler*

TL;DR: The paper introduces Stability-Driven Assembly (SDA) as a new framework for modeling evolutionary dynamics beyond equilibrium constraints, illustrating its implications for economics, policy, and system modeling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper seeks to address the limitations of existing system dynamics models, which are often confined to equilibrium-seeking behavior and fixed state spaces, and to propose a framework that models evolutionary dynamics more realistically.

Method: The authors developed the Stability-Driven Assembly (SDA) framework, which uses stochastic interactions and differential persistence to generate endogenous selection without relying on traditional elements like genes or fitness functions.

Result: SDA demonstrates how population composition influences system dynamics, producing fitness-proportional sampling as an emergent property and revealing the limitations of traditional equilibrium-based models in capturing open-ended evolutionary processes.

Conclusion: The study underscores the need for embracing population-dependent, non-stationary dynamics in system modeling, highlighting SDA's potential to advance economic, policy, and AI-enabled agent-based models for sustained novelty and structural emergence.

Abstract: Complex change is often described as "evolutionary" in economics, policy, and technology, yet most system dynamics models remain constrained to fixed state spaces and equilibrium-seeking behavior. This paper argues that evolutionary dynamics should be treated as a core system-thinking problem rather than as a biological metaphor. We introduce Stability-Driven Assembly (SDA) as a minimal, non-equilibrium framework in which stochastic interactions combined with differential persistence generate endogenous selection without genes, replication, or predefined fitness functions. In SDA, longer-lived patterns accumulate in the population, biasing future interactions and creating feedback between population composition and system dynamics. This feedback yields fitness-proportional sampling as an emergent property, realizing a natural genetic algorithm driven solely by stability. Using SDA, we demonstrate why equilibrium-constrained models, even when simulated numerically, cannot exhibit open-ended evolution: evolutionary systems require population-dependent, non-stationary dynamics in which structure and dynamics co-evolve. We conclude by discussing implications for system dynamics, economics, and policy modeling, and outline how agent-based and AI-enabled approaches may support evolutionary models capable of sustained novelty and structural emergence.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the nonlinear mechanisms (TQ and LQ) governing solar cycle modulation and to enhance predictive accuracy of solar dynamics using advanced computational methods.

Method: PINNs were used to solve the SFT equation while embedding physical constraints. By varying transport parameters, the study analyzed the contributions of TQ and LQ in polar field formation, comparing these effects through error metrics.

Result: PINNs proved to have lower error metrics and stronger recovery of nonlinear trends compared to traditional models. Key findings highlighted the dominance of LQ in advection regimes and TQ suppression under high diffusivity. Results refined prior empirical fits and showed no need for decay terms in PINN setups.

Conclusion: PINNs offer an effective, efficient, and accurate tool for studying solar magnetic processes. The nonlinear interaction of LQ and TQ explains strong-weak cycle alternations and even-odd cycle modulation, advancing solar cycle predictions.

Abstract: The solar dynamo relies on the regeneration of the poloidal magnetic field through processes strongly modulated by nonlinear feedbacks such as tilt quenching (TQ) and latitude quenching (LQ). These mechanisms play a decisive role in regulating the buildup of the Sun's polar field and, in turn, the amplitude of future solar cycles. In this work, we employ Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINN) to solve the surface flux transport (SFT) equation, embedding physical constraints directly into the neural network framework. By systematically varying transport parameters, we isolate the relative contributions of TQ and LQ to polar dipole buildup. We use the residual dipole moment as a diagnostic for cycle-to-cycle amplification and show that TQ suppression strengthens with increasing diffusivity, while LQ dominates in advection-dominated regimes. The ratio $ΔD_{\mathrm{LQ}}/ΔD_{\mathrm{TQ}}$ exhibits a smooth inverse-square dependence on the dynamo effectivity range, refining previous empirical fits with improved accuracy and reduced scatter. The results further reveal that the need for a decay term is not essential for PINN set-up due to the training process. Compared with the traditional 1D SFT model, the PINN framework achieves significantly lower error metrics and more robust recovery of nonlinear trends. Our results suggest that the nonlinear interplay between LQ and TQ can naturally produce alternations between weak and strong cycles, providing a physical explanation for the observed even-odd cycle modulation. These findings demonstrate the potential of PINN as an accurate, efficient, and physically consistent tool for solar cycle prediction.

Main category: stat.CO

TL;DR: The paper explores how uncertainty from approximations in submodels affects the assessment of system performance in stochastic simulations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of unknown or computationally intensive subprocesses in simulation models that introduce uncertainty in estimated system performance.

Method: A framework is developed using bootstrapping, Bayesian model averaging, and tree-based methods to quantify and attribute submodel uncertainty in stochastic simulation models.

Result: The framework demonstrates effectiveness in identifying individual submodels' contributions to output uncertainty in synthetic and digital-twin simulation experiments.

Conclusion: The study highlights the critical role of understanding submodel uncertainty in simulations to improve the reliability of system performance assessments.

Abstract: Stochastic simulation is widely used to study complex systems composed of various interconnected subprocesses, such as input processes, routing and control logic, optimization routines, and data-driven decision modules. In practice, these subprocesses may be inherently unknown or too computationally intensive to directly embed in the simulation model. Replacing these elements with estimated or learned approximations introduces a form of epistemic uncertainty that we refer to as submodel uncertainty. This paper investigates how submodel uncertainty affects the estimation of system performance metrics. We develop a framework for quantifying submodel uncertainty in stochastic simulation models and extend the framework to digital-twin settings, where simulation experiments are repeatedly conducted with the model initialized from observed system states. Building on approaches from input uncertainty analysis, we leverage bootstrapping and Bayesian model averaging to construct quantile-based confidence or credible intervals for key performance indicators. We propose a tree-based method that decomposes total output variability and attributes uncertainty to individual submodels in the form of importance scores. The proposed framework is model-agnostic and accommodates both parametric and nonparametric submodels under frequentist and Bayesian modeling paradigms. A synthetic numerical experiment and a more realistic digital-twin simulation of a contact center illustrate the importance of understanding how and how much individual submodels contribute to overall uncertainty.

Method: This investigation employed grounded theory, interviewing eleven part-time university students from a distance learning program to analyze their generative AI usage patterns.

Result: Three causal and four intervening conditions were identified, along with strategies influencing GenAI use. The findings highlight productivity and learning benefits alongside ethical challenges and risks of academic misconduct.

Conclusion: A grounded model was developed providing insights into GenAI usage, bridging education and business, and offering recommendations for educators, policymakers, and tool developers.

Abstract: This study investigates generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) usage of university students who study alongside their professional career. Previous literature has paid little attention to part-time students and the intersectional use of GenAI between education and business. This study examines with a grounded theory approach the characteristics of GenAI usage of part-time students. Eleven students from a distance learning university were interviewed. Three causal and four intervening conditions, as well as strategies were identified, to influence the use of GenAI. The study highlights both the potential and challenges of GenAI usage in education and business. While GenAI can significantly enhance productivity and learning outcomes, concerns about ethical implications, reliability, and the risk of academic misconduct persist. The developed grounded model offers a comprehensive understanding of GenAI usage among students, providing valuable insights for educators, policymakers, and developers of GenAI tools seeking to bridge the gap between education and business.

### [347] [Measuring Mid-2025 LLM-Assistance on Novice Performance in Biology](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16703)
*Shen Zhou Hong,Alex Kleinman,Alyssa Mathiowetz,Adam Howes,Julian Cohen,Suveer Ganta,Alex Letizia,Dora Liao,Deepika Pahari,Xavier Roberts-Gaal,Luca Righetti,Joe Torres*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: The study analyzed if large language models (LLMs) improve novice performance in viral reverse genetics laboratory tasks. Results showed no substantial enhancements, though modest improvements were noted in intermediate steps and specific tasks, highlighting a gap between digital benchmarks and real-world effectiveness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper is motivated by concerns over LLMs potentially aiding novices in acquiring dangerous lab skills and the lack of evidence on their real-world impact in physical laboratories.

Method: The study employed a pre-registered, investigator-blinded, randomized controlled trial with 153 participants to evaluate LLMs' impact on novice performance in completing tasks modeling viral reverse genetics workflows.

Result: No significant improvement in overall workflow completion was observed with LLMs compared to internet use, though modest benefits were seen in intermediate steps and cell culture tasks. Bayesian modeling suggested an approximately 1.4-fold increase in task success with LLM assistance.

Conclusion: Current LLMs (mid-2025) provide limited real-world utility for enhancing novice execution of complex lab procedures. These findings emphasize the disconnect between AI benchmarks and physical-world outcomes, stressing the need for better real-world validations of AI applications.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) perform strongly on biological benchmarks, raising concerns that they may help novice actors acquire dual-use laboratory skills. Yet, whether this translates to improved human performance in the physical laboratory remains unclear. To address this, we conducted a pre-registered, investigator-blinded, randomized controlled trial (June-August 2025; n = 153) evaluating whether LLMs improve novice performance in tasks that collectively model a viral reverse genetics workflow. We observed no significant difference in the primary endpoint of workflow completion (5.2% LLM vs. 6.6% Internet; P = 0.759), nor in the success rate of individual tasks. However, the LLM arm had numerically higher success rates in four of the five tasks, most notably for the cell culture task (68.8% LLM vs. 55.3% Internet; P = 0.059). Post-hoc Bayesian modeling of pooled data estimates an approximate 1.4-fold increase (95% CrI 0.74-2.62) in success for a "typical" reverse genetics task under LLM assistance. Ordinal regression modelling suggests that participants in the LLM arm were more likely to progress through intermediate steps across all tasks (posterior probability of a positive effect: 81%-96%). Overall, mid-2025 LLMs did not substantially increase novice completion of complex laboratory procedures but were associated with a modest performance benefit. These results reveal a gap between in silico benchmarks and real-world utility, underscoring the need for physical-world validation of AI biosecurity assessments as model capabilities and user proficiency evolve.

*Rakshit Kumar Singh,Aryan Amit Barsainyan,Bharath Ramsundar*

Main category: cond-mat.mtrl-sci

TL;DR: The paper presents a differentiable framework combining machine learning models with density functional theory to replace traditional exchange-correlation functionals for simulating large periodic systems more efficiently.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to overcome the computational cost barrier in DFT, especially for large systems, by leveraging advancements in ML-based exchange-correlation functionals.

Method: The authors propose a differentiable framework using neural networks as drop-in replacements for exchange-correlation functionals within DFT. It employs PyTorch for differentiability and integrates with the DeepChem library for accessibility.

Result: In benchmarking tests against GPAW and PySCF, the machine learning models achieve relative errors of 5-10%, demonstrating competitive accuracy.

Conclusion: The framework successfully integrates machine learning into DFT, offering a differentiable and user-friendly platform for periodic systems with competitive error rates and potential for broader adoption.

Abstract: Density Functional Theory (DFT) is widely used for first-principles simulations in chemistry and materials science, but its computational cost remains a key limitation for large systems. Motivated by recent advances in ML-based exchange-correlation (XC) functionals, this paper introduces a differentiable framework that integrates machine learning models into density functional theory (DFT) for solids and other periodic systems. The framework defines a clean API for neural network models that can act as drop in replacements for conventional exchange-correlation (XC) functionals and enables gradients to flow through the full self-consistent DFT workflow. The framework is implemented in Python using a PyTorch backend, making it fully differentiable and easy to use with standard deep learning tools. We integrate the implementation with the DeepChem library to promote the reuse of established models and to lower the barrier for experimentation. In initial benchmarks against established electronic structure packages (GPAW and PySCF), our models achieve relative errors on the order of 5-10%.

*Bin Cao,Qian Zhang,Zhenjie Feng,Taolue Zhang,Jiaqiang Huang,Lu-Tao Weng,Tong-Yi Zhang*

Main category: cond-mat.mtrl-sci

TL;DR: The paper introduces WPEM, a new physics-constrained XRD data analysis method, which ensures Bragg law consistency and improves intensity representation under complex diffraction scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AI tools for XRD analysis fail in refinement due to unstable peak intensity assignments under overlap and weak diffraction consistency enforcement.

Method: WPEM employs a physics-constrained, batch expectation-maximization framework modeling diffraction patterns as probabilistic mixtures, ensuring Bragg’s law consistency and stable intensity assignments.

Result: WPEM outperforms existing tools like FullProf and TOPAS on benchmarks and demonstrates robust generality across diverse experimental XRD scenarios, including phase decomposition and high-throughput analyses.

Conclusion: WPEM bridges the gap between AI-generated hypotheses and diffraction-refinement compatibility, providing a significant improvement in processing challenging XRD datasets.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence can rapidly propose candidate phases and structures from X-ray diffraction (XRD), but these hypotheses often fail in downstream refinement because peak intensities cannot be stably assigned under severe overlap and diffraction consistency is enforced only weakly. Here we introduce WPEM, a physics-constrained whole-pattern decomposition and refinement workflow that turns Bragg's law into an explicit constraint within a batch expectation--maximization framework. WPEM models the full profile as a probabilistic mixture density and iteratively infers component-resolved intensities while keeping peak centres Bragg-consistent, producing a continuous, physically admissible intensity representation that remains stable in heavily overlapped regions and in the presence of mixed radiation or multiple phases. We benchmark WPEM on standard reference patterns (\ce{PbSO4} and \ce{Tb2BaCoO5}), where it yields lower $R_{\mathrm{p}}$/$R_{\mathrm{wp}}$ than widely used packages (FullProf and TOPAS) under matched refinement conditions. We further demonstrate generality across realistic experimental scenarios, including phase-resolved decomposition of a multiphase Ti--15Nb thin film, quantitative recovery of \ce{NaCl}--\ce{Li2CO3} mixture compositions, separation of crystalline peaks from amorphous halos in semicrystalline polymers, high-throughput operando lattice tracking in layered cathodes, automated refinement of a compositionally disordered Ru--Mn oxide solid solution (CCDC 2530452), and quantitative phase-resolved deciphering of an ancient Egyptian make-up sample from synchrotron powder XRD. By providing Bragg-consistent, uncertainty-aware intensity partitioning as a refinement-ready interface, WPEM closes the gap between AI-generated hypotheses and diffraction-admissible structure refinement on challenging XRD data.

*Santiago Jimenez-Navarro,Belen Masia,Ana Serrano*

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: This study examines how gloss and artistic style are represented and disentangled in a generative model, enabling fine-grained synthesis of non-photorealistic images.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore human ability to perceive gloss in artistic forms and investigate its representation in learned models, particularly focusing on disentangling gloss from artistic styles.

Method: An unsupervised generative model was trained on a custom dataset of painterly objects systematically varying gloss and style factors. A lightweight adapter links the gloss-aware latent space to a latent-diffusion model for image synthesis.

Result: The analysis shows a hierarchical latent space where gloss is disentangled from other factors, facilitating controlled synthesis of non-photorealistic images with improved disentanglement and controllability.

Conclusion: The disentangled representation of gloss enhances understanding of material appearance across styles and enables better control in generating artistic images using generative models.

Abstract: Humans can infer material characteristics of objects from their visual appearance, and this ability extends to artistic depictions, where similar perceptual strategies guide the interpretation of paintings or drawings. Among the factors that define material appearance, gloss, along with color, is widely regarded as one of the most important, and recent studies indicate that humans can perceive gloss independently of the artistic style used to depict an object. To investigate how gloss and artistic style are represented in learned models, we train an unsupervised generative model on a newly curated dataset of painterly objects designed to systematically vary such factors. Our analysis reveals a hierarchical latent space in which gloss is disentangled from other appearance factors, allowing for a detailed study of how gloss is represented and varies across artistic styles. Building on this representation, we introduce a lightweight adapter that connects our style- and gloss-aware latent space to a latent-diffusion model, enabling the synthesis of non-photorealistic images with fine-grained control of these factors. We compare our approach with previous models and observe improved disentanglement and controllability of the learned factors.

*Md Hossain Sahadath,Qiyun Cheng,Shaowu Pan,Wei Ji*

Main category: physics.comp-ph

TL;DR: This study presents a neural operator framework using DeepONet and FNO for neutron transport computation, showing high accuracy and efficiency especially in computational speed over traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The work is driven by the need to develop fast, accurate, and generalizable computational models for neutron transport to enable real-time applications and repeated evaluations, such as in design optimization.

Method: Two neural operator architectures (DeepONet and Fourier Neural Operator) were trained to map neutron source configurations to angular fluxes in a 1D slab geometry, with evaluations across different scattering ratios and source settings.

Result: FNO exhibited higher accuracy, while DeepONet demonstrated better computational efficiency. Both models significantly outperformed a conventional S_N solver in speed, with runtime reductions of >99%. They also integrated well with S_N k-eigenvalue solvers, maintaining good accuracy.

Conclusion: Neural operator frameworks demonstrate promising potential as surrogate models for neutron transport computations, enabling efficient and accurate solutions suitable for real-time and iterative applications.

Abstract: This work introduces a neural operator based surrogate modeling framework for neutron transport computation. Two architectures, the Deep Operator Network (DeepONet) and the Fourier Neural Operator (FNO), were trained for fixed source problems to learn the mapping from anisotropic neutron sources, Q(x,μ), to the corresponding angular fluxes, ψ(x,μ), in a one-dimensional slab geometry. Three distinct models were trained for each neural operator, corresponding to different scattering ratios (c = 0.1, 0.5, & 1.0), providing insight into their performance across distinct transport regimes (absorption-dominated, moderate, and scattering-dominated). The models were subsequently evaluated on a wide range of previously unseen source configurations, demonstrating that FNO generally achieves higher predictive accuracy, while DeepONet offers greater computational efficiency. Both models offered significant speedups that become increasingly pronounced as the scattering ratio increases, requiring <0.3% of the runtime of a conventional S_N solver. The surrogate models were further incorporated into the S_N k-eigenvalue solver, replacing the computationally intensive transport sweep loop with a single forward pass. Across varying fission cross sections and spatial-angular grids, both neural operator solvers reproduced reference eigenvalues with deviations up to 135 pcm for DeepONet and 112 pcm for FNO, while reducing runtime to <0.1% of that of the S_N solver on relatively fine grids. These results demonstrate the strong potential of neural operator frameworks as accurate, efficient, and generalizable surrogates for neutron transport, paving the way for real-time digital twin applications and repeated evaluations, such as in design optimization.

*Fatih Temiz,Shavbo Salehi,Melike Erol-Kantarci*

Main category: cs.NI

TL;DR: The paper introduces Federated Split Decision Transformer (FSDT), an offline reinforcement learning (RL) framework aimed at improving the quality of experience (QoE) and reducing computational burdens in MEC-driven wireless metaverse services.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation stems from the need to improve user QoE for metaverse services in MEC environments while addressing latency constraints, visual quality demands, and challenges associated with federated learning (FL) in heterogeneous multi-radio technology environments.

Method: The method involves using a federated learning framework combined with reinforcement learning, employing a transformer model partitioned between MEC servers and the cloud for local adaptability and global cooperative training.

Result: Experimental results show that FSDT improves QoE by up to 10% in heterogeneous environments compared to traditional methods and reduces computational load on MEC servers by offloading 98% of the transformer model parameters to the cloud.

Conclusion: FSDT effectively addresses challenges in enhancing QoE and reducing computational burdens through a hybrid approach of local adaptability and cooperative cloud-based training, making it suitable for heterogeneous MEC environments.

Abstract: Mobile edge computing (MEC) based wireless metaverse services offer an untethered, immersive experience to users, where the superior quality of experience (QoE) needs to be achieved under stringent latency constraints and visual quality demands. To achieve this, MEC-based intelligent resource allocation for virtual reality users needs to be supported by coordination across MEC servers to harness distributed data. Federated learning (FL) is a promising solution, and can be combined with reinforcement learning (RL) to develop generalized policies across MEC-servers. However, conventional FL incurs transmitting the full model parameters across the MEC-servers and the cloud, and suffer performance degradation due to naive global aggregation, especially in heterogeneous multi-radio access technology environments. To address these challenges, this paper proposes Federated Split Decision Transformer (FSDT), an offline RL framework where the transformer model is partitioned between MEC servers and the cloud. Agent-specific components (e.g., MEC-based embedding and prediction layers) enable local adaptability, while shared global layers in the cloud facilitate cooperative training across MEC servers. Experimental results demonstrate that FSDT enhances QoE for up to 10% in heterogeneous environments compared to baselines, while offloadingnearly 98% of the transformer model parameters to the cloud, thereby reducing the computational burden on MEC servers.

TL;DR: Proposes a quantum graph convolutional architecture for unsupervised learning in NISQ quantum systems, utilizing qubit-efficient message passing and achieving competitive performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome challenges of implementing graph neural networks on near-term quantum hardware due to circuit depth, complex interactions, and scalability constraints.

Method: Introduces a variational quantum feature extraction layer and edge-local pairwise qubit-efficient message passing inspired by QAOA, using hardware-native operations.

Result: Reduces qubit requirements significantly, and unsupervised training on datasets like Cora citation network and genomic SNP yields competitive results.

Conclusion: The proposed architecture enables practical implementation on current quantum devices for unsupervised learning on graph-structured data.

Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) are a powerful framework for learning representations from graph-structured data, but their direct implementation on near-term quantum hardware remains challenging due to circuit depth, multi-qubit interactions, and qubit scalability constraints. In this work, we introduce a fully quantum graph convolutional architecture designed explicitly for unsupervised learning in the noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) regime. Our approach combines a variational quantum feature extraction layer with an edge-local and qubit-efficient quantum message-passing mechanism inspired by the Quantum Alternating Operator Ansatz (QAOA) framework. Unlike prior models that rely on global operations or multi-controlled unitaries, our model decomposes message passing into pairwise interactions along graph edges using only hardware-native single- and two-qubit gates. This design reduces the qubit requirement from $O(Nn)$ to $O(n)$ for a graph with $N$ nodes and $n$-qubit feature registers, enabling implementation on current quantum devices regardless of graph size. We train the model using the Deep Graph Infomax objective to perform unsupervised node representation learning. Experiments on the Cora citation network and a large-scale genomic SNP dataset demonstrate that our model remains competitive with prior quantum and hybrid approaches.

*Guang Lin,Toshihisa Tanaka,Qibin Zhao*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: The paper proposes TNQE, a circuit-efficient quantum data encoding framework using tensor network representations to address the challenge of encoding classical data into quantum states efficiently.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The challenge of encoding classical data into quantum states is a bottleneck for quantum machine learning due to existing methods requiring deep circuits and substantial quantum resources, limiting scalability.

Method: TNQE uses a tensor network decomposition to represent classical inputs and compiles them into shallow quantum circuits through two core-to-circuit encoding strategies, implementing a unitary-aware constraint for trainability and optimization.

Result: TNQE enables the construction of encoding circuits that are 0.04× the depth of amplitude encoding, scales to high-resolution image data, and demonstrates feasibility on real quantum hardware.

Conclusion: TNQE provides a scalable and efficient solution to classical-to-quantum data encoding, making quantum machine learning more practical with reduced circuit depth and quantum resource usage.

Abstract: Encoding classical data into quantum states is a central bottleneck in quantum machine learning: many widely used encodings are circuit-inefficient, requiring deep circuits and substantial quantum resources, which limits scalability on quantum hardware. In this work, we propose TNQE, a circuit-efficient quantum data encoding framework built on structured unitary tensor network (TN) representations. TNQE first represents each classical input via a TN decomposition and then compiles the resulting tensor cores into an encoding circuit through two complementary core-to-circuit strategies. To make this compilation trainable while respecting the unitary nature of quantum operations, we introduce a unitary-aware constraint that parameterizes TN cores as learnable block unitaries, enabling them to be directly optimized and directly encoded as quantum operators. The proposed TNQE framework enables explicit control over circuit depth and qubit resources, allowing the construction of shallow, resource-efficient circuits. Across a range of benchmarks, TNQE achieves encoding circuits as shallow as $0.04\times$ the depth of amplitude encoding, while naturally scaling to high-resolution images ($256 \times 256$) and demonstrating practical feasibility on real quantum hardware.

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: The paper proposes MFLI, a scalable retrieval system eliminating the need for ANN search during serving, and showcases significant improvement in recommendation performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations in ANN-based retrieval such as suboptimal retrieval quality and high computation costs at scale.

Method: Introduce MFLI, leveraging multifaceted hierarchical codebooks via residual quantization, co-training embeddings with codebooks, and enabling real-time updates.

Result: Experiments show up to 57.29% improvement in cold-content delivery, 11.8% better recall, and 13.5% higher semantic relevance, alongside enhanced deployment performance.

Conclusion: MFLI effectively improves recommendation system efficiency and performance, reducing computation cost and supporting real-time index updates.

Abstract: Approximate nearest neighbor (ANN) search is widely used in the retrieval stage of large-scale recommendation systems. In this stage, candidate items are indexed using their learned embedding vectors, and ANN search is executed for each user (or item) query to retrieve a set of relevant items. However, ANN-based retrieval has two key limitations. First, item embeddings and their indices are typically learned in separate stages: indexing is often performed offline after embeddings are trained, which can yield suboptimal retrieval quality-especially for newly created items. Second, although ANN offers sublinear query time, it must still be run for every request, incurring substantial computation cost at industry scale. In this paper, we propose MultiFaceted Learnable Index (MFLI), a scalable, real-time retrieval paradigm that learns multifaceted item embeddings and indices within a unified framework and eliminates ANN search at serving time. Specifically, we construct a multifaceted hierarchical codebook via residual quantization of item embeddings and co-train the codebook with the embeddings. We further introduce an efficient multifaceted indexing structure and mechanisms that support real-time updates. At serving time, the learned hierarchical indices are used directly to identify relevant items, avoiding ANN search altogether. Extensive experiments on real-world data with billions of users show that MFLI improves recall on engagement tasks by up to 11.8\%, cold-content delivery by up to 57.29\%, and semantic relevance by 13.5\% compared with prior state-of-the-art methods. We also deploy MFLI in the system and report online experimental results demonstrating improved engagement, less popularity bias, and higher serving efficiency.

*Hongyeon Yu,Dongchan Kim,Young-Bum Kim*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: The paper examines Retrieval Collapse, where search engines increasingly rely on AI-generated content, creating risks of reduced source diversity and misinformation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the structural risks that arise as AI-generated content increasingly dominates search results and infiltrates information retrieval pipelines.

Method: Through controlled experiments comparing high-quality SEO-style contamination and adversarial content infiltration, evaluating the impact on retrieval pipelines.

Result: SEO contamination led to homogenized exposure (80%), with deceptive accuracy in responses. Adversarial content exposed certain flaws, with BM25 baseline ranking exposing harmful content (19%), while LLM-based rankers suppressed it more effectively.

Conclusion: Retrieval pipelines are at risk of shifting toward synthetic evidence, requiring robust strategies to counter the decline of quality and diversity in information retrieval systems.

Abstract: The rapid proliferation of AI-generated content on the Web presents a structural risk to information retrieval, as search engines and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems increasingly consume evidence produced by the Large Language Models (LLMs). We characterize this ecosystem-level failure mode as Retrieval Collapse, a two-stage process where (1) AI-generated content dominates search results, eroding source diversity, and (2) low-quality or adversarial content infiltrates the retrieval pipeline. We analyzed this dynamic through controlled experiments involving both high-quality SEO-style content and adversarially crafted content. In the SEO scenario, a 67\% pool contamination led to over 80\% exposure contamination, creating a homogenized yet deceptively healthy state where answer accuracy remains stable despite the reliance on synthetic sources. Conversely, under adversarial contamination, baselines like BM25 exposed $\sim$19\% of harmful content, whereas LLM-based rankers demonstrated stronger suppression capabilities. These findings highlight the risk of retrieval pipelines quietly shifting toward synthetic evidence and the need for retrieval-aware strategies to prevent a self-reinforcing cycle of quality decline in Web-grounded systems.

### [357] [Variable-Length Semantic IDs for Recommender Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16375)
*Kirill Khrylchenko*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: The paper addresses the inefficiency of fixed-length semantic identifiers in recommender systems by proposing a novel method using variable-length semantic identifiers for better adaptation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the inefficiency and limitations of fixed-length semantic identifiers in diverse item catalogs, especially considering the varying description requirements of popular versus long-tail items.

Method: The authors propose a discrete variational autoencoder with Gumbel-Softmax reparameterization to generate variable-length semantic identifiers, improving efficiency and aligning better with real-world data distributions.

Result: The proposed approach enables adaptive-length representations while avoiding the instability of reinforcement learning and limitations of current fixed-length methods.

Conclusion: Variable-length semantic identifiers bridge recommender systems with emergent communication and present an effective solution to the vocabulary gap and inefficiency in generative models for recommendation systems.

Abstract: Generative models are increasingly used in recommender systems, both for modeling user behavior as event sequences and for integrating large language models into recommendation pipelines. A key challenge in this setting is the extremely large cardinality of item spaces, which makes training generative models difficult and introduces a vocabulary gap between natural language and item identifiers. Semantic identifiers (semantic IDs), which represent items as sequences of low-cardinality tokens, have recently emerged as an effective solution to this problem.
  However, existing approaches generate semantic identifiers of fixed length, assigning the same description length to all items. This is inefficient, misaligned with natural language, and ignores the highly skewed frequency structure of real-world catalogs, where popular items and rare long-tail items exhibit fundamentally different information requirements. In parallel, the emergent communication literature studies how agents develop discrete communication protocols, often producing variable-length messages in which frequent concepts receive shorter descriptions. Despite the conceptual similarity, these ideas have not been systematically adopted in recommender systems.
  In this work, we bridge recommender systems and emergent communication by introducing variable-length semantic identifiers for recommendation. We propose a discrete variational autoencoder with Gumbel-Softmax reparameterization that learns item representations of adaptive length under a principled probabilistic framework, avoiding the instability of REINFORCE-based training and the fixed-length constraints of prior semantic ID methods.

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: The paper discusses a feedback-loop model for understanding systemic effects in recommender systems, analyzing both individual diversity and collective demand redistribution.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To better understand the systemic effects of feedback loops in recommender systems as existing simulation studies often make unrealistic assumptions.

Method: A detailed feedback-loop model incorporating implicit feedback, periodic retraining, probabilistic recommendation adoption, and heterogeneous systems, applied to online retail and music streaming data.

Result: Findings show diversification in individual consumption with increased recommender adoption, but collective demand often amplifies popularity concentration. Temporal analysis reveals decreasing individual diversity over time regardless of static evaluation increases.

Conclusion: The study emphasizes the need to account for dynamic feedback-loop effects when designing and evaluating recommender systems instead of relying solely on static studies.

Abstract: Recommender systems shape individual choices through feedback loops in which user behavior and algorithmic recommendations coevolve over time. The systemic effects of these loops remain poorly understood, in part due to unrealistic assumptions in existing simulation studies. We propose a feedback-loop model that captures implicit feedback, periodic retraining, probabilistic adoption of recommendations, and heterogeneous recommender systems. We apply the framework on online retail and music streaming data and analyze systemic effects of the feedback loop. We find that increasing recommender adoption may lead to a progressive diversification of individual consumption, while collective demand is redistributed in model- and domain-dependent ways, often amplifying popularity concentration. Temporal analyses further reveal that apparent increases in individual diversity observed in static evaluations are illusory: when adoption is fixed and time unfolds, individual diversity consistently decreases across all models. Our results highlight the need to move beyond static evaluations and explicitly account for feedback-loop dynamics when designing recommender systems.

*Subham Pokhriyal,Shweta Jain,Vaneet Aggarwal*

Main category: cs.GT

TL;DR: The paper addresses the Submodular Welfare Problem (SWP) under bandit feedback, proposing a novel framework and method with proven regret guarantees.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to extend classical SWP approaches, which assume full oracle access, to scenarios where decision making occurs under bandit feedback with multiple non-communicating agents.

Method: The authors introduce an explore-then-commit strategy within a multi-agent combinatorial bandit (MA-CMAB) framework, employing randomized assignments to couple agents through shared allocation constraints.

Result: The method achieves a regret guarantee of \(\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(T^{2/3})\) against a \((1-1/e)\) benchmark, which marks a significant step forward for partition-based SWP under bandit feedback.

Conclusion: This paper provides the first regret guarantee for the submodular welfare problem in partition-based scenarios under bandit feedback, advancing the theoretical foundation for real-world applications.

Abstract: We study the \emph{Submodular Welfare Problem} (SWP), where items are partitioned among agents with monotone submodular utilities to maximize the total welfare under \emph{bandit feedback}. Classical SWP assumes full value-oracle access, achieving $(1-1/e)$ approximations via continuous-greedy algorithms. We extend this to a \emph{multi-agent combinatorial bandit} framework (\textsc{MA-CMAB}), where actions are partitions under full-bandit feedback with non-communicating agents. Unlike prior single-agent or separable multi-agent CMAB models, our setting couples agents through shared allocation constraints. We propose an explore-then-commit strategy with randomized assignments, achieving $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(T^{2/3})$ regret against a $(1-1/e)$ benchmark, the first such guarantee for partition-based submodular welfare problem under bandit feedback.

### [360] [Temporal Panel Selection in Ongoing Citizens' Assemblies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16194)
*Yusuf Hakan Kalayci,Evi Micha*

Main category: cs.GT

TL;DR: The paper introduces permanent citizens' assemblies, focusing on rotating panels of randomly-selected citizens to ensure proportional representation over time.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the need for fair and proportional representation in citizens' assemblies, particularly for smaller, unrepresented groups.

Method: Temporal sortition framework ensuring both proportional representation within panels and over sequential panels, with fairness built into the selection process.

Result: Algorithms were developed that balance proportional representation across individual and cumulative panels while maintaining individual fairness.

Conclusion: This novel approach ensures both temporal fairness and proportional group representation, enhancing inclusivity and equity in citizen engagement.

Abstract: Permanent citizens' assemblies are ongoing deliberative bodies composed of randomly selected citizens, organized into panels that rotate over time. Unlike one-off panels, which represent the population in a single snapshot, permanent assemblies enable shifting participation across multiple rounds. This structure offers a powerful framework for ensuring that different groups of individuals are represented over time across successive panels. In particular, it allows smaller groups of individuals that may not warrant representation in every individual panel to be represented across a sequence of them. We formalize this temporal sortition framework by requiring proportional representation both within each individual panel and across the sequence of panels.
  Building on the work of Ebadian and Micha (2025), we consider a setting in which the population lies in a metric space, and the goal is to achieve both proportional representation, ensuring that every group of citizens receives adequate representation, and individual fairness, ensuring that each individual has an equal probability of being selected. We extend the notion of representation to a temporal setting by requiring that every initial segment of the panel sequence, viewed as a cumulative whole, proportionally reflects the structure of the population. We present algorithms that provide varying guarantees of proportional representation, both within individual panels and across any sequence of panels, while also maintaining individual fairness over time.

### [361] [Imaging-Derived Coronary Fractional Flow Reserve: Advances in Physics-Based, Machine-Learning, and Physics-Informed Methods](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16000)
*Tanxin Zhu,Emran Hossen,Chen Zhao,Michele Esposito,Jiguang Sun,Weihua Zhou*

Main category: physics.med-ph

TL;DR: Recent advances in imaging-derived fractional flow reserve (FFR) focus on machine learning, deep learning, and physics-informed approaches for more efficient and reliable coronary stenosis assessment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to optimize and improve FFR methods for fast, wire-free, scalable, and clinically reliable functional assessment of coronary stenosis.

Method: The paper discusses the integration of machine learning (ML), deep learning (DL), and physics-informed neural networks (PINNs/PINOs) to enhance computational speed, automation, and generalizability in predicting FFR.

Result: ML/DL approaches improve computational speed and automation but face challenges in generalizability and domain shift. Physics-informed learning adds consistency and robustness by embedding conservation structures and boundary conditions.

Conclusion: The research highlights a convergence toward methods that balance speed, automation, and physical consistency; standardized validation and multi-center trials are necessary for clinical adoption.

Abstract: Purpose of Review Imaging derived fractional flow reserve (FFR) is rapidly evolving beyond conventional computational fluid dynamics (CFD) based pipelines toward machine learning (ML), deep learning (DL), and physics informed approaches that enable fast, wire free, and scalable functional assessment of coronary stenosis. This review synthesizes recent advances in CT and angiography based FFR, with particular emphasis on emerging physics informed neural networks and neural operators (PINNs and PINOs) and key considerations for their clinical translation. Recent Findings ML/DL approaches have markedly improved automation and computational speed, enabling prediction of pressure and FFR from anatomical descriptors or angiographic contrast dynamics. However, their real-world performance and generalizability can remain variable and sensitive to domain shift, due to multi-center heterogeneity, interpretability challenges, and differences in acquisition protocols and image quality. Physics informed learning introduces conservation structure and boundary condition consistency into model training, improving generalizability and reducing dependence on dense supervision while maintaining rapid inference. Recent evaluation trends increasingly highlight deployment oriented metrics, including calibration, uncertainty quantification, and quality control gatekeeping, as essential for safe clinical use. Summary The field is converging toward imaging derived FFR methods that are faster, more automated, and more reliable. While ML/DL offers substantial efficiency gains, physics informed frameworks such as PINNs and PINOs may provide a more robust balance between speed and physical consistency. Prospective multi center validation and standardized evaluation will be critical to support broad and safe clinical adoption.

### [362] [Harnessing Implicit Cooperation: A Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning Approach Towards Decentralized Local Energy Markets](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16062)
*Nelson Salazar-Pena,Alejandra Tabares,Andres Gonzalez-Mancera*

Main category: eess.SY

TL;DR: This paper introduces a decentralized framework for optimizing local energy markets using stigmergic signals and multi-agent reinforcement learning, achieving efficient coordination without central communication.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to create a decentralized, privacy-preserving, and efficient coordination framework for local energy markets, eliminating the need for costly centralized communication while ensuring grid stability and optimal resource allocation.

Method: The study models the energy market as a decentralized partially observable Markov decision problem, solved using multi-agent reinforcement learning with stigmergic signals. A 3x3 factorial design tests training paradigms (CTCE, CTDE, DTDE) and algorithms (PPO, APPO, SAC).

Result: The APPO-DTDE configuration achieves 91.7% coordination score compared to centralized benchmarks, improving grid physical stability by reducing variance and promoting self-organized trading communities.

Conclusion: Decentralized approaches using stigmergic signals are viable and advantageous for local energy markets, enabling robust, privacy-preserving coordination with minimal reliance on centralized infrastructure.

Abstract: This paper proposes implicit cooperation, a framework enabling decentralized agents to approximate optimal coordination in local energy markets without explicit peer-to-peer communication. We formulate the problem as a decentralized partially observable Markov decision problem that is solved through a multi-agent reinforcement learning task in which agents use stigmergic signals (key performance indicators at the system level) to infer and react to global states. Through a 3x3 factorial design on an IEEE 34-node topology, we evaluated three training paradigms (CTCE, CTDE, DTDE) and three algorithms (PPO, APPO, SAC). Results identify APPO-DTDE as the optimal configuration, achieving a coordination score of 91.7% relative to the theoretical centralized benchmark (CTCE). However, a critical trade-off emerges between efficiency and stability: while the centralized benchmark maximizes allocative efficiency with a peer-to-peer trade ratio of 0.6, the fully decentralized approach (DTDE) demonstrates superior physical stability. Specifically, DTDE reduces the variance of grid balance by 31% compared to hybrid architectures, establishing a highly predictable, import-biased load profile that simplifies grid regulation. Furthermore, topological analysis reveals emergent spatial clustering, where decentralized agents self-organize into stable trading communities to minimize congestion penalties. While SAC excelled in hybrid settings, it failed in decentralized environments due to entropy-driven instability. This research proves that stigmergic signaling provides sufficient context for complex grid coordination, offering a robust, privacy-preserving alternative to expensive centralized communication infrastructure.

Main category: eess.SY

TL;DR: The paper presents an open-source MARL simulation framework for implicit cooperation in local energy markets (LEMs), aiming for decentralized energy systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to improve market efficiency and grid stability by fostering emergent coordination in decentralized energy systems.

Method: The framework uses a decentralized partially observable Markov decision process with enhanced agent observations and rewards based on system-level performance indicators.

Result: The simulation framework demonstrated effective system-level coordination and provided insights on how market configurations impact system performance.

Conclusion: The framework is a versatile tool for designing and testing strategies for decentralized energy systems, promoting efficiency and stability.

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel, open-source MARL simulation framework for studying implicit cooperation in LEMs, modeled as a decentralized partially observable Markov decision process and implemented as a Gymnasium environment for MARL. Our framework features a modular market platform with plug-and-play clearing mechanisms, physically constrained agent models (including battery storage), a realistic grid network, and a comprehensive analytics suite to evaluate emergent coordination. The main contribution is a novel method to foster implicit cooperation, where agents' observations and rewards are enhanced with system-level key performance indicators to enable them to independently learn strategies that benefit the entire system and aim for collectively beneficial outcomes without explicit communication. Through representative case studies (available in a dedicated GitHub repository in https://github.com/salazarna/marlem, we show the framework's ability to analyze how different market configurations (such as varying storage deployment) impact system performance. This illustrates its potential to facilitate emergent coordination, improve market efficiency, and strengthen grid stability. The proposed simulation framework is a flexible, extensible, and reproducible tool for researchers and practitioners to design, test, and validate strategies for future intelligent, decentralized energy systems.

*Mikio Nakano,Hironori Takeuchi,Kazunori Komatani*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: This paper proposes a method to identify evaluation metrics for practical dialogue systems using a business-dialogue system alignment model.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for more comprehensive evaluation metrics beyond user satisfaction and experiences for assessing practical dialogue systems.

Method: Application of business-IT alignment models to create a business-dialogue system alignment model, alongside proposing a generic model for adaptation.

Result: A novel methodology to identify evaluation items, addressing gaps in current evaluation practices.

Conclusion: This approach opens new possibilities for research topics and ensures more robust evaluation of dialogue systems.

Abstract: This paper proposes a methodology for identifying evaluation items for practical dialogue systems. Traditionally, user satisfaction and user experiences have been the primary metrics for evaluating dialogue systems. However, there are various other evaluation items to consider when developing and operating practical dialogue systems, and such evaluation items are expected to lead to new research topics. So far, there has been no methodology for identifying these evaluation items. We propose identifying evaluation items based on business-dialogue system alignment models, which are applications of business-IT alignment models used in the development and operation of practical IT systems. We also present a generic model that facilitates the construction of a business-dialogue system alignment model for each dialogue system.

Motivation: To address challenges in regulating beneficial versus harmful online activities, especially their impact on mental health, by equipping young people with tools to manage online safety and interactions.

Method: Developed EmoTrack, a personal informatics system, to log users' online video-watching activities and encourage reflective and mindful internet use. Evaluated with 13 participants, analyzing its effectiveness in fostering reflections.

Result: Participants used EmoTrack to reflect on online video engagement's impact on mood and reported various reflection levels (R0 to R3).

Conclusion: EmoTrack promotes self-awareness about online behavior, helping users assess and improve their digital habits to ensure positive mental health impacts.

Abstract: With the rapid growth of the internet, all online activities can have both positive and negative effects on human mental health. Online engagement is complex and efforts to regulate online use face challenges in distinguishing between beneficial and harmful content and behaviours. An alternative approach is to help young people develop the skills they need to manage online safety while preserving the benefits of online interactions. This dissertation presents the entire development process and evaluation of an multi-platform application, called EmoTrack that aims to help young people reflect on their online behaviour. It was developed to record their online activities and cultivate strategies for more positive and mindful engagement online. EmoTrack is a personal informatics system, and it is designed to help people track and reflect on their engagement with YouTube videos. The system was evaluated with thirteen participants and it was found that EmoTrack can facilitate them to reflect on their video watching behaviour and the impact on their mood, with reports of different levels of reflections from R0 to R3.

*Sikao Guo,Edoardo Sarti,Frédéric Cazals*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: The paper presents a workflow and toolkit to automate GUI creation for CLI executables, following a Model--View--Presenter architecture, reducing engineering efforts and enabling portability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To minimize the engineering effort required and enhance portability in creating interactive GUIs for CLI executables.

Method: A three-step workflow: design plugins, specify GUI formally, and generate platform-specific plugin code; utilizing the MVP design pattern.

Result: Developed a workflow to produce GUIs for CLI executables in structural bioinformatics with applications in VMD, Pymol, and Web servers.

Conclusion: The architecture enables automation, reuse of logic, and portability across platforms, significantly improving GUI development for CLI tools.

Abstract: We present a workflow and associated toolkit to automate the creation of graphical user interfaces (GUI) for executables run from command line interfaces (CLI). The workflow consists of three phases, namely (Step 1) the plugin design, (Step 2) the formal (platform independent) specification of the GUI, and (Step 3) the plugin code generation for the targeted platforms. Our architecture is aligned with the Model--View--Presenter (MVP) pattern: steps one and two build the Model and View descriptions, while step three implements the Presenter layer that binds inputs, invokes the CLI, and updates outputs. Once Step one has been (manually) completed, steps two and three are fully automated. The decoupled MVP design and platform-specific generator modules enable reuse of logic, portability across ecosystems, and significant reductions in engineering effort for complex interactive applications.
  We primarily use our workflow to generate GUI in structural bioinformatics for CLI executables from the Structural Bioinformatics Library (SBL), targeting three platforms, namely VMD, Pymol and Web servers.
  The workflow can be used as a guideline, while its implementation available in the package Plugin_manager from the SBL, see https://sbl.inria.fr/doc/Plugin_manager-user-manual.html.

*Weiwen Su,Yuhan Zhou,Zihan Wang,Naoki Yoshinaga,Masashi Toyoda*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: This work addresses the challenge of identifying relevant but unknown user personas for simulations and introduces a dataset (PICQ) to assess context-aware personas influencing user choices.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing user simulations struggle with verification of adequate user personas, questioning their validity in dialogue generation.

Method: The authors introduce PICQ, a novel dataset with annotated personas and propose an evaluation scheme assessing fidelity, influence, and inaccessibility, supported by benchmarking leading LLMs.

Result: They observed a "Fidelity vs. Insight" dilemma where larger models show increased influence but inverted U-shaped fidelity to human-like behaviors.

Conclusion: Providing benchmarks on persona identification task enables deeper insights into cognitive differences between humans and advanced LLMs.

Abstract: Existing user simulations, where models generate user-like responses in dialogue, often lack verification that sufficient user personas are provided, questioning the validity of the simulations. To address this core concern, this work explores the task of identifying relevant but unknown personas of the simulation target for a given simulation context. We introduce PICQ, a novel dataset of context-aware choice questions, annotated with unknown personas (e.g., ''Is the user price-sensitive?'') that may influence user choices, and propose a multi-faceted evaluation scheme assessing fidelity, influence, and inaccessibility. Our benchmark of leading LLMs reveals a complex ''Fidelity vs. Insight'' dilemma governed by model scale: while influence generally scales with model size, fidelity to human patterns follows an inverted U-shaped curve. We trace this phenomenon to cognitive differences, particularly the human tendency for ''cognitive economy.'' Our work provides the first comprehensive benchmark for this crucial task, offering a new lens for understanding the divergent cognitive models of humans and advanced LLMs.

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: Current AI systems are often passive, and their effectiveness is limited by explainability-focused designs and miscalibrated trust. Transitioning AI to active teammates requires adaptive, context-aware collaboration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the limitations in Human-AI collaboration, particularly in distinguishing AI as a tool versus a teammate, and improving interaction dynamics, trust, and performance.

Method: The authors synthesize existing HAI literature to explore differences in interaction design, trust calibration, collaborative frameworks, and healthcare applications.

Result: Static designs and excessive focus on explainability hinder effective Human-AI collaboration. AI often leads to miscalibrated trust and limited decision-making impact, emphasizing the need for adaptive and interactive designs.

Conclusion: To evolve AI into active teammates, systems must enable dynamic, context-aware interaction, shared mental models, and better negotiation of authority with humans.

Abstract: The integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) necessitates determining whether systems function as tools or collaborative teammates. In this study, by synthesizing Human-AI Interaction (HAI) literature, we analyze this distinction across four dimensions: interaction design, trust calibration, collaborative frameworks and healthcare applications. Our analysis reveals that static interfaces and miscalibrated trust limit AI efficacy. Performance hinges on aligning transparency with cognitive workflows, yet a fluency trap often inflates trust without improving decision-making. Consequently, an overemphasis on explainability leaves systems largely passive. Our findings show that current AI systems remain largely passive due to an overreliance on explainability-centric designs and that transitioning AI to an active teammate requires adaptive, context-aware interactions that support shared mental models and the dynamic negotiation of authority between humans and AI.

*Ruiwei Xiao,Runlong Ye,Xinying Hou,Jessica Wen,Harsh Kumar,Michael Liut,John Stamper*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: The study validates instructional interventions for teaching students to use GenAI as a tutor, demonstrating improved learning outcomes through varying engagement conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the lack of scalable interventions and research on teaching students to utilize GenAI tools for learning rather than task completion.

Method: A semester-long randomized controlled trial (RCT) involving 979 participants with four instructional conditions based on the ICAP framework, assessed through pre-tests, post-tests, and surveys.

Result: All conditions enhanced prompting skills progressively across ICAP-driven engagement levels. Higher learning gains corresponded to higher final scores for students with similar initial abilities.

Conclusion: The interventions improve GenAI prompting skills, validate ICAP's framework, and serve as adaptable solutions for diverse learning contexts, contributing to theoretical and practical knowledge in education with Generative AI.

Abstract: Despite universal GenAI adoption, students cannot distinguish task performance from actual learning and lack skills to leverage AI for learning, leading to worse exam performance when AI use remains unreflective. Yet few interventions teaching students to prompt AI as a tutor rather than solution provider have been validated at scale through randomized controlled trials (RCTs). To bridge this gap, we conducted a semester-long RCT (N=979) with four ICAP framework-based instructional conditions varying in engagement intensity with a pre-test, immediate and delayed post-test and surveys. Mixed methods analysis results showed: (1) All conditions significantly improved prompting skills, with gains increasing progressively from Condition 1 to Condition 4, validating ICAP's cognitive engagement hierarchy; (2) for students with similar pre-test scores, higher learning gain in immediate post-test predict higher final exam score, though no direct between-group differences emerged; (3) Our interventions are suitable and scalable solutions for diverse educational contexts, resources and learners. Together, this study makes empirical and theoretical contributions: (1) theoretically, we provided one of the first large-scale RCTs examining how cognitive engagement shapes learning in prompting literacy and clarifying the relationship between learning-oriented prompting skills and broader academic performance; (2) empirically, we offered timely design guidance for transforming GenAI classroom policies into scalable, actionable prompting literacy instruction to advance learning in the era of Generative AI.

*Wooyoung Jung,Kahyun Jeon,Prosper Babon-Ayeng*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: This study explores how domain knowledge and AI literacy influence interactions with human-AI energy management systems by analyzing user interactions with GPT-4 used as a BEMS tool.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate the dynamics of human-AI collaboration in building energy management and assess the influence of AI literacy and domain knowledge on user interactions with systems like GPT-4.

Method: Systematic role-playing experiment with 85 participants who interacted with GPT-4 to identify behavioral energy-saving measures. Data was analyzed using hierarchical frameworks, grouping users by domain knowledge and AI literacy, and performing Kruskal-Wallis H tests across metrics.

Result: The analysis showed most users relied on concise prompts and GPT's capabilities, with appliance identification rates differing based on AI literacy alone, highlighting LLMs as equalizers of expertise levels.

Conclusion: This research advances understanding of human-AI interaction in energy management, suggesting LLM-integrated systems can bridge expertise gaps and promote human-centric development.

Abstract: This study aimed to comprehend how user domain knowledge and artificial intelligence (AI) literacy impact the effective use of human-AI interactive building energy management system (BEMS). While prior studies have investigated the potential of integrating large language models (LLMs) into BEMS or building energy modeling, very few studies have examined how user interact with such systems. We conducted a systematic role-playing experiment, where 85 human subjects interacted with an advanced generative pre-trained transformer (OpenAI GPT-4o). Participants were tasked with identifying the top five behavioral changes that could reduce home energy use with the GPT model that functioned as an LLM-integrated BEMS. Then, the collected prompt-response data and participant conclusions were analyzed using an analytical framework that hierarchically assessed and scored human-AI interactions and their home energy analysis approaches. Also, participants were classified into four groups based on their self-evaluated domain knowledge of building energy use and AI literacy, and Kruskal-Wallis H tests with post-hoc pairwise comparisons were conducted across 20 quantifiable metrics. Key takeaways include: most participants employed concise prompts (median: 16.2 words) and relied heavily on GPT's analytical capabilities; and notably, only 1 of 20 metrics, appliance identification rate, showed statistically significant group differences (p=0.037), driven by AI literacy rather than domain knowledge, suggesting an equalizing effect of LLMs across expertise levels. This study provides foundational insights into human-AI collaboration dynamics and promising development directions in the context of LLM-integrated BEMS and contributes to realizing human-centric LLM-integrated energy systems.

Main category: physics.ao-ph

TL;DR: The study showcases the potential of using machine-learning-based (ML) weather emulators, trained on historical meteorological data, to analyze the fast precipitation responses to carbon dioxide changes, without retraining for future conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The desire to effectively understand the climatic system’s response to fast atmospheric feedbacks, given their historical presence in the data and their key role in the global hydrological cycle, motivates the study.

Method: Machine-learning-based weather emulators trained on historical radiative and sea-surface temperature data are applied to examine fast precipitation responses to varying carbon dioxide levels. Results are compared against simulations made by Earth System Models (ESMs).

Result: The results show that historically trained ML weather emulators produce precipitation response patterns consistent with Earth System Models (ESMs), demonstrating their effectiveness.

Conclusion: The paper highlights ML emulators’ capability for studying fast processes like precipitation responses, suggesting they can complement Earth System Models to enhance climate response studies.

Abstract: The response of the climate system to increased greenhouse gases and other radiative perturbations is governed by a combination of fast and slow feedbacks. Slow feedbacks are typically activated in response to changes in ocean temperatures on decadal timescales and manifest as changes in climatic state with no recent historical analogue. However, fast feedbacks are activated in response to rapid atmospheric physical processes on weekly timescales, and they are already operative in the present-day climate. This distinction implies that the physics of fast radiative feedbacks is present in the historical meteorological reanalyses used to train many recent successful machine-learning-based (ML) emulators of weather and climate. In addition, these feedbacks are functional under the historical boundary conditions pertaining to the top-of-atmosphere radiative balance and sea-surface temperatures. Together, these factors imply that we can use historically trained ML weather emulators to study the response of radiative-convective equilibrium (RCE), and hence the global hydrological cycle, to perturbations in carbon dioxide and other well-mixed greenhouse gases. Without retraining on prospective Earth system conditions, we use ML weather emulators to quantify the fast precipitation response to reduced and elevated carbon dioxed concentrations with no recent historical precedent. We show that the responses from historically trained emulators agree with those produced by full-physics Earth System Models (ESMs). In conclusion, we discuss the prospects for and advantages from using ESMs and ML emulators to study fast processes in global climate.

TL;DR: MAEB introduces a large-scale audio embedding benchmark covering diverse audio tasks across multiple languages and modalities, with evaluations across 50+ models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the lack of standardized and comprehensive evaluation for audio embeddings across diverse tasks and languages.

Method: MAEB provides a curated benchmark of 30 tasks derived from 98 tasks, focusing on speech, music, environmental sounds, and audio-text reasoning, and integrates it into the MTEB ecosystem.

Result: Different models show specialized strengths (e.g., contrastive audio-text models excel in environmental sounds but struggle in speech tasks), highlighting varied capabilities and challenges.

Conclusion: MAEB provides a unified tool for evaluating audio models' strengths across modalities and languages, facilitating research progress and system optimization.

Abstract: We introduce the Massive Audio Embedding Benchmark (MAEB), a large-scale benchmark covering 30 tasks across speech, music, environmental sounds, and cross-modal audio-text reasoning in 100+ languages. We evaluate 50+ models and find that no single model dominates across all tasks: contrastive audio-text models excel at environmental sound classification (e.g., ESC50) but score near random on multilingual speech tasks (e.g., SIB-FLEURS), while speech-pretrained models show the opposite pattern. Clustering remains challenging for all models, with even the best-performing model achieving only modest results. We observe that models excelling on acoustic understanding often perform poorly on linguistic tasks, and vice versa. We also show that the performance of audio encoders on MAEB correlates highly with their performance when used in audio large language models. MAEB is derived from MAEB+, a collection of 98 tasks. MAEB is designed to maintain task diversity while reducing evaluation cost, and it integrates into the MTEB ecosystem for unified evaluation across text, image, and audio modalities. We release MAEB and all 98 tasks along with code and a leaderboard at https://github.com/embeddings-benchmark/mteb.

TL;DR: This paper investigates the development of native audio foundation models for general audio generation and cross-modal tasks, proposing new insights and methodologies for scalable audio modeling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the limitations of text-first and semantic-only audio language models, which hinder the ability to perform comprehensive audio modeling.

Method: Conduct a systematic empirical study on audio modeling techniques, exploring data sources, token composition, and scaling laws. Provide findings through analysis and develop SODA, a suite of scalable models based on these insights.

Result: Developed SODA models ranging from 135M to 4B parameters, trained on 500B tokens, effectively serving as a backbone for various audio/text tasks such as voice-preserving speech-to-speech translation.

Conclusion: The study confirms the viability of scalable native audio foundation models for diverse applications and emphasizes the importance of a unified architecture for general audio modeling.

Abstract: Current audio language models are predominantly text-first, either extending pre-trained text LLM backbones or relying on semantic-only audio tokens, limiting general audio modeling. This paper presents a systematic empirical study of native audio foundation models that apply next-token prediction to audio at scale, jointly modeling semantic content, acoustic details, and text to support both general audio generation and cross-modal capabilities. We provide comprehensive empirical insights for building such models: (1) We systematically investigate design choices -- data sources, text mixture ratios, and token composition -- establishing a validated training recipe. (2) We conduct the first scaling law study for discrete audio models via IsoFLOP analysis on 64 models spanning $3{\times}10^{18}$ to $3{\times}10^{20}$ FLOPs, finding that optimal data grows 1.6$\times$ faster than optimal model size. (3) We apply these lessons to train SODA (Scaling Open Discrete Audio), a suite of models from 135M to 4B parameters on 500B tokens, comparing against our scaling predictions and existing models. SODA serves as a flexible backbone for diverse audio/text tasks -- we demonstrate this by fine-tuning for voice-preserving speech-to-speech translation, using the same unified architecture.

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: The paper introduces a framework and methods to improve machine reasoning on spatial audio, particularly focusing on understanding sound movement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable machines to interpret moving sound sources and enhance the understanding of auditory scenes using spatial audio.

Method: The study includes (1) an audio augmentation framework for creating motion patterns, (2) a multimodal finetuning method called 'thinking mode' for explicit reasoning, and (3) investigating query-conditioned source separation with three inference setups.

Result: Improvements were observed, with a 5.1% enhancement in reasoning accuracy for single-event contexts when using the proposed 'thinking mode.'

Conclusion: Reasoning, motion modeling, and source separation interplay is crucial for advancing spatial audio understanding, and the proposed methods offer valuable advances in the domain.

Abstract: Spatial audio understanding aims to enable machines to interpret complex auditory scenes, particularly when sound sources move over time. In this work, we study Spatial Audio Question Answering (Spatial AQA) with a focus on movement reasoning, where a model must infer object motion, position, and directional changes directly from stereo audio. First, we introduce a movement-centric spatial audio augmentation framework that synthesizes diverse motion patterns from isolated mono audio events, enabling controlled and scalable training data generation. Second, we propose an end-to-end multimodal finetuning approach with a thinking mode, which allows audio-language models to produce explicit intermediate reasoning steps before predicting an answer. Third, we investigate the impact of query-conditioned source separation as a preprocessing stage and compare three inference regimes: no masking, an audio grounding model (AGM), and ground-truth masks. Our results show that reasoning amplifies the benefits of source separation, with thinking mode showing significant improvement of +5.1% when a single event is present in the question. These findings highlight the interplay between movement modeling, reasoning, and separation quality, offering new insights for advancing spatial audio understanding.

Result: CGP reduces the gap between fine-tuning and probing, and BAT achieves state-of-the-art results on audio benchmarks.

Conclusion: The work enhances the reliability of audio SSL evaluations, improving methodology for ranking and embedding quality while contributing to SOTA advancements.

Abstract: Probing is widely adopted in computer vision to faithfully evaluate self-supervised learning (SSL) embeddings, as fine-tuning may misrepresent their inherent quality. In contrast, audio SSL models still rely on fine-tuning because simple probing fails to unlock their full potential and alters their rankings when competing for SOTA on AudioSet. Hence, a robust and efficient probing mechanism is required to guide the trajectory of audio SSL towards reliable and reproducible methods. We introduce Convex Gated Probing (CGP), a prototype-based method that drastically closes the gap between fine-tuning and probing in audio. CGP efficiently utilizes all frozen layers via a gating mechanism and exposes the location of latent task-relevant information. Guided by CGP, we rework the entire SSL pipeline of current SOTA audio models that use legacy implementations of prior SSL methods. By refining data preprocessing, model architecture, and pre-training recipe, we introduce Better Audio Transformer (BAT), and establish new SOTA on audio benchmarks.

### [376] [How to Label Resynthesized Audio: The Dual Role of Neural Audio Codecs in Audio Deepfake Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16343)
*Yixuan Xiao,Florian Lux,Alejandro Pérez-González-de-Martos,Ngoc Thang Vu*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: The paper explores the use of neural audio codec-resynthesized data in spoof detection, extending the ASVspoof 5 dataset and providing insights into labeling strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the dual functionality of neural audio codecs, which can blur the line between bonafide and spoofed speech, and investigate how labeling choices affect spoof detection outcomes.

Method: The study builds a challenging extension of the ASVspoof 5 dataset, analyzes the labeling strategies for codec-resynthesized data, and evaluates their impact on detection performance.

Result: The analysis shows that labeling strategies significantly affect detection results and provides practical insights for labeling such data effectively.

Conclusion: The paper offers a deeper understanding of the role of neural audio codecs in spoof detection and highlights the importance of proper labeling choices when dealing with resynthesized data.

Abstract: Since Text-to-Speech systems typically don't produce waveforms directly, recent spoof detection studies use resynthesized waveforms from vocoders and neural audio codecs to simulate an attacker. Unlike vocoders, which are specifically designed for speech synthesis, neural audio codecs were originally developed for compressing audio for storage and transmission. However, their ability to discretize speech also sparked interest in language-modeling-based speech synthesis. Owing to this dual functionality, codec resynthesized data may be labeled as either bonafide or spoof. So far, very little research has addressed this issue. In this study, we present a challenging extension of the ASVspoof 5 dataset constructed for this purpose. We examine how different labeling choices affect detection performance and provide insights into labeling strategies.

### [377] [Resp-Agent: An Agent-Based System for Multimodal Respiratory Sound Generation and Disease Diagnosis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15909)
*Pengfei Zhang,Tianxin Xie,Minghao Yang,Li Liu*

Main category: eess.AS

TL;DR: Resp-Agent, a deep learning-based respiratory auscultation system, overcomes challenges like information loss and limited data by using multimodal strategies, modality weaving, and targeted data synthesis. Extensive experiments show it outperforms prior methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address two significant issues in respiratory auscultation using deep learning: the loss of transient acoustic events and clinical context in signal conversion, and the scarcity of balanced training data.

Method: The proposed Resp-Agent system integrates a novel Active Adversarial Curriculum Agent (Thinker-A$^2$CA) as a central controller, a Modality-Weaving Diagnoser to merge EHR data with audio tokens, and a Flow Matching Generator to generate challenging diagnostic data using an adapted text-only LLM.

Result: Resp-Agent achieves superior diagnostic performance across a variety of testing scenarios, especially under data scarcity and long-tail class imbalance conditions, as validated through extensive experiments.

Conclusion: Resp-Agent effectively enhances diagnostic robustness in deep learning-based respiratory auscultation by addressing key challenges of data limitations and representation gaps, setting a new benchmark with Resp-229k.

Abstract: Deep learning-based respiratory auscultation is currently hindered by two fundamental challenges: (i) inherent information loss, as converting signals into spectrograms discards transient acoustic events and clinical context; (ii) limited data availability, exacerbated by severe class imbalance. To bridge these gaps, we present Resp-Agent, an autonomous multimodal system orchestrated by a novel Active Adversarial Curriculum Agent (Thinker-A$^2$CA). Unlike static pipelines, Thinker-A$^2$CA serves as a central controller that actively identifies diagnostic weaknesses and schedules targeted synthesis in a closed loop. To address the representation gap, we introduce a Modality-Weaving Diagnoser that weaves EHR data with audio tokens via Strategic Global Attention and sparse audio anchors, capturing both long-range clinical context and millisecond-level transients. To address the data gap, we design a Flow Matching Generator that adapts a text-only Large Language Model (LLM) via modality injection, decoupling pathological content from acoustic style to synthesize hard-to-diagnose samples. As a foundation for these efforts, we introduce Resp-229k, a benchmark corpus of 229k recordings paired with LLM-distilled clinical narratives. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Resp-Agent consistently outperforms prior approaches across diverse evaluation settings, improving diagnostic robustness under data scarcity and long-tailed class imbalance. Our code and data are available at https://github.com/zpforlove/Resp-Agent.

*Ryotaro Nagase,Ryoichi Takashima,Yoichi Yamashita*

Main category: eess.AS

TL;DR: The paper explores representing emotions in speech using color attributes for better diversity and interpretability, develops regression models, and improves tasks using multitask learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional methods relying on categorical/dimensional labels fail to represent the diversity and interpretability of emotions effectively.

Method: Crowdsourced annotation of emotional speech with color attributes, development of regression models using machine and deep learning, and multitask learning applied for color attribute regression and emotion classification.

Result: Established the relationship between color attributes and speech emotions, developed successful regression models, and improved task performances with multitask learning.

Conclusion: Color attributes provide a more continuous and interpretable emotion representation in SER, and multitask learning enhances performance in combining emotion classification and attribute regression.

Abstract: Speech emotion recognition (SER) has traditionally relied on categorical or dimensional labels. However, this technique is limited in representing both the diversity and interpretability of emotions. To overcome this limitation, we focus on color attributes, such as hue, saturation, and value, to represent emotions as continuous and interpretable scores. We annotated an emotional speech corpus with color attributes via crowdsourcing and analyzed them. Moreover, we built regression models for color attributes in SER using machine learning and deep learning, and explored the multitask learning of color attribute regression and emotion classification. As a result, we demonstrated the relationship between color attributes and emotions in speech, and successfully developed color attribute regression models for SER. We also showed that multitask learning improved the performance of each task.

*Michael Neri,Tuomas Virtanen*

Main category: eess.AS

TL;DR: Proposes acoustic maps as a novel spatial feature representation to improve replay attack detection using a lightweight convolutional network.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Replay attacks pose risks to speaker verification systems, especially in real-time applications like voice assistants.

Method: Utilized acoustic maps derived from beamforming to encode energy distributions for spatial differences in human and replayed speech.

Result: Achieved competitive performance on ReMASC dataset with only about 6k parameters in the designed neural network.

Conclusion: Acoustic maps are effective and interpretable for detecting replay attacks across devices and environments.

Abstract: Replay attacks remain a critical vulnerability for automatic speaker verification systems, particularly in real-time voice assistant applications. In this work, we propose acoustic maps as a novel spatial feature representation for replay speech detection from multi-channel recordings. Derived from classical beamforming over discrete azimuth and elevation grids, acoustic maps encode directional energy distributions that reflect physical differences between human speech radiation and loudspeaker-based replay. A lightweight convolutional neural network is designed to operate on this representation, achieving competitive performance on the ReMASC dataset with approximately 6k trainable parameters. Experimental results show that acoustic maps provide a compact and physically interpretable feature space for replay attack detection across different devices and acoustic environments.
