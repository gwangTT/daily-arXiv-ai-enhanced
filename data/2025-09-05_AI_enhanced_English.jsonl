Effectively integrating pruning and quantization\nto harness their complementary advantages poses a challenging task, primarily\ndue to their potential impact on model accuracy and the complexity of jointly\noptimizing both processes.

The pose\nestimator is a critical component of wall climbing mobile robots, as their\noperational environment involves carrying precise measurement equipment and\nmaintenance tools in construction, requiring information about pose on the\nbuilding at the time of measurement. Due to the complex geometry and material\nproperties of building facades, the use of traditional localization sensors\nsuch as laser, ultrasonic, or radar is often infeasible for wall-climbing\nrobots. Moreover, GPS-based localization is generally unreliable in these\nenvironments because of signal degradation caused by reinforced concrete and\nelectromagnetic interference. Consequently, robot odometry remains the primary\nsource of velocity and position information, despite being susceptible to drift\ncaused by both systematic and non-systematic errors. The calibrations of the\nrobot's systematic parameters were conducted using nonlinear optimization and\nLevenberg-Marquardt methods as Newton-Gauss and gradient-based model fitting\nmethods, while Genetic algorithm and Particle swarm were used as\nstochastic-based methods for kinematic parameter calibration.

Then, we summarize three challenges of\ndomain adaptation: severe geometric distortions near the poles, non-uniform\nsampling in Equirectangular Projection (ERP), and periodic boundary continuity.\nBuilding on this, we cover 20+ representative tasks drawn from more than 300\nresearch papers in two dimensions. On one hand, we present a cross-method\nanalysis of representative strategies for addressing panoramic specific\nchallenges across different tasks.

In addition, we discuss open challenges\nand future directions in data, models, and applications that will drive the\nadvancement of panoramic vision research.

Most of the existing\napproaches model BSSRDF either through an analysis-by-synthesis approach,\napproximating complex path integrals, or using differentiable volume rendering\ntechniques to account for heterogeneity. However, only a few studies have\napplied learning-based methods to estimate subsurface scattering parameters,\nbut they assume homogeneous media. Interestingly, no specific distribution is\nknown to us that can explicitly model the heterogeneous scattering parameters\nin the real world. Notably, procedural noise models such as Perlin and Fractal\nPerlin noise have been effective in representing intricate heterogeneities of\nnatural, organic, and inorganic surfaces. Leveraging this, we first create\nHeteroSynth, a synthetic dataset comprising photorealistic images of\nheterogeneous media whose scattering parameters are modeled using Fractal\nPerlin noise. Furthermore, we propose Tensorial Inverse Scattering (TensoIS), a\nlearning-based feed-forward framework to estimate these Perlin-distributed\nheterogeneous scattering parameters from sparse multi-view image observations.\nInstead of directly predicting the 3D scattering parameter volume, TensoIS uses\nlearnable low-rank tensor components to represent the scattering volume. We\nevaluate TensoIS on unseen heterogeneous variations over shapes from the\nHeteroSynth test set, smoke and cloud geometries obtained from open-source\nrealistic volumetric simulations, and some real-world samples to establish its\neffectiveness for inverse scattering.

In the last decades, the production and design of such\nbatteries and their adjacent embedded charging and safety protocols, denoted by\nBattery Management Systems (BMS), has taken central stage. A fundamental\nchallenge to be addressed is the trade-off between the speed of charging and\nthe ageing behavior, resulting in the loss of capacity in the battery cell. We\nrely on a high-fidelity physics-based battery model and propose an approach to\ndata-driven charging and safety protocol design. Following a\nCounterexample-Guided Inductive Synthesis scheme, we combine Reinforcement\nLearning (RL) with recent developments in data-driven formal methods to obtain\na hybrid control strategy: RL is used to synthesise the individual controllers,\nand a data-driven abstraction guides their partitioning into a switched\nstructure, depending on the initial output measurements of the battery. The\nresulting discrete selection among RL-based controllers, coupled with the\ncontinuous battery dynamics, realises a hybrid system. When a design meets the\ndesired criteria, the abstraction provides probabilistic guarantees on the\nclosed-loop performance of the cell.", "AI": {"tldr": "This paper tackles the trade-off between fast charging and battery aging using a hybrid control strategy combining Reinforcement Learning and formal methods.", "motivation": "Balancing the speed of lithium-ion battery charging with minimal aging effects, which results in capacity loss, is a key challenge in improving battery performance and prolonging its lifespan.", "method": "The authors adopt a hybrid approach involving Reinforcement Learning to design controllers and data-driven formal methods to guide partitioning into a switched control structure.

To address this gap, we introduce\n\\textbf{HumAIne-chatbot}, an AI-driven conversational agent that personalizes\nresponses through a novel user profiling framework. The system is pre-trained\non a diverse set of GPT-generated virtual personas to establish a broad prior\nover user types. During live interactions, an online reinforcement learning\nagent refines per-user models by combining implicit signals (e.g. typing speed,\nsentiment, engagement duration) with explicit feedback (e.g., likes and\ndislikes).

To evaluate the\nsystem, we performed controlled experiments with 50 synthetic personas in\nmultiple conversation domains.
