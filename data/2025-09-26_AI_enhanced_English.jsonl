Deploying edge cameras\nacross urban environments is a standard practice for monitoring road\nconditions. However, integrating these with intelligent models requires a\nrobust understanding of dynamic traffic scenarios and a responsive interface\nfor user interaction. Although multimodal Large Language Models (LLMs) can\ninterpret traffic images and generate informative responses, their deployment\non edge devices is infeasible due to high computational demands. Therefore, LLM\ninference must occur on the cloud, necessitating visual data transmission from\nedge to cloud, a process hindered by limited bandwidth, leading to potential\ndelays that compromise real-time performance. To address this challenge, we\npropose a semantic communication framework that significantly reduces\ntransmission overhead. Our method involves detecting Regions of Interest (RoIs)\nusing YOLOv11, cropping relevant image segments, and converting them into\ncompact embedding vectors using a Vision Transformer (ViT). These embeddings\nare then transmitted to the cloud, where an image decoder reconstructs the\ncropped images. The reconstructed images are processed by a multimodal LLM to\ngenerate traffic condition descriptions. This approach achieves a 99.9%\nreduction in data transmission size while maintaining an LLM response accuracy\nof 89% for reconstructed cropped images, compared to 93% accuracy with original\ncropped images.
