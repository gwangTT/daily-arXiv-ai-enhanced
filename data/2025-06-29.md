Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper emphasizes the importance of building a trusted AI ecosystem and organizes AI safety research into Development, Assessment, and Control domains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the vigorous debate on AI safety and provide a framework for trustworthy, reliable, and secure AI adoption.

Method: An international conference brought together AI scientists to synthesize research priorities using a defense-in-depth model categorizing AI safety into Development, Assessment, and Control.

Result: The paper organizes AI safety research priorities based on insights from international collaboration and synthesizes these into structured domains.

Conclusion: Developing and evaluating trustworthy AI systems, along with monitoring their post-deployment impact, is crucial for fostering innovation while ensuring safety.

Abstract: Rapidly improving AI capabilities and autonomy hold significant promise of
transformation, but are also driving vigorous debate on how to ensure that AI
is safe, i.e., trustworthy, reliable, and secure. Building a trusted ecosystem
is therefore essential -- it helps people embrace AI with confidence and gives
maximal space for innovation while avoiding backlash.
  The "2025 Singapore Conference on AI (SCAI): International Scientific
Exchange on AI Safety" aimed to support research in this space by bringing
together AI scientists across geographies to identify and synthesise research
priorities in AI safety. This resulting report builds on the International AI
Safety Report chaired by Yoshua Bengio and backed by 33 governments. By
adopting a defence-in-depth model, this report organises AI safety research
domains into three types: challenges with creating trustworthy AI systems
(Development), challenges with evaluating their risks (Assessment), and
challenges with monitoring and intervening after deployment (Control).

### [2] [MAGPIE: A dataset for Multi-AGent contextual PrIvacy Evaluation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20737)
*Gurusha Juneja,Alon Albalak,Wenyue Hua,William Yang Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper investigates privacy capabilities of LLM-based multi-agent systems, using a benchmark named MAGPIE to evaluate contextual privacy handling across real-life scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the privacy concerns in inter-agent collaborations using LLMs, especially in high-stakes real-life scenarios where data exclusion impacts task completion.

Method: Development of a benchmark (MAGPIE) with 158 high-stakes scenarios across 15 domains, and evaluation of prominent LLMs like GPT-4o and Claude-2.7-Sonnet on contextual privacy understanding and collaborative performance.

Result: Empirical results show significant privacy breaches: private data is shared in up to 59.9% of multi-turn conversations despite explicit privacy instructions, and tasks failed completion in 71% of scenarios.

Conclusion: Current LLMs lack sufficient alignment towards contextual privacy and effective collaboration, indicating a critical need for improvement in privacy-preserving mechanisms in multi-agent systems.

Abstract: The proliferation of LLM-based agents has led to increasing deployment of
inter-agent collaboration for tasks like scheduling, negotiation, resource
allocation etc. In such systems, privacy is critical, as agents often access
proprietary tools and domain-specific databases requiring strict
confidentiality. This paper examines whether LLM-based agents demonstrate an
understanding of contextual privacy. And, if instructed, do these systems
preserve inference time user privacy in non-adversarial multi-turn
conversation. Existing benchmarks to evaluate contextual privacy in LLM-agents
primarily assess single-turn, low-complexity tasks where private information
can be easily excluded. We first present a benchmark - MAGPIE comprising 158
real-life high-stakes scenarios across 15 domains. These scenarios are designed
such that complete exclusion of private data impedes task completion yet
unrestricted information sharing could lead to substantial losses. We then
evaluate the current state-of-the-art LLMs on (a) their understanding of
contextually private data and (b) their ability to collaborate without
violating user privacy. Empirical experiments demonstrate that current models,
including GPT-4o and Claude-2.7-Sonnet, lack robust understanding of contextual
privacy, misclassifying private data as shareable 25.2\% and 43.6\% of the
time. In multi-turn conversations, these models disclose private information in
59.9\% and 50.5\% of cases even under explicit privacy instructions.
Furthermore, multi-agent systems fail to complete tasks in 71\% of scenarios.
These results underscore that current models are not aligned towards both
contextual privacy preservation and collaborative task-solving.

### [3] [Dynamic Context-Aware Prompt Recommendation for Domain-Specific AI Applications](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20815)
*Xinye Tang,Haijun Zhai,Chaitanya Belwal,Vineeth Thayanithi,Philip Baumann,Yogesh K Roy*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces a system to recommend domain-specific prompts for LLM-powered applications by considering user context, using advanced analysis and ranking techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High-quality prompts are crucial for LLM-powered applications, but generating them is challenging, especially for domain-specific contexts.

Method: The proposed system integrates contextual query analysis, retrieval-augmented knowledge grounding, hierarchical skill organization, and adaptive skill ranking. It dynamically selects and ranks skills, and generates prompts using predefined and adaptive templates with few-shot learning.

Result: Experiments with real-world datasets showed high usefulness and relevance of the prompt suggestions, validated by both automated metrics and expert evaluations.

Conclusion: The system effectively enhances the quality and context-relevance of prompts for domain-specific AI applications, addressing a critical challenge in LLM usability.

Abstract: LLM-powered applications are highly susceptible to the quality of user
prompts, and crafting high-quality prompts can often be challenging especially
for domain-specific applications. This paper presents a novel dynamic
context-aware prompt recommendation system for domain-specific AI applications.
Our solution combines contextual query analysis, retrieval-augmented knowledge
grounding, hierarchical skill organization, and adaptive skill ranking to
generate relevant and actionable prompt suggestions.
  The system leverages behavioral telemetry and a two-stage hierarchical
reasoning process to dynamically select and rank relevant skills, and
synthesizes prompts using both predefined and adaptive templates enhanced with
few-shot learning. Experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that our
approach achieves high usefulness and relevance, as validated by both automated
and expert evaluations.

### [4] [Beyond Reactive Safety: Risk-Aware LLM Alignment via Long-Horizon Simulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20949)
*Chenkai Sun,Denghui Zhang,ChengXiang Zhai,Heng Ji*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes a framework for assessing the societal impact of language model-generated advice and introduces a dataset to evaluate their ability to foresee indirect harm scenarios, achieving improved safety performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Language model-based agents are increasingly involved in critical decisions, and ensuring their positive societal impact requires studying the broader implications of their outputs.

Method: The authors introduce a framework to model how language model advice propagates in society and a dataset of 100 indirect harm scenarios to evaluate safety awareness.

Result: The proposed approach improves performance on the new dataset by over 20% and achieves a 70% win rate against strong existing safety benchmarks.

Conclusion: This work suggests an effective direction for enhancing the long-term safety and alignment of language model agents.

Abstract: Given the growing influence of language model-based agents on high-stakes
societal decisions, from public policy to healthcare, ensuring their beneficial
impact requires understanding the far-reaching implications of their
suggestions. We propose a proof-of-concept framework that projects how
model-generated advice could propagate through societal systems on a
macroscopic scale over time, enabling more robust alignment. To assess the
long-term safety awareness of language models, we also introduce a dataset of
100 indirect harm scenarios, testing models' ability to foresee adverse,
non-obvious outcomes from seemingly harmless user prompts. Our approach
achieves not only over 20% improvement on the new dataset but also an average
win rate exceeding 70% against strong baselines on existing safety benchmarks
(AdvBench, SafeRLHF, WildGuardMix), suggesting a promising direction for safer
agents.

### [5] [Unveiling Causal Reasoning in Large Language Models: Reality or Mirage?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21215)
*Haoang Chi,He Li,Wenjing Yang,Feng Liu,Long Lan,Xiaoguang Ren,Tongliang Liu,Bo Han*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper investigates the causal reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs) and introduces an approach, G^2-Reasoner, to improve their reasoning capability, especially in unseen and counterfactual contexts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To ascertain whether LLMs can perform genuine human-like causal reasoning and to address their current limitations of being confined to shallow causal reasoning (level-1).

Method: The authors analyze the autoregression mechanism in LLMs to show its non-causal nature, introduce a new benchmark (CausalProbe-2024) for evaluation, and propose G^2-Reasoner, which incorporates general knowledge and goal-oriented prompts into LLM reasoning.

Result: The introduced benchmark confirms that LLMs mainly operate at level-1 causal reasoning. G^2-Reasoner significantly improves causal reasoning performance, especially in new and counterfactual scenarios.

Conclusion: LLMs currently lack human-like causal reasoning but can move towards achieving it with methods like G^2-Reasoner. This work opens up new avenues for improving LLMs' reasoning capabilities beyond shallow levels.

Abstract: Causal reasoning capability is critical in advancing large language models
(LLMs) toward strong artificial intelligence. While versatile LLMs appear to
have demonstrated capabilities in understanding contextual causality and
providing responses that obey the laws of causality, it remains unclear whether
they perform genuine causal reasoning akin to humans. However, current evidence
indicates the contrary. Specifically, LLMs are only capable of performing
shallow (level-1) causal reasoning, primarily attributed to the causal
knowledge embedded in their parameters, but they lack the capacity for genuine
human-like (level-2) causal reasoning. To support this hypothesis,
methodologically, we delve into the autoregression mechanism of
transformer-based LLMs, revealing that it is not inherently causal.
Empirically, we introduce a new causal Q&A benchmark called CausalProbe-2024,
whose corpora are fresh and nearly unseen for the studied LLMs. The LLMs
exhibit a significant performance drop on CausalProbe-2024 compared to earlier
benchmarks, indicating the fact that they primarily engage in level-1 causal
reasoning. To bridge the gap towards level-2 causal reasoning, we draw
inspiration from the fact that human reasoning is usually facilitated by
general knowledge and intended goals. We propose G^2-Reasoner, a method that
incorporates general knowledge and goal-oriented prompts into LLMs' causal
reasoning processes. Experiments demonstrate that G^2-Reasoner significantly
enhances LLMs' causal reasoning capability, particularly in fresh and
counterfactual contexts. This work sheds light on a new path for LLMs to
advance towards genuine causal reasoning, going beyond level-1 and making
strides towards level-2.

### [6] [World-aware Planning Narratives Enhance Large Vision-Language Model Planner](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21230)
*Junhao Shi,Zhaoye Fei,Siyin Wang,Qipeng Guo,Jingjing Gong,Xipeng QIu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper addresses the limitations of Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) in complex embodied planning tasks by introducing an environment-aware framework focused on improving cognitive capabilities, achieving significant performance enhancements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LVLMs struggle with context-sensitive instructions in unfamiliar environments and rely on supplementary cues rather than robust visual reasoning during extended interactions. The paper aims to address these challenges.

Method: The proposed framework, WAP (World-Aware Planning Narrative Enhancement), enhances LVLMs by incorporating four cognitive capabilities: visual appearance modeling, spatial reasoning, functional abstraction, and syntactic grounding, while focusing on curriculum learning from raw visual observations.

Result: Using the EB-ALFRED benchmark, the framework leads to significant improvements in task success rates (+60.7), commonsense reasoning (+60.0), and long-horizon planning (+70.0). Enhanced open-source models outperform proprietary alternatives such as GPT-4o and Claude-3.5-Sonnet.

Conclusion: Integrating world-awareness through cognitive enhancements in LVLMs enables substantial advancements in embodied planning tasks, positioning open-source models as competitive or superior alternatives to proprietary systems.

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) show promise for embodied planning tasks
but struggle with complex scenarios involving unfamiliar environments and
multi-step goals. Current approaches rely on environment-agnostic imitation
learning that disconnects instructions from environmental contexts, causing
models to struggle with context-sensitive instructions and rely on
supplementary cues rather than visual reasoning during long-horizon
interactions. In this work, we propose World-Aware Planning Narrative
Enhancement (WAP), a framework that infuses LVLMs with comprehensive
environmental understanding through four cognitive capabilities (visual
appearance modeling, spatial reasoning, functional abstraction, and syntactic
grounding) while developing and evaluating models using only raw visual
observations through curriculum learning. Evaluations on the EB-ALFRED
benchmark demonstrate substantial improvements, with Qwen2.5-VL achieving a
60.7 absolute improvement in task success rates, particularly in commonsense
reasoning (+60.0) and long-horizon planning (+70.0). Notably, our enhanced
open-source models outperform proprietary systems like GPT-4o and
Claude-3.5-Sonnet by a large margin.

### [7] [IXAII: An Interactive Explainable Artificial Intelligence Interface for Decision Support Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21310)
*Pauline Speckmann,Mario Nadj,Christian Janiesch*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: IXAII is an interactive explainable AI system integrating diverse explanation methods to enhance user transparency and customization, evaluated positively by experts and lay users.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional post-hoc explainable AI methods are static and do not consider the user perspective, reducing their effectiveness for the target audience.

Method: The researchers developed IXAII, an interactive system combining methods like LIME, SHAP, Anchors, and DiCE. It offers tailored views for five user groups and allows users to control explanation content and format. Evaluation involved interviews with experts and lay users.

Result: The study found IXAII increases perceived transparency due to its diverse explanations and visualization options. Both experts and lay users viewed the system as helpful.

Conclusion: IXAII bridges gaps in explainable AI methods by integrating interactivity and user customization, offering a new take on explanation practices and human-AI interaction.

Abstract: Although several post-hoc methods for explainable AI have been developed,
most are static and neglect the user perspective, limiting their effectiveness
for the target audience. In response, we developed the interactive explainable
intelligent system called IXAII that offers explanations from four explainable
AI methods: LIME, SHAP, Anchors, and DiCE. Our prototype provides tailored
views for five user groups and gives users agency over the explanations'
content and their format. We evaluated IXAII through interviews with experts
and lay users. Our results indicate that IXAII, which provides different
explanations with multiple visualization options, is perceived as helpful to
increase transparency. By bridging the gaps between explainable AI methods,
interactivity, and practical implementation, we provide a novel perspective on
AI explanation practices and human-AI interaction.

### [8] [Active Inference AI Systems for Scientific Discovery](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21329)
*Karthik Duraisamy*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper discusses the challenges in current artificial intelligence systems for scientific discovery and proposes an architecture focused on overcoming three key gaps — abstraction, reasoning, and reality gaps.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation behind this paper is to address the limitations of current advanced AI systems in contributing to scientific discovery due to issues in reasoning mechanisms, operational architecture, and detachment from experimental reality.

Method: The authors define an AI architecture focused on active inference for scientific discovery. This includes (i) ground research memories in causal, self-supervised models, (ii) neuro-symbolic planners with Bayesian safeguards, (iii) dynamic knowledge graphs that evolve through reasoning and real-world validation, and (iv) iterative learning via simulations and physical experiments.

Result: The proposed system integrates counterfactual reasoning with real-world validation, aiming to enable more robust scientific discovery processes.

Conclusion: Human judgment remains indispensable in mitigating ambiguity, uncertainty, and feedback discrepancies, making it a permanent component of the proposed AI-driven scientific discovery framework.

Abstract: The rapid evolution of artificial intelligence has led to expectations of
transformative scientific discovery, yet current systems remain fundamentally
limited by their operational architectures, brittle reasoning mechanisms, and
their separation from experimental reality. Building on earlier work, we
contend that progress in AI-driven science now depends on closing three
fundamental gaps -- the abstraction gap, the reasoning gap, and the reality gap
-- rather than on model size/data/test time compute. Scientific reasoning
demands internal representations that support simulation of actions and
response, causal structures that distinguish correlation from mechanism, and
continuous calibration. We define active inference AI systems for scientific
discovery as those that (i) maintain long-lived research memories grounded in
causal self-supervised foundation models, (ii) symbolic or neuro-symbolic
planners equipped with Bayesian guardrails, (iii) grow persistent knowledge
graphs where thinking generates novel conceptual nodes, reasoning establishes
causal edges, and real-world interaction prunes false connections while
strengthening verified pathways, and (iv) refine their internal representations
through closed-loop interaction with both high-fidelity simulators and
automated laboratories - an operational loop where mental simulation guides
action and empirical surprise reshapes understanding. In essence, we outline an
architecture where discovery arises from the interplay between internal models
that enable counterfactual reasoning and external validation that grounds
hypotheses in reality. It is also argued that the inherent ambiguity in
feedback from simulations and experiments, and underlying uncertainties makes
human judgment indispensable, not as a temporary scaffold but as a permanent
architectural component.

### [9] [TableMoE: Neuro-Symbolic Routing for Structured Expert Reasoning in Multimodal Table Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21393)
*Junwen Zhang,Pu Chen,Yin Zhang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces TableMoE, a neuro-symbolic model designed to interpret complex, multimodal table data, outperforming existing models in handling structural and visual challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of existing multimodal large language models (MLLMs) in interpreting complex, real-world table structures under challenging conditions, termed WildStruct.

Method: The method involves a Mixture-of-Connector-Experts (MoCE) architecture with a Neuro-Symbolic Routing mechanism for assigning semantic roles and routing data elements to specialized experts. It also includes a pretraining step using a new TableMoE-Align dataset.

Result: TableMoE exceeds the performance of state-of-the-art models in multimodal table understanding and demonstrates robustness through four newly introduced benchmarks. Ablation studies validate its key components.

Conclusion: TableMoE integrates neuro-symbolic reasoning effectively, providing strong interpretability, robustness, and performance in multimodal table understanding.

Abstract: Multimodal understanding of tables in real-world contexts is challenging due
to the complexity of structure, symbolic density, and visual degradation (blur,
skew, watermarking, incomplete structures or fonts, multi-span or
hierarchically nested layouts). Existing multimodal large language models
(MLLMs) struggle with such WildStruct conditions, resulting in limited
performance and poor generalization. To address these challenges, we propose
TableMoE, a neuro-symbolic Mixture-of-Connector-Experts (MoCE) architecture
specifically designed for robust, structured reasoning over multimodal table
data. TableMoE features an innovative Neuro-Symbolic Routing mechanism, which
predicts latent semantic token roles (e.g., header, data cell, axis, formula)
and dynamically routes table elements to specialized experts (Table-to-HTML,
Table-to-JSON, Table-to-Code) using a confidence-aware gating strategy informed
by symbolic reasoning graphs. To facilitate effective alignment-driven
pretraining, we introduce the large-scale TableMoE-Align dataset, consisting of
1.2M table-HTML-JSON-code quadruples across finance, science, biomedicine and
industry, utilized exclusively for model pretraining. For evaluation, we curate
and release four challenging WildStruct benchmarks: WMMFinQA, WMMTatQA,
WMMTabDialog, and WMMFinanceMath, designed specifically to stress-test models
under real-world multimodal degradation and structural complexity. Experimental
results demonstrate that TableMoE significantly surpasses existing
state-of-the-art models. Extensive ablation studies validate each core
component, emphasizing the critical role of Neuro-Symbolic Routing and
structured expert alignment. Through qualitative analyses, we further showcase
TableMoE's interpretability and enhanced robustness, underscoring the
effectiveness of integrating neuro-symbolic reasoning for multimodal table
understanding.

### [10] [Spatial Mental Modeling from Limited Views](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21458)
*Baiqiao Yin,Qineng Wang,Pingyue Zhang,Jianshu Zhang,Kangrui Wang,Zihan Wang,Jieyu Zhang,Keshigeyan Chandrasegaran,Han Liu,Ranjay Krishna,Saining Xie,Manling Li,Jiajun Wu,Li Fei-Fei*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper discusses MindCube benchmark for assessing Vision Language Models (VLMs) in forming spatial mental models and introduces a synergistic approach, "map-then-reason," to improve performance by leveraging cognitive maps for reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the gap in current Vision Language Models (VLMs) which perform poorly at understanding and reasoning about unseen spaces, unlike humans who can build spatial mental models.

Method: The study developed the MindCube benchmark to evaluate VLMs' abilities in spatial tasks and employed techniques like unseen intermediate views, reasoning chains, and cognitive maps. The "map-then-reason" method is introduced to progressively construct cognitive maps and reason over them.

Result: The "map-then-reason" approach improved VLM performance on the MindCube benchmark from 37.8% to 60.8%, and further to 70.7% with reinforcement learning.

Conclusion: Actively constructing and reasoning over internal structured spatial representations improves VLMs' ability to understand unobservable spaces, enabling better reasoning processes.

Abstract: Can Vision Language Models (VLMs) imagine the full scene from just a few
views, like humans do? Humans form spatial mental models, internal
representations of unseen space, to reason about layout, perspective, and
motion. Our new MindCube benchmark with 21,154 questions across 3,268 images
exposes this critical gap, where existing VLMs exhibit near-random performance.
Using MindCube, we systematically evaluate how well VLMs build robust spatial
mental models through representing positions (cognitive mapping), orientations
(perspective-taking), and dynamics (mental simulation for "what-if" movements).
We then explore three approaches to help VLMs approximate spatial mental
models, including unseen intermediate views, natural language reasoning chains,
and cognitive maps. The significant improvement comes from a synergistic
approach, "map-then-reason", that jointly trains the model to first generate a
cognitive map and then reason upon it. By training models to reason over these
internal maps, we boosted accuracy from 37.8% to 60.8% (+23.0%). Adding
reinforcement learning pushed performance even further to 70.7% (+32.9%). Our
key insight is that such scaffolding of spatial mental models, actively
constructing and utilizing internal structured spatial representations with
flexible reasoning processes, significantly improves understanding of
unobservable space.

### [11] [Ad-Hoc Human-AI Coordination Challenge](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21490)
*Tin Dizdarević,Ravi Hammond,Tobias Gessler,Anisoara Calinescu,Jonathan Cook,Matteo Gallici,Andrei Lupu,Jakob Nicolaus Foerster*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper tackles AI-human coordination in the game Hanabi by introducing the Ad-Hoc Human-AI Coordination Challenge (AH2AC2) with proxy human agents for evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI-human seamless coordination is essential but remains challenging, particularly in complex domains like Hanabi due to imperfect information and difficult-to-reproduce human evaluations.

Method: The authors develop human proxy agents using large-scale human gameplay data to simulate human behavior, enabling reproducible, cost-effective evaluations in the AH2AC2 framework.

Result: Baseline performance results for two- and three-player Hanabi games are provided, and proxy agents are made accessible via a controlled evaluation system.

Conclusion: AH2AC2 ensures a standardized platform for testing human-AI coordination, with controlled access to proxy agents and open-source data for further development.

Abstract: Achieving seamless coordination between AI agents and humans is crucial for
real-world applications, yet it remains a significant open challenge. Hanabi is
a cooperative card game featuring imperfect information, constrained
communication, theory of mind requirements, and coordinated action -- making it
an ideal testbed for human-AI coordination. However, its use for human-AI
interaction has been limited by the challenges of human evaluation. In this
work, we introduce the Ad-Hoc Human-AI Coordination Challenge (AH2AC2) to
overcome the constraints of costly and difficult-to-reproduce human
evaluations. We develop \textit{human proxy agents} on a large-scale human
dataset that serve as robust, cheap, and reproducible human-like evaluation
partners in AH2AC2. To encourage the development of data-efficient methods, we
open-source a dataset of 3,079 games, deliberately limiting the amount of
available human gameplay data. We present baseline results for both two- and
three- player Hanabi scenarios. To ensure fair evaluation, we host the proxy
agents through a controlled evaluation system rather than releasing them
publicly. The code is available at

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces Mind2Web 2, a benchmark for evaluating advanced autonomous web-browsing systems, and proposes a novel framework to assess answer quality and source attribution.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current evaluation benchmarks are insufficient for complex, autonomous web-browsing systems like Deep Research, which require handling extensive searches and dynamic information synthesis.

Method: The authors developed a benchmark consisting of 130 challenging tasks requiring real-time web interaction, paired with an Agent-as-a-Judge framework that employs a tree-structured rubric for automated evaluation.

Result: Evaluation reveals that OpenAI Deep Research achieves 50-70% of human performance while taking half the time, highlighting significant potential for agentic search systems.

Conclusion: Mind2Web 2 lays a foundation for advancing and benchmarking autonomous agentic search systems, offering tools for evaluating their performance in handling complex, dynamic tasks.

Abstract: Agentic search such as Deep Research systems, where large language models
autonomously browse the web, synthesize information, and return comprehensive
citation-backed answers, represents a major shift in how users interact with
web-scale information. While promising greater efficiency and cognitive
offloading, the growing complexity and open-endedness of agentic search have
outpaced existing evaluation benchmarks and methodologies, which largely assume
short search horizons and static answers. In this paper, we introduce Mind2Web
2, a benchmark of 130 realistic, high-quality, and long-horizon tasks that
require real-time web browsing and extensive information synthesis, constructed
with over 1,000 hours of human labor. To address the challenge of evaluating
time-varying and complex answers, we propose a novel Agent-as-a-Judge
framework. Our method constructs task-specific judge agents based on a
tree-structured rubric design to automatically assess both answer correctness
and source attribution. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation of nine frontier
agentic search systems and human performance, along with a detailed error

*Fangjun Ding,Renyu Zhang,Xinyu Feng,Chengye Xie,Zheng Zhang,Yanting Zhang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces PsyLite, an advanced lightweight AI model for psychological counseling, which improves dialogue safety, reasoning, and deployment efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing AI models for psychological counseling struggle with issues like unsafe dialogues, inefficient scenario handling, and heavy deployment requirements.

Method: The study employs a two-stage training strategy involving hybrid distillation fine-tuning and preference optimization, coupled with conditional RAG for humorous crosstalk and dialogue safety enhancements.

Result: PsyLite shows superior performance in evaluations, notably improving psychological counseling professionalism by 47.6% and dialogue safety by 2.4%, while enabling low-cost deployment with just 5GB memory.

Conclusion: PsyLite provides an effective, scalable solution for psychological counseling, addressing key shortcomings of prior models, and is suitable for deployment in resource-constrained environments.

Abstract: With the rapid development of digital technology, AI-driven psychological
counseling has gradually become an important research direction in the field of
mental health. However, existing models still have deficiencies in dialogue
safety, detailed scenario handling, and lightweight deployment. To address
these issues, this study proposes PsyLite, a lightweight psychological
counseling large language model agent developed based on the base model
InternLM2.5-7B-chat. Through a two-stage training strategy (hybrid distillation
data fine-tuning and ORPO preference optimization), PsyLite enhances the
model's deep-reasoning ability, psychological counseling ability, and safe
dialogue ability. After deployment using Ollama and Open WebUI, a custom
workflow is created with Pipelines. An innovative conditional RAG is designed
to introduce crosstalk humor elements at appropriate times during psychological
counseling to enhance user experience and decline dangerous requests to
strengthen dialogue safety. Evaluations show that PsyLite outperforms the
baseline models in the Chinese general evaluation (CEval), psychological
counseling professional evaluation (CPsyCounE), and dialogue safety evaluation
(SafeDialBench), particularly in psychological counseling professionalism
(CPsyCounE score improvement of 47.6\%) and dialogue safety (\safe{} score
improvement of 2.4\%). Additionally, the model uses quantization technology
(GGUF q4\_k\_m) to achieve low hardware deployment (5GB memory is sufficient
for operation), providing a feasible solution for psychological counseling
applications in resource-constrained environments.

*Ilias Papalamprou,Nikolaos Fotos,Nikolaos Chatzivasileiadis,Anna Angelogianni,Dimosthenis Masouros,Dimitrios Soudris*

Main category: cs.AR

TL;DR: This paper proposes a secure FPGA configuration method using Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC) and blockchain.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The increasing deployment of FPGAs in unprotected environments and the threat quantum computing poses to existing cryptographic methods require robust security measures.

Method: The approach combines remote attestation, Post-Quantum Cryptographic (PQC) algorithms for FPGA configuration, and blockchain for secure evidence storage.

Result: The proposed method introduces only a 2% overhead compared to non-PQC methods, validated on two FPGA families.

Conclusion: The solution provides a secure configuration process for FPGAs with minimal performance trade-offs, addressing both post-quantum security and trust across edge computing.

Abstract: The advent of 5G and beyond has brought increased performance networks,
facilitating the deployment of services closer to the user. To meet performance
requirements such services require specialized hardware, such as Field
Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs). However, FPGAs are often deployed in
unprotected environments, leaving the user's applications vulnerable to
multiple attacks. With the rise of quantum computing, which threatens the
integrity of widely-used cryptographic algorithms, the need for a robust
security infrastructure is even more crucial. In this paper we introduce a
hybrid hardware-software solution utilizing remote attestation to securely
configure FPGAs, while integrating Post-Quantum Cryptographic (PQC) algorithms
for enhanced security. Additionally, to enable trustworthiness across the whole
edge computing continuum, our solution integrates a blockchain infrastructure,
ensuring the secure storage of any security evidence. We evaluate the proposed
secure configuration process under different PQC algorithms in two FPGA
families, showcasing only 2% overheard compared to the non PQC approach.

### [15] [Accelerating GNN Training through Locality-aware Dropout and Merge](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21414)
*Gongjian Sun,Mingyu Yan,Dengke Han,Runzhen Xue,Duo Wang,Xiaochun Ye,Dongrui Fan*

Main category: cs.AR

TL;DR: LiGNN proposes a hardware-based solution to improve data locality in GNN training, using locality-aware dropout and memory access merging, achieving up to 3.02x speedup without sacrificing model accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Inefficient neighbor aggregation in GNNs causes irregular and coarse-grained DRAM accesses, leading to significant performance degradation.

Method: LiGNN introduces a locality-aware feature dropout mechanism and a memory access merging strategy during neighbor aggregation, informed by memory layout and organization to reduce DRAM irregularities.

Result: LiGNN achieves a 1.48~3.02x speedup, a reduction in DRAM accesses by 34%~55%, and DRAM row activations by 59%~82% under a 0.5 dropout rate, with no loss in model accuracy.

Conclusion: LiGNN effectively addresses the data locality challenge in GNN training, offering a hardware-efficient solution that improves performance while maintaining model fidelity.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have demonstrated significant success in graph
learning and are widely adopted across various critical domains. However, the
irregular connectivity between vertices leads to inefficient neighbor
aggregation, resulting in substantial irregular and coarse-grained DRAM
accesses. This lack of data locality presents significant challenges for
execution platforms, ultimately degrading performance. While previous
accelerator designs have leveraged on-chip memory and data access scheduling
strategies to address this issue, they still inevitably access features at
irregular addresses from DRAM. In this work, we propose LiGNN, a hardware-based
solution that improves data locality by applying dropout and merge techniques
during neighbor aggregation to accelerate GNN training. Unlike conventional
algorithm-level dropout methods that primarily aim to improve accuracy while
overlooking hardware costs, LiGNN introduces a locality-aware feature dropout
mechanism. This approach selectively drops node features with data locality
awareness, effectively reducing irregular DRAM accesses without compromising
model accuracy. Moreover, by leveraging detailed knowledge of memory layout and
organization-including critical alignment constraints-LiGNN strategically
merges memory accesses during neighbor aggregation at the DRAM row level,
guided by GNN-level semantics. This optimization significantly improves data
locality with minimal additional cost. Under the commonly adopted 0.5 dropout
rate, LiGNN outperforms state-of-the-art methods, delivering a 1.48~3.02x
speedup, reducing DRAM accesses by 34%~55%, and lowering DRAM row activations
by 59%~82%, all while maintaining model accuracy.

*Maryam Ghane,Amir M. Hajisadeghi,Hamid R. Zarandi*

Main category: cs.AR

TL;DR: OptGM is a gate merging method to reduce NBTI effects in digital circuits, significantly improving device performance and reducing critical delays.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address negative bias temperature instability (NBTI), a degradation phenomenon that impacts the reliability and performance of digital circuits.

Method: OptGM identifies NBTI-critical nodes based on signal probabilities, then merges sensitizer and sensitive gates into a complex gate to eliminate these nodes while preserving original logic.

Result: Simulation results show reductions of 89.29% in NBTI-critical transistors, 23.87% in delay degradation, and 6.47% in total transistor count. It also enhances performance per cost by 12.8%.

Conclusion: OptGM effectively mitigates NBTI issues with minimal area overhead, improving circuit reliability and performance.

Abstract: This paper presents OptGM, an optimized gate merging method designed to
mitigate negative bias temperature instability (NBTI) in digital circuits.
First, the proposed approach effectively identifies NBTI-critical internal
nodes, defined as those with a signal probability exceeding a predefined
threshold. Next, based on the proposed optimized algorithm, the sensitizer gate
(which drives the critical node) and the sensitive gate (which is fed by it)
are merged into a new complex gate. This complex gate preserves the original
logic while eliminating NBTI-critical nodes. Finally, to evaluate the
effectiveness of OptGM, we assess it on several combinational and sequential
benchmark circuits. Simulation results demonstrate that, on average, the number
of NBTI-critical transistors (i.e., PMOS transistors connected to critical
nodes), NBTI-induced delay degradation, and the total transistor count are
reduced by 89.29%, 23.87%, and 6.47%, respectively. Furthermore, OptGM enhances
performance per cost (PPC) by 12.8% on average, with minimal area overhead.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces LUCARIO, a benchmark and framework for probabilistic question answering (QA) over tabular data, utilizing Bayesian Networks and large language models (LLMs).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing QA systems for tabular data perform well on factual queries but fail on probabilistic queries that require reasoning under uncertainty.

Method: The approach involves constructing Bayesian Networks from data tables, translating probabilistic queries, and leveraging large language models (LLMs) to compute final answers.

Result: Empirical evaluation shows that the hybrid symbolic-neural approach achieves significant improvements compared to baseline methods.

Conclusion: The proposed hybrid framework demonstrates the effectiveness of combining Bayesian Networks with LLMs for probabilistic QA over large tabular datasets, addressing shortcomings in existing systems.

Abstract: Current approaches for question answering (QA) over tabular data, such as
NL2SQL systems, perform well for factual questions where answers are directly
retrieved from tables. However, they fall short on probabilistic questions
requiring reasoning under uncertainty. In this paper, we introduce a new
benchmark LUCARIO and a framework for probabilistic QA over large tabular data.
Our method induces Bayesian Networks from tables, translates natural language
queries into probabilistic queries, and uses large language models (LLMs) to
generate final answers. Empirical results demonstrate significant improvements
over baselines, highlighting the benefits of hybrid symbolic-neural reasoning.

### [18] [Multi-lingual Functional Evaluation for Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20793)
*Victor Ojewale,Inioluwa Deborah Raji,Suresh Venkatasubramanian*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces multi-lingual functional benchmarks (CL-GSM Symbolic and CL-IFEval) to better evaluate the practical performance and robustness of large language models across six languages. It reveals disparities in how static benchmarks align with functional performance and highlights performance variability among languages.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current multi-lingual evaluation benchmarks fail to accurately measure practical performance and robustness of language models in real-world multilingual settings.

Method: The authors create two new benchmarks, CL-GSM Symbolic and CL-IFEval, by translating existing functional templates from English to French, Spanish, Hindi, Arabic, and Yoruba. They compare performance results against traditional static benchmarks.

Result: There is a significant performance drop when moving from static to functional evaluations for benchmarks like M-GSM and Belebele. Certain benchmarks like M-MMLU align more closely with functional performance. Language performance robustness varies, with Arabic and English performing more consistently.

Conclusion: The study highlights the limitations of static multi-lingual benchmarks and proposes functional benchmarks as a more reliable approach for evaluating model performance across languages, aiding in identifying language-specific challenges.

Abstract: Multi-lingual competence in large language models is often evaluated via
static data benchmarks such as Belebele, M-MMLU and M-GSM. However, these
evaluations often fail to provide an adequate understanding of the practical
performance and robustness of models across multi-lingual settings. In
response, we create multi-lingual functional benchmarks -- Cross-Lingual Grade
School Math Symbolic (CL-GSM Symbolic) and Cross-Lingual Instruction-Following
Eval (CL-IFEval)-- by translating existing functional benchmark templates from
English to five additional languages that span the range of resources available
for NLP: French, Spanish, Hindi, Arabic and Yoruba. Our results reveal that
some static multi-lingual benchmarks capture functional performance much more
closely than others (i.e. across models, there is a 24%, 17% and 18% decrease
in performance between M-GSM and CL-GSM Symbolic in English, French and Spanish
respectively; similarly there's a 15 - 24% performance drop across languages
between Belebele and CL-IFEval, and only a 0.5% to 3% performance drop between
M-MMLU and CL-IFEval). Similarly, we find that model robustness across
languages varies significantly, with certain languages (eg. Arabic, English)
being the most consistently well performing across evaluation iterations.

### [19] [The Ideation-Execution Gap: Execution Outcomes of LLM-Generated versus Human Research Ideas](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20803)
*Chenglei Si,Tatsunori Hashimoto,Diyi Yang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study evaluates the effectiveness of research ideas generated by Large Language Models (LLMs) compared to human-expert ideas after execution, finding that LLM ideas perform worse after being implemented.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to investigate whether LLM-generated research ideas, which may initially appear novel, actually result in impactful and effective research outcomes when implemented.

Method: The paper conducts an experiment with 43 expert researchers executing randomly assigned research ideas (LLM-generated or expert-written). Each researcher implemented their assigned idea, wrote a short paper, and had their work reviewed blindly by expert NLP researchers.

Result: The study finds that while LLM-generated ideas may initially appear more novel, their effectiveness diminishes after execution. Human-written ideas surpassed LLM ideas in all evaluation metrics post-execution.

Conclusion: Current LLMs have limitations in generating truly effective research ideas, and evaluating ideas without execution does not fully capture their potential shortcomings.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise in accelerating the
scientific research pipeline. A key capability for this process is the ability
to generate novel research ideas, and prior studies have found settings in
which LLM-generated research ideas were judged as more novel than human-expert
ideas. However, a good idea should not simply appear to be novel, it should
also result in better research after being executed. To test whether
AI-generated ideas lead to better research outcomes, we conduct an execution
study by recruiting 43 expert researchers to execute randomly-assigned ideas,
either written by experts or generated by an LLM. Each expert spent over 100
hours implementing the idea and wrote a 4-page short paper to document the
experiments. All the executed projects are then reviewed blindly by expert NLP
researchers. Comparing the review scores of the same ideas before and after
execution, the scores of the LLM-generated ideas decrease significantly more
than expert-written ideas on all evaluation metrics (novelty, excitement,
effectiveness, and overall; p < 0.05), closing the gap between LLM and human
ideas observed at the ideation stage. When comparing the aggregated review
scores from the execution study, we even observe that for many metrics there is
a flip in rankings where human ideas score higher than LLM ideas. This
ideation-execution gap highlights the limitations of current LLMs in generating
truly effective research ideas and the challenge of evaluating research ideas
in the absence of execution outcomes.

*Chinmay Gondhalekar,Urjitkumar Patel,Fang-Chun Yeh*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MultiFinRAG is a retrieval-augmented generation framework designed specifically for answering complex financial questions involving diverse modalities such as text, tables, and images.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the limitations of traditional large language models and retrieval-augmented generation pipelines in handling financial documents that require cross-modal reasoning due to token limits and context fragmentation.

Method: MultiFinRAG uses multimodal extraction, modality-aware embedding, indexed retrieval, and a tiered fallback strategy for answering financial questions, leveraging multimodal inputs like tables and images.

Result: MultiFinRAG outperformed ChatGPT-4o (free-tier) by 19 percentage points in accuracy on complex financial QA tasks.

Conclusion: The proposed framework provides an effective solution for financial QA tasks, enabling accurate multimodal reasoning even on commodity hardware.

Abstract: Financial documents--such as 10-Ks, 10-Qs, and investor presentations--span
hundreds of pages and combine diverse modalities, including dense narrative
text, structured tables, and complex figures. Answering questions over such
content often requires joint reasoning across modalities, which strains
traditional large language models (LLMs) and retrieval-augmented generation
(RAG) pipelines due to token limitations, layout loss, and fragmented
cross-modal context. We introduce MultiFinRAG, a retrieval-augmented generation
framework purpose-built for financial QA. MultiFinRAG first performs multimodal
extraction by grouping table and figure images into batches and sending them to
a lightweight, quantized open-source multimodal LLM, which produces both
structured JSON outputs and concise textual summaries. These outputs, along
with narrative text, are embedded and indexed with modality-aware similarity
thresholds for precise retrieval. A tiered fallback strategy then dynamically
escalates from text-only to text+table+image contexts when necessary, enabling
cross-modal reasoning while reducing irrelevant context. Despite running on
commodity hardware, MultiFinRAG achieves 19 percentage points higher accuracy
than ChatGPT-4o (free-tier) on complex financial QA tasks involving text,
tables, images, and combined multimodal reasoning.

*Quintin Myers,Yanjun Gao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study evaluates six Large Language Models (LLMs) on their ability to reason about everyday conflict using the Violent Behavior Vignette Questionnaire (VBVQ), revealing divergence in text generation and demographic biases.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the capability of LLMs in addressing morally ambiguous and real-world violent content scenarios, and examine biases in their responses.

Method: Six LLMs were tested using VBVQ in a zero-shot setting with persona-based prompts varying in race, age, and geographic identity within the U.S.

Result: LLMs showed divergence between their generated text and violent response preferences, and exhibited demographic biases that conflict with established social science findings.

Conclusion: LLMs need improvement in reasoning about real-world conflicts and managing demographic biases, highlighting ethical concerns in their deployment for handling violent content.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly proposed for detecting and
responding to violent content online, yet their ability to reason about morally
ambiguous, real-world scenarios remains underexamined. We present the first
study to evaluate LLMs using a validated social science instrument designed to
measure human response to everyday conflict, namely the Violent Behavior
Vignette Questionnaire (VBVQ). To assess potential bias, we introduce
persona-based prompting that varies race, age, and geographic identity within
the United States. Six LLMs developed across different geopolitical and
organizational contexts are evaluated under a unified zero-shot setting. Our
study reveals two key findings: (1) LLMs surface-level text generation often
diverges from their internal preference for violent responses; (2) their
violent tendencies vary across demographics, frequently contradicting
established findings in criminology, social science, and psychology.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This study highlights challenges in applying end-to-end fact-checking systems to medical claims and argues for interactive communication-based approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address issues in medical communication and the challenges of verifying claims against extensive medical literature, especially given the stakes in public health and medicine.

Method: The study analyzes how clinical experts verify real-world medical claims from social media by synthesizing evidence from clinical literature, probing limitations of current fact-checking systems.

Result: The research identifies challenges specific to medical fact-checking, such as mismatches between claims and evidence, ambiguities in claim interpretation, and subjective veracity labeling.

Conclusion: End-to-end fact-checking systems for medicine face significant hurdles, and the authors propose rethinking such systems as interactive communication tools for better efficacy.

Abstract: Technological progress has led to concrete advancements in tasks that were
regarded as challenging, such as automatic fact-checking. Interest in adopting
these systems for public health and medicine has grown due to the high-stakes
nature of medical decisions and challenges in critically appraising a vast and
diverse medical literature. Evidence-based medicine connects to every
individual, and yet the nature of it is highly technical, rendering the medical
literacy of majority users inadequate to sufficiently navigate the domain. Such
problems with medical communication ripens the ground for end-to-end
fact-checking agents: check a claim against current medical literature and
return with an evidence-backed verdict. And yet, such systems remain largely
unused. To understand this, we present the first study examining how clinical
experts verify real claims from social media by synthesizing medical evidence.
In searching for this upper-bound, we reveal fundamental challenges in
end-to-end fact-checking when applied to medicine: Difficulties connecting
claims in the wild to scientific evidence in the form of clinical trials;
ambiguities in underspecified claims mixed with mismatched intentions; and
inherently subjective veracity labels. We argue that fact-checking should be
approached and evaluated as an interactive communication problem, rather than
an end-to-end process.

*Zhengyan Shi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces methods to efficiently and robustly adapt language models (LMs) to specific NLP tasks by leveraging unlabelled data, reducing computational costs, and improving evaluation techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing challenges in fine-tuning large LMs include underutilization of unlabelled data, overfitting on small task-specific datasets, high computational costs, and limited applicability to open-ended language tasks.

Method: The proposed methods include novel continued pre-training techniques, parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods, improved supervised fine-tuning for instruction following, and advanced evaluation frameworks like multi-hop spatial reasoning tasks.

Result: The methods significantly enhance LM robustness, efficiency, and generalization, demonstrating superior performance in empirical tests across diverse NLP tasks.

Conclusion: These advancements improve adaptability and bring LMs closer to achieving artificial general intelligence by addressing core challenges in task-specific adaptation.

Abstract: Language models (LMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in NLP, yet
adapting them efficiently and robustly to specific tasks remains challenging.
As their scale and complexity grow, fine-tuning LMs on labelled data often
underutilizes available unlabelled data, leads to overfitting on small
task-specific sets, and imposes significant computational costs. These
limitations hamper their application to the open-ended landscape of real-world
language tasks.
  This thesis proposes a series of methods to better adapt LMs to downstream
applications. First, we explore strategies for extracting task-relevant
knowledge from unlabelled data, introducing a novel continued pre-training
technique that outperforms state-of-the-art semi-supervised approaches. Next,
we present a parameter-efficient fine-tuning method that substantially reduces
memory and compute costs while maintaining competitive performance. We also
introduce improved supervised fine-tuning methods that enable LMs to better
follow instructions, especially when labelled data is scarce, enhancing their
performance across a range of NLP tasks, including open-ended generation.
Finally, we develop new evaluation methods and benchmarks, such as multi-hop
spatial reasoning tasks, to assess LM capabilities and adaptation more
comprehensively.
  Through extensive empirical studies across diverse NLP tasks, our results
demonstrate that these approaches substantially improve LM robustness,
efficiency, and generalization, making them more adaptable to a broad range of
applications. These advances mark a significant step towards more robust and
efficient LMs, bringing us closer to the goal of artificial general
intelligence.

TL;DR: The paper introduces FineWeb and FineWeb2, a curation pipeline and massive multilingual dataset for pre-training large language models, achieving improved performance across diverse languages.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multilingual pretraining remains challenging due to difficulties in filtering and deduplication pipelines across languages, prompting the need for better dataset curation methods.

Method: FineWeb pipeline automatically curates pre-training datasets with high quality and diversity, rebalances corpora based on duplication and content quality, and scales to over 1000 languages using Common Crawl snapshots.

Result: Using FineWeb, the curated datasets improved model performance across nine diverse languages, and scaling this approach generated FineWeb2, a 20TB dataset with 5 billion documents.

Conclusion: FineWeb pipeline effectively addresses multilingual dataset curation challenges, enhancing model performance and scalability, with resources open-sourced for broader use.

Abstract: Pre-training state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs) requires vast
amounts of clean and diverse text data. While the open development of large
high-quality English pre-training datasets has seen substantial recent
progress, training performant multilingual LLMs remains a challenge, in large
part due to the inherent difficulty of tailoring filtering and deduplication
pipelines to a large number of languages. In this work, we introduce a new
pre-training dataset curation pipeline based on FineWeb that can be
automatically adapted to support any language. We extensively ablate our
pipeline design choices on a set of nine diverse languages, guided by a set of
meaningful and informative evaluation tasks that were chosen through a novel
selection process based on measurable criteria. Ultimately, we show that our
pipeline can be used to create non-English corpora that produce more performant
models than prior datasets. We additionally introduce a straightforward and
principled approach to rebalance datasets that takes into consideration both
duplication count and quality, providing an additional performance uplift.
Finally, we scale our pipeline to over 1000 languages using almost 100 Common
Crawl snapshots to produce FineWeb2, a new 20 terabyte (5 billion document)
multilingual dataset which we release along with our pipeline, training, and
evaluation codebases.

TL;DR: KaLM-Embedding-V2 is a compact yet high-performing text embedding model leveraging innovative training techniques and pre-training/fine-tuning on diverse datasets, achieving results comparable to much larger models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation stems from the need for a compact and versatile text embedding model that can maintain high performance without requiring disproportionately large model sizes.

Method: The method includes a fully bidirectional transformer with mean-pooling, a multi-stage training pipeline (pre-training, fine-tuning, model-soup averaging), focal-style reweighting for difficult samples, and an online hard-negative mixing strategy. It also incorporates diverse datasets for pre-training and fine-tuning to enhance performance and generalization.

Result: KaLM-Embedding-V2 significantly outperforms other models of similar size and matches or surpasses the performance of much larger models across various metrics in the MTEB Chinese and English benchmarks.

Conclusion: KaLM-Embedding-V2 demonstrates that a compact model with innovative designs and efficient training strategies can set a new standard for embedding performance, balancing size and effectiveness.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose KaLM-Embedding-V2, a versatile and compact
embedding model, which achieves impressive performance in general-purpose text
embedding tasks by leveraging superior training techniques and data. Our key
innovations include: (1) To better align the architecture with representation
learning, we remove the causal attention mask and adopt a fully bidirectional
transformer with simple yet effective mean-pooling to produce fixed-length
embeddings; (2) We employ a multi-stage training pipeline: (i) pre-training on
large-scale weakly supervised open-source corpora; (ii) fine-tuning on
high-quality retrieval and non-retrieval datasets; and (iii) model-soup
parameter averaging for robust generalization. Besides, we introduce a
focal-style reweighting mechanism that concentrates learning on difficult
samples and an online hard-negative mixing strategy to continuously enrich hard
negatives without expensive offline mining; (3) We collect over 20 categories
of data for pre-training and 100 categories of data for fine-tuning, to boost
both the performance and generalization of the embedding model. Extensive
evaluations on the Massive Text Embedding Benchmark (MTEB) Chinese and English
show that our model significantly outperforms others of comparable size, and
competes with 3x, 14x, 18x, and 26x larger embedding models, setting a new

### [26] [Can Gradient Descent Simulate Prompting?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20989)
*Eric Zhang,Leshem Choshen,Jacob Andreas*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper investigates how to modify language models (LMs) so that parameter fine-tuning emulates prompting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the storage cost and generalization limitations of fine-tuning compared to the robustness of prompting in updating LMs with new information.

Method: The method involves meta-training LMs using gradient-based meta-learning approaches, leveraging the LM's own prompted predictions as training targets instead of ground-truth labels.

Result: Gradient descent trained this way partially or fully recovers the performance of prompting, showing improvements on specific tasks such as the "reversal curse" and single-passage question answering.

Conclusion: The study provides insights into making gradient descent more expressive and hints at new possibilities for long-context modeling and understanding the generalization power of gradient-based learning.

Abstract: There are two primary ways of incorporating new information into a language
model (LM): changing its prompt or changing its parameters, e.g. via
fine-tuning. Parameter updates incur no long-term storage cost for model
changes. However, for many model updates, prompting is significantly more
effective: prompted models can generalize robustly from single examples and
draw logical inferences that do not occur under standard fine-tuning. Can
models be modified so that fine-tuning does emulate prompting? This paper
describes a method for meta-training LMs such that gradient updates emulate the
effects of conditioning on new information. Our approach uses tools from
gradient-based meta-learning but uses an LM's own prompted predictions as
targets, eliminating the need for ground-truth labels. Subsequent gradient
descent training recovers some (and occasionally all) of prompted model
performance -- showing improvement on the ``reversal curse'' tasks, and
answering questions about text passages after a single gradient update. These
results suggest that, with appropriate initialization, gradient descent can be
surprisingly expressive. Our results suggest new avenues for long-context
modeling and offer insight into the generalization capabilities of
gradient-based learning.

TL;DR: This study extends personality modeling for large language models (LLMs) by using the 16 Personality Factor (16PF) model, providing more nuanced and controllable personality traits.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve personality modeling in LLMs by addressing the limitations of coarse personality dimensions in the Big Five model and the lack of mechanisms to control trait intensity.

Method: The study introduces the Machine Personality Inventory (MPI) with an upgraded 16PF framework and a Specific Attribute Control (SAC) mechanism, using adjective-based semantic anchoring and behavioural questions to model personality intensity across five factors.

Result: The findings demonstrate that modeling personality intensity as a continuous spectrum produces more consistent and psychologically coherent trait expressions. Adjusting trait intensity systematically affects related traits in predictable directions.

Conclusion: The work achieves more nuanced, controllable personality expressions for LLMs, paving the way for improved human-machine interactions in fields like healthcare, education, and job interviews.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have gained significant traction across a wide
range of fields in recent years. There is also a growing expectation for them
to display human-like personalities during interactions. To meet this
expectation, numerous studies have proposed methods for modelling LLM
personalities through psychometric evaluations. However, most existing models
face two major limitations: they rely on the Big Five (OCEAN) framework, which
only provides coarse personality dimensions, and they lack mechanisms for
controlling trait intensity. In this paper, we address this gap by extending
the Machine Personality Inventory (MPI), which originally used the Big Five
model, to incorporate the 16 Personality Factor (16PF) model, allowing
expressive control over sixteen distinct traits. We also developed a structured
framework known as Specific Attribute Control (SAC) for evaluating and
dynamically inducing trait intensity in LLMs. Our method introduces
adjective-based semantic anchoring to guide trait intensity expression and
leverages behavioural questions across five intensity factors:
\textit{Frequency}, \textit{Depth}, \textit{Threshold}, \textit{Effort}, and
\textit{Willingness}. Through experimentation, we find that modelling intensity
as a continuous spectrum yields substantially more consistent and controllable
personality expression compared to binary trait toggling. Moreover, we observe
that changes in target trait intensity systematically influence closely related
traits in psychologically coherent directions, suggesting that LLMs internalize
multi-dimensional personality structures rather than treating traits in
isolation. Our work opens new pathways for controlled and nuanced human-machine
interactions in domains such as healthcare, education, and interviewing
processes, bringing us one step closer to truly human-like social machines.

*Papa Séga Wade,Mihai Andries,Ioannis Kanellos,Thierry Moudenc*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes a chunk-based automatic fluency assessment method using self-supervised learning models and hierarchical frameworks, improving fluency scoring metrics significantly over baseline methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurately assessing speech fluency in non-native speakers is difficult due to complex rhythm, pauses, and disfluencies inherent to such speech.

Method: A chunk-based approach integrates multiple SSL models (Wav2Vec2, HuBERT, WavLM) with hierarchical CNN-BiLSTM networks, leveraging Silero-VAD for breath-group segmentation and enriching input with fluency markers.

Result: The proposed method achieved significant improvements in F1-score (+2.8 to +4.2 points) and Pearson correlation (+4 to +6.2 points) across evaluated datasets compared to baselines.

Conclusion: Chunk-based multi-SSL fusion is effective for robust fluency evaluation; further work should explore applications to diverse dialects and prosodic patterns.

Abstract: Automatic fluency assessment (AFA) remains challenging, particularly in
capturing speech rhythm, pauses, and disfluencies in non-native speakers. We
introduce a chunk-based approach integrating self-supervised learning (SSL)
models (Wav2Vec2, HuBERT, and WavLM) selected for their complementary strengths
in phonetic, prosodic, and noisy speech modeling, with a hierarchical
CNN-BiLSTM framework. Speech is segmented into breath-group chunks using Silero
voice activity detection (Silero-VAD), enabling fine-grained temporal analysis
while mitigating over-segmentation artifacts. SSL embeddings are fused via a
learnable weighted mechanism, balancing acoustic and linguistic features, and
enriched with chunk-level fluency markers (e.g., speech rate, pause durations,
n-gram repetitions). The CNN-BiLSTM captures local and long-term dependencies
across chunks. Evaluated on Avalinguo and Speechocean762, our approach improves
F1-score by 2.8 and Pearson correlation by 6.2 points over single SSL baselines
on Speechocean762, with gains of 4.2 F1-score and 4.0 Pearson points on
Avalinguo, surpassing Pyannote.audio-based segmentation baselines. These
findings highlight chunk-based multi-SSL fusion for robust fluency evaluation,
though future work should explore generalization to dialects with irregular
prosody.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper evaluates six prominent Large Language Models (LLMs) using CA-Ben, a benchmark for Chartered Accountancy-style financial reasoning in the Indian context. GPT-4o and Claude 3.5 Sonnet perform best overall, but challenges remain in numerical computations and legal interpretations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to evaluate how effectively advanced LLMs capture and apply domain-specific financial knowledge, addressing gaps in the Indian financial expertise context.

Method: The authors introduce CA-Ben, a benchmark based on ICAI examination datasets, to evaluate financial, legal, and quantitative reasoning in six prominent LLMs using standardized protocols.

Result: Claude 3.5 Sonnet and GPT-4o excel in conceptual and legal reasoning. However, all models struggle with numerical computations and precise legal interpretations.

Conclusion: The study highlights both strengths and limitations of current LLMs for domain-specific tasks, recommending hybrid reasoning and retrieval-augmented methods for enhanced performance in quantitative and legal contexts.

Abstract: Advanced intelligent systems, particularly Large Language Models (LLMs), are
significantly reshaping financial practices through advancements in Natural
Language Processing (NLP). However, the extent to which these models
effectively capture and apply domain-specific financial knowledge remains
uncertain. Addressing a critical gap in the expansive Indian financial context,
this paper introduces CA-Ben, a Chartered Accountancy benchmark specifically
designed to evaluate the financial, legal, and quantitative reasoning
capabilities of LLMs. CA-Ben comprises structured question-answer datasets
derived from the rigorous examinations conducted by the Institute of Chartered
Accountants of India (ICAI), spanning foundational, intermediate, and advanced
CA curriculum stages. Six prominent LLMs i.e. GPT 4o, LLAMA 3.3 70B, LLAMA 3.1
405B, MISTRAL Large, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, and Microsoft Phi 4 were evaluated
using standardized protocols. Results indicate variations in performance, with
Claude 3.5 Sonnet and GPT-4o outperforming others, especially in conceptual and
legal reasoning. Notable challenges emerged in numerical computations and legal
interpretations. The findings emphasize the strengths and limitations of
current LLMs, suggesting future improvements through hybrid reasoning and
retrieval-augmented generation methods, particularly for quantitative analysis
and accurate legal interpretation.

### [30] [A Semi-supervised Scalable Unified Framework for E-commerce Query Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21049)
*Chunyuan Yuan,Chong Zhang,Zheng Fang,Ming Pang,Xue Jiang,Changping Peng,Zhangang Lin,Ching Law*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a Semi-supervised Scalable Unified Framework (SSUF) to improve query classification in e-commerce, tackling issues like limited query context and inefficiencies in task frameworks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Query classification, essential for e-commerce, suffers from challenges like short, context-lacking queries and reliance on users’ posterior click behavior, which creates inefficiencies and limits scalability.

Method: The paper proposes SSUF, which includes three enhanced modules: knowledge-enhanced (using world knowledge for better query representations), label-enhanced (leveraging label semantics and semi-supervised signals), and structure-enhanced (exploiting complex label relations). These modules are modular and adaptable to subtasks.

Result: SSUF was validated through offline and online experiments, showing significant improvement over existing state-of-the-art models for e-commerce query classification.

Conclusion: SSUF provides an effective, unified, and scalable framework for query classification in e-commerce, resolving prior limitations and boosting model performance.

Abstract: Query classification, including multiple subtasks such as intent and category
prediction, is vital to e-commerce applications. E-commerce queries are usually
short and lack context, and the information between labels cannot be used,
resulting in insufficient prior information for modeling. Most existing
industrial query classification methods rely on users' posterior click behavior
to construct training samples, resulting in a Matthew vicious cycle.
Furthermore, the subtasks of query classification lack a unified framework,
leading to low efficiency for algorithm optimization.
  In this paper, we propose a novel Semi-supervised Scalable Unified Framework
(SSUF), containing multiple enhanced modules to unify the query classification
tasks. The knowledge-enhanced module uses world knowledge to enhance query
representations and solve the problem of insufficient query information. The
label-enhanced module uses label semantics and semi-supervised signals to
reduce the dependence on posterior labels. The structure-enhanced module
enhances the label representation based on the complex label relations. Each
module is highly pluggable, and input features can be added or removed as
needed according to each subtask. We conduct extensive offline and online A/B
experiments, and the results show that SSUF significantly outperforms the
state-of-the-art models.

### [32] [MT2-CSD: A New Dataset and Multi-Semantic Knowledge Fusion Method for Conversational Stance Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21053)
*Fuqiang Niu,Genan Dai,Yisha Lu,Jiayu Liao,Xiang Li,Hu Huang,Bowen Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces MT2-CSD, the largest multi-target, multi-turn conversational stance detection dataset, along with a new model LLM-CRAN, which outperforms existing baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of datasets and models capable of handling conversational stance detection in multi-party discussions on social media.

Method: The authors developed MT2-CSD, a comprehensive annotated dataset, and proposed LLM-CRAN, a model leveraging Large Language Models for enhanced reasoning in conversational understanding.

Result: LLM-CRAN demonstrates superior performance and outperforms strong baseline models on the MT2-CSD dataset during extensive experimental testing.

Conclusion: This research advances the field of conversational stance detection by introducing both a groundbreaking dataset and a high-performing model, contributing valuable tools for social media opinion mining.

Abstract: In the realm of contemporary social media, automatic stance detection is
pivotal for opinion mining, as it synthesizes and examines user perspectives on
contentious topics to uncover prevailing trends and sentiments. Traditional
stance detection research often targets individual instances, thereby limiting
its capacity to model multi-party discussions typical in real social media
scenarios. This shortcoming largely stems from the scarcity of datasets that
authentically capture the dynamics of social media interactions, hindering
advancements in conversational stance detection. In this paper, we introduce
MT2-CSD, a comprehensive dataset for multi-target, multi-turn conversational
stance detection. To the best of our knowledge, MT2-CSD is the largest dataset
available for this purpose, comprising 24,457 annotated instances and
exhibiting the greatest conversational depth, thereby presenting new challenges
for stance detection. To address these challenges, we propose the Large
Language model enhanced Conversational Relational Attention Network (LLM-CRAN),
which exploits the reasoning capabilities of LLMs to improve conversational
understanding. We conduct extensive experiments to evaluate the efficacy of
LLM-CRAN on the MT2-CSD dataset. The experimental results indicate that
LLM-CRAN significantly outperforms strong baseline models in the task of
conversational stance detection.

### [33] [DALR: Dual-level Alignment Learning for Multimodal Sentence Representation Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21096)
*Kang He,Yuzhe Ding. Haining Wang,Fei Li,Chong Teng,Donghong Ji*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces DALR, focusing on fine-grained cross-modal alignment and ranking distillation to improve multimodal sentence representation, showing effectiveness in STS and TR tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the issues of cross-modal misalignment bias and intra-modal semantic divergence in multimodal sentence representation.

Method: The method involves dual-level alignment: (1) consistency learning for fine-grained cross-modal alignment and (2) ranking distillation integrated with global intra-modal alignment.

Result: Experiments show improved performance in semantic textual similarity (STS) and transfer tasks, outperforming existing baselines.

Conclusion: DALR effectively enhances multimodal sentence representation by addressing key alignment and representation challenges, offering a significant improvement over state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: Previous multimodal sentence representation learning methods have achieved
impressive performance. However, most approaches focus on aligning images and
text at a coarse level, facing two critical challenges:cross-modal misalignment
bias and intra-modal semantic divergence, which significantly degrade sentence
representation quality. To address these challenges, we propose DALR
(Dual-level Alignment Learning for Multimodal Sentence Representation). For
cross-modal alignment, we propose a consistency learning module that softens
negative samples and utilizes semantic similarity from an auxiliary task to
achieve fine-grained cross-modal alignment. Additionally, we contend that
sentence relationships go beyond binary positive-negative labels, exhibiting a
more intricate ranking structure. To better capture these relationships and
enhance representation quality, we integrate ranking distillation with global
intra-modal alignment learning. Comprehensive experiments on semantic textual
similarity (STS) and transfer (TR) tasks validate the effectiveness of our
approach, consistently demonstrating its superiority over state-of-the-art
baselines.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a framework called ComRAG which improves real-time Community Question Answering (CQA) by effectively integrating static knowledge and dynamic historical data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current CQA systems face challenges in real-time processing, underutilization of external knowledge, and lack of suitable memory mechanisms for historical interactions.

Method: ComRAG leverages retrieval-augmented generation to combine static knowledge with historical QA data using a centroid-based memory mechanism designed for retrieval, storage, and generation.

Result: Experimental evaluation demonstrates superior performance on three industrial CQA datasets, with improvements in vector similarity (up to 25.9%), reduced latency (8.7%-23.3%), and more efficient storage (chunk growth reduced from 20.23% to 2.06%).

Conclusion: ComRAG offers significant advancements in CQA by addressing existing limitations, showcasing its effectiveness across industrial datasets, and enhancing both efficiency and accuracy.

Abstract: Community Question Answering (CQA) platforms can be deemed as important
knowledge bases in community, but effectively leveraging historical
interactions and domain knowledge in real-time remains a challenge. Existing
methods often underutilize external knowledge, fail to incorporate dynamic
historical QA context, or lack memory mechanisms suited for industrial
deployment. We propose ComRAG, a retrieval-augmented generation framework for
real-time industrial CQA that integrates static knowledge with dynamic
historical QA pairs via a centroid-based memory mechanism designed for
retrieval, generation, and efficient storage. Evaluated on three industrial CQA
datasets, ComRAG consistently outperforms all baselines--achieving up to 25.9%
improvement in vector similarity, reducing latency by 8.7% to 23.3%, and
lowering chunk growth from 20.23% to 2.06% over iterations.

*Xiaoshuang Ji,Zhendong Zhao,Xiaojun Chen,Xin Zhao,Zeyao Liu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Progtuning is a new progressive learning fine-tuning technique for transformers that updates fewer parameters (~25% reduction) while maintaining competitive performance, effectively optimizing resource use.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing fine-tuning approaches, including parameter-efficient ones, inefficiently allocate computing resources by updating all blocks equally, ignoring their different contributions.

Method: Progtuning progressively reduces the number of updated transformer blocks based on their contribution, optimizing resource usage.

Result: Progtuning achieves a 25% reduction in updated parameters without compromising performance and adapts well to parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods.

Conclusion: Progtuning enhances efficiency and adaptability in fine-tuning for Transformer-based language models, making it ideal for various adaptation scenarios.

Abstract: Fine-tuning is a promising technique for leveraging Transformer-based
language models in downstream tasks. As model sizes continue to grow, updating
all model parameters becomes increasingly costly. Parameter-efficient
fine-tuning methods effectively address this issue by selectively updating a
small subset of parameters. However, fine-tuning and most existing
parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods require updating the same number of
parameters as the initial size, ignoring the unequal contribution across
Transformer blocks and leading to extremely inefficient allocation of computing
resources. In this paper, we propose Progtuning, the novel fine-tuning
framework combined with progressive learning for Transformer-based language
models. Specifically, Progtuning progressively reduces the number of updated
transformer blocks based on the contribution. Remarkably, Progtuning optimizes
resource allocation and reduces the number of updated parameters by
approximately 25\%, while still maintaining competitive performance. And it
also exhibits high adaptability with parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods,
demonstrating excellent performance across various adaptation scenarios.

*Viacheslav Meshchaninov,Egor Chimbulatov,Alexander Shabalin,Aleksandr Abramov,Dmitry Vetrov*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Cosmos is a novel text generation approach leveraging diffusion models in a compressed latent space, achieving comparable or superior quality to traditional models with faster inference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Autoregressive language models, dominant in modern text generation, face challenges like slow decoding and global coherence issues. Diffusion models provide benefits like parallel generation but struggle due to the high dimensionality of token-level representations. The paper addresses this gap.

Method: Cosmos uses a compressed, smooth latent space tailored for diffusion, learned through an autoencoder. The autoencoder ensures robust semantic grounding via token-level reconstruction and alignment with a pretrained language encoder, supporting effective augmentations and efficient compression.

Result: Cosmos achieves $8\times$ compression of text representations while retaining generation quality. By increasing latent sequence length, it surpasses autoregressive and other diffusion-based baselines in text generation tasks.

Conclusion: Cosmos provides a promising solution with faster inference (more than $2\times$ speedup) and comparable or superior quality across various tasks like storytelling, summarization, and detoxification, thus addressing key limitations of existing models.

Abstract: Autoregressive language models dominate modern text generation, yet their
sequential nature introduces fundamental limitations: decoding is slow, and
maintaining global coherence remains challenging. Diffusion models offer a
promising alternative by enabling parallel generation and flexible control;
however, their application to text generation is hindered by the high
dimensionality of token-level representations. We introduce Cosmos, a novel
approach to text generation that operates entirely in a compressed, smooth
latent space tailored specifically for diffusion. This space is learned using
an autoencoder trained simultaneously for token-level reconstruction and
alignment with frozen activations from a pretrained language encoder, providing
robust semantic grounding and enabling effective perturbation-based
augmentations. Empirically, we demonstrate that text representations can be
compressed by $8\times$ while maintaining generation quality comparable to
token-level diffusion models. Furthermore, increasing the latent sequence
length allows Cosmos to surpass both diffusion-based and autoregressive
baselines. We evaluate Cosmos on four diverse generative tasks including story
generation, question generation, summarization, and detoxification and compare
it with various generative paradigms. Cosmos achieves comparable or superior
generation quality while offering more than $2\times$ faster inference.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper presents a transformer-based model for turn-taking prediction in spoken dialogue systems. It incorporates textual prompts for dynamic control and achieves improved accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation was to enhance spoken dialogue systems by enabling dynamic and explicit control of turn-taking timing using simple textual prompts like "faster" or "calmer," making them adaptable to varied conversational partners and contexts.

Method: The method involves extending a transformer-based voice activity projection model by embedding textual prompts into both channel-wise transformers and a cross-channel transformer. Additionally, synthetic prompt data was generated with a large language model due to a lack of such data in existing datasets.

Result: The results showed improved prediction accuracy and the model successfully varied turn-taking behavior based on textual prompts.

Conclusion: The study concluded that adding textual prompts to transformer-based turn-taking models is a feasible and effective way to improve conversational adaptability and accuracy.

Abstract: Turn-taking prediction models are essential components in spoken dialogue
systems and conversational robots. Recent approaches leverage transformer-based
architectures to predict speech activity continuously and in real-time. In this
study, we propose a novel model that enables turn-taking prediction to be
dynamically controlled via textual prompts. This approach allows intuitive and
explicit control through instructions such as "faster" or "calmer" adapting
dynamically to conversational partners and contexts. The proposed model builds
upon a transformer-based voice activity projection (VAP) model, incorporating
textual prompt embeddings into both channel-wise transformers and a
cross-channel transformer. We evaluated the feasibility of our approach using
over 950 hours of human-human spoken dialogue data. Since textual prompt data
for the proposed approach was not available in existing datasets, we utilized a
large language model (LLM) to generate synthetic prompt sentences. Experimental
results demonstrated that the proposed model improved prediction accuracy and
effectively varied turn-taking timing behaviors according to the textual
prompts.

*Yongchan Chun,Minhyuk Kim,Dongjun Kim,Chanjun Park,Heuiseok Lim*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper presents a syntactic retrieval-based prompting strategy for automatic term extraction (ATE) using large language models (LLMs) in few-shot settings, improving performance across domains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing approaches to automatic term extraction (ATE) lack exploration of large language models (LLMs), and leveraging syntactic cues could yield more reliable term boundary identification.

Method: The proposed method employs a syntactic retrieval-based prompting strategy in few-shot settings, focusing on syntactic rather than semantic similarity to select demonstrations for guiding term boundary detection.

Result: The strategy improved F1-scores across three specialized ATE benchmarks, demonstrating the efficacy of syntactic cues for reliable term extraction.

Conclusion: Syntactic retrieval offers significant advantages in adapting LLMs to terminology-extraction tasks, emphasizing the need for syntactic over semantic alignment in few-shot scenarios.

Abstract: Automatic Term Extraction (ATE) identifies domain-specific expressions that
are crucial for downstream tasks such as machine translation and information
retrieval. Although large language models (LLMs) have significantly advanced
various NLP tasks, their potential for ATE has scarcely been examined. We
propose a retrieval-based prompting strategy that, in the few-shot setting,
selects demonstrations according to \emph{syntactic} rather than semantic
similarity. This syntactic retrieval method is domain-agnostic and provides
more reliable guidance for capturing term boundaries. We evaluate the approach
in both in-domain and cross-domain settings, analyzing how lexical overlap
between the query sentence and its retrieved examples affects performance.
Experiments on three specialized ATE benchmarks show that syntactic retrieval
improves F1-score. These findings highlight the importance of syntactic cues
when adapting LLMs to terminology-extraction tasks.

TL;DR: This study introduces Agent-RewardBench, a benchmark for evaluating reward modeling in multimodal large language models (MLLMs), aimed at improving agents' real-world task performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of multimodal agents in self-correction and generalization due to a lack of external feedback and provide clarity on selecting reward models.

Method: The authors develop Agent-RewardBench with features including multidimensional real-world scenario evaluation, step-level reward assessment, and data quality control from diverse model sampling and manual validation.

Result: Experiments reveal state-of-the-art MLLMs generally perform poorly on the benchmark, emphasizing the need for specialized training in reward modeling for agents.

Conclusion: Agent-RewardBench provides a critical step toward improving multimodal agents by offering a structured evaluation framework for reward modeling in real-world tasks, but existing models require significant refinement.

Abstract: As Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) advance, multimodal agents show
promise in real-world tasks like web navigation and embodied intelligence.
However, due to limitations in a lack of external feedback, these agents
struggle with self-correction and generalization. A promising approach is to
use reward models as external feedback, but there is no clear on how to select
reward models for agents. Thus, there is an urgent need to build a reward bench
targeted at agents. To address these challenges, we propose Agent-RewardBench,
a benchmark designed to evaluate reward modeling ability in MLLMs. The
benchmark is characterized by three key features: (1) Multiple dimensions and
real-world agent scenarios evaluation. It covers perception, planning, and
safety with 7 scenarios; (2) Step-level reward evaluation. It allows for the
assessment of agent capabilities at the individual steps of a task, providing a
more granular view of performance during the planning process; and (3)
Appropriately difficulty and high-quality. We carefully sample from 10 diverse
models, difficulty control to maintain task challenges, and manual verification
to ensure the integrity of the data. Experiments demonstrate that even
state-of-the-art multimodal models show limited performance, highlighting the
need for specialized training in agent reward modeling. Code is available at

*Andrea McGlinchey,Peter J Barclay*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores the capacity of statistical classifiers to detect fake text generated by large language models and finds that detection is viable even as models grow larger.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To determine whether the ever-expanding size and sophistication of Large Language Models will inevitably outpace detection methods for fake text.

Method: The study compared the performance of statistical classifiers against fake text generated by language models, specifically testing for patterns in the style of classical detective fiction.

Result: Findings showed that while Gemini improved in generating deceptive text across versions, GPT did not exhibit such improvements. Detection techniques still performed effectively alongside model upgrades.

Conclusion: Detection of artificially generated text is feasible even for advanced and large-scale models, though architectural shifts may enhance their deceptive abilities further.

Abstract: Large language models can produce convincing "fake text" in domains such as
academic writing, product reviews, and political news. Many approaches have
been investigated for the detection of artificially generated text. While this
may seem to presage an endless "arms race", we note that newer LLMs use ever
more parameters, training data, and energy, while relatively simple classifiers
demonstrate a good level of detection accuracy with modest resources. To
approach the question of whether the models' ability to beat the detectors may
therefore reach a plateau, we examine the ability of statistical classifiers to
identify "fake text" in the style of classical detective fiction. Over a 0.5
version increase, we found that Gemini showed an increased ability to generate
deceptive text, while GPT did not. This suggests that reliable detection of
fake text may remain feasible even for ever-larger models, though new model
architectures may improve their deceptiveness

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces Double-Checker, a framework that improves reasoning in large language models through self-critique and iterative solution refinement, showing significant performance gains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the limitations of large language models in generating informative critiques and refining solutions, aiming to enhance their reasoning capabilities.

Method: The authors fine-tune LLMs using 1,730 self-critical instances to empower them with iterative self-critique and refinement during inference.

Result: Double-Checker showed a substantial performance improvement, notably increasing pass@1 accuracy on AIME benchmarks from 4.4% to 18.2%.

Conclusion: Iterative self-critique marks a promising approach for creating more trustworthy and effective reasoning in large language models.

Abstract: While slow-thinking large language models (LLMs) exhibit reflection-like
reasoning, commonly referred to as the "aha moment:, their ability to generate
informative critiques and refine prior solutions remains limited. In this
paper, we introduce Double-Checker, a principled framework designed to enhance
the reasoning capabilities of slow-thinking LLMs by fostering explicit
self-critique and iterative refinement of their previous solutions. By
fine-tuning on our curated 1,730 self-critical instances, Double-Checker
empowers long-CoT LLMs to iteratively critique and refine their outputs during
inference until they evaluate their solutions as correct under self-generated
critiques. We validate the efficacy of Double-Checker across a comprehensive
suite of reasoning benchmarks, demonstrating that iterative self-critique
significantly enhances the reasoning capabilities of long-CoT LLMs. Notably,
our Double-Checker increases the pass@1 performance on challenging AIME
benchmarks from 4.4% to 18.2% compared to the original long-CoT LLMs. These
results highlight a promising direction for developing more trustworthy and
effective LLMs capable of structured self-critique.

*Istabrak Abbes,Gabriele Prato,Quentin Fournier,Fernando Rodriguez,Alaa Boukhary,Adam Elwood,Sarath Chandar*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes a method to detect if a query is grounded in provided context before generating an answer with large language models (LLMs). It uses lightweight models like RoBERTa to save time and compute resources while maintaining accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the issue of LLMs speculating or relying on internal knowledge when the provided context lacks sufficient information, thereby improving factual consistency and resource efficiency.

Method: Lightweight, task-specific encoder models such as RoBERTa and NomicBERT are fine-tuned on curated datasets to detect the groundedness of queries efficiently.

Result: Fine-tuned lightweight models achieve accuracy comparable to large state-of-the-art models like Llama3 and GPT4o in groundedness detection, while significantly reducing inference latency.

Conclusion: Using lightweight models for grounded query detection is an effective strategy to reduce resource consumption and maintain high accuracy, enhancing the reliability of LLMs in knowledge-grounded tasks.

Abstract: Augmenting large language models (LLMs) with external context significantly
improves their performance in natural language processing (NLP) tasks. However,
LLMs struggle to answer queries reliably when the provided context lacks
information, often resorting to ungrounded speculation or internal knowledge.
Groundedness - generating responses strictly supported by the context - is
essential for ensuring factual consistency and trustworthiness. This study
focuses on detecting whether a given query is grounded in a document provided
in context before the costly answer generation by LLMs. Such a detection
mechanism can significantly reduce both inference time and resource
consumption. We show that lightweight, task specific encoder models such as
RoBERTa and NomicBERT, fine-tuned on curated datasets, can achieve accuracy
comparable to state-of-the-art LLMs, such as Llama3 8B and GPT4o, in
groundedness detection while reducing inference latency by orders of magnitude.

### [43] [Detecting Referring Expressions in Visually Grounded Dialogue with Autoregressive Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21294)
*Bram Willemsen,Gabriel Skantze*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper uses a text-only autoregressive language model to identify referring expressions in visually grounded dialogues, showing its effectiveness while discussing the limitations of unimodal approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to explore whether linguistic context alone can identify visually grounded mentions in dialogues, emphasizing the role of text-only models in referring expression extraction.

Method: The researchers modified a pretrained large language model for next-token prediction to annotate mention spans in text from dialogues, employing small datasets and parameter-efficient fine-tuning.

Result: The findings reveal that text-only approaches can effectively detect referring expressions even with moderate-sized LLMs and limited datasets, showing the importance of linguistic context.

Conclusion: While text-only approaches are effective, referring expression detection is inherently multimodal; unimodal strategies face fundamental limitations, emphasizing the need for multimodal solutions in future research.

Abstract: In this paper, we explore the use of a text-only, autoregressive language
modeling approach for the extraction of referring expressions from visually
grounded dialogue. More specifically, the aim is to investigate the extent to
which the linguistic context alone can inform the detection of mentions that
have a (visually perceivable) referent in the visual context of the
conversation. To this end, we adapt a pretrained large language model (LLM) to
perform a relatively course-grained annotation of mention spans in unfolding
conversations by demarcating mention span boundaries in text via next-token
prediction. Our findings indicate that even when using a moderately sized LLM,
relatively small datasets, and parameter-efficient fine-tuning, a text-only
approach can be effective, highlighting the relative importance of the
linguistic context for this task. Nevertheless, we argue that the task
represents an inherently multimodal problem and discuss limitations fundamental
to unimodal approaches.

### [44] [Structuralist Approach to AI Literary Criticism: Leveraging Greimas Semiotic Square for Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21360)
*Fangzhou Dong,Yifan Zeng,Yingpeng Sang,Hong Shen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces GLASS, a Greimas-based framework, to enhance LLMs' ability to perform advanced literary criticism using structured narrative analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the inability of LLMs to carry out professional-level literary criticism, particularly for narratives with complex meanings.

Method: Developed GLASS, grounded on Greimas Semiotic Square, paired with a new dataset and quantitative metrics to evaluate GSS-based literary criticism by LLMs.

Result: GLASS showed high performance compared to expert criticism and successfully analyzed 39 classic works, filling research gaps.

Conclusion: GLASS is a promising AI tool for literary research and education, providing both original critical insights and understanding of cognitive mechanisms in narrative engagement.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel in understanding and generating text but
struggle with providing professional literary criticism for works with profound
thoughts and complex narratives. This paper proposes GLASS (Greimas Literary
Analysis via Semiotic Square), a structured analytical framework based on
Greimas Semiotic Square (GSS), to enhance LLMs' ability to conduct in-depth
literary analysis. GLASS facilitates the rapid dissection of narrative
structures and deep meanings in narrative works. We propose the first dataset
for GSS-based literary criticism, featuring detailed analyses of 48 works. Then
we propose quantitative metrics for GSS-based literary criticism using the
LLM-as-a-judge paradigm. Our framework's results, compared with expert
criticism across multiple works and LLMs, show high performance. Finally, we
applied GLASS to 39 classic works, producing original and high-quality analyses
that address existing research gaps. This research provides an AI-based tool
for literary research and education, offering insights into the cognitive
mechanisms underlying literary engagement.

### [45] [Leveraging LLM-Assisted Query Understanding for Live Retrieval-Augmented Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21384)
*Guanting Dong,Xiaoxi Li,Yuyao Zhang,Mengjie Deng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces Omni-RAG, a framework aimed at improving the robustness and effectiveness of retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems when processing complex and noisy queries in live settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges RAG systems face in real-world applications, including processing noisy, ambiguous, and multi-intent user queries.

Method: Omni-RAG preprocesses queries through three modules: (1) deep query understanding and decomposition using LLMs, (2) intent-aware knowledge retrieval, and (3) reranking and generation combining refined document selection and LLMs.

Result: Omni-RAG enables RAG systems to effectively handle real-world applications, bridging the gap between existing systems and demands like those in the SIGIR 2025 LiveRAG Challenge.

Conclusion: The framework enhances the robustness of RAG systems in open-domain settings by addressing the limitations in handling noisy and complex queries.

Abstract: Real-world live retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems face significant
challenges when processing user queries that are often noisy, ambiguous, and
contain multiple intents. While RAG enhances large language models (LLMs) with
external knowledge, current systems typically struggle with such complex
inputs, as they are often trained or evaluated on cleaner data. This paper
introduces Omni-RAG, a novel framework designed to improve the robustness and
effectiveness of RAG systems in live, open-domain settings. Omni-RAG employs
LLM-assisted query understanding to preprocess user inputs through three key
modules: (1) Deep Query Understanding and Decomposition, which utilizes LLMs
with tailored prompts to denoise queries (e.g., correcting spelling errors) and
decompose multi-intent queries into structured sub-queries; (2) Intent-Aware
Knowledge Retrieval, which performs retrieval for each sub-query from a corpus
(i.e., FineWeb using OpenSearch) and aggregates the results; and (3) Reranking
and Generation, where a reranker (i.e., BGE) refines document selection before
a final response is generated by an LLM (i.e., Falcon-10B) using a
chain-of-thought prompt. Omni-RAG aims to bridge the gap between current RAG
capabilities and the demands of real-world applications, such as those
highlighted by the SIGIR 2025 LiveRAG Challenge, by robustly handling complex
and noisy queries.

### [46] [Domain Knowledge-Enhanced LLMs for Fraud and Concept Drift Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21443)
*Ali Şenol,Garima Agrawal,Huan Liu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes a DK-Enhanced LLM framework to detect deceptive conversations and semantic shifts using domain knowledge and drift detection units, achieving high accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current challenges in detecting deceptive conversations arise due to evolving language patterns and Concept Drift (CD), making malicious intent difficult to identify.

Method: The paper introduces a framework combining pretrained LLMs with domain knowledge components, including DK-LLM modules for deception detection and fraud drift classification as well as an OCDD unit for semantic drift detection.

Result: The framework achieved 98% classification accuracy on a multiturn dialogue dataset, SEConvo, and demonstrated significant improvement over zero-shot baselines.

Conclusion: Integrating domain knowledge into LLM-based systems enhances fraud detection, drift classification, interpretability, and robustness in risk-sensitive scenarios.

Abstract: Detecting deceptive conversations on dynamic platforms is increasingly
difficult due to evolving language patterns and Concept Drift (CD)-i.e.,
semantic or topical shifts that alter the context or intent of interactions
over time. These shifts can obscure malicious intent or mimic normal dialogue,
making accurate classification challenging. While Large Language Models (LLMs)
show strong performance in natural language tasks, they often struggle with
contextual ambiguity and hallucinations in risk-sensitive scenarios. To address
these challenges, we present a Domain Knowledge (DK)-Enhanced LLM framework
that integrates pretrained LLMs with structured, task-specific insights to
perform fraud and concept drift detection. The proposed architecture consists
of three main components: (1) a DK-LLM module to detect fake or deceptive
conversations; (2) a drift detection unit (OCDD) to determine whether a
semantic shift has occurred; and (3) a second DK-LLM module to classify the
drift as either benign or fraudulent. We first validate the value of domain
knowledge using a fake review dataset and then apply our full framework to
SEConvo, a multiturn dialogue dataset that includes various types of fraud and
spam attacks. Results show that our system detects fake conversations with high
accuracy and effectively classifies the nature of drift. Guided by structured
prompts, the LLaMA-based implementation achieves 98% classification accuracy.
Comparative studies against zero-shot baselines demonstrate that incorporating
domain knowledge and drift awareness significantly improves performance,
interpretability, and robustness in high-stakes NLP applications.

### [47] [Text2Cypher Across Languages: Evaluating Foundational Models Beyond English](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21445)
*Makbule Gulcin Ozsoy,William Tai*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper evaluates the performance of foundational LLMs on the Text2Cypher task across English, Spanish, and Turkish.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper is motivated by the dominance of English-focused Text2Cypher evaluation and the lack of testing in other languages.

Method: Researchers created a multilingual test set by translating English questions into Spanish and Turkish and evaluated LLMs using standardized prompts and metrics.

Result: Performance patterns showed accuracy dropping across languages—from English to Spanish to Turkish. Prompt translation had little impact.

Conclusion: The study emphasizes the need for multilingual inclusivity in query generation and suggests future research in schema localization and fine-tuning for various languages.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models have enabled natural language
interfaces that translate user questions into database queries, such as
Text2SQL, Text2SPARQL, and Text2Cypher. While these interfaces enhance database
accessibility, most research today focuses solely on English, with limited
evaluation in other languages. This paper investigates the performance of
foundational LLMs on the Text2Cypher task across multiple languages. We create
and release a multilingual test set by translating English questions into
Spanish and Turkish while preserving the original Cypher queries, enabling fair
cross-lingual comparison. We evaluate multiple foundational models using
standardized prompts and metrics. Our results show a consistent performance
pattern: highest on English, then Spanish, and lowest on Turkish. We attribute
this to differences in training data availability and linguistic
characteristics. Additionally, we explore the impact of translating task
prompts into Spanish and Turkish. Results show little to no change in
evaluation metrics, suggesting prompt translation has minor impact. Our
findings highlight the need for more inclusive evaluation and development in
multilingual query generation. Future work includes schema localization and
fine-tuning across diverse languages.

### [48] [Aligning Spoken Dialogue Models from User Interactions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21463)
*Anne Wu,Laurent Mazaré,Neil Zeghidour,Alexandre Défossez*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces a new framework to align preferences in spoken dialogue models using a dataset of annotated speech interactions for improved real-time conversational performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current preference learning methods are inadequate for the complexities of real-time speech interactions, which involve unique dynamics like interruptions and lack of turn segmentation.

Method: The authors curated a dataset of over 150,000 annotated preference pairs from multi-turn speech conversations and used offline alignment techniques to fine-tune a speech-to-speech dialogue model.

Result: Their approach leads to improved speech dialogue models that generate more factual, safer, and contextually aligned responses, with benefits extending to multi-turn conversations.

Conclusion: Balancing multiple dynamics is critical for advancing natural real-time speech dialogue systems, as demonstrated by the improvements highlighted in the study.

Abstract: We propose a novel preference alignment framework for improving spoken
dialogue models on real-time conversations from user interactions. Current
preference learning methods primarily focus on text-based language models, and
are not directly suited to the complexities of real-time speech interactions,
with richer dynamics (e.g. interruption, interjection) and no explicit
segmentation between speaker turns.We create a large-scale dataset of more than
150,000 preference pairs from raw multi-turn speech conversations, annotated
with AI feedback, to cover preferences over both linguistic content and
temporal context variations. We leverage offline alignment methods to finetune
a full-duplex autoregressive speech-to-speech model. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that feedback on generic conversations can be consistently
effective in improving spoken dialogue models to produce more factual, safer
and more contextually aligned interactions. We deploy the finetuned model and
conduct holistic human evaluations to assess the impact beyond single-turn
conversations. Our findings shed light on the importance of a well-calibrated
balance among various dynamics, crucial for natural real-time speech dialogue
systems.

### [49] [TopK Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21468)
*Ryosuke Takahashi,Tatsuro Inaba,Kentaro Inui,Benjamin Heinzerling*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces TopK activation layers into transformer-based language models to replace post-hoc sparse autoencoders, addressing issues of feature instability and training-related limitations, while improving interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address the shortcomings of post-hoc sparse autoencoders, which lack interpretability and feature stability, making it harder to analyze and trace language models' representation of concepts, especially across training checkpoints.

Method: The paper proposes a modification to transformer architectures by integrating a TopK activation function at specific layers, eliminating the need for post-hoc training while preserving interpretability similar to SAEs.

Result: TopK LMs provide interpretable sparse representations, maintain computational efficiency and performance, and enable robust neuron analysis across checkpoints and layers.

Conclusion: TopK LMs are positioned as reliable, interpretable tools for research on how language models learn and represent concepts, with potential to advance the field of model interpretability and controllability.

Abstract: Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) have become an important tool for analyzing and
interpreting the activation space of transformer-based language models (LMs).
However, SAEs suffer several shortcomings that diminish their utility and
internal validity. Since SAEs are trained post-hoc, it is unclear if the
failure to discover a particular concept is a failure on the SAE's side or due
to the underlying LM not representing this concept. This problem is exacerbated
by training conditions and architecture choices affecting which features an SAE
learns. When tracing how LMs learn concepts during training, the lack of
feature stability also makes it difficult to compare SAEs features across
different checkpoints. To address these limitations, we introduce a
modification to the transformer architecture that incorporates a TopK
activation function at chosen layers, making the model's hidden states
equivalent to the latent features of a TopK SAE. This approach eliminates the
need for post-hoc training while providing interpretability comparable to SAEs.
The resulting TopK LMs offer a favorable trade-off between model size,
computational efficiency, and interpretability. Despite this simple
architectural change, TopK LMs maintain their original capabilities while
providing robust interpretability benefits. Our experiments demonstrate that
the sparse representations learned by TopK LMs enable successful steering
through targeted neuron interventions and facilitate detailed analysis of
neuron formation processes across checkpoints and layers. These features make
TopK LMs stable and reliable tools for understanding how language models learn
and represent concepts, which we believe will significantly advance future
research on model interpretability and controllability.

### [50] [Bridging Offline and Online Reinforcement Learning for LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21495)
*Jack Lanchantin,Angelica Chen,Janice Lan,Xian Li,Swarnadeep Saha,Tianlu Wang,Jing Xu,Ping Yu,Weizhe Yuan,Jason E Weston,Sainbayar Sukhbaatar,Ilia Kulikov*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper evaluates reinforcement learning methods for fine-tuning large language models under different training regimes and finds that online and semi-online methods perform comparably and outperform offline methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how reinforcement learning can be used to effectively fine-tune large language models for both verifiable (e.g., math) and non-verifiable (e.g., instruction following) tasks across different training regimes.

Method: The authors conduct experiments comparing online, semi-online, and offline learning approaches like Direct Preference Optimization and Group Reward Policy Optimization, including the impact of multi-tasking and analyzing training dynamics.

Result: Online and semi-online methods showed similar performance and convergence, both significantly exceeding offline methods. Multi-tasking with verifiable and non-verifiable tasks further improved overall performance.

Conclusion: Reinforcement learning approaches, particularly online and semi-online methods, are effective for fine-tuning language models, and multi-tasking strategies enhance performance across various task types.

Abstract: We investigate the effectiveness of reinforcement learning methods for
finetuning large language models when transitioning from offline to semi-online
to fully online regimes for both verifiable and non-verifiable tasks. Our
experiments cover training on verifiable math as well as non-verifiable
instruction following with a set of benchmark evaluations for both. Across
these settings, we extensively compare online and semi-online Direct Preference
Optimization and Group Reward Policy Optimization objectives, and surprisingly
find similar performance and convergence between these variants, which all
strongly outperform offline methods. We provide a detailed analysis of the
training dynamics and hyperparameter selection strategies to achieve optimal
results. Finally, we show that multi-tasking with verifiable and non-verifiable
rewards jointly yields improved performance across both task types.

### [51] [Enhancing User Engagement in Socially-Driven Dialogue through Interactive LLM Alignments](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21497)
*Jiashuo Wang,Kaitao Song,Chunpu Xu,Changhe Song,Yang Xiao,Dongsheng Li,Lili Qiu,Wenjie Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes using a user simulator and Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS)-based interactions to optimize interactive LLMs for enhancing user engagement in socially-driven dialogues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improving user engagement in socially-driven dialogues as prior approaches optimizing knowledge or dialogue acts don't necessarily result in engaging interactions.

Method: Interactive LLMs are trained using user engagement signals derived from future dialogue reactions combined with a user simulator and a Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) system. A dataset of high-quality and low-quality experiences is collected and used for direct preference optimization (DPO).

Result: Experiments on emotional support and persuasion dialogues show effectiveness in enhancing user engagement using the proposed method.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates that leveraging future reaction signals and direct preference optimization of interactive LLMs can significantly improve their ability to create engaging dialogues.

Abstract: Enhancing user engagement through interactions plays an essential role in
socially-driven dialogues. While prior works have optimized models to reason
over relevant knowledge or plan a dialogue act flow, the relationship between
user engagement and knowledge or dialogue acts is subtle and does not guarantee
user engagement in socially-driven dialogues. To this end, we enable
interactive LLMs to learn user engagement by leveraging signals from the future
development of conversations. Specifically, we adopt a more direct and relevant
indicator of user engagement, i.e., the user's reaction related to dialogue
intention after the interaction, as a reward to align interactive LLMs. To
achieve this, we develop a user simulator to interact with target interactive
LLMs and explore interactions between the user and the interactive LLM system
via \textit{i$\times$MCTS} (\textit{M}onte \textit{C}arlo \textit{T}ree
\textit{S}earch for \textit{i}nteraction). In this way, we collect a dataset
containing pairs of higher and lower-quality experiences using
\textit{i$\times$MCTS}, and align interactive LLMs for high-level user
engagement by direct preference optimization (DPO) accordingly. Experiments
conducted on two socially-driven dialogue scenarios (emotional support
conversations and persuasion for good) demonstrate that our method effectively
enhances user engagement in interactive LLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the lack of dedicated benchmarks for Slovak NLU models, enabling their systematic evaluation and fostering research in this area.

Method: The authors compiled original Slovak datasets and translated English NLU resources, creating nine diverse tasks. They evaluated various Slovak-specific, multilingual, and English pre-trained language models.

Result: The introduction of skLEP provides a comprehensive evaluation framework, an open-source toolkit, and establishes a leaderboard for future research.

Conclusion: The paper contributes by presenting an accessible benchmark that promises to enhance reproducibility and catalyze research progress in Slovak natural language understanding.

Abstract: In this work, we introduce skLEP, the first comprehensive benchmark
specifically designed for evaluating Slovak natural language understanding
(NLU) models. We have compiled skLEP to encompass nine diverse tasks that span
token-level, sentence-pair, and document-level challenges, thereby offering a
thorough assessment of model capabilities. To create this benchmark, we curated
new, original datasets tailored for Slovak and meticulously translated
established English NLU resources. Within this paper, we also present the first
systematic and extensive evaluation of a wide array of Slovak-specific,
multilingual, and English pre-trained language models using the skLEP tasks.
Finally, we also release the complete benchmark data, an open-source toolkit
facilitating both fine-tuning and evaluation of models, and a public
leaderboard at https://github.com/slovak-nlp/sklep in the hopes of fostering
reproducibility and drive future research in Slovak NLU.

### [53] [Potemkin Understanding in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21521)
*Marina Mancoridis,Bec Weeks,Keyon Vafa,Sendhil Mullainathan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper examines the validity of using benchmark tests to assess large language models (LLMs), finding that these benchmarks often fail to reflect true understanding, as LLMs misunderstand concepts differently than humans.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address whether benchmarks used to evaluate LLMs accurately reflect their capabilities, especially when these benchmarks are originally designed for human evaluation.

Method: A formal framework is introduced to explore LLM understanding. Two procedures are proposed: one uses a specially designed benchmark in various domains, and another provides a general estimate of errors related to "potemkin understanding."

Result: The study finds that "potemkin understanding" is common across many models, tasks, and domains, indicating that LLMs frequently fail to genuinely understand tested concepts.

Conclusion: LLMs often exhibit internal incoherence in concept representation, raising questions about the validity of benchmarks as a measure of true understanding.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are regularly evaluated using benchmark
datasets. But what justifies making inferences about an LLM's capabilities
based on its answers to a curated set of questions? This paper first introduces
a formal framework to address this question. The key is to note that the
benchmarks used to test LLMs -- such as AP exams -- are also those used to test
people. However, this raises an implication: these benchmarks are only valid
tests if LLMs misunderstand concepts in ways that mirror human
misunderstandings. Otherwise, success on benchmarks only demonstrates potemkin
understanding: the illusion of understanding driven by answers irreconcilable
with how any human would interpret a concept. We present two procedures for
quantifying the existence of potemkins: one using a specially designed
benchmark in three domains, the other using a general procedure that provides a
lower-bound on their prevalence. We find that potemkins are ubiquitous across
models, tasks, and domains. We also find that these failures reflect not just
incorrect understanding, but deeper internal incoherence in concept
representations.

*Akshay Paruchuri,Maryam Aziz,Rohit Vartak,Ayman Ali,Best Uchehara,Xin Liu,Ishan Chatterjee,Monica Agrawal*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces HealthChat-11K, a dataset of 11K healthcare-related chatbot conversations, systematically analyzing user interactions across 21 specialties to highlight risks and areas for improving LLM-based healthcare tools.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: With the rise of individuals using LLM-based chatbots for healthcare advice, understanding the nature of these interactions and their associated risks is essential to improving these tools and ensuring reliable healthcare support.

Method: The authors curated HealthChat-11K by filtering large conversational AI datasets to collect user interactions, followed by a systematic analysis based on a clinician-driven taxonomy across multiple health specialties.

Result: Insights were derived about the ways users seek healthcare information, including patterns of incomplete context, emotional behaviors, and interactions that could trigger incorrect or sycophantic responses from the LLM.

Conclusion: LLMs used in healthcare chatbots require advancements to address shortcomings in context comprehension, emotional response handling, and susceptibility to user-induced sycophantic behavior, with curated data playing a key role in improvements.

Abstract: People are increasingly seeking healthcare information from large language
models (LLMs) via interactive chatbots, yet the nature and inherent risks of
these conversations remain largely unexplored. In this paper, we filter
large-scale conversational AI datasets to achieve HealthChat-11K, a curated
dataset of 11K real-world conversations composed of 25K user messages. We use
HealthChat-11K and a clinician-driven taxonomy for how users interact with LLMs
when seeking healthcare information in order to systematically study user
interactions across 21 distinct health specialties. Our analysis reveals
insights into the nature of how and why users seek health information, such as
common interactions, instances of incomplete context, affective behaviors, and
interactions (e.g., leading questions) that can induce sycophancy, underscoring
the need for improvements in the healthcare support capabilities of LLMs
deployed as conversational AI. Code and artifacts to retrieve our analyses and

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces the DELT paradigm to improve language model training by optimizing data organization, achieving improved performance without increasing data scale or model size.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current research has focused on data efficiency in language model training, but data efficacy—optimizing the organization of training data—has remained underexplored.

Method: The authors propose the DELT paradigm, which incorporates Data Scoring, Data Selection, and Data Ordering. They introduce Learnability-Quality Scoring (LQS) to evaluate data from a gradient consistency perspective and Folding Ordering (FO) to mitigate model forgetting and data distribution biases.

Result: Experiments demonstrate that DELT improves LM performance, with the combination of LQS and FO achieving the most significant results. The approach does not require increasing the data scale or model size.

Conclusion: Data efficacy is a complementary and promising foundation for enhancing language model training, capable of being combined with data efficiency techniques.

Abstract: Data is fundamental to the training of language models (LM). Recent research
has been dedicated to data efficiency, which aims to maximize performance by
selecting a minimal or optimal subset of training data. Techniques such as data
filtering, sampling, and selection play a crucial role in this area. To
complement it, we define Data Efficacy, which focuses on maximizing performance
by optimizing the organization of training data and remains relatively
underexplored. This work introduces a general paradigm, DELT, for considering
data efficacy in LM training, which highlights the significance of training
data organization. DELT comprises three components: Data Scoring, Data
Selection, and Data Ordering. Among these components, we design
Learnability-Quality Scoring (LQS), as a new instance of Data Scoring, which
considers both the learnability and quality of each data sample from the
gradient consistency perspective. We also devise Folding Ordering (FO), as a
novel instance of Data Ordering, which addresses issues such as model
forgetting and data distribution bias. Comprehensive experiments validate the
data efficacy in LM training, which demonstrates the following: Firstly,
various instances of the proposed DELT enhance LM performance to varying
degrees without increasing the data scale and model size. Secondly, among these
instances, the combination of our proposed LQS for data scoring and Folding for
data ordering achieves the most significant improvement. Lastly, data efficacy
can be achieved together with data efficiency by applying data selection.
Therefore, we believe that data efficacy is a promising foundational area in LM
training.

### [56] [OTSurv: A Novel Multiple Instance Learning Framework for Survival Prediction with Heterogeneity-aware Optimal Transport](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20741)
*Qin Ren,Yifan Wang,Ruogu Fang,Haibin Ling,Chenyu You*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces OTSurv, a novel approach to survival prediction using whole slide images (WSIs) by leveraging optimal transport (OT) within a multiple instance learning (MIL) framework to address global and local pathological heterogeneity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for survival prediction via WSIs fail to adequately manage pathological heterogeneity, both in global morphological distributions and local prediction uncertainties, necessitating an innovative approach.

Method: The paper proposes OTSurv, which uses an OT perspective with two additional constraints: (1) a global long-tail constraint to balance morphological distribution and avoid excessive uniformity or mode collapse, and (2) a local uncertainty-aware constraint to emphasize high-confidence patches while filtering noise.

Result: OTSurv achieves state-of-the-art performance, showing a 3.6% improvement in average C-index across six benchmarks and statistically significant results in log-rank tests, while maintaining high interpretability.

Conclusion: OTSurv significantly advances survival prediction in digital pathology by effectively incorporating global and local heterogeneity, offering robust performance, statistical reliability, and interpretability.

Abstract: Survival prediction using whole slide images (WSIs) can be formulated as a
multiple instance learning (MIL) problem. However, existing MIL methods often
fail to explicitly capture pathological heterogeneity within WSIs, both
globally -- through long-tailed morphological distributions, and locally
through -- tile-level prediction uncertainty. Optimal transport (OT) provides a
principled way of modeling such heterogeneity by incorporating marginal
distribution constraints. Building on this insight, we propose OTSurv, a novel
MIL framework from an optimal transport perspective. Specifically, OTSurv
formulates survival predictions as a heterogeneity-aware OT problem with two
constraints: (1) global long-tail constraint that models prior morphological
distributions to avert both mode collapse and excessive uniformity by
regulating transport mass allocation, and (2) local uncertainty-aware
constraint that prioritizes high-confidence patches while suppressing noise by
progressively raising the total transport mass. We then recast the initial OT
problem, augmented by these constraints, into an unbalanced OT formulation that
can be solved with an efficient, hardware-friendly matrix scaling algorithm.
Empirically, OTSurv sets new state-of-the-art results across six popular
benchmarks, achieving an absolute 3.6% improvement in average C-index. In
addition, OTSurv achieves statistical significance in log-rank tests and offers
high interpretability, making it a powerful tool for survival prediction in
digital pathology. Our codes are available at

### [57] [StereoDiff: Stereo-Diffusion Synergy for Video Depth Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20756)
*Haodong Li,Chen Wang,Jiahui Lei,Kostas Daniilidis,Lingjie Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces StereoDiff, a two-stage video depth estimator that combines stereo matching for static regions and video depth diffusion for dynamic regions, achieving state-of-the-art (SoTA) video depth estimation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the limitations of existing video depth estimation models which follow image-based paradigms but fail to account for the differing temporal consistency requirements of dynamic and static regions in videos.

Method: StereoDiff employs stereo matching for static areas leveraging global 3D cues and utilizes video depth diffusion for ensuring smooth transitions in dynamic areas by learning from large-scale video depth data.

Result: Experimental results demonstrate that StereoDiff achieves state-of-the-art performance in zero-shot, real-world video depth estimation benchmarks with superior consistency and accuracy.

Conclusion: StereoDiff successfully addresses temporal consistency challenges in video depth estimation by synergizing stereo matching and video depth diffusion, proving effective in both static and dynamic regions.

Abstract: Recent video depth estimation methods achieve great performance by following
the paradigm of image depth estimation, i.e., typically fine-tuning pre-trained
video diffusion models with massive data. However, we argue that video depth
estimation is not a naive extension of image depth estimation. The temporal
consistency requirements for dynamic and static regions in videos are
fundamentally different. Consistent video depth in static regions, typically
backgrounds, can be more effectively achieved via stereo matching across all
frames, which provides much stronger global 3D cues. While the consistency for
dynamic regions still should be learned from large-scale video depth data to
ensure smooth transitions, due to the violation of triangulation constraints.
Based on these insights, we introduce StereoDiff, a two-stage video depth
estimator that synergizes stereo matching for mainly the static areas with
video depth diffusion for maintaining consistent depth transitions in dynamic
areas. We mathematically demonstrate how stereo matching and video depth
diffusion offer complementary strengths through frequency domain analysis,
highlighting the effectiveness of their synergy in capturing the advantages of
both. Experimental results on zero-shot, real-world, dynamic video depth
benchmarks, both indoor and outdoor, demonstrate StereoDiff's SoTA performance,
showcasing its superior consistency and accuracy in video depth estimation.

### [58] [ConViTac: Aligning Visual-Tactile Fusion with Contrastive Representations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20757)
*Zhiyuan Wu,Yongqiang Zhao,Shan Luo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces ConViTac, a novel network for enhancing visual-tactile fusion using contrastive learning, achieving significantly improved results in material classification and grasping tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to improve joint learning of visual-tactile representations for robots, addressing poor feature integration issues in traditional fusion methods.

Method: The method utilizes a Contrastive Embedding Conditioning (CEC) mechanism involving a self-supervised contrastive encoder to align and fuse visual-tactile features efficiently through cross-modal attention.

Result: Experiments show that ConViTac outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving up to 12.0% improvement in accuracy for material classification and grasp prediction tasks.

Conclusion: The study concludes that ConViTac and the proposed CEC mechanism enhance visual-tactile fusion and improve downstream task performance, demonstrating their effectiveness in real robotic applications.

Abstract: Vision and touch are two fundamental sensory modalities for robots, offering
complementary information that enhances perception and manipulation tasks.
Previous research has attempted to jointly learn visual-tactile representations
to extract more meaningful information. However, these approaches often rely on
direct combination, such as feature addition and concatenation, for modality
fusion, which tend to result in poor feature integration. In this paper, we
propose ConViTac, a visual-tactile representation learning network designed to
enhance the alignment of features during fusion using contrastive
representations. Our key contribution is a Contrastive Embedding Conditioning
(CEC) mechanism that leverages a contrastive encoder pretrained through
self-supervised contrastive learning to project visual and tactile inputs into
unified latent embeddings. These embeddings are used to couple visual-tactile
feature fusion through cross-modal attention, aiming at aligning the unified
representations and enhancing performance on downstream tasks. We conduct
extensive experiments to demonstrate the superiority of ConViTac in real world
over current state-of-the-art methods and the effectiveness of our proposed CEC
mechanism, which improves accuracy by up to 12.0% in material classification
and grasping prediction tasks.

*Connor Ludwig,Khashayar Namdar,Farzad Khalvati*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This study evaluates the segmentation performance of various general and medical promptable models, including SAM, SAM 2, MedSAM, SAM-Med-3D, and nnU-Net, on a medical imaging dataset, focusing on prompt qualities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The research addresses the gap in comparing general and medical promptable segmentation models across diverse prompt qualities on a standardized medical dataset.

Method: The paper conducts zero-shot inference on the BraTS 2023 dataset using multiple models with varying levels of prompt quality (points and bounding boxes), and extends the analysis by fine-tuning the models on a pediatrics dataset.

Result: Models like SAM and SAM 2 demonstrated high Dice scores (up to 0.894 and 0.893) with precise bounding box prompts, outperforming nnU-Net. However, nnU-Net remains superior due to practical limitations in providing precise prompts.

Conclusion: Fine-tuning improved performance with point prompts but neither surpassed bounding box prompts nor nnU-Net. The work shows potential for fine-tuned models but highlights nnU-Net’s continued dominance in medical image segmentation.

Abstract: Medical image segmentation has greatly aided medical diagnosis, with U-Net
based architectures and nnU-Net providing state-of-the-art performance. There
have been numerous general promptable models and medical variations introduced
in recent years, but there is currently a lack of evaluation and comparison of
these models across a variety of prompt qualities on a common medical dataset.
This research uses Segment Anything Model (SAM), Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM
2), MedSAM, SAM-Med-3D, and nnU-Net to obtain zero-shot inference on the BraTS
2023 adult glioma and pediatrics dataset across multiple prompt qualities for
both points and bounding boxes. Several of these models exhibit promising Dice
scores, particularly SAM and SAM 2 achieving scores of up to 0.894 and 0.893,
respectively when given extremely accurate bounding box prompts which exceeds
nnU-Net's segmentation performance. However, nnU-Net remains the dominant
medical image segmentation network due to the impracticality of providing
highly accurate prompts to the models. The model and prompt evaluation, as well
as the comparison, are extended through fine-tuning SAM, SAM 2, MedSAM, and
SAM-Med-3D on the pediatrics dataset. The improvements in point prompt
performance after fine-tuning are substantial and show promise for future
investigation, but are unable to achieve better segmentation than bounding
boxes or nnU-Net.

### [60] [How do Foundation Models Compare to Skeleton-Based Approaches for Gesture Recognition in Human-Robot Interaction?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20795)
*Stephanie Käs,Anton Burenko,Louis Markert,Onur Alp Culha,Dennis Mack,Timm Linder,Bastian Leibe*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper studies the use of advanced vision models for dynamic human-robot gesture recognition, introduces a new dataset, and compares different approaches, finding skeletal models most effective.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve human-robot communication efficiency in noisy environments, the paper explores reducing system complexity by leveraging the generalization capabilities of Vision Foundation Models and Vision Language Models.

Method: The study compares gesture recognition performances of three models (V-JEPA, Gemini Flash 2.0, and HD-GCN) and introduces the NUGGET dataset specifically tailored for evaluating gestures in human-robot communication.

Result: HD-GCN achieves the highest recognition accuracy, V-JEPA performs nearly as well with a simpler setup, and Gemini struggles under zero-shot settings.

Conclusion: While skeleton-based HD-GCN leads in performance, V-JEPA demonstrates promising multi-task capabilities, indicating potential for system simplification, whereas Gemini requires further research for improved gesture representation.

Abstract: Gestures enable non-verbal human-robot communication, especially in noisy
environments like agile production. Traditional deep learning-based gesture
recognition relies on task-specific architectures using images, videos, or
skeletal pose estimates as input. Meanwhile, Vision Foundation Models (VFMs)
and Vision Language Models (VLMs) with their strong generalization abilities
offer potential to reduce system complexity by replacing dedicated
task-specific modules. This study investigates adapting such models for
dynamic, full-body gesture recognition, comparing V-JEPA (a state-of-the-art
VFM), Gemini Flash 2.0 (a multimodal VLM), and HD-GCN (a top-performing
skeleton-based approach). We introduce NUGGET, a dataset tailored for
human-robot communication in intralogistics environments, to evaluate the
different gesture recognition approaches. In our experiments, HD-GCN achieves
best performance, but V-JEPA comes close with a simple, task-specific
classification head - thus paving a possible way towards reducing system
complexity, by using it as a shared multi-task model. In contrast, Gemini
struggles to differentiate gestures based solely on textual descriptions in the
zero-shot setting, highlighting the need of further research on suitable input
representations for gestures.

### [61] [Leveraging Vision-Language Models to Select Trustworthy Super-Resolution Samples Generated by Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20832)
*Cansu Korkmaz,Ahmet Murat Tekalp,Zafer Dogan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper presents a method for selecting the most trustworthy super-resolution (SR) images from diffusion models using vision-language models (VLMs) and introduces a novel Trustworthiness Score (TWS) to quantify SR reliability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the limitations of current SR approaches, where regressive models produce artifacts affecting applications like digit or letter recognition and diffusion models struggle to identify the best trustworthy SR solution from a diverse set.

Method: The authors use VLMs (e.g., BLIP-2, GPT-4o) to assess SR samples for semantic correctness, visual quality, and artifacts. They introduce a Trustworthiness Score (TWS) based on semantic similarity, structural integrity, and artifact sensitivity, and ensemble the top-ranked SR samples into a single output.

Result: The study demonstrates that TWS correlates strongly with human preferences. The VLM-guided approach produces SR samples with high TWS values and outperforms traditional SR evaluation metrics like PSNR and LPIPS.

Conclusion: The proposed framework offers a principled and scalable approach for generating trustworthy SR images, aligning outputs with human expectations and semantic correctness, and sets a new standard for SR evaluation in uncertain generative spaces.

Abstract: Super-resolution (SR) is an ill-posed inverse problem with many feasible
solutions consistent with a given low-resolution image. On one hand, regressive
SR models aim to balance fidelity and perceptual quality to yield a single
solution, but this trade-off often introduces artifacts that create ambiguity
in information-critical applications such as recognizing digits or letters. On
the other hand, diffusion models generate a diverse set of SR images, but
selecting the most trustworthy solution from this set remains a challenge. This
paper introduces a robust, automated framework for identifying the most
trustworthy SR sample from a diffusion-generated set by leveraging the semantic
reasoning capabilities of vision-language models (VLMs). Specifically, VLMs
such as BLIP-2, GPT-4o, and their variants are prompted with structured queries
to assess semantic correctness, visual quality, and artifact presence. The
top-ranked SR candidates are then ensembled to yield a single trustworthy
output in a cost-effective manner. To rigorously assess the validity of
VLM-selected samples, we propose a novel Trustworthiness Score (TWS) a hybrid
metric that quantifies SR reliability based on three complementary components:
semantic similarity via CLIP embeddings, structural integrity using SSIM on
edge maps, and artifact sensitivity through multi-level wavelet decomposition.
We empirically show that TWS correlates strongly with human preference in both
ambiguous and natural images, and that VLM-guided selections consistently yield
high TWS values. Compared to conventional metrics like PSNR, LPIPS, which fail
to reflect information fidelity, our approach offers a principled, scalable,
and generalizable solution for navigating the uncertainty of the diffusion SR
space. By aligning outputs with human expectations and semantic correctness,
this work sets a new benchmark for trustworthiness in generative SR.

### [62] [FixCLR: Negative-Class Contrastive Learning for Semi-Supervised Domain Generalization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20841)
*Ha Min Son,Shahbaz Rezaei,Xin Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes FixCLR for semi-supervised domain generalization, focusing on explicitly learning domain-invariant representations using contrastive learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing SSDG methods fail to explicitly regularize domain-invariant representations, which are critical for domain generalization.

Method: FixCLR adapts contrastive learning by employing class information from pseudo-labels and using only a repelling term for domain invariance. It can complement other SSDG and semi-supervised methods.

Result: FixCLR demonstrates effective performance improvements, particularly when combined with other SSDG approaches, even on diverse and previously unexplored experimental setups.

Conclusion: FixCLR is a promising SSDG method that enhances domain generalization, leveraging explicit domain invariance regularization through contrastive learning and showing compatibility with other techniques.

Abstract: Semi-supervised domain generalization (SSDG) aims to solve the problem of
generalizing to out-of-distribution data when only a few labels are available.
Due to label scarcity, applying domain generalization methods often
underperform. Consequently, existing SSDG methods combine semi-supervised
learning methods with various regularization terms. However, these methods do
not explicitly regularize to learn domains invariant representations across all
domains, which is a key goal for domain generalization. To address this, we
introduce FixCLR. Inspired by success in self-supervised learning, we change
two crucial components to adapt contrastive learning for explicit domain
invariance regularization: utilization of class information from pseudo-labels
and using only a repelling term. FixCLR can also be added on top of most
existing SSDG and semi-supervised methods for complementary performance
improvements. Our research includes extensive experiments that have not been
previously explored in SSDG studies. These experiments include benchmarking
different improvements to semi-supervised methods, evaluating the performance
of pretrained versus non-pretrained models, and testing on datasets with many
domains. Overall, FixCLR proves to be an effective SSDG method, especially when
combined with other semi-supervised methods.

### [63] [Vector Contrastive Learning For Pixel-Wise Pretraining In Medical Vision](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20850)
*Yuting He,Shuo Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper addresses the issue of extending contrastive learning (CL) to pixel-wise representation in medical vision by introducing a new framework, COVER, which reformulates CL into a vector regression problem to better preserve pixel-wise feature correlations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to overcome the limitations of traditional contrastive learning in pixel-wise representation, particularly the over-dispersion problem, which disrupts pixel-wise feature correlations critical in medical vision.

Method: The authors reformulate contrastive learning as a vector regression problem, modeling feature distances using displacement vectors. The COVER framework introduces a vector-based self-learning pipeline, maintains optimization consistency, and employs a vector pyramid architecture for adaptability and granularity.

Result: COVER demonstrates significant improvements in pixel-wise self-supervised pretraining (SSP) across 8 different tasks, showing its effectiveness in advancing generalizable medical visual foundation models.

Conclusion: COVER provides a strong framework for pixel-wise self-supervised pretraining, addressing the over-dispersion issue and achieving better performance and generalization for medical vision tasks.

Abstract: Contrastive learning (CL) has become a cornerstone of self-supervised
pretraining (SSP) in foundation models, however, extending CL to pixel-wise
representation, crucial for medical vision, remains an open problem. Standard
CL formulates SSP as a binary optimization problem (binary CL) where the
excessive pursuit of feature dispersion leads to an over-dispersion problem,
breaking pixel-wise feature correlation thus disrupting the intra-class
distribution. Our vector CL reformulates CL as a vector regression problem,
enabling dispersion quantification in pixel-wise pretraining via modeling
feature distances in regressing displacement vectors. To implement this novel
paradigm, we propose the COntrast in VEctor Regression (COVER) framework. COVER
establishes an extendable vector-based self-learning, enforces a consistent
optimization flow from vector regression to distance modeling, and leverages a
vector pyramid architecture for granularity adaptation, thus preserving
pixel-wise feature correlations in SSP. Extensive experiments across 8 tasks,
spanning 2 dimensions and 4 modalities, show that COVER significantly improves
pixel-wise SSP, advancing generalizable medical visual foundation models.

*Ryosuke Kawamura,Hideaki Hayashi,Shunsuke Otake,Noriko Takemura,Hajime Nagahara*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The study introduces MIDAS, a data augmentation method designed for Dynamic Facial Expression Recognition (DFER) that performs well in recognizing ambiguous facial expressions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to improve DFER performance, particularly for ambiguous facial expressions found in real-world scenarios, as current approaches lack in handling such complexities effectively.

Method: The proposed method, MIDAS, convexly combines pairs of video frames and their corresponding soft emotion class labels. It extends mixup to soft-labeled video data, providing better training data for handling ambiguity.

Result: Experiments using the DFEW dataset and FERV39k-Plus demonstrate that MIDAS-augmented training data leads to better performance compared to current state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: MIDAS is an effective and simple solution for enhancing DFER, especially for addressing ambiguities in facial expression recognition through soft-label-informed data augmentation.

Abstract: Dynamic facial expression recognition (DFER) is a task that estimates
emotions from facial expression video sequences. For practical applications,
accurately recognizing ambiguous facial expressions -- frequently encountered
in in-the-wild data -- is essential. In this study, we propose MIDAS, a data
augmentation method designed to enhance DFER performance for ambiguous facial
expression data using soft labels representing probabilities of multiple
emotion classes. MIDAS augments training data by convexly combining pairs of
video frames and their corresponding emotion class labels. This approach
extends mixup to soft-labeled video data, offering a simple yet highly
effective method for handling ambiguity in DFER. To evaluate MIDAS, we
conducted experiments on both the DFEW dataset and FERV39k-Plus, a newly
constructed dataset that assigns soft labels to an existing DFER dataset. The
results demonstrate that models trained with MIDAS-augmented data achieve
superior performance compared to the state-of-the-art method trained on the
original dataset.

### [65] [THIRDEYE: Cue-Aware Monocular Depth Estimation via Brain-Inspired Multi-Stage Fusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20877)
*Calin Teodor Ioan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces 'ThirdEye,' a monocular depth estimation framework that explicitly incorporates human-like visual cues through pre-trained networks, organized hierarchically.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Human visual depth estimation relies on explicit monocular cues (like occlusion boundaries and shading), but deep models often fail to directly capitalize on these.

Method: ThirdEye integrates explicit monocular cues using pre-trained networks, fuses them in a cortical-inspired hierarchy with a working memory module, and generates disparity maps through a transformer model.

Result: Quantitative results are yet to be provided; however, the method promises reduced fine-tuning needs due to external supervision.

Conclusion: ThirdEye offers a biologically-inspired, cue-aware approach to monocular depth estimation that combines neuroscience motivation with practical efficiency.

Abstract: Monocular depth estimation methods traditionally train deep models to infer
depth directly from RGB pixels. This implicit learning often overlooks explicit
monocular cues that the human visual system relies on, such as occlusion
boundaries, shading, and perspective. Rather than expecting a network to
discover these cues unaided, we present ThirdEye, a cue-aware pipeline that
deliberately supplies each cue through specialised, pre-trained, and frozen
networks. These cues are fused in a three-stage cortical hierarchy (V1->V2->V3)
equipped with a key-value working-memory module that weights them by
reliability. An adaptive-bins transformer head then produces a high-resolution
disparity map. Because the cue experts are frozen, ThirdEye inherits large
amounts of external supervision while requiring only modest fine-tuning. This
extended version provides additional architectural detail, neuroscientific
motivation, and an expanded experimental protocol; quantitative results will
appear in a future revision.

TL;DR: This paper introduces MultiHuman-Testbench, a benchmark for evaluating generative models in multi-human image generation scenarios, tackling challenges in preserving identities and performing complex actions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the lack of a dedicated benchmark for generating multi-human images with accurate facial identities and complex actions.

Method: The authors create MultiHuman-Testbench featuring 1800 samples with text prompts and human face images covering diverse demographics, paired with human-selected pose conditioning images. They employ four metrics for evaluation and propose improved techniques using segmentation and Hungarian matching.

Result: The benchmark enables comparative studies by rigorously evaluating multiple generative models, highlighting performance gaps and improvements in ID similarity and task alignment.

Conclusion: MultiHuman-Testbench offers a standardized evaluation framework, advancing the field of multi-human image generation while providing key methodologies for preserving identity and action accuracy.

Abstract: Generation of images containing multiple humans, performing complex actions,
while preserving their facial identities, is a significant challenge. A major
factor contributing to this is the lack of a a dedicated benchmark. To address
this, we introduce MultiHuman-Testbench, a novel benchmark for rigorously
evaluating generative models for multi-human generation. The benchmark
comprises 1800 samples, including carefully curated text prompts, describing a
range of simple to complex human actions. These prompts are matched with a
total of 5,550 unique human face images, sampled uniformly to ensure diversity
across age, ethnic background, and gender. Alongside captions, we provide
human-selected pose conditioning images which accurately match the prompt. We
propose a multi-faceted evaluation suite employing four key metrics to quantify
face count, ID similarity, prompt alignment, and action detection. We conduct a
thorough evaluation of a diverse set of models, including zero-shot approaches
and training-based methods, with and without regional priors. We also propose
novel techniques to incorporate image and region isolation using human
segmentation and Hungarian matching, significantly improving ID similarity. Our
proposed benchmark and key findings provide valuable insights and a
standardized tool for advancing research in multi-human image generation.

Motivation: To investigate how 3D structure and human-inspired perception can improve depth reconstruction in stereo vision systems.

Method: The paper revisits the Cyclopean Eye model, introduces novel geometric constraints, and evaluates deep learning-derived feature matching and attention mechanisms.

Result: The combination of strong geometric priors and learned features was shown to improve the understanding and performance of stereo vision systems.

Conclusion: Incorporating advanced geometric foundations along with deep learning models creates robust abstractions for stereo vision system functionalities.

Abstract: This work investigates the geometric foundations of modern stereo vision
systems, with a focus on how 3D structure and human-inspired perception
contribute to accurate depth reconstruction. We revisit the Cyclopean Eye model
and propose novel geometric constraints that account for occlusions and depth
discontinuities. Our analysis includes the evaluation of stereo feature
matching quality derived from deep learning models, as well as the role of
attention mechanisms in recovering meaningful 3D surfaces. Through both
theoretical insights and empirical studies on real datasets, we demonstrate
that combining strong geometric priors with learned features provides internal
abstractions for understanding stereo vision systems.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces FaSTA$^*$, a cost-efficient neurosymbolic agent for complex, multi-turn image editing tasks, combining fast LLM-driven planning with localized A$^*$ search.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for a solution to efficiently handle complex, multi-turn image editing tasks without exorbitant computational costs.

Method: Combines large language models (LLMs) for fast planning and A$^*$ for accurate tool-use. Uses inductive reasoning to extract reusable subroutines, employing a fast-slow adaptive planning framework.

Result: FaSTA$^*$ achieves significant computational efficiency with competitive success rates compared to state-of-the-art image editing methods.

Conclusion: The proposed FaSTA$^*$ agent is efficient, cost-effective, and adaptable, capable of handling diverse image-editing tasks effectively by balancing fast planning and detailed search.

Abstract: We develop a cost-efficient neurosymbolic agent to address challenging
multi-turn image editing tasks such as "Detect the bench in the image while
recoloring it to pink. Also, remove the cat for a clearer view and recolor the
wall to yellow.'' It combines the fast, high-level subtask planning by large
language models (LLMs) with the slow, accurate, tool-use, and local A$^*$
search per subtask to find a cost-efficient toolpath -- a sequence of calls to
AI tools. To save the cost of A$^*$ on similar subtasks, we perform inductive
reasoning on previously successful toolpaths via LLMs to continuously
extract/refine frequently used subroutines and reuse them as new tools for
future tasks in an adaptive fast-slow planning, where the higher-level
subroutines are explored first, and only when they fail, the low-level A$^*$
search is activated. The reusable symbolic subroutines considerably save
exploration cost on the same types of subtasks applied to similar images,
yielding a human-like fast-slow toolpath agent "FaSTA$^*$'': fast subtask
planning followed by rule-based subroutine selection per subtask is attempted
by LLMs at first, which is expected to cover most tasks, while slow A$^*$
search is only triggered for novel and challenging subtasks. By comparing with
recent image editing approaches, we demonstrate FaSTA$^*$ is significantly more
computationally efficient while remaining competitive with the state-of-the-art
baseline in terms of success rate.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: M2SFormer is a novel Transformer-based framework for detecting and localizing image forgeries more effectively, addressing challenges like computational overhead and representation limits.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Image editing advancements have enabled both creative and malicious uses, necessitating effective forgery localization methods capable of handling subtle or complex tampering.

Method: M2SFormer unifies multi-frequency and multi-scale attentions using skip connections, incorporates a global prior map and difficulty-guided attention module, and preserves fine details during localization.

Result: Extensive experiments show M2SFormer surpasses state-of-the-art methods in accuracy and generalization for forgery detection, including on unseen domains.

Conclusion: M2SFormer advances forgery localization by integrating global context and difficulty-guided attention, achieving superior performance and generalization over prior approaches.

Abstract: Image editing techniques have rapidly advanced, facilitating both innovative
use cases and malicious manipulation of digital images. Deep learning-based
methods have recently achieved high accuracy in pixel-level forgery
localization, yet they frequently struggle with computational overhead and
limited representation power, particularly for subtle or complex tampering. In
this paper, we propose M2SFormer, a novel Transformer encoder-based framework
designed to overcome these challenges. Unlike approaches that process spatial
and frequency cues separately, M2SFormer unifies multi-frequency and
multi-scale attentions in the skip connection, harnessing global context to
better capture diverse forgery artifacts. Additionally, our framework addresses
the loss of fine detail during upsampling by utilizing a global prior map, a
curvature metric indicating the difficulty of forgery localization, which then
guides a difficulty-guided attention module to preserve subtle manipulations
more effectively. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets
demonstrate that M2SFormer outperforms existing state-of-the-art models,
offering superior generalization in detecting and localizing forgeries across
unseen domains.

*Hao Zhang,Haolan Xu,Chun Feng,Varun Jampani,Narendra Ahuja*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PhysRig offers a physics-based and differentiable solution for skinning and rigging, addressing the inadequacies of traditional Linear Blend Skinning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods like Linear Blend Skinning cause artifacts and fail to model elastic materials and certain flexible structures effectively.

Method: The paper introduces PhysRig, utilizing physics-based modeling with a volumetric representation and grid-based discretization, combined with material prototypes to improve efficiency.

Result: PhysRig outperformed traditional methods in generating realistic and physically plausible animations across synthetic datasets.

Conclusion: This framework enhances realism and versatility in articulated object modeling, showing significant promise in motion tasks like pose transfer.

Abstract: Skinning and rigging are fundamental components in animation, articulated
object reconstruction, motion transfer, and 4D generation. Existing approaches
predominantly rely on Linear Blend Skinning (LBS), due to its simplicity and
differentiability. However, LBS introduces artifacts such as volume loss and
unnatural deformations, and it fails to model elastic materials like soft
tissues, fur, and flexible appendages (e.g., elephant trunks, ears, and fatty
tissues). In this work, we propose PhysRig: a differentiable physics-based
skinning and rigging framework that overcomes these limitations by embedding
the rigid skeleton into a volumetric representation (e.g., a tetrahedral mesh),
which is simulated as a deformable soft-body structure driven by the animated
skeleton. Our method leverages continuum mechanics and discretizes the object
as particles embedded in an Eulerian background grid to ensure
differentiability with respect to both material properties and skeletal motion.
Additionally, we introduce material prototypes, significantly reducing the
learning space while maintaining high expressiveness. To evaluate our
framework, we construct a comprehensive synthetic dataset using meshes from
Objaverse, The Amazing Animals Zoo, and MixaMo, covering diverse object
categories and motion patterns. Our method consistently outperforms traditional
LBS-based approaches, generating more realistic and physically plausible
results. Furthermore, we demonstrate the applicability of our framework in the
pose transfer task highlighting its versatility for articulated object
modeling.

Method: A year-long data collection campaign to compile a dataset of aviation-relevant visibility-tagged images and the evaluation of three commonly used machine learning approaches on this dataset as well as on other publicly available datasets.

Result: The new dataset and benchmarking results demonstrate how the approaches compare against an ASTM standard, validating its utility for visibility estimation tasks.

Conclusion: This new dataset fills a gap in the availability of large, diverse datasets crucial for supervised learning in atmospheric visibility in aviation and sets a benchmark for future research in this area.

Abstract: Machine Learning for aviation weather is a growing area of research for
providing low-cost alternatives for traditional, expensive weather sensors;
however, in the area of atmospheric visibility estimation, publicly available
datasets, tagged with visibility estimates, of distances relevant for aviation,
of diverse locations, of sufficient size for use in supervised learning, are
absent. This paper introduces a new dataset which represents the culmination of
a year-long data collection campaign of images from the FAA weather camera
network suitable for this purpose. We also present a benchmark when applying
three commonly used approaches and a general-purpose baseline when trained and
tested on three publicly available datasets, in addition to our own, when
compared against a recently ratified ASTM standard.

*Dejie Yang,Zhu Xu,Xinjie Gao,Yang Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The study introduces Hierarchical Sub-action Tree (HST-CSLR) to improve Continuous Sign Language Recognition (CSLR) using a more effective incorporation of gloss knowledge and visual learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CSLR faces challenges due to limited datasets and annotations, which hinder the ability to train models effectively.

Method: The paper leverages gloss-specific knowledge from large language models, building an HST for textual representation to align visual and textual modalities in a step-by-step manner, along with contrastive alignment enhancement.

Result: Experiments conducted on four datasets demonstrate the proposed HST-CSLR approach's effectiveness in improving CSLR tasks.

Conclusion: HST-CSLR successfully integrates gloss knowledge with visual learning techniques, reducing computational complexity and enhancing the alignment between visual and textual modalities.

Abstract: Continuous sign language recognition (CSLR) aims to transcribe untrimmed
videos into glosses, which are typically textual words. Recent studies indicate
that the lack of large datasets and precise annotations has become a bottleneck
for CSLR due to insufficient training data. To address this, some works have
developed cross-modal solutions to align visual and textual modalities.
However, they typically extract textual features from glosses without fully
utilizing their knowledge. In this paper, we propose the Hierarchical
Sub-action Tree (HST), termed HST-CSLR, to efficiently combine gloss knowledge
with visual representation learning. By incorporating gloss-specific knowledge
from large language models, our approach leverages textual information more
effectively. Specifically, we construct an HST for textual information
representation, aligning visual and textual modalities step-by-step and
benefiting from the tree structure to reduce computational complexity.
Additionally, we impose a contrastive alignment enhancement to bridge the gap
between the two modalities. Experiments on four datasets (PHOENIX-2014,
PHOENIX-2014T, CSL-Daily, and Sign Language Gesture) demonstrate the
effectiveness of our HST-CSLR.

TL;DR: PathChat+ advances pathology AI by addressing multimodal large language model limitations with extensive training and diagnostic reasoning capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current multimodal models in computational pathology lack sufficient training data, multi-image understanding capabilities, and diagnostic reasoning.

Method: Developed PathChat+, trained on diverse pathology-specific datasets, and introduced SlideSeek for hierarchical diagnostic reasoning on gigapixel images.

Result: PathChat+ outperforms previous models and general-purpose alternatives, offering high accuracy and interpretability for diagnostic tasks.

Conclusion: PathChat+ and SlideSeek demonstrate enhanced diagnostic proficiency and pave the way for AI systems in computational pathology.

Abstract: Pathology is experiencing rapid digital transformation driven by whole-slide
imaging and artificial intelligence (AI). While deep learning-based
computational pathology has achieved notable success, traditional models
primarily focus on image analysis without integrating natural language
instruction or rich, text-based context. Current multimodal large language
models (MLLMs) in computational pathology face limitations, including
insufficient training data, inadequate support and evaluation for multi-image
understanding, and a lack of autonomous, diagnostic reasoning capabilities. To
address these limitations, we introduce PathChat+, a new MLLM specifically
designed for human pathology, trained on over 1 million diverse,
pathology-specific instruction samples and nearly 5.5 million question answer
turns. Extensive evaluations across diverse pathology benchmarks demonstrated
that PathChat+ substantially outperforms the prior PathChat copilot, as well as
both state-of-the-art (SOTA) general-purpose and other pathology-specific
models. Furthermore, we present SlideSeek, a reasoning-enabled multi-agent AI
system leveraging PathChat+ to autonomously evaluate gigapixel whole-slide
images (WSIs) through iterative, hierarchical diagnostic reasoning, reaching
high accuracy on DDxBench, a challenging open-ended differential diagnosis
benchmark, while also capable of generating visually grounded,
humanly-interpretable summary reports.

TL;DR: DFVEdit introduces an efficient zero-shot video editing method for Video Diffusion Transformers (Video DiTs) that skips computationally heavy attention modifications and fine-tuning, offering significant speed and memory gains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing video generation methods using Video DiTs face computational challenges when applied to video editing tasks due to the resource-intensive nature of attention modifications and fine-tuning.

Method: DFVEdit introduces Conditional Delta Flow Vector (CDFV) for zero-shot video editing using flow transformation, along with Implicit Cross Attention (ICA) guidance and Embedding Reinforcement (ER) for improved editing quality.

Result: DFVEdit achieves at least 20x faster inference and 85% memory reduction compared to attention-engineering-based editing methods, while providing high editing quality and maintaining structural fidelity and spatial-temporal consistency.

Conclusion: DFVEdit proves to be a highly efficient and effective video editing solution for Video DiTs, offering practical advantages in speed, memory efficiency, and quality, making it ideal for real-world applications.

Abstract: The advent of Video Diffusion Transformers (Video DiTs) marks a milestone in
video generation. However, directly applying existing video editing methods to
Video DiTs often incurs substantial computational overhead, due to
resource-intensive attention modification or finetuning. To alleviate this
problem, we present DFVEdit, an efficient zero-shot video editing method
tailored for Video DiTs. DFVEdit eliminates the need for both attention
modification and fine-tuning by directly operating on clean latents via flow
transformation. To be more specific, we observe that editing and sampling can
be unified under the continuous flow perspective. Building upon this
foundation, we propose the Conditional Delta Flow Vector (CDFV) -- a
theoretically unbiased estimation of DFV -- and integrate Implicit Cross
Attention (ICA) guidance as well as Embedding Reinforcement (ER) to further
enhance editing quality. DFVEdit excels in practical efficiency, offering at
least 20x inference speed-up and 85\% memory reduction on Video DiTs compared
to attention-engineering-based editing methods. Extensive quantitative and
qualitative experiments demonstrate that DFVEdit can be seamlessly applied to
popular Video DiTs (e.g., CogVideoX and Wan2.1), attaining state-of-the-art
performance on structural fidelity, spatial-temporal consistency, and editing
quality.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Cradle2Cane, a two-pass face aging framework addressing the Age-ID trade-off, achieving realistic aging and identity preservation using adaptive noise injection and identity-aware embeddings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenge of balancing age accuracy and identity preservation in face aging across the lifespan, particularly for large age gaps or extreme poses.

Method: Proposes a two-pass framework. First pass focuses on adaptive noise injection to achieve strong age transformations, guided by textual prompts. Second pass enforces identity preservation using two identity-aware embeddings (SVR-ArcFace and Rotate-CLIP), jointly trained in an end-to-end manner.

Result: Extensive experiments on the CelebA-HQ test dataset demonstrate Cradle2Cane's superiority in both age accuracy and identity consistency over existing methods.

Conclusion: Cradle2Cane successfully resolves the Age-ID trade-off and provides a robust, realistic, and identity-consistent approach to face aging.

Abstract: Face aging has become a crucial task in computer vision, with applications
ranging from entertainment to healthcare. However, existing methods struggle
with achieving a realistic and seamless transformation across the entire
lifespan, especially when handling large age gaps or extreme head poses. The
core challenge lies in balancing age accuracy and identity preservation--what
we refer to as the Age-ID trade-off. Most prior methods either prioritize age
transformation at the expense of identity consistency or vice versa. In this
work, we address this issue by proposing a two-pass face aging framework, named
Cradle2Cane, based on few-step text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models. The first
pass focuses on solving age accuracy by introducing an adaptive noise injection
(AdaNI) mechanism. This mechanism is guided by including prompt descriptions of
age and gender for the given person as the textual condition. Also, by
adjusting the noise level, we can control the strength of aging while allowing
more flexibility in transforming the face. However, identity preservation is
weakly ensured here to facilitate stronger age transformations. In the second
pass, we enhance identity preservation while maintaining age-specific features
by conditioning the model on two identity-aware embeddings (IDEmb): SVR-ArcFace
and Rotate-CLIP. This pass allows for denoising the transformed image from the
first pass, ensuring stronger identity preservation without compromising the
aging accuracy. Both passes are jointly trained in an end-to-end way. Extensive
experiments on the CelebA-HQ test dataset, evaluated through Face++ and Qwen-VL
protocols, show that our Cradle2Cane outperforms existing face aging methods in
age accuracy and identity consistency.

### [77] [3D Scene-Camera Representation with Joint Camera Photometric Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20979)
*Weichen Dai,Kangcheng Ma,Jiaxin Wang,Kecen Pan,Yuhang Ming,Hua Zhang,Wanzeng Kong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper presents a method to improve 3D scene representation by jointly optimizing photometric distortions present in camera imaging, leading to better scene quality even in degraded imaging conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current 3D scene representations often include unwanted errors due to photometric distortions inherent in cameras, such as vignetting and dirt, negatively impacting scene quality.

Method: The authors introduced a joint representation of 3D scenes and camera photometric characteristics by proposing internal and external photometric models and optimizing these along with depth-based regularization to separate error-inducing information.

Result: The proposed method successfully disentangles these camera-related distortions and improves the 3D scene representation, as shown through experiments under challenging imaging conditions.

Conclusion: Jointly optimizing the camera photometric model and scene representation enhances the quality of 3D mappings, ensuring resilience to common imaging distortions.

Abstract: Representing scenes from multi-view images is a crucial task in computer
vision with extensive applications. However, inherent photometric distortions
in the camera imaging can significantly degrade image quality. Without
accounting for these distortions, the 3D scene representation may inadvertently
incorporate erroneous information unrelated to the scene, diminishing the
quality of the representation. In this paper, we propose a novel 3D
scene-camera representation with joint camera photometric optimization. By
introducing internal and external photometric model, we propose a full
photometric model and corresponding camera representation. Based on
simultaneously optimizing the parameters of the camera representation, the
proposed method effectively separates scene-unrelated information from the 3D
scene representation. Additionally, during the optimization of the photometric
parameters, we introduce a depth regularization to prevent the 3D scene
representation from fitting scene-unrelated information. By incorporating the
camera model as part of the mapping process, the proposed method constructs a
complete map that includes both the scene radiance field and the camera
photometric model. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method
can achieve high-quality 3D scene representations, even under conditions of
imaging degradation, such as vignetting and dirt.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper presents a novel Graph-oriented Inverse Reinforcement Learning (GoIRL) framework for trajectory prediction in autonomous driving, outperforming existing supervised models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges of uncertainty and multimodality in trajectory prediction for autonomous driving, seeking an alternative to purely data-driven supervised learning methods.

Method: The proposed method employs Graph-oriented Inverse Reinforcement Learning (GoIRL), which integrates lane-graph features into grid space, uses maximum entropy IRL for reward distribution inference, and implements a hierarchical trajectory generator with refinement modules and probability fusion.

Result: The method achieves state-of-the-art performance on Argoverse and nuScenes benchmarks and demonstrates strong generalization abilities compared to supervised models.

Conclusion: The GoIRL framework successfully improves trajectory prediction accuracy and confidence in autonomous driving by leveraging IRL principles and graph-based feature integration.

Abstract: Trajectory prediction for surrounding agents is a challenging task in
autonomous driving due to its inherent uncertainty and underlying
multimodality. Unlike prevailing data-driven methods that primarily rely on
supervised learning, in this paper, we introduce a novel Graph-oriented Inverse
Reinforcement Learning (GoIRL) framework, which is an IRL-based predictor
equipped with vectorized context representations. We develop a feature adaptor
to effectively aggregate lane-graph features into grid space, enabling seamless
integration with the maximum entropy IRL paradigm to infer the reward
distribution and obtain the policy that can be sampled to induce multiple
plausible plans. Furthermore, conditioned on the sampled plans, we implement a
hierarchical parameterized trajectory generator with a refinement module to
enhance prediction accuracy and a probability fusion strategy to boost
prediction confidence. Extensive experimental results showcase our approach not
only achieves state-of-the-art performance on the large-scale Argoverse &
nuScenes motion forecasting benchmarks but also exhibits superior
generalization abilities compared to existing supervised models.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper presents SP-Ctrl, a system that enhances sparse signals like OpenPose for pose-guided image generation, demonstrating efficiency and versatility compared to dense signals.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address challenges posed by dense signals, such as editing difficulties and inconsistencies, by revisiting sparse signals for detailed spatial guidance in pose-guided text-to-image (T2I) generation.

Method: The authors propose Spatial-Pose ControlNet (SP-Ctrl), which builds upon OpenPose by creating a learnable spatial representation with discriminative and expressive keypoint embeddings. They also introduce keypoint concept learning to improve pose alignment.

Result: SP-Ctrl achieves superior pose-guided image generation performance over existing spatially controllable methods using sparse signals. It matches dense-signal methods and exhibits cross-species generalization capabilities.

Conclusion: SP-Ctrl demonstrates robust controllability and versatility in image generation tasks, leading the way in maximizing the potential of sparse signals for pose guidance.

Abstract: Recent works favored dense signals (e.g., depth, DensePose), as an
alternative to sparse signals (e.g., OpenPose), to provide detailed spatial
guidance for pose-guided text-to-image generation. However, dense
representations raised new challenges, including editing difficulties and
potential inconsistencies with textual prompts. This fact motivates us to
revisit sparse signals for pose guidance, owing to their simplicity and
shape-agnostic nature, which remains underexplored. This paper proposes a novel
Spatial-Pose ControlNet(SP-Ctrl), equipping sparse signals with robust
controllability for pose-guided image generation. Specifically, we extend
OpenPose to a learnable spatial representation, making keypoint embeddings
discriminative and expressive. Additionally, we introduce keypoint concept
learning, which encourages keypoint tokens to attend to the spatial positions
of each keypoint, thus improving pose alignment. Experiments on animal- and
human-centric image generation tasks demonstrate that our method outperforms
recent spatially controllable T2I generation approaches under sparse-pose
guidance and even matches the performance of dense signal-based methods.
Moreover, SP-Ctrl shows promising capabilities in diverse and cross-species
generation through sparse signals. Codes will be available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the challenges posed by existing methods that struggle with Out-of-Distribution (OoD) objects and long-tail distributions in 3D semantic occupancy for autonomous driving.

Method: A Synthetic Anomaly Integration Pipeline is designed to create realistic voxel datasets like VAA-KITTI and VAA-KITTI-360, paired with OccOoD framework employing Voxel-BEV Progressive Fusion (VBPF) with RWKV-based geometry-semantic fusion for robust OoD detection.

Result: OccOoD achieves state-of-the-art performance in OoD detection with AuROC of 67.34% and AuPRCr of 29.21% in a 1.2m region while retaining effective occupancy prediction.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that incorporating synthetic anomalies and the OccOoD framework significantly enhances OoD detection capabilities in 3D semantic occupancy prediction, presenting robust solutions for autonomous driving.

Abstract: 3D Semantic Occupancy Prediction is crucial for autonomous driving, providing
a dense, semantically rich environmental representation. However, existing
methods focus on in-distribution scenes, making them susceptible to
Out-of-Distribution (OoD) objects and long-tail distributions, which increases
the risk of undetected anomalies and misinterpretations, posing safety hazards.
To address these challenges, we introduce Out-of-Distribution Semantic
Occupancy Prediction, targeting OoD detection in 3D voxel space. To fill the
gaps in the dataset, we propose a Synthetic Anomaly Integration Pipeline that
injects synthetic anomalies while preserving realistic spatial and occlusion
patterns, enabling the creation of two datasets: VAA-KITTI and VAA-KITTI-360.
We introduce OccOoD, a novel framework integrating OoD detection into 3D
semantic occupancy prediction, with Voxel-BEV Progressive Fusion (VBPF)
leveraging an RWKV-based branch to enhance OoD detection via geometry-semantic
fusion. Experimental results demonstrate that OccOoD achieves state-of-the-art
OoD detection with an AuROC of 67.34% and an AuPRCr of 29.21% within a 1.2m

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper presents EVA, a new framework for improving Compositional Zero-Shot Learning (CZSL) by introducing expert-based learning and refined image-composition alignment strategies, achieving state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing CZSL methods struggle with suboptimal representation of semantic subsets and fail to address compositional divergence effectively, leading to limited compositional generalization.

Method: The paper proposes EVA, a framework with two main contributions: domain-expert adaptation (using multiple experts for token-aware learning) and semantic variant alignment (selecting relevant representations for image-primitives matching).

Result: EVA achieves superior performance compared to other state-of-the-art methods across three benchmarks in both closed-world and open-world scenarios.

Conclusion: EVA demonstrates the effectiveness of expert-driven and semantically aligned approaches in enhancing compositional generalization in CZSL.

Abstract: Compositional Zero-Shot Learning (CZSL) investigates compositional
generalization capacity to recognize unknown state-object pairs based on
learned primitive concepts. Existing CZSL methods typically derive primitives
features through a simple composition-prototype mapping, which is suboptimal
for a set of individuals that can be divided into distinct semantic subsets.
Moreover, the all-to-one cross-modal primitives matching neglects compositional
divergence within identical states or objects, limiting fine-grained
image-composition alignment. In this study, we propose EVA, a
Mixture-of-Experts Semantic Variant Alignment framework for CZSL. Specifically,
we introduce domain-expert adaption, leveraging multiple experts to achieve
token-aware learning and model high-quality primitive representations. To
enable accurate compositional generalization, we further present semantic
variant alignment to select semantically relevant representation for
image-primitives matching. Our method significantly outperforms other
state-of-the-art CZSL methods on three popular benchmarks in both closed- and
open-world settings, demonstrating the efficacy of the proposed insight.

TL;DR: This paper introduces a novel task, SFOASS, and UNLOCK, a framework for source-free panoramic image segmentation with occlusion handling. It achieves competitive results without needing source-domain data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Panoramic image processing faces challenges like distortions, occlusions, and lack of annotations, while current methods requiring source data limit their practicality.

Method: The authors propose the SFOASS task and a source-free solution UNLOCK, featuring Omni Pseudo-Labeling and Amodal-Driven Context Learning, for segmentation without source or target labels.

Result: UNLOCK demonstrated state-of-the-art performance with mAAP of 10.9, mAP of 11.6, and a +4.3 improvement in mAPQ over source-only methods under various adaptation settings.

Conclusion: The proposed SFOASS task and UNLOCK framework enable effective panoramic segmentation in a source-free manner, showing results comparable to source-dependent methods and advancing practical applicability.

Abstract: Panoramic image processing is essential for omni-context perception, yet
faces constraints like distortions, perspective occlusions, and limited
annotations. Previous unsupervised domain adaptation methods transfer knowledge
from labeled pinhole data to unlabeled panoramic images, but they require
access to source pinhole data. To address these, we introduce a more practical
task, i.e., Source-Free Occlusion-Aware Seamless Segmentation (SFOASS), and
propose its first solution, called UNconstrained Learning Omni-Context
Knowledge (UNLOCK). Specifically, UNLOCK includes two key modules: Omni
Pseudo-Labeling Learning and Amodal-Driven Context Learning. While adapting
without relying on source data or target labels, this framework enhances models
to achieve segmentation with 360{\deg} viewpoint coverage and occlusion-aware
reasoning. Furthermore, we benchmark the proposed SFOASS task through both
real-to-real and synthetic-to-real adaptation settings. Experimental results
show that our source-free method achieves performance comparable to
source-dependent methods, yielding state-of-the-art scores of 10.9 in mAAP and
11.6 in mAP, along with an absolute improvement of +4.3 in mAPQ over the
source-only method. All data and code will be made publicly available at

Abstract: Pathology image segmentation is crucial in computational pathology for
analyzing histological features relevant to cancer diagnosis and prognosis.
However, current methods face major challenges in clinical applications due to
limited annotated data and restricted category definitions. To address these
limitations, we propose PathSegmentor, the first text-prompted segmentation
foundation model designed specifically for pathology images. We also introduce
PathSeg , the largest and most comprehensive dataset for pathology
segmentation, built from 17 public sources and containing 275k image-mask-label
triples across 160 diverse categories. With PathSegmentor, users can perform
semantic segmentation using natural language prompts, eliminating the need for
laborious spatial inputs such as points or boxes. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that PathSegmentor outperforms specialized models with higher
accuracy and broader applicability, while maintaining a compact architecture.
It significantly surpasses existing spatial- and text-prompted models by 0.145
and 0.429 in overall Dice scores, respectively, showing strong robustness in
segmenting complex structures and generalizing to external datasets. Moreover,
PathSegmentor's outputs enhance the interpretability of diagnostic models
through feature importance estimation and imaging biomarker discovery, offering
pathologists evidence-based support for clinical decision-making. This work
advances the development of explainable AI in precision oncology.

Motivation: Existing 3D vision-language models struggle with interactive point-level tasks due to a lack of direct 3D-text alignment, which hampers local 3D feature understanding in textual contexts.

Method: The authors developed TSDASeg, which includes a direct cross-modal alignment module for explicit alignment across modalities and a memory module with dedicated memory banks dynamically updated via attention mechanisms to improve segmentation.

Result: The model achieves state-of-the-art performance on various 3D segmentation datasets, showing its effectiveness in addressing inconsistencies during interactive segmentation tasks.

Conclusion: TSDASeg improves cross-modal interaction and alignment for 3D point cloud tasks, making it effective for real-world applications in diverse scenarios.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of 3D vision-language models (VLMs) has spurred
significant interest in interactive point cloud processing tasks, particularly
for real-world applications. However, existing methods often underperform in
point-level tasks, such as segmentation, due to missing direct 3D-text
alignment, limiting their ability to link local 3D features with textual
context. To solve this problem, we propose TSDASeg, a Two-Stage model coupled
with a Direct cross-modal Alignment module and memory module for interactive
point cloud Segmentation. We introduce the direct cross-modal alignment module
to establish explicit alignment between 3D point clouds and textual/2D image
data. Within the memory module, we employ multiple dedicated memory banks to
separately store text features, visual features, and their cross-modal
correspondence mappings. These memory banks are dynamically leveraged through
self-attention and cross-attention mechanisms to update scene-specific features
based on prior stored data, effectively addressing inconsistencies in
interactive segmentation results across diverse scenarios. Experiments
conducted on multiple 3D instruction, reference, and semantic segmentation
datasets demonstrate that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art
performance.

video into executable joint trajectories for a low-cost 4-DoF desktop arm. ESFP
comprises four sequential modules. (1) Estimating: ROMP lifts each frame to a
24-joint 3-D skeleton. (2) Smoothing: the proposed HPSTM-a sequence-to-sequence
Transformer with self-attention-combines long-range temporal context with a
differentiable forward-kinematics decoder, enforcing constant bone lengths and
anatomical plausibility while jointly predicting joint means and full
covariances. (3) Filtering: root-normalized trajectories are variance-weighted
according to HPSTM's uncertainty estimates, suppressing residual noise. (4)
Pose-Mapping: a geometric retargeting layer transforms shoulder-elbow-wrist
triples into the uArm's polar workspace, preserving wrist orientation.

### [86] [Step-by-Step Video-to-Audio Synthesis via Negative Audio Guidance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20995)
*Akio Hayakawa,Masato Ishii,Takashi Shibuya,Yuki Mitsufuji*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a sequential video-to-audio generation method to produce distinct audio tracks for different sound events in a video, using text prompts and previous audio as guidance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of generating comprehensive audio tracks for videos, mimicking traditional Foley workflows without reliance on specialized paired datasets.

Method: The method utilizes a guided video-to-audio synthesis task, conditioned on text prompts and previously generated audio, supported by pre-trained video-to-audio models.

Result: Experiments indicate the method produces semantically distinct audio tracks for videos, achieving higher-quality composite audio synthesis compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: The approach successfully surpasses current baselines in generating coherent and comprehensive audio for video content.

Abstract: We propose a novel step-by-step video-to-audio generation method that
sequentially produces individual audio tracks, each corresponding to a specific
sound event in the video. Our approach mirrors traditional Foley workflows,
aiming to capture all sound events induced by a given video comprehensively.
Each generation step is formulated as a guided video-to-audio synthesis task,
conditioned on a target text prompt and previously generated audio tracks. This
design is inspired by the idea of concept negation from prior compositional
generation frameworks. To enable this guided generation, we introduce a
training framework that leverages pre-trained video-to-audio models and
eliminates the need for specialized paired datasets, allowing training on more
accessible data. Experimental results demonstrate that our method generates
multiple semantically distinct audio tracks for a single input video, leading
to higher-quality composite audio synthesis than existing baselines.

*Yeon-Ji Song,Jaein Kim,Byung-Ju Kim,Byoung-Tak Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a method, DBMovi-GS, for synthesizing realistic dynamic scenes from blurry monocular videos using dense 3D Gaussians.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To resolve the limitations of current novel view synthesis methods, which struggle with dynamic scenes and blurry videos due to their reliance on static geometry assumptions and high-resolution inputs.

Method: The method, DBMovi-GS, uses sparse-controlled Gaussian splatting to restore sharpness from blurry videos and to reconstruct detailed 3D geometry for dynamic view synthesis.

Result: DBMovi-GS achieves robust performance in generating realistic novel views even under dynamic and blurry conditions and sets a new benchmark for this task.

Conclusion: The proposed DBMovi-GS method effectively addresses the challenges of dynamic scenes and blurry inputs in view synthesis, offering improved stability and visual fidelity.

Abstract: Novel view synthesis is a task of generating scenes from unseen perspectives;
however, synthesizing dynamic scenes from blurry monocular videos remains an
unresolved challenge that has yet to be effectively addressed. Existing novel
view synthesis methods are often constrained by their reliance on
high-resolution images or strong assumptions about static geometry and rigid
scene priors. Consequently, their approaches lack robustness in real-world
environments with dynamic object and camera motion, leading to instability and
degraded visual fidelity. To address this, we propose Motion-aware Dynamic View
Synthesis from Blurry Monocular Video via Sparse-Controlled Gaussian Splatting
(DBMovi-GS), a method designed for dynamic view synthesis from blurry monocular
videos. Our model generates dense 3D Gaussians, restoring sharpness from blurry
videos and reconstructing detailed 3D geometry of the scene affected by dynamic
motion variations. Our model achieves robust performance in novel view
synthesis under dynamic blurry scenes and sets a new benchmark in realistic
novel view synthesis for blurry monocular video inputs.

*Behrooz Nasihatkon,Hossein Resani,Amirreza Mehrzadian*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ToosiCubix proposes a cost-effective method for annotating 3D cuboids of vehicles using only monocular images and intrinsic camera parameters, requiring about 10 user clicks per vehicle.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 3D vehicle annotation tools often require expensive and complex hardware setups like camera-LiDAR systems, making them unsuitable for large-scale use.

Method: ToosiCubix uses monocular imagery and intrinsic camera parameters, combining feature-specific annotations and geometric constraints to estimate 8 DoF parameters. An optimization technique alternates between Perspective-n-Points and least-squares methods, supplemented by probabilistic size priors to achieve 9 DoF cuboid positions.

Result: The approach was validated on KITTI and Cityscapes3D datasets, where it showed cost-effectiveness and scalability while providing accurate 3D cuboid annotations.

Conclusion: This method simplifies and lowers the cost of 3D cuboid annotation, making it a scalable solution for datasets originally lacking specialized 3D equipment.

Abstract: Many existing methods for 3D cuboid annotation of vehicles rely on expensive
and carefully calibrated camera-LiDAR or stereo setups, limiting their
accessibility for large-scale data collection. We introduce ToosiCubix, a
simple yet powerful approach for annotating ground-truth cuboids using only
monocular images and intrinsic camera parameters. Our method requires only
about 10 user clicks per vehicle, making it highly practical for adding 3D
annotations to existing datasets originally collected without specialized
equipment. By annotating specific features (e.g., wheels, car badge,
symmetries) across different vehicle parts, we accurately estimate each
vehicle's position, orientation, and dimensions up to a scale ambiguity (8
DoF). The geometric constraints are formulated as an optimization problem,
which we solve using a coordinate descent strategy, alternating between
Perspective-n-Points (PnP) and least-squares subproblems. To handle common
ambiguities such as scale and unobserved dimensions, we incorporate
probabilistic size priors, enabling 9 DoF cuboid placements. We validate our
annotations against the KITTI and Cityscapes3D datasets, demonstrating that our
method offers a cost-effective and scalable solution for high-quality 3D cuboid
annotation.

*Qiuyi Qi,Xin Li,Ming Kong,Zikang Xu,Bingdi Chen,Qiang Zhu,S Kevin Zhou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces a method, SAIC, to create high-quality pathological image compositions to improve abnormal cell detection in cytopathology.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To tackle challenges such as lack of quality annotations, long-tailed data, and inconsistent staining in cytopathology, which hinder robust abnormal cell detection by neural networks.

Method: The SAIC method selects candidates from an abnormal cell bank, applies high-frequency feature reconstruction for image composition, and filters high-quality synthesized images using a vision-language model.

Result: SAIC-synthesized images notably enhance detection performance and robustness for tail categories and varying styles in abnormal cell detection.

Conclusion: SAIC shows significant potential for improving detection accuracy in cytopathology and demonstrates generalizability and practical value for clinical use.

Abstract: Challenges such as the lack of high-quality annotations, long-tailed data
distributions, and inconsistent staining styles pose significant obstacles to
training neural networks to detect abnormal cells in cytopathology robustly.
This paper proposes a style-aligned image composition (SAIC) method that
composes high-fidelity and style-preserved pathological images to enhance the
effectiveness and robustness of detection models. Without additional training,
SAIC first selects an appropriate candidate from the abnormal cell bank based
on attribute guidance. Then, it employs a high-frequency feature reconstruction
to achieve a style-aligned and high-fidelity composition of abnormal cells and
pathological backgrounds. Finally, it introduces a large vision-language model
to filter high-quality synthesis images. Experimental results demonstrate that
incorporating SAIC-synthesized images effectively enhances the performance and
robustness of abnormal cell detection for tail categories and styles, thereby
improving overall detection performance. The comprehensive quality evaluation
further confirms the generalizability and practicality of SAIC in clinical
application scenarios. Our code will be released at

### [90] [EndoFlow-SLAM: Real-Time Endoscopic SLAM with Flow-Constrained Gaussian Splatting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21420)
*Taoyu Wu,Yiyi Miao,Zhuoxiao Li,Haocheng Zhao,Kang Dang,Jionglong Su,Limin Yu,Haoang Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper enhances 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS)-based SLAM for endoscopic surgical scenarios by adding optical flow loss and depth regularization, achieving superior 3D reconstruction, pose estimation, and rendering results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address challenges in 3D reconstruction and SLAM for endoscopic surgery, such as photometric inconsistencies and dynamic motion caused by breathing.

Method: The authors introduce optical flow loss as a geometric constraint, depth regularization to combat photometric inconsistencies, and refined a 3DGS-based SLAM system to improve rendering from suboptimal keyframes.

Result: The proposed approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods on the C3VD static dataset and StereoMIS dynamic dataset for novel view synthesis and pose estimation tasks.

Conclusion: The paper provides an improved 3DGS-based SLAM approach tailored to dynamic and static endoscopic surgical scenarios, achieving better rendering quality and performance, with plans to release the source code.

Abstract: Efficient three-dimensional reconstruction and real-time visualization are
critical in surgical scenarios such as endoscopy. In recent years, 3D Gaussian
Splatting (3DGS) has demonstrated remarkable performance in efficient 3D
reconstruction and rendering. Most 3DGS-based Simultaneous Localization and
Mapping (SLAM) methods only rely on the appearance constraints for optimizing
both 3DGS and camera poses. However, in endoscopic scenarios, the challenges
include photometric inconsistencies caused by non-Lambertian surfaces and
dynamic motion from breathing affects the performance of SLAM systems. To
address these issues, we additionally introduce optical flow loss as a
geometric constraint, which effectively constrains both the 3D structure of the
scene and the camera motion. Furthermore, we propose a depth regularisation
strategy to mitigate the problem of photometric inconsistencies and ensure the
validity of 3DGS depth rendering in endoscopic scenes. In addition, to improve
scene representation in the SLAM system, we improve the 3DGS refinement
strategy by focusing on viewpoints corresponding to Keyframes with suboptimal
rendering quality frames, achieving better rendering results. Extensive
experiments on the C3VD static dataset and the StereoMIS dynamic dataset
demonstrate that our method outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in
novel view synthesis and pose estimation, exhibiting high performance in both
static and dynamic surgical scenes. The source code will be publicly available
upon paper acceptance.

TL;DR: The paper proposes methods to detect and respond to misuse risks linked to Scene Text Removal (STR), focusing on detecting and localizing removed text while exploring text recovery.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: STR originally aimed to remove sensitive or undesired text from images but faces misuse risks, prompting the need for tools to analyze STR-processed images.

Method: Inverse STR (ISTR) is introduced using binary classification to detect STR usage and localization techniques for removed text, alongside experiments with text recovery.

Result: Experiments show high accuracy in detecting and localizing removed text regions, demonstrating the feasibility of addressing misuse risks.

Conclusion: This study contributes methods to combat STR misuse and explores challenges in recovering removed text, advancing the STR field's ethical and technical aspects.

Abstract: Scene text removal (STR) aims to erase textual elements from images. It was
originally intended for removing privacy-sensitiveor undesired texts from
natural scene images, but is now also appliedto typographic images. STR
typically detects text regions and theninpaints them. Although STR has advanced
through neural networksand synthetic data, misuse risks have increased. This
paper investi-gates Inverse STR (ISTR), which analyzes STR-processed images
andfocuses on binary classification (detecting whether an image has un-dergone
STR) and localizing removed text regions. We demonstrate inexperiments that
these tasks are achievable with high accuracies, en-abling detection of
potential misuse and improving STR. We also at-tempt to recover the removed
text content by training a text recognizerto understand its difficulty.

*Lam-Huy Nguyen,Thinh-Phuc Nguyen,Thanh-Hai Nguyen,Gia-Huy Dinh,Minh-Triet Tran,Trung-Nghia Le*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The study introduces VisionGuard, a multi-stage framework designed to enhance helmet violation detection among motorcyclists using Adaptive Labeling and Contextual Expander modules.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current helmet violation detection systems struggle with environmental variability, inconsistent data, and class imbalances, affecting their efficiency in promoting road safety.

Method: VisionGuard employs two modules: Adaptive Labeling improves classification by refining labels using tracking, and Contextual Expander generates virtual bounding boxes to address class imbalance.

Result: VisionGuard achieved a 3.1% improvement in mean Average Precision (mAP) over baseline detectors, indicating enhanced performance.

Conclusion: The framework showcases its viability for deployment in traffic surveillance systems, reinforcing road safety and regulatory compliance.

Abstract: Enforcing helmet regulations among motorcyclists is essential for enhancing
road safety and ensuring the effectiveness of traffic management systems.
However, automatic detection of helmet violations faces significant challenges
due to environmental variability, camera angles, and inconsistencies in the
data. These factors hinder reliable detection of motorcycles and riders and
disrupt consistent object classification. To address these challenges, we
propose VisionGuard, a synergistic multi-stage framework designed to overcome
the limitations of frame-wise detectors, especially in scenarios with class
imbalance and inconsistent annotations. VisionGuard integrates two key
components: Adaptive Labeling and Contextual Expander modules. The Adaptive
Labeling module is a tracking-based refinement technique that enhances
classification consistency by leveraging a tracking algorithm to assign
persistent labels across frames and correct misclassifications. The Contextual
Expander module improves recall for underrepresented classes by generating
virtual bounding boxes with appropriate confidence scores, effectively
addressing the impact of data imbalance. Experimental results show that
VisionGuard improves overall mAP by 3.1% compared to baseline detectors,
demonstrating its effectiveness and potential for real-world deployment in
traffic surveillance systems, ultimately promoting safety and regulatory
compliance.

*Jianyun Xu,Song Wang,Ziqian Ni,Chunyong Hu,Sheng Yang,Jianke Zhu,Qiang Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces SAM4D, a foundational model for segmentation across camera and LiDAR streams, using innovative techniques for multi-modal alignment and temporal consistency with automated data generation for annotation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the challenge of robust multi-modal segmentation for dynamic autonomous driving scenarios while reducing the dependency on manual annotation.

Method: The authors propose two key innovations: Unified Multi-modal Positional Encoding (UMPE) for aligning camera and LiDAR features in 3D space, and Motion-aware Cross-modal Memory Attention (MCMA) to improve temporal consistency using ego-motion compensation. They also design an automated data engine for generating pseudo-labels efficiently.

Result: Experimental results on the newly created Waymo-4DSeg dataset show that SAM4D achieves strong cross-modal segmentation capabilities and significantly accelerates the data annotation process.

Conclusion: SAM4D demonstrates robust segmentation performance across camera and LiDAR streams, improving both alignment and efficiency, and holds promise for scalable annotation in autonomous driving applications.

Abstract: We present SAM4D, a multi-modal and temporal foundation model designed for
promptable segmentation across camera and LiDAR streams. Unified Multi-modal
Positional Encoding (UMPE) is introduced to align camera and LiDAR features in
a shared 3D space, enabling seamless cross-modal prompting and interaction.
Additionally, we propose Motion-aware Cross-modal Memory Attention (MCMA),
which leverages ego-motion compensation to enhance temporal consistency and
long-horizon feature retrieval, ensuring robust segmentation across dynamically
changing autonomous driving scenes. To avoid annotation bottlenecks, we develop
a multi-modal automated data engine that synergizes VFM-driven video masklets,
spatiotemporal 4D reconstruction, and cross-modal masklet fusion. This
framework generates camera-LiDAR aligned pseudo-labels at a speed orders of
magnitude faster than human annotation while preserving VFM-derived semantic
fidelity in point cloud representations. We conduct extensive experiments on
the constructed Waymo-4DSeg, which demonstrate the powerful cross-modal
segmentation ability and great potential in data annotation of proposed SAM4D.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The study introduces a deep learning framework combining Forward-Forward Contrastive Learning (FFCL) and the Segment Anything Model (SAM) to improve tumor margin assessment during lumpectomy, achieving significant accuracy and speed boosts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The current method for assessing tumor margin status during breast cancer surgery, 2D specimen radiography, has limited accuracy, leading to frequent additional surgeries. There is a pressing need for a faster and more precise approach to enhance surgical outcomes.

Method: The authors pre-annotated SR images with regions of known malignancy and pathology-confirmed margins. They pre-trained a ResNet-18 backbone using Forward-Forward Contrastive Learning (FFCL). Coarse classification results were used to prompt the Segment Anything Model (SAM) for refined tumor margin segmentation.

Result: The proposed framework achieved an AUC of 0.8455 for tumor margin classification and improved segmentation Dice similarity by 27.4% compared to baseline models. It also reduced inference time to just 47 milliseconds per image.

Conclusion: FFCL-SAM significantly enhances the accuracy and speed of intraoperative breast cancer margin assessment, offering the potential to reduce re-excision rates and improve surgical outcomes.

Abstract: Complete removal of cancer tumors with a negative specimen margin during
lumpectomy is essential in reducing breast cancer recurrence. However, 2D
specimen radiography (SR), the current method used to assess intraoperative
specimen margin status, has limited accuracy, resulting in nearly a quarter of
patients requiring additional surgery. To address this, we propose a novel deep
learning framework combining the Segment Anything Model (SAM) with
Forward-Forward Contrastive Learning (FFCL), a pre-training strategy leveraging
both local and global contrastive learning for patch-level classification of SR
images. After annotating SR images with regions of known maligancy,
non-malignant tissue, and pathology-confirmed margins, we pre-train a ResNet-18
backbone with FFCL to classify margin status, then reconstruct coarse binary
masks to prompt SAM for refined tumor margin segmentation. Our approach
achieved an AUC of 0.8455 for margin classification and segmented margins with
a 27.4% improvement in Dice similarity over baseline models, while reducing
inference time to 47 milliseconds per image. These results demonstrate that
FFCL-SAM significantly enhances both the speed and accuracy of intraoperative
margin assessment, with strong potential to reduce re-excision rates and
improve surgical outcomes in breast cancer treatment. Our code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To simulate first-person human actions and their impact on the environment using egocentric video prediction.

Method: Trained an auto-regressive conditional diffusion transformer model on a large-scale dataset (Nymeria), using kinematic pose trajectories structured by the body's joint hierarchy.

Result: Developed the PEVA model and designed hierarchical evaluation protocols to analyze its video prediction and embodied control capabilities on challenging tasks.

Conclusion: Initial progress in modeling human actions and complex real-world environments through egocentric video prediction and embodied agent behavior analysis.

Abstract: We train models to Predict Ego-centric Video from human Actions (PEVA), given
the past video and an action represented by the relative 3D body pose. By
conditioning on kinematic pose trajectories, structured by the joint hierarchy
of the body, our model learns to simulate how physical human actions shape the
environment from a first-person point of view. We train an auto-regressive
conditional diffusion transformer on Nymeria, a large-scale dataset of
real-world egocentric video and body pose capture. We further design a
hierarchical evaluation protocol with increasingly challenging tasks, enabling
a comprehensive analysis of the model's embodied prediction and control
abilities. Our work represents an initial attempt to tackle the challenges of
modeling complex real-world environments and embodied agent behaviors with
video prediction from the perspective of a human.

*Bang Gong,Luchao Qi,Jiaye Wu,Zhicheng Fu,Chunbo Song,David W. Jacobs,John Nicholson,Roni Sengupta*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces the "Aging Multiverse," a facial aging framework for generating diverse aging scenarios based on external conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current facial aging techniques mostly follow a single deterministic path and fail to account for how external factors like health or lifestyle could influence aging.

Method: Proposes a training-free, diffusion-based mechanism combining attention mixing and simulated aging regularization for controlled and realistic outputs.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art results in identity preservation, aging realism, and condition alignment, outperforming previous models.

Conclusion: The "Aging Multiverse" allows aging to be represented as a multidimensional, interpretable process with applications in storytelling, education, and personalized visualization.

Abstract: We introduce the Aging Multiverse, a framework for generating multiple
plausible facial aging trajectories from a single image, each conditioned on
external factors such as environment, health, and lifestyle. Unlike prior
methods that model aging as a single deterministic path, our approach creates
an aging tree that visualizes diverse futures. To enable this, we propose a
training-free diffusion-based method that balances identity preservation, age
accuracy, and condition control. Our key contributions include attention mixing
to modulate editing strength and a Simulated Aging Regularization strategy to
stabilize edits. Extensive experiments and user studies demonstrate
state-of-the-art performance across identity preservation, aging realism, and
conditional alignment, outperforming existing editing and age-progression
models, which often fail to account for one or more of the editing criteria. By
transforming aging into a multi-dimensional, controllable, and interpretable
process, our approach opens up new creative and practical avenues in digital
storytelling, health education, and personalized visualization.

TL;DR: The paper enhances augmented reality (AR) for novel view synthesis using locally reconstructed light fields to achieve better results with fewer view samples and less user effort.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To simplify the mentally demanding task of AR view sample collection and overcome constraints of predefined small capture areas.

Method: The authors propose locally reconstructed light fields to visualize errors, enabling insertion of new views without relying on 3D annotations. This method also integrates error-peaking for improved user experience.

Result: The approach reduces user frustration, needs fewer view samples, and contributes to larger scene radiance field reconstructions such as 3D Gaussian splatting.

Conclusion: This innovative visualization technique makes AR data collection more intuitive and effective for both small and large scenes.

Abstract: Augmented reality (AR) provides ways to visualize missing view samples for
novel view synthesis. Existing approaches present 3D annotations for new view
samples and task users with taking images by aligning the AR display. This data
collection task is known to be mentally demanding and limits capture areas to
pre-defined small areas due to the ideal but restrictive underlying sampling
theory. To free users from 3D annotations and limited scene exploration, we
propose using locally reconstructed light fields and visualizing errors to be
removed by inserting new views. Our results show that the error-peaking
visualization is less invasive, reduces disappointment in final results, and is
satisfactory with fewer view samples in our mobile view synthesis system. We
also show that our approach can contribute to recent radiance field
reconstruction for larger scenes, such as 3D Gaussian splatting.

### [98] [Bridging Video Quality Scoring and Justification via Large Multimodal Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21011)
*Qizhi Xie,Kun Yuan,Yunpeng Qu,Jiachao Gong,Mingda Wu,Ming Sun,Chao Zhou,Jihong Zhu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Traditional methods of video quality assessment (VQA) rely on numerical scores, limiting their ability to address complex quality dimensions. This paper proposes the Score-based Instruction Generation (SIG) pipeline that generates linguistic data for video quality assessment, enabling better reasoning and scalability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to overcome limitations of numerical scores in video quality assessment by leveraging large multimodal models (LMMs) to describe complex video quality dimensions using instructional data.

Method: The authors developed the SIG pipeline, which scores multiple quality dimensions of videos and maps them to text-defined levels using hierarchical Chain-of-Thought reasoning. This approach eliminates reliance on human annotations and proprietary systems, generating a scalable dataset (S2I) for instruction tuning.

Result: The proposed method produced the S2I dataset with over 320K instruction-response pairs and curated a benchmark (S2I-Bench) with 400 questions for evaluation. Experimental results showed enhanced video LMM performance in scoring and quality justification across existing benchmarks.

Conclusion: Using the SIG pipeline, the paper successfully moves beyond numerical VQA methods, enabling scalable, linguistic-driven assessments that enhance video LMM scoring and reasoning capacities.

Abstract: Classical video quality assessment (VQA) methods generate a numerical score
to judge a video's perceived visual fidelity and clarity. Yet, a score fails to
describe the video's complex quality dimensions, restricting its applicability.
Benefiting from the linguistic output, adapting video large multimodal models
(LMMs) to VQA via instruction tuning has the potential to address this issue.
The core of the approach lies in the video quality-centric instruction data.
Previous explorations mainly focus on the image domain, and their data
generation processes heavily rely on human quality annotations and proprietary
systems, limiting data scalability and effectiveness. To address these
challenges, we propose the Score-based Instruction Generation (SIG) pipeline.
Specifically, SIG first scores multiple quality dimensions of an unlabeled
video and maps scores to text-defined levels. It then explicitly incorporates a
hierarchical Chain-of-Thought (CoT) to model the correlation between specific
dimensions and overall quality, mimicking the human visual system's reasoning
process. The automated pipeline eliminates the reliance on expert-written
quality descriptions and proprietary systems, ensuring data scalability and
generation efficiency. To this end, the resulting Score2Instruct (S2I) dataset
contains over 320K diverse instruction-response pairs, laying the basis for
instruction tuning. Moreover, to advance video LMMs' quality scoring and
justification abilities simultaneously, we devise a progressive tuning strategy
to fully unleash the power of S2I. Built upon SIG, we further curate a
benchmark termed S2I-Bench with 400 open-ended questions to better evaluate the
quality justification capacity of video LMMs. Experimental results on the
S2I-Bench and existing benchmarks indicate that our method consistently
improves quality scoring and justification capabilities across multiple video
LMMs.

*Huan Wang,Haoran Li,Huaming Chen,Jun Yan,Jiahua Shi,Jun Shen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper presents Federated Learning with Semantic-Aware Collaboration (FedSC), which aims to address data heterogeneity in federated learning by leveraging intra-client semantic knowledge.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper seeks to address the data heterogeneity issue in federated learning, where biased labeling preferences across clients hinder effective model training, by leveraging clients' inherent semantic information.

Method: FedSC constructs semantic-level relational and consistent prototypes. It employs inter-contrastive learning to align instance-level embeddings with relational prototypes and uses discrepancy aggregation to create consistent prototypes as a regularization penalty for optimization.

Result: Experimental evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness of FedSC in improving federated learning performance across various challenging settings. The approach shows efficiency in handling data heterogeneity.

Conclusion: FedSC offers a semantic-aware solution for federated learning, ensuring better collaboration and tackling data heterogeneity while providing theoretical convergence guarantees.

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) aims to train models collaboratively across clients
without sharing data for privacy-preserving. However, one major challenge is
the data heterogeneity issue, which refers to the biased labeling preferences
at multiple clients. A number of existing FL methods attempt to tackle data
heterogeneity locally (e.g., regularizing local models) or globally (e.g.,
fine-tuning global model), often neglecting inherent semantic information
contained in each client. To explore the possibility of using intra-client
semantically meaningful knowledge in handling data heterogeneity, in this
paper, we propose Federated Learning with Semantic-Aware Collaboration (FedSC)
to capture client-specific and class-relevant knowledge across heterogeneous
clients. The core idea of FedSC is to construct relational prototypes and
consistent prototypes at semantic-level, aiming to provide fruitful class
underlying knowledge and stable convergence signals in a prototype-wise
collaborative way. On the one hand, FedSC introduces an inter-contrastive
learning strategy to bring instance-level embeddings closer to relational
prototypes with the same semantics and away from distinct classes. On the other
hand, FedSC devises consistent prototypes via a discrepancy aggregation manner,
as a regularization penalty to constrain the optimization region of the local
model. Moreover, a theoretical analysis for FedSC is provided to ensure a
convergence guarantee. Experimental results on various challenging scenarios
demonstrate the effectiveness of FedSC and the efficiency of crucial
components.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improve data augmentation in skin disease detection by addressing challenges in class imbalance, privacy concerns, and object bias.

Method: Developed a classical-quantum latent space fusion technique for a hybrid GAN model that generates color medical images and evaluated it on real quantum hardware.

Result: The model generated high-quality color images, enhanced classification performance with fewer parameters and epochs, and demonstrated robustness on noisy quantum hardware.

Conclusion: Quantum image generation has significant potential as quantum hardware improves, offering efficient alternatives to classical methods.

Abstract: Machine learning-assisted diagnosis is gaining traction in skin disease
detection, but training effective models requires large amounts of high-quality
data. Skin disease datasets often suffer from class imbalance, privacy
concerns, and object bias, making data augmentation essential. While classical
generative models are widely used, they demand extensive computational
resources and lengthy training time. Quantum computing offers a promising
alternative, but existing quantum-based image generation methods can only yield
grayscale low-quality images. Through a novel classical-quantum latent space
fusion technique, our work overcomes this limitation and introduces the first
classical-quantum generative adversarial network (GAN) capable of generating
color medical images. Our model outperforms classical deep convolutional GANs
and existing hybrid classical-quantum GANs in both image generation quality and
classification performance boost when used as data augmentation. Moreover, the
performance boost is comparable with that achieved using state-of-the-art
classical generative models, yet with over 25 times fewer parameters and 10
times fewer training epochs. Such results suggest a promising future for
quantum image generation as quantum hardware advances. Finally, we demonstrate
the robust performance of our model on real IBM quantum machine with hardware
noise.

### [101] [Multimodal Prompt Alignment for Facial Expression Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21017)
*Fuyan Ma,Yiran He,Bin Sun,Shutao Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces MPA-FER, a multimodal prompt alignment framework to improve facial expression recognition (FER) using vision-language models (VLMs).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current VLM-based FER methods struggle to capture subtle textual-visual relationships critical for differentiating fine-grained facial expressions.

Method: The proposed method utilizes a multi-granularity hard prompt generation strategy backed by a large language model (LLM) like ChatGPT and includes prototype-guided visual feature alignment, along with a cross-modal global-local alignment module.

Result: MPA-FER effectively aligns visual and textual features, resulting in precise FER performances, surpassing state-of-the-art methods across three benchmark datasets.

Conclusion: The framework enhances FER accuracy and interpretability while maintaining pretrained model benefits and minimizing computational overhead.

Abstract: Prompt learning has been widely adopted to efficiently adapt vision-language
models (VLMs) like CLIP for various downstream tasks. Despite their success,
current VLM-based facial expression recognition (FER) methods struggle to
capture fine-grained textual-visual relationships, which are essential for
distinguishing subtle differences between facial expressions. To address this
challenge, we propose a multimodal prompt alignment framework for FER, called
MPA-FER, that provides fine-grained semantic guidance to the learning process
of prompted visual features, resulting in more precise and interpretable
representations. Specifically, we introduce a multi-granularity hard prompt
generation strategy that utilizes a large language model (LLM) like ChatGPT to
generate detailed descriptions for each facial expression. The LLM-based
external knowledge is injected into the soft prompts by minimizing the feature
discrepancy between the soft prompts and the hard prompts. To preserve the
generalization abilities of the pretrained CLIP model, our approach
incorporates prototype-guided visual feature alignment, ensuring that the
prompted visual features from the frozen image encoder align closely with
class-specific prototypes. Additionally, we propose a cross-modal global-local
alignment module that focuses on expression-relevant facial features, further
improving the alignment between textual and visual features. Extensive
experiments demonstrate our framework outperforms state-of-the-art methods on
three FER benchmark datasets, while retaining the benefits of the pretrained
model and minimizing computational costs.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces LASFNet, a lightweight multimodal object detection network utilizing a single fusion unit to simplify training and improve performance. It achieves better efficiency-accuracy trade-offs with lower computational costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the computational complexity and efficiency challenges involved in multimodal object detection using feature-level fusion.

Method: Introduce LASFNet, combining the Attention-Guided Self-Modulation Feature Fusion (ASFF) module and Feature Attention Transformation Module (FATM) within a single fusion detection unit to adjust and enhance feature integration.

Result: Experiments show that LASFNet reduces parameters and computational cost by up to 90% and 85% respectively, while improving detection accuracy (mAP) by 1%-3% compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: The proposed LASFNet achieves substantial computational efficiency and accuracy improvements, making it a superior baseline for multimodal object detection tasks.

Abstract: Effective deep feature extraction via feature-level fusion is crucial for
multimodal object detection. However, previous studies often involve complex
training processes that integrate modality-specific features by stacking
multiple feature-level fusion units, leading to significant computational
overhead. To address this issue, we propose a new fusion detection baseline
that uses a single feature-level fusion unit to enable high-performance
detection, thereby simplifying the training process. Based on this approach, we
propose a lightweight attention-guided self-modulation feature fusion network
(LASFNet), which introduces a novel attention-guided self-modulation feature
fusion (ASFF) module that adaptively adjusts the responses of fusion features
at both global and local levels based on attention information from different
modalities, thereby promoting comprehensive and enriched feature generation.
Additionally, a lightweight feature attention transformation module (FATM) is
designed at the neck of LASFNet to enhance the focus on fused features and
minimize information loss. Extensive experiments on three representative
datasets demonstrate that, compared to state-of-the-art methods, our approach
achieves a favorable efficiency-accuracy trade-off, reducing the number of
parameters and computational cost by as much as 90% and 85%, respectively,
while improving detection accuracy (mAP) by 1%-3%. The code will be

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces a 1D binary latent space approach for image tokenization, significantly reducing token count while preserving high-resolution details and improving computational efficiency for image generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High computational demands of handling high-resolution images necessitate more efficient image tokenization methods to enhance performance in image and multimodal understanding and generation tasks.

Method: The paper proposes representing images as sequences of binary vectors in a 1D latent space, which replaces traditional one-hot codebook tokens. This method allows for compact, high-resolution image representation and efficient use of computational resources.

Result: The approach achieved competitive performance on text-to-image generation tasks using just 128 discrete tokens for images up to 1024x1024, demonstrating a 32-fold reduction in token numbers compared to VQ-VAEs. It also showed improved training and inference speed.

Conclusion: The 1D binary latent space model offers a scalable, efficient, and competitive alternative to existing image tokenization methods, fitting within limited computational resources without the need for additional refinements or private datasets.

Abstract: Image tokenization plays a critical role in reducing the computational
demands of modeling high-resolution images, significantly improving the
efficiency of image and multimodal understanding and generation. Recent
advances in 1D latent spaces have reduced the number of tokens required by
eliminating the need for a 2D grid structure. In this paper, we further advance
compact discrete image representation by introducing 1D binary image latents.
By representing each image as a sequence of binary vectors, rather than using
traditional one-hot codebook tokens, our approach preserves high-resolution
details while maintaining the compactness of 1D latents. To the best of our
knowledge, our text-to-image models are the first to achieve competitive
performance in both diffusion and auto-regressive generation using just 128
discrete tokens for images up to 1024x1024, demonstrating up to a 32-fold
reduction in token numbers compared to standard VQ-VAEs. The proposed 1D binary
latent space, coupled with simple model architectures, achieves marked
improvements in speed training and inference speed. Our text-to-image models
allow for a global batch size of 4096 on a single GPU node with 8 AMD MI300X
GPUs, and the training can be completed within 200 GPU days. Our models achieve
competitive performance compared to modern image generation models without any
in-house private training data or post-training refinements, offering a
scalable and efficient alternative to conventional tokenization methods.

*Wenzhou Lyu,Jialing Lin,Wenqi Ren,Ruihao Xia,Feng Qian,Yang Tang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces DidSee, a diffusion-based framework that addresses challenges in depth completion for non-Lambertian objects caused by noisy data and limited visual features. It proposes innovations to improve bias handling, training methodology, and includes a semantic enhancer for enhanced results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the challenges of incomplete and noisy depth maps for non-Lambertian objects and to improve generalization in depth completion tasks, which are limited by conventional approaches.

Method: The authors propose DidSee, which includes a rescaled noise scheduler to reduce signal leakage, a noise-agnostic single-step training method to minimize exposure bias, and a semantic enhancer for joint depth completion and semantic segmentation.

Result: DidSee achieves state-of-the-art performance on benchmarks, exhibits strong generalizability to real-world scenarios, and enhances downstream tasks like pose estimation and robotic grasping.

Conclusion: DidSee effectively addresses biases and lack of visual features in non-Lambertian objects, providing precise depth maps and proving its utility in improving several downstream applications.

Abstract: Commercial RGB-D cameras often produce noisy, incomplete depth maps for
non-Lambertian objects. Traditional depth completion methods struggle to
generalize due to the limited diversity and scale of training data. Recent
advances exploit visual priors from pre-trained text-to-image diffusion models
to enhance generalization in dense prediction tasks. However, we find that
biases arising from training-inference mismatches in the vanilla diffusion
framework significantly impair depth completion performance. Additionally, the
lack of distinct visual features in non-Lambertian regions further hinders
precise prediction. To address these issues, we propose \textbf{DidSee}, a
diffusion-based framework for depth completion on non-Lambertian objects.
First, we integrate a rescaled noise scheduler enforcing a zero terminal
signal-to-noise ratio to eliminate signal leakage bias. Second, we devise a
noise-agnostic single-step training formulation to alleviate error accumulation
caused by exposure bias and optimize the model with a task-specific loss.
Finally, we incorporate a semantic enhancer that enables joint depth completion
and semantic segmentation, distinguishing objects from backgrounds and yielding
precise, fine-grained depth maps. DidSee achieves state-of-the-art performance
on multiple benchmarks, demonstrates robust real-world generalization, and
effectively improves downstream tasks such as category-level pose estimation
and robotic grasping.Project page: https://wenzhoulyu.github.io/DidSee/

### [105] [Boosting Domain Generalized and Adaptive Detection with Diffusion Models: Fitness, Generalization, and Transferability](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21042)
*Boyong He,Yuxiang Ji,Zhuoyue Tan,Liaoni Wu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper addresses domain adaptation and generalization for object detection by leveraging diffusion models to enhance feature extraction and fusion, achieving better performance and reduced inference costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The performance of object detectors drops due to the domain gap between training and testing data. Previous methods using diffusion models for domain tasks face high inference costs and underutilization of the model's capabilities.

Method: The authors enhance feature fusion using a single-step diffusion process, reducing inference time, creating an auxiliary branch with box-masked images for robust feature extraction, and aligning ordinary and auxiliary branches using consistency loss. They integrate feature- and object-level alignment for standard detectors in a unified framework.

Result: The proposed method achieves strong results on both domain generalization (5 benchmarks) and domain adaptation (3 benchmarks) tasks. It excels in handling large domain shifts and low-data settings, particularly in the COCO generalization benchmark, demonstrating efficiency and effectiveness.

Conclusion: Applying diffusion models significantly improves domain generalization and adaptation for detection tasks, reducing computational costs and providing a valuable approach for cross-domain visual perception challenges.

Abstract: Detectors often suffer from performance drop due to domain gap between
training and testing data. Recent methods explore diffusion models applied to
domain generalization (DG) and adaptation (DA) tasks, but still struggle with
large inference costs and have not yet fully leveraged the capabilities of
diffusion models. We propose to tackle these problems by extracting
intermediate features from a single-step diffusion process, improving feature
collection and fusion to reduce inference time by 75% while enhancing
performance on source domains (i.e., Fitness). Then, we construct an
object-centered auxiliary branch by applying box-masked images with class
prompts to extract robust and domain-invariant features that focus on object.
We also apply consistency loss to align the auxiliary and ordinary branch,
balancing fitness and generalization while preventing overfitting and improving
performance on target domains (i.e., Generalization). Furthermore, within a
unified framework, standard detectors are guided by diffusion detectors through
feature-level and object-level alignment on source domains (for DG) and
unlabeled target domains (for DA), thereby improving cross-domain detection
performance (i.e., Transferability). Our method achieves competitive results on
3 DA benchmarks and 5 DG benchmarks. Additionally, experiments on COCO
generalization benchmark demonstrate that our method maintains significant
advantages and show remarkable efficiency in large domain shifts and low-data
scenarios. Our work shows the superiority of applying diffusion models to
domain generalized and adaptive detection tasks and offers valuable insights
for visual perception tasks across diverse domains. The code is available at

*Hansam Cho,Seoung Bum Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Faithfulness Guidance and Scheduling (FGS) to balance editability and faithfulness in text-guided image editing with diffusion models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The trade-off between editability (extent of modification) and faithfulness (preservation of unaltered elements) poses challenges in achieving optimal image editing results.

Method: The Faithfulness Guidance and Scheduling (FGS) method combines faithfulness guidance for preserving input image information and a scheduling strategy to align editability with faithfulness.

Result: FGS demonstrates superior faithfulness in preserving image details while maintaining editability in experimental results.

Conclusion: FGS enhances text-guided diffusion models' ability to deliver precise and high-quality image edits across diverse tasks, addressing misalignment issues effectively.

Abstract: Text-guided diffusion models have become essential for high-quality image
synthesis, enabling dynamic image editing. In image editing, two crucial
aspects are editability, which determines the extent of modification, and
faithfulness, which reflects how well unaltered elements are preserved.
However, achieving optimal results is challenging because of the inherent
trade-off between editability and faithfulness. To address this, we propose
Faithfulness Guidance and Scheduling (FGS), which enhances faithfulness with
minimal impact on editability. FGS incorporates faithfulness guidance to
strengthen the preservation of input image information and introduces a
scheduling strategy to resolve misalignment between editability and
faithfulness. Experimental results demonstrate that FGS achieves superior
faithfulness while maintaining editability. Moreover, its compatibility with
various editing methods enables precise, high-quality image edits across
diverse tasks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces dSVA, an attack exploiting self-supervised Vision Transformer (ViT) features to create highly transferable adversarial examples.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to improve the black-box transferability of adversarial perturbations by leveraging self-supervised learning features rather than traditional supervised approaches.

Method: The paper develops dSVA, a generative attack using dual self-supervised ViT features (contrastive learning and masked image modeling) along with a novel training framework to craft adversarial examples.

Result: Experiments demonstrate that combining global structural and local textural features achieves superior adversarial transferability across architectures, outperforming previous state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: Exploiting joint features and attention mechanisms of self-supervised ViTs significantly enhances adversarial example generalizability, setting a benchmark for black-box attacks.

Abstract: The ability of deep neural networks (DNNs) come from extracting and
interpreting features from the data provided. By exploiting intermediate
features in DNNs instead of relying on hard labels, we craft adversarial
perturbation that generalize more effectively, boosting black-box
transferability. These features ubiquitously come from supervised learning in
previous work. Inspired by the exceptional synergy between self-supervised
learning and the Transformer architecture, this paper explores whether
exploiting self-supervised Vision Transformer (ViT) representations can improve
adversarial transferability. We present dSVA -- a generative dual
self-supervised ViT features attack, that exploits both global structural
features from contrastive learning (CL) and local textural features from masked
image modeling (MIM), the self-supervised learning paradigm duo for ViTs. We
design a novel generative training framework that incorporates a generator to
create black-box adversarial examples, and strategies to train the generator by
exploiting joint features and the attention mechanism of self-supervised ViTs.
Our findings show that CL and MIM enable ViTs to attend to distinct feature
tendencies, which, when exploited in tandem, boast great adversarial
generalizability. By disrupting dual deep features distilled by self-supervised
ViTs, we are rewarded with remarkable black-box transferability to models of
various architectures that outperform state-of-the-arts. Code available at

TL;DR: The paper introduces a task called "Class-Agnostic Region-of-Interest Matching" meant for flexible document analysis. It proposes a benchmark and a framework for effective matching, achieving promising results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rigid nature of existing document analysis methods that lack user customization is a key weakness. The paper seeks to address this by enabling flexible applications at different granularities and category definitions.

Method: The authors propose a "RoI-Matching" task, creating a benchmark (RoI-Matching-Bench) with varying difficulty levels. They also introduce a framework (RoI-Matcher) using a Siamese network for feature extraction and cross-attention layers for semantic alignment.

Result: Experimental results show that RoI-Matcher delivers effective performance on the introduced benchmark, establishing a baseline for future research.

Conclusion: This work provides a promising direction for customizable document analysis tasks, combining high flexibility and efficiency with reliable metrics. The framework and benchmark open up new possibilities in document understanding and matching.

Abstract: Document understanding and analysis have received a lot of attention due to
their widespread application. However, existing document analysis solutions,
such as document layout analysis and key information extraction, are only
suitable for fixed category definitions and granularities, and cannot achieve
flexible applications customized by users. Therefore, this paper defines a new
task named ``Class-Agnostic Region-of-Interest Matching'' (``RoI-Matching'' for
short), which aims to match the customized regions in a flexible, efficient,
multi-granularity, and open-set manner. The visual prompt of the reference
document and target document images are fed into our model, while the output is
the corresponding bounding boxes in the target document images. To meet the
above requirements, we construct a benchmark RoI-Matching-Bench, which sets
three levels of difficulties following real-world conditions, and propose the
macro and micro metrics to evaluate. Furthermore, we also propose a new
framework RoI-Matcher, which employs a siamese network to extract multi-level
features both in the reference and target domains, and cross-attention layers
to integrate and align similar semantics in different domains. Experiments show
that our method with a simple procedure is effective on RoI-Matching-Bench, and
serves as the baseline for further research. The code is available at

TL;DR: This paper proposes SAMURAI, a hybrid framework for retrieving 3D objects in indoor environments, combining CLIP-based semantic matching with shape-guided re-ranking to address challenges like distorted viewpoints and ambiguous language.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address significant challenges in retrieving 3D objects using limited input such as masked 2D images and natural language descriptions in complex indoor settings.

Method: SAMURAI combines CLIP-based semantic matching with shape-guided re-ranking using binary silhouettes and employs preprocessing to improve mask quality.

Result: SAMURAI achieves competitive performance on the ROOMELSA private test set, validating the integration of shape priors with semantic understanding.

Conclusion: Integrating multimodal cues, including shape and language understanding, is crucial for effective open-world 3D object retrieval in challenging environments.

Abstract: Retrieving 3D objects in complex indoor environments using only a masked 2D
image and a natural language description presents significant challenges. The
ROOMELSA challenge limits access to full 3D scene context, complicating
reasoning about object appearance, geometry, and semantics. These challenges
are intensified by distorted viewpoints, textureless masked regions, ambiguous
language prompts, and noisy segmentation masks. To address this, we propose
SAMURAI: Shape-Aware Multimodal Retrieval for 3D Object Identification. SAMURAI
integrates CLIP-based semantic matching with shape-guided re-ranking derived
from binary silhouettes of masked regions, alongside a robust majority voting
strategy. A dedicated preprocessing pipeline enhances mask quality by
extracting the largest connected component and removing background noise. Our
hybrid retrieval framework leverages both language and shape cues, achieving
competitive performance on the ROOMELSA private test set. These results
highlight the importance of combining shape priors with language understanding
for robust open-world 3D object retrieval.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces PoseMaster, a unified end-to-end framework for generating 3D characters and controlling their poses, overcoming previous limitations of self-occlusion and degraded image quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for 3D character modeling struggle with geometric degradation during pose standardization, particularly due to self-occlusion and viewpoint challenges. The authors aim to address these inefficiencies and propose a framework for accurate pose control and 3D character generation.

Method: PoseMaster combines pose transformation and 3D generation into a flow-based framework, using body bones as pose conditions. By randomly emptying conditions during training, it improves the model's pose control generalizability. Also, they employ a pose-control dataset derived from character animation data.

Result: Experiments show PoseMaster outperforms state-of-the-art methods in quality and precision for A-pose character generation, while excelling in controlling arbitrary poses effectively.

Conclusion: PoseMaster introduces a novel way of unifying pose transformation and 3D character generation into one model, achieving high-quality outputs and precise control over poses by addressing core issues of existing approaches.

Abstract: 3D characters play a crucial role in our daily entertainment. To improve the
efficiency of 3D character modeling, recent image-based methods use two
separate models to achieve pose standardization and 3D reconstruction of the
A-pose character. However, these methods are prone to generating distorted and
degraded images in the pose standardization stage due to self-occlusion and
viewpoints, which further affects the geometric quality of the subsequent
reconstruction process. To tackle these problems, we propose PoseMaster, an
end-to-end controllable 3D character generation framework. Specifically, we
unify pose transformation and 3D character generation into a flow-based 3D
native generation framework. To achieve accurate arbitrary-pose control, we
propose to leverage the 3D body bones existing in the skeleton of an animatable
character as the pose condition. Furthermore, considering the specificity of
multi-condition control, we randomly empty the pose condition and the image
condition during training to improve the effectiveness and generalizability of
pose control. Finally, we create a high-quality pose-control dataset derived
from realistic character animation data to make the model learning the implicit
relationships between skeleton and skinning weights. Extensive experiments show
that PoseMaster outperforms current state-of-the-art techniques in both
qualitative and quantitative evaluations for A-pose character generation while
demonstrating its powerful ability to achieve precise control for arbitrary
poses.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a reinforcement learning (RL)-based framework to enhance multimodal large language models (LLMs) for better global context understanding and reasoning. It introduces a unique reward system and a new benchmark, achieving improved performance in multimodal reasoning tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the challenges in multimodal reasoning models, such as insufficient global context understanding and shortcut issues, which hinder the accurate interpretation of complex human intentions and emotions.

Method: The authors use reinforcement learning with multiple reward types, including context, format, accuracy, and logical rewards judged by LLMs, to improve the reasoning capabilities of multimodal LLMs. They also introduce a benchmark named 'IntentBench' to evaluate these models.

Result: Their approach shows superior performance in interpreting complex multimodal context and reasoning compared to other open-source omni-modal models.

Conclusion: The proposed framework successfully mitigates the identified issues in multimodal reasoning and improves the understanding of complex human intentions, representing an advancement in the field of multimodal LLMs.

Abstract: With the rapid evolution of multimodal large language models, the capacity to
deeply understand and interpret human intentions has emerged as a critical
capability, which demands detailed and thoughtful reasoning. In recent studies,
Reinforcement Learning (RL) has demonstrated potential in enhancing the
reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). Nonetheless, the
challenges associated with adapting RL to multimodal data and formats remain
largely unaddressed. In this paper, we identify two issues in existing
multimodal reasoning models: insufficient global context understanding and
shortcut problems. Insufficient context understanding can happen when a model
misinterprets multimodal context, resulting in incorrect answers. The shortcut
problem occurs when the model overlooks crucial clues in multimodal inputs,
directly addressing the query without considering the multimodal information.
To tackle these issues, we emphasize the necessity for the model to reason with
a clear understanding of the global context within multimodal inputs. This
global context understanding can effectively prevent the model from overlooking
key multimodal cues and ensure a thorough reasoning process. To ensure the
accurate interpretation of multimodal context information, we implement a
context reward judged by a large language model, alongside format and accuracy
rewards. Additionally, to improve complex reasoning capability, we employ the
LLM to assess the logical reward, determining whether the reasoning process
successfully integrates multimodal information with logical methods. We also
introduce a reasoning omni-modal benchmark, IntentBench, aimed at evaluating
models in understanding complex human intentions and emotions. Our proposed
method demonstrates advanced performance across multiple omni-modal benchmarks
compared to other open-source omni-modal models.

Motivation: High computational demands of modern egocentric perception models hinder their deployment in resource-constrained environments.

Method: EgoAdapt performs cross-modal distillation and policy learning to offer efficient inference tailored to specific egocentric perception tasks.

Result: EgoAdapt demonstrated efficiency improvements across datasets, reducing GMACs by up to 89.09%, parameters by 82.02%, and energy consumption by 9.6x while maintaining or surpassing state-of-the-art performance.

Conclusion: EgoAdapt provides an efficient solution to deploy egocentric perception models in resource-constrained environments without compromising on performance.

Abstract: Modern perception models, particularly those designed for multisensory
egocentric tasks, have achieved remarkable performance but often come with
substantial computational costs. These high demands pose challenges for
real-world deployment, especially in resource-constrained environments. In this
paper, we introduce EgoAdapt, a framework that adaptively performs cross-modal
distillation and policy learning to enable efficient inference across different
egocentric perception tasks, including egocentric action recognition, active
speaker localization, and behavior anticipation. Our proposed policy module is
adaptable to task-specific action spaces, making it broadly applicable.

EasyCom, and Aria Everyday Activities demonstrate that our method significantly
enhances efficiency, reducing GMACs by up to 89.09%, parameters up to 82.02%,
and energy up to 9.6x, while still on-par and in many cases outperforming, the
performance of corresponding state-of-the-art models.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces Enhanced Shuffle Mixer (ESM) to improve real-time stereo matching by restoring crucial details while maintaining computational efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-time stereo matching faces challenges due to large-scale cost volumes requiring high computation and small-scale volumes sacrificing accuracy.

Method: Enhanced Shuffle Mixer (ESM) integrates primary features into disparity upsampling, uses shuffling and layer splitting, and employs a compact hourglass network for feature refinement.

Result: The compact ESMStereo model achieves high accuracy and fast inference speeds of 116 FPS on GPUs and 91 FPS on AGX Orin.

Conclusion: Enhanced Shuffle Mixer provides a balance of speed and accuracy for real-time stereo matching applications in autonomous systems.

Abstract: Stereo matching has become an increasingly important component of modern
autonomous systems. Developing deep learning-based stereo matching models that
deliver high accuracy while operating in real-time continues to be a major
challenge in computer vision. In the domain of cost-volume-based stereo
matching, accurate disparity estimation depends heavily on large-scale cost
volumes. However, such large volumes store substantial redundant information
and also require computationally intensive aggregation units for processing and
regression, making real-time performance unattainable. Conversely, small-scale
cost volumes followed by lightweight aggregation units provide a promising
route for real-time performance, but lack sufficient information to ensure
highly accurate disparity estimation. To address this challenge, we propose the
Enhanced Shuffle Mixer (ESM) to mitigate information loss associated with
small-scale cost volumes. ESM restores critical details by integrating primary
features into the disparity upsampling unit. It quickly extracts features from
the initial disparity estimation and fuses them with image features. These
features are mixed by shuffling and layer splitting then refined through a
compact feature-guided hourglass network to recover more detailed scene
geometry. The ESM focuses on local contextual connectivity with a large
receptive field and low computational cost, leading to the reconstruction of a
highly accurate disparity map at real-time. The compact version of ESMStereo
achieves an inference speed of 116 FPS on high-end GPUs and 91 FPS on the AGX
Orin.

Motivation: Many characters in Oracle Bone Script remain undeciphered due to their structural complexity and abstract imagery, necessitating innovative methods for interpretation.

Method: The paper proposes OracleFusion, a two-stage semantic typography framework. The first stage uses a Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) with improved Spatial Awareness Reasoning (SAR) to analyze and localize glyph components. The second stage employs Oracle Structural Vector Fusion (OSVF) to generate semantically enriched vector fonts while maintaining structural integrity and glyph constraints.

Result: OracleFusion significantly outperforms existing models in semantic analysis, visual aesthetics, and glyph maintenance, demonstrated through both qualitative and quantitative assessments.

Conclusion: OracleFusion aids experts by providing accurate, aesthetically refined tools to decipher previously unreadable OBS characters, advancing the understanding of this ancient script.

Abstract: As one of the earliest ancient languages, Oracle Bone Script (OBS)
encapsulates the cultural records and intellectual expressions of ancient
civilizations. Despite the discovery of approximately 4,500 OBS characters,
only about 1,600 have been deciphered. The remaining undeciphered ones, with
their complex structure and abstract imagery, pose significant challenges for
interpretation. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a novel
two-stage semantic typography framework, named OracleFusion. In the first
stage, this approach leverages the Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) with
enhanced Spatial Awareness Reasoning (SAR) to analyze the glyph structure of
the OBS character and perform visual localization of key components. In the
second stage, we introduce Oracle Structural Vector Fusion (OSVF),
incorporating glyph structure constraints and glyph maintenance constraints to
ensure the accurate generation of semantically enriched vector fonts. This
approach preserves the objective integrity of the glyph structure, offering
visually enhanced representations that assist experts in deciphering OBS.
Extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments demonstrate that
OracleFusion outperforms state-of-the-art baseline models in terms of
semantics, visual appeal, and glyph maintenance, significantly enhancing both
readability and aesthetic quality. Furthermore, OracleFusion provides
expert-like insights on unseen oracle characters, making it a valuable tool for
advancing the decipherment of OBS.

*Luosheng Xu,Dalin Zhang,Zhaohui Song*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces FlickCD, a lightweight model for remote sensing change detection that balances computational efficiency and accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Remote sensing change detection requires timely and accurate models for applications like urban monitoring and disaster assessment. Current deep learning models face challenges in balancing complexity and computational demands with accuracy.

Method: FlickCD integrates an Enhanced Difference Module (EDM) to highlight relevant feature differences and suppress irrelevant ones. Its decoder uses Local-Global Fusion Blocks with Shifted Window Self-Attention (SWSA) and Enhanced Global Self-Attention (EGSA) techniques for multi-scale semantic information capture.

Result: FlickCD achieves state-of-the-art performance on four benchmark datasets with significant reductions in computational and storage demands, showing only minimal accuracy losses (<1% F1).

Conclusion: FlickCD provides an efficient solution for change detection, combining lightweight design and high performance, making it suitable for resource-constrained tasks like on-satellite processing.

Abstract: Remote sensing change detection is essential for monitoring urban expansion,
disaster assessment, and resource management, offering timely, accurate, and
large-scale insights into dynamic landscape transformations. While deep
learning has revolutionized change detection, the increasing complexity and
computational demands of modern models have not necessarily translated into
significant accuracy gains. Instead of following this trend, this study
explores a more efficient approach, focusing on lightweight models that
maintain high accuracy while minimizing resource consumption, which is an
essential requirement for on-satellite processing. To this end, we propose
FlickCD, which means quick flick then get great results, pushing the boundaries
of the performance-resource trade-off. FlickCD introduces an Enhanced
Difference Module (EDM) to amplify critical feature differences between
temporal phases while suppressing irrelevant variations such as lighting and
weather changes, thereby reducing computational costs in the subsequent change
decoder. Additionally, the FlickCD decoder incorporates Local-Global Fusion
Blocks, leveraging Shifted Window Self-Attention (SWSA) and Enhanced Global
Self-Attention (EGSA) to efficiently capture semantic information at multiple
scales, preserving both coarse- and fine-grained changes. Extensive experiments
on four benchmark datasets demonstrate that FlickCD reduces computational and
storage overheads by more than an order of magnitude while achieving
state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance or incurring only a minor (<1\% F1)
accuracy trade-off. The implementation code is publicly available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper identifies challenges with Video Large Language Models (VideoLLMs) in multi-shot scenarios and introduces a dataset, MultiClip-Bench, along with a new model, IPFormer, to improve video understanding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VideoLLMs struggle with multi-shot scenarios due to missing annotations and issues like identity forgetting and key frame negligence.

Method: The study introduces MultiClip-Bench, a dataset with dense descriptions and QA pairs for multi-shot evaluation. It also proposes IPFormer-VideoLLM, a model using instance prompts via an attention-based connector to preserve information across scenes.

Result: Experiments show the new dataset and model significantly enhance multi-scene video understanding and outperform other systems across diverse video benchmarks.

Conclusion: The combination of MultiClip-Bench and IPFormer-VideoLLM addresses key challenges of multi-shot scenarios, marking an advancement in video-language model capabilities.

Abstract: Video Large Language Models (VideoLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable
understanding capabilities, but are found struggling to tackle multi-shot
scenarios,e.g., video clips with varying camera angles or scene changes. This
challenge can render failures such as instance identity forgetting and key
frame negligence. In this work, we first attribute the challenge to the lack of
multi-shot annotations among existing datasets and therefore we introduce a new
dataset termed MultiClip-Bench, featuring dense descriptions and
instruction-based question-answering pairs tailored for multi-shot scenarios.
We empirically find that the training set significantly boosts the multi-shot
performance, while the testing benchmark provides a reliable measure of the
model capability in multi-shot scenarios. By further analyzing and discovering
that current models only encode instance features in a discrete or lossy
manner, at the risk of missing identity information, we then contribute a new
model IPFormer-VideoLLM. Its key idea is the injection of instance-level
features as instance prompts through an efficient attention-based connector.
This allows for the aggregation of instance-specific information across scenes.
Experiments demonstrate that our proposed dataset and model not only enhance
the multi-scene video understanding significantly, but also offer distinct
advantages across various video benchmarks.

TL;DR: CL-Splats incrementally updates 3D scene representations using Gaussian splatting, optimizing for changes without reprocessing the entire scene.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable real-time adaptive 3D scene reconstruction in dynamic environments for applications like robotics and mixed reality.

Method: The paper proposes CL-Splats which integrates Gaussian splatting with a change-detection module to locally optimize updates.

Result: CL-Splats achieves better efficiency and reconstruction quality compared to state-of-the-art methods through focused local updates.

Conclusion: CL-Splats provides a foundation for real-time 3D scene reconstruction, excelling in efficient updates and quality improvements for evolving environments.

Abstract: In dynamic 3D environments, accurately updating scene representations over
time is crucial for applications in robotics, mixed reality, and embodied AI.
As scenes evolve, efficient methods to incorporate changes are needed to
maintain up-to-date, high-quality reconstructions without the computational
overhead of re-optimizing the entire scene. This paper introduces CL-Splats,
which incrementally updates Gaussian splatting-based 3D representations from
sparse scene captures. CL-Splats integrates a robust change-detection module
that segments updated and static components within the scene, enabling focused,
local optimization that avoids unnecessary re-computation. Moreover, CL-Splats
supports storing and recovering previous scene states, facilitating temporal
segmentation and new scene-analysis applications. Our extensive experiments
demonstrate that CL-Splats achieves efficient updates with improved
reconstruction quality over the state-of-the-art. This establishes a robust
foundation for future real-time adaptation in 3D scene reconstruction tasks.

*Hai Jiang,Binhao Guan,Zhen Liu,Xiaohong Liu,Jian Yu,Zheng Liu,Songchen Han,Shuaicheng Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a new dataset, SIED, synthesized to support enhancements of extremely low-light RAW images, along with a diffusion-based method for restoration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current low-light RAW image enhancement methods struggle with scenes having extremely low illuminance (< 0.0001 lux) due to insufficient datasets.

Method: The authors designed a data synthesis pipeline to create paired datasets of RAW and sRGB images under specific illuminance ranges and proposed a diffusion-based framework with an Adaptive Illumination Correction Module and color consistency loss.

Result: Experiments using the SIED dataset and public benchmarks confirmed the framework's ability to restore visually appealing and accurate results.

Conclusion: SIED dataset and the proposed method pave the way for advancements in enhancing extremely dark RAW images with consistent exposure and color correction.

Abstract: Learning-based methods have made promising advances in low-light RAW image
enhancement, while their capability to extremely dark scenes where the
environmental illuminance drops as low as 0.0001 lux remains to be explored due
to the lack of corresponding datasets. To this end, we propose a
paired-to-paired data synthesis pipeline capable of generating well-calibrated
extremely low-light RAW images at three precise illuminance ranges of 0.01-0.1
lux, 0.001-0.01 lux, and 0.0001-0.001 lux, together with high-quality sRGB
references to comprise a large-scale paired dataset named
See-in-the-Extremely-Dark (SIED) to benchmark low-light RAW image enhancement
approaches. Furthermore, we propose a diffusion-based framework that leverages
the generative ability and intrinsic denoising property of diffusion models to
restore visually pleasing results from extremely low-SNR RAW inputs, in which
an Adaptive Illumination Correction Module (AICM) and a color consistency loss
are introduced to ensure accurate exposure correction and color restoration.
Extensive experiments on the proposed SIED and publicly available benchmarks
demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. The code and dataset are available

*Xinzhuo Li,Adheesh Juvekar,Xingyou Liu,Muntasir Wahed,Kiet A. Nguyen,Ismini Lourentzou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces HalluSegBench, a benchmark designed to evaluate segmentation hallucinations in vision-language models, emphasizing counterfactual reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The researchers aim to address the hallucination issue in vision-language segmentation models, particularly their tendency to mislabel irrelevant regions or generate masks for objects not actually grounded in the visual content.

Method: They created HalluSegBench, which includes a dataset of 1340 counterfactual instance pairs across 281 object classes and new metrics to assess hallucination sensitivity through visually coherent edits.

Result: Experiments reveal that vision-driven hallucinations occur more frequently than label-driven ones, exposing the limitations of current models and the necessity for counterfactual visual reasoning.

Conclusion: Counterfactual visual reasoning is crucial for diagnosing and improving grounding fidelity in advanced vision-language segmentation models.

Abstract: Recent progress in vision-language segmentation has significantly advanced
grounded visual understanding. However, these models often exhibit
hallucinations by producing segmentation masks for objects not grounded in the
image content or by incorrectly labeling irrelevant regions. Existing
evaluation protocols for segmentation hallucination primarily focus on label or
textual hallucinations without manipulating the visual context, limiting their
capacity to diagnose critical failures. In response, we introduce
HalluSegBench, the first benchmark specifically designed to evaluate
hallucinations in visual grounding through the lens of counterfactual visual
reasoning. Our benchmark consists of a novel dataset of 1340 counterfactual
instance pairs spanning 281 unique object classes, and a set of newly
introduced metrics that quantify hallucination sensitivity under visually
coherent scene edits. Experiments on HalluSegBench with state-of-the-art
vision-language segmentation models reveal that vision-driven hallucinations
are significantly more prevalent than label-driven ones, with models often
persisting in false segmentation, highlighting the need for counterfactual
reasoning to diagnose grounding fidelity.

*Jiawei Hu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: YOLO-FDA is a novel YOLO-based detection framework addressing challenges in surface defect detection through detail enhancement and attention-guided feature fusion.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Surface defect detection in industrial settings is technically demanding due to defects' variability, irregularities, and complex material textures.

Method: YOLO-FDA employs a BiFPN-style architecture for multilevel feature aggregation, introduces a Detail-directional Fusion Module (DDFM) for enhanced spatial and semantic details, and advances attention-based fusion strategies like Attention-weighted Concatenation (AC) and Cross-layer Attention Fusion (CAF).

Result: Extensive experiments show YOLO-FDA achieves superior accuracy and robustness compared to state-of-the-art methods across diverse datasets.

Conclusion: YOLO-FDA effectively tackles the challenges in defect detection and proves to be more accurate and robust in multiscale industrial scenarios.

Abstract: Surface defect detection in industrial scenarios is both crucial and
technically demanding due to the wide variability in defect types, irregular
shapes and sizes, fine-grained requirements, and complex material textures.
Although recent advances in AI-based detectors have improved performance,
existing methods often suffer from redundant features, limited detail
sensitivity, and weak robustness under multiscale conditions. To address these
challenges, we propose YOLO-FDA, a novel YOLO-based detection framework that
integrates fine-grained detail enhancement and attention-guided feature fusion.
Specifically, we adopt a BiFPN-style architecture to strengthen bidirectional
multilevel feature aggregation within the YOLOv5 backbone. To better capture
fine structural changes, we introduce a Detail-directional Fusion Module (DDFM)
that introduces a directional asymmetric convolution in the second-lowest layer
to enrich spatial details and fuses the second-lowest layer with low-level
features to enhance semantic consistency. Furthermore, we propose two novel
attention-based fusion strategies, Attention-weighted Concatenation (AC) and
Cross-layer Attention Fusion (CAF) to improve contextual representation and
reduce feature noise. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate
that YOLO-FDA consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in
terms of both accuracy and robustness across diverse types of defects and
scales.

*Junwen Wang,Oscar Maccormac,William Rochford,Aaron Kujawa,Jonathan Shapey,Tom Vercauteren*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper presents tree-based semantic loss functions for hyperspectral imaging (HSI) segmentation, enhancing inter-class semantics and performing well even with sparse annotations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: HSI has potential for surgical use but current methods for biomedical segmentation fail to utilize inter-class semantics, treating all errors equally.

Method: Introduced two tree-based semantic loss functions leveraging hierarchical label organization and applied them to sparsely annotated HSI datasets.

Result: Achieved state-of-the-art segmentation with 107 classes, effective OOD detection, and no compromise on ID performance.

Conclusion: The method improves annotation efficiency and segmentation quality by incorporating hierarchical semantics into the learning process.

Abstract: Hyperspectral imaging (HSI) shows great promise for surgical applications,
offering detailed insights into biological tissue differences beyond what the
naked eye can perceive. Refined labelling efforts are underway to train vision
systems to distinguish large numbers of subtly varying classes. However,
commonly used learning methods for biomedical segmentation tasks penalise all
errors equivalently and thus fail to exploit any inter-class semantics in the
label space. In this work, we introduce two tree-based semantic loss functions
which take advantage of a hierarchical organisation of the labels. We further
incorporate our losses in a recently proposed approach for training with
sparse, background-free annotations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our
proposed method reaches state-of-the-art performance on a sparsely annotated
HSI dataset comprising $107$ classes organised in a clinically-defined semantic
tree structure. Furthermore, our method enables effective detection of
out-of-distribution (OOD) pixels without compromising segmentation performance
on in-distribution (ID) pixels.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve clinical assessment and treatment planning by accurately segmenting myocardial scars from cardiac MRI.

Method: Developed a robust fine-tuned deep-learning pipeline that uses Kullback-Leibler loss, extensive data augmentation, and tackles challenges like label noise, data heterogeneity, and class imbalance.

Result: The approach showed superior performance compared to state-of-the-art models, such as nnU-Net, and demonstrated strong generalizability on out-of-distribution test sets.

Conclusion: This method establishes a strong, reliable foundation for automated myocardial scar quantification and promotes the clinical adoption of deep learning in cardiac imaging.

Abstract: The accurate segmentation of myocardial scars from cardiac MRI is essential
for clinical assessment and treatment planning. In this study, we propose a
robust deep-learning pipeline for fully automated myocardial scar detection and
segmentation by fine-tuning state-of-the-art models. The method explicitly
addresses challenges of label noise from semi-automatic annotations, data
heterogeneity, and class imbalance through the use of Kullback-Leibler loss and
extensive data augmentation. We evaluate the model's performance on both acute
and chronic cases and demonstrate its ability to produce accurate and smooth
segmentations despite noisy labels. In particular, our approach outperforms
state-of-the-art models like nnU-Net and shows strong generalizability in an
out-of-distribution test set, highlighting its robustness across various
imaging conditions and clinical tasks. These results establish a reliable
foundation for automated myocardial scar quantification and support the broader
clinical adoption of deep learning in cardiac imaging.

*Pufan Li,Bi'an Du,Wei Hu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a method for creating realistic 3D objects from single-view images by combining geometry and perception priors without extra model training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods to generate 3D objects from single-view images often lack multiview consistency and geometric detail, necessitating a more robust approach.

Method: The proposed method uses three Gaussian branches initialized with geometry prior, perception prior, and Gaussian noise. These branches are refined through interaction and a reprojection-based strategy to ensure depth consistency.

Result: The method achieves superior fidelity in 3D reconstruction and novel view synthesis compared to existing approaches.

Conclusion: This approach effectively addresses the challenges of multiview consistency and geometric detailing, offering a robust solution for single-image 3D object generation.

Abstract: Generating realistic 3D objects from single-view images requires natural
appearance, 3D consistency, and the ability to capture multiple plausible
interpretations of unseen regions. Existing approaches often rely on
fine-tuning pretrained 2D diffusion models or directly generating 3D
information through fast network inference or 3D Gaussian Splatting, but their
results generally suffer from poor multiview consistency and lack geometric
detail. To takle these issues, we present a novel method that seamlessly
integrates geometry and perception priors without requiring additional model
training to reconstruct detailed 3D objects from a single image. Specifically,
we train three different Gaussian branches initialized from the geometry prior,
perception prior and Gaussian noise, respectively. The geometry prior captures
the rough 3D shapes, while the perception prior utilizes the 2D pretrained
diffusion model to enhance multiview information. Subsequently, we refine 3D
Gaussian branches through mutual interaction between geometry and perception
priors, further enhanced by a reprojection-based strategy that enforces depth
consistency. Experiments demonstrate the higher-fidelity reconstruction results
of our method, outperforming existing methods on novel view synthesis and 3D
reconstruction, demonstrating robust and consistent 3D object generation.

*Longkun Zou,Kangjun Liu,Ke Chen,Kailing Guo,Kui Jia,Yaowei Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper addresses the simulation-to-reality domain gap in 3D object shape classification by proposing a Topology-Aware Modeling (TAM) framework that uses global spatial topology and advanced self-training strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Training data for 3D object shape classifiers often comes from simulators, whereas testing data is captured by distinct sensors, leading to a Sim2Real domain gap that current UDA techniques struggle to bridge due to their weak representation of global topology.

Method: The authors introduce the TAM framework, which leverages global spatial topology and self-supervised learning on high-frequency 3D structures. Additionally, a novel self-training strategy combining cross-domain contrastive learning is proposed.

Result: The proposed TAM framework shows consistent improvements over state-of-the-art methods on three public Sim2Real benchmarks, demonstrating its efficacy.

Conclusion: Utilizing global topological features and robust learning strategies, TAM successfully bridges the Sim2Real gap in 3D object shape classification. Its implementation will be accessible via an open-source repository.

Abstract: Learning semantic representations from point sets of 3D object shapes is
often challenged by significant geometric variations, primarily due to
differences in data acquisition methods. Typically, training data is generated
using point simulators, while testing data is collected with distinct 3D
sensors, leading to a simulation-to-reality (Sim2Real) domain gap that limits
the generalization ability of point classifiers. Current unsupervised domain
adaptation (UDA) techniques struggle with this gap, as they often lack robust,
domain-insensitive descriptors capable of capturing global topological
information, resulting in overfitting to the limited semantic patterns of the
source domain. To address this issue, we introduce a novel Topology-Aware
Modeling (TAM) framework for Sim2Real UDA on object point clouds. Our approach
mitigates the domain gap by leveraging global spatial topology, characterized
by low-level, high-frequency 3D structures, and by modeling the topological
relations of local geometric features through a novel self-supervised learning
task. Additionally, we propose an advanced self-training strategy that combines
cross-domain contrastive learning with self-training, effectively reducing the
impact of noisy pseudo-labels and enhancing the robustness of the adaptation
process. Experimental results on three public Sim2Real benchmarks validate the
effectiveness of our TAM framework, showing consistent improvements over
state-of-the-art methods across all evaluated tasks. The source code of this
work will be available at https://github.com/zou-longkun/TAG.git.

*Minghao Qin,Yan Shu,Peitian Zhang,Kun Lun,Huaying Yuan,Juenjie Zhou,Shitao Xiao,Bo Zhao,Zheng Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Video-X^2L is a novel approach for improving long-video understanding (LVU) in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) by using bi-level KV compression and selective KV re-loading to balance detail retention with computational efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing MLLMs struggle with LVU tasks due to the computational cost associated with processing long videos. Current KV compression methods reduce cost but lose significant information at high compression ratios.

Method: Video-X^2L introduces bi-level KV compression to create low-compression KVs (L-KVs) for fine-grained details and high-compression KVs (H-KVs) for compact representation during the pre-filling stage. It also employs selective KV re-loading during the decoding stage, reactivating L-KVs for critical chunks while using H-KVs for others.

Result: Video-X^2L significantly outperforms current KV-compression approaches on popular LVU benchmarks like VideoMME, MLVU, LongVideoBench, and VNBench, while reducing computational costs.

Conclusion: Video-X^2L is an efficient and effective solution, compatible with existing KV-compressible MLLMs, and enhances both task-specific performance and overall computational efficiency.

Abstract: Long-video understanding (LVU) remains a severe challenge for existing
multimodal large language models (MLLMs), primarily due to the prohibitive
computational cost. Recent approaches have explored KV compression to mitigate
this issue, but they often suffer from significant information loss at high
compression ratios. In this paper, we introduce Video-X^2L, which flexibly
preserves critical video information for each LVU task. Video-X^2L involves two
key operations. The first one is called bi-level KV compression. During the
MLLM's pre-filling stage, Video-X^2L generates two types of compressed KVs:
low-compression KVs (L-KVs) to capture fine-grained video details and
high-compression KVs (H-KVs) to offer compact video representations. The second
one is called selective KV re-loading. During the MLLM's decoding stage,
Video-X^2L selectively re-loads L-KVs for the most critical video chunks while
using H-KVs for other less important ones. This allows the MLLM to fully
utilize task-specific information while maintaining the overall compactness.
Video-X^2L is simple yet effective: it is free from additional training and
directly compatible with existing KV-compressible MLLMs. We evaluate Video-X^2L
with a variety of popular LVU benchmarks, including VideoMME, MLVU,
LongVideoBench, and VNBench. Our experiment result shows that Video-X^2L
outperforms existing KV-compression methods by a huge advantage while
substantially saving the computation cost.

*Zijun Lin,Shuting He,Cheston Tan,Bihan Wen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces GroundFlow, a module designed to improve sequential grounding accuracy in 3D point clouds by enabling temporal reasoning, achieving state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Sequential grounding tasks involve locating object sequences based on step-by-step text instructions with temporal dependencies, requiring enhanced context understanding to address pronouns and historical information.

Method: GroundFlow integrates temporal reasoning by selectively analyzing short-term and long-term historical information relevant to each instruction, enhancing 3DVG baseline models.

Result: The integration of GroundFlow boosts accuracy in SG3D benchmarks by 7.5% and 10.2%, outperforming even advanced pre-trained 3D language models, across five datasets.

Conclusion: GroundFlow effectively introduces temporal reasoning into 3DVG models, significantly enhancing sequential grounding accuracy and setting new performance benchmarks in the SG3D task.

Abstract: Sequential grounding in 3D point clouds (SG3D) refers to locating sequences
of objects by following text instructions for a daily activity with detailed
steps. Current 3D visual grounding (3DVG) methods treat text instructions with
multiple steps as a whole, without extracting useful temporal information from
each step. However, the instructions in SG3D often contain pronouns such as
"it", "here" and "the same" to make language expressions concise. This requires
grounding methods to understand the context and retrieve relevant information
from previous steps to correctly locate object sequences. Due to the lack of an
effective module for collecting related historical information,
state-of-the-art 3DVG methods face significant challenges in adapting to the
SG3D task. To fill this gap, we propose GroundFlow -- a plug-in module for
temporal reasoning on 3D point cloud sequential grounding. Firstly, we
demonstrate that integrating GroundFlow improves the task accuracy of 3DVG
baseline methods by a large margin (+7.5\% and +10.2\%) in the SG3D benchmark,
even outperforming a 3D large language model pre-trained on various datasets.
Furthermore, we selectively extract both short-term and long-term step
information based on its relevance to the current instruction, enabling
GroundFlow to take a comprehensive view of historical information and maintain
its temporal understanding advantage as step counts increase. Overall, our work
introduces temporal reasoning capabilities to existing 3DVG models and achieves
state-of-the-art performance in the SG3D benchmark across five datasets.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MedPrompt is a unified framework combining large language models and convolutional neural networks to enable prompt-driven medical image analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current medical image analysis systems lack flexibility and often require separate models for different tasks like classification and segmentation.

Method: MedPrompt leverages a few-shot prompted LLM for task planning and a modular CNN for image processing. Task-specific weights are routed without retraining the entire framework, enabling scalability.

Result: MedPrompt achieved 97% end-to-end correctness in executing instructions and demonstrated competitive performance in segmentation and classification across 19 datasets.

Conclusion: MedPrompt enables scalable, efficient medical image analysis by integrating interpretability from LLMs and precision from CNNs, supporting modular task adaptation.

Abstract: Current medical image analysis systems are typically task-specific, requiring
separate models for classification and segmentation, and lack the flexibility
to support user-defined workflows. To address these challenges, we introduce
MedPrompt, a unified framework that combines a few-shot prompted Large Language
Model (Llama-4-17B) for high-level task planning with a modular Convolutional
Neural Network (DeepFusionLab) for low-level image processing. The LLM
interprets user instructions and generates structured output to dynamically
route task-specific pretrained weights. This weight routing approach avoids
retraining the entire framework when adding new tasks-only task-specific
weights are required, enhancing scalability and deployment. We evaluated
MedPrompt across 19 public datasets, covering 12 tasks spanning 5 imaging
modalities. The system achieves a 97% end-to-end correctness in interpreting
and executing prompt-driven instructions, with an average inference latency of
2.5 seconds, making it suitable for near real-time applications. DeepFusionLab
achieves competitive segmentation accuracy (e.g., Dice 0.9856 on lungs) and
strong classification performance (F1 0.9744 on tuberculosis). Overall,
MedPrompt enables scalable, prompt-driven medical imaging by combining the
interpretability of LLMs with the efficiency of modular CNNs.

*Louis Kerner,Michel Meintz,Bihe Zhao,Franziska Boenisch,Adam Dziedzic*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces BitMark, a watermarking framework to embed robust and imperceptible signals directly in token streams of text-to-image models to mitigate risks like model collapse.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the risk of text-to-image models creating degraded outputs through repeated training on their own generated data, and to enable detection of such generated content for preventing model collapse.

Method: BitMark embeds human-imperceptible watermarks at the bit level during image generation across multiple scales, ensuring robustness to removal techniques and radioactive properties for traceability.

Result: The watermark preserves visual fidelity and generation speed while proving resistant to removal techniques and remaining detectable even in fine-tuned models trained on watermarked images.

Conclusion: BitMark represents an effective approach to preventing model collapse by allowing reliable detection of generated content, thereby safeguarding the integrity of text-to-image generative performance.

Abstract: State-of-the-art text-to-image models like Infinity generate photorealistic
images at an unprecedented speed. These models operate in a bitwise
autoregressive manner over a discrete set of tokens that is practically
infinite in size. However, their impressive generative power comes with a
growing risk: as their outputs increasingly populate the Internet, they are
likely to be scraped and reused as training data-potentially by the very same
models. This phenomenon has been shown to lead to model collapse, where
repeated training on generated content, especially from the models' own
previous versions, causes a gradual degradation in performance. A promising
mitigation strategy is watermarking, which embeds human-imperceptible yet
detectable signals into generated images-enabling the identification of
generated content. In this work, we introduce BitMark, a robust bitwise
watermarking framework for Infinity. Our method embeds a watermark directly at
the bit level of the token stream across multiple scales (also referred to as
resolutions) during Infinity's image generation process. Our bitwise watermark
subtly influences the bits to preserve visual fidelity and generation speed
while remaining robust against a spectrum of removal techniques. Furthermore,
it exhibits high radioactivity, i.e., when watermarked generated images are
used to train another image generative model, this second model's outputs will
also carry the watermark. The radioactive traces remain detectable even when
only fine-tuning diffusion or image autoregressive models on images watermarked
with our BitMark. Overall, our approach provides a principled step toward
preventing model collapse in image generative models by enabling reliable
detection of generated outputs.

*Xiwei Xuan,Ziquan Deng,Kwan-Liu Ma*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a training-free semantic segmentation framework that improves performance by focusing on data quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current solutions for open-vocabulary semantic segmentation (OVS) are limited by the capabilities of pre-trained models or poor quality of generated reference datasets, challenging their performance.

Method: The study introduces a data-quality-oriented framework that constructs a high-quality reference set with well-paired segment-text embeddings and employs a similarity-based retrieval process for semantic segmentation without training.

Result: Extensive evaluations on ten benchmark datasets show the proposed method outperforms existing training-free OVS approaches.

Conclusion: Focusing on data quality rather than complex training or mechanisms can significantly enhance training-free open-vocabulary semantic segmentation, demonstrating the value of a data-centric approach.

Abstract: Training-free open-vocabulary semantic segmentation (OVS) aims to segment
images given a set of arbitrary textual categories without costly model
fine-tuning. Existing solutions often explore attention mechanisms of
pre-trained models, such as CLIP, or generate synthetic data and design complex
retrieval processes to perform OVS. However, their performance is limited by
the capability of reliant models or the suboptimal quality of reference sets.
In this work, we investigate the largely overlooked data quality problem for
this challenging dense scene understanding task, and identify that a
high-quality reference set can significantly benefit training-free OVS. With
this observation, we introduce a data-quality-oriented framework, comprising a
data pipeline to construct a reference set with well-paired segment-text
embeddings and a simple similarity-based retrieval to unveil the essential
effect of data. Remarkably, extensive evaluations on ten benchmark datasets
demonstrate that our method outperforms all existing training-free OVS
approaches, highlighting the importance of data-centric design for advancing
OVS without training. Our code is available at https://github.com/xiweix/ReME .

*Umaima Rahman,Mohammad Yaqub,Dwarikanath Mahapatra*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DiMPLe is a multi-modal learning framework that improves out-of-distribution performance by disentangling invariant and spurious features across vision and language modalities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the challenge of spurious correlations in visual data that degrade out-of-distribution generalization in multi-modal learning.

Method: DiMPLe employs mutual information minimization, spurious feature regularization, and contrastive learning to disentangle features within and across modalities.

Result: DiMPLe outperforms competing methods like CoOp-OOD, with significant gains in accuracy across diverse datasets, including 15.27 points for base classes and 44.31 points for novel classes.

Conclusion: DiMPLe represents a breakthrough in handling spurious correlations in multi-modal learning, improving generalization and robustness to distribution shifts.

Abstract: We introduce DiMPLe (Disentangled Multi-Modal Prompt Learning), a novel
approach to disentangle invariant and spurious features across vision and
language modalities in multi-modal learning. Spurious correlations in visual
data often hinder out-of-distribution (OOD) performance. Unlike prior methods
focusing solely on image features, DiMPLe disentangles features within and
across modalities while maintaining consistent alignment, enabling better
generalization to novel classes and robustness to distribution shifts. Our
method combines three key objectives: (1) mutual information minimization
between invariant and spurious features, (2) spurious feature regularization,
and (3) contrastive learning on invariant features. Extensive experiments
demonstrate DiMPLe demonstrates superior performance compared to CoOp-OOD, when
averaged across 11 diverse datasets, and achieves absolute gains of 15.27 in
base class accuracy and 44.31 in novel class accuracy.

*Xianghan Meng,Zhengyu Tong,Zhiyuan Huang,Chun-Guang Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The study proposes Temporal Rate Reduction Clustering (TR²C) for Human Motion Segmentation, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Human Motion Segmentation (HMS) faces challenges with complex motion and cluttered backgrounds, which existing subspace clustering solutions struggle with.

Method: TR²C jointly learns structured temporal representations and affinity to segment frame sequences while ensuring consistency with a Union-of-Subspaces distribution.

Result: Experiments on five HMS benchmark datasets demonstrated TR²C achieves state-of-the-art performance.

Conclusion: TR²C advances HMS by providing robust segmentation in challenging scenarios, using improved temporal representations.

Abstract: Human Motion Segmentation (HMS), which aims to partition videos into
non-overlapping human motions, has attracted increasing research attention
recently. Existing approaches for HMS are mainly dominated by subspace
clustering methods, which are grounded on the assumption that high-dimensional
temporal data align with a Union-of-Subspaces (UoS) distribution. However, the
frames in video capturing complex human motions with cluttered backgrounds may
not align well with the UoS distribution. In this paper, we propose a novel
approach for HMS, named Temporal Rate Reduction Clustering
($\text{TR}^2\text{C}$), which jointly learns structured representations and
affinity to segment the frame sequences in video. Specifically, the structured
representations learned by $\text{TR}^2\text{C}$ maintain temporally consistent
and align well with a UoS structure, which is favorable for the HMS task. We
conduct extensive experiments on five benchmark HMS datasets and achieve
state-of-the-art performances with different feature extractors.

*Munish Monga,Vishal Chudasama,Pankaj Wasnik,Biplab Banerjee*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper presents DuET, a model designed for Dual Incremental Object Detection (DuIOD) that tackles class and domain shifts in real-world settings without requiring exemplar storage.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world object detection systems face challenges of learning new classes and adapting to domain changes. Existing methods address only one of these issues, limiting their effectiveness.

Method: The paper introduces DuET, a detector-agnostic model merging framework that leverages Task Arithmetic and a Directional Consistency Loss to balance incremental learning and adaptability.

Result: DuET achieved significant improvements in the Retention-Adaptability Index (RAI) across multiple datasets, outperforming existing methods in both retention and adaptability metrics.

Conclusion: DuET effectively addresses the dual challenges of class and domain shifts, establishing itself as a robust solution for incremental object detection in dynamic environments.

Abstract: Real-world object detection systems, such as those in autonomous driving and
surveillance, must continuously learn new object categories and simultaneously
adapt to changing environmental conditions. Existing approaches, Class
Incremental Object Detection (CIOD) and Domain Incremental Object Detection
(DIOD) only address one aspect of this challenge. CIOD struggles in unseen
domains, while DIOD suffers from catastrophic forgetting when learning new
classes, limiting their real-world applicability. To overcome these
limitations, we introduce Dual Incremental Object Detection (DuIOD), a more
practical setting that simultaneously handles class and domain shifts in an
exemplar-free manner. We propose DuET, a Task Arithmetic-based model merging
framework that enables stable incremental learning while mitigating sign
conflicts through a novel Directional Consistency Loss. Unlike prior methods,
DuET is detector-agnostic, allowing models like YOLO11 and RT-DETR to function
as real-time incremental object detectors. To comprehensively evaluate both
retention and adaptation, we introduce the Retention-Adaptability Index (RAI),
which combines the Average Retention Index (Avg RI) for catastrophic forgetting
and the Average Generalization Index for domain adaptability into a common
ground. Extensive experiments on the Pascal Series and Diverse Weather Series
demonstrate DuET's effectiveness, achieving a +13.12% RAI improvement while
preserving 89.3% Avg RI on the Pascal Series (4 tasks), as well as a +11.39%
RAI improvement with 88.57% Avg RI on the Diverse Weather Series (3 tasks),
outperforming existing methods.

### [134] [Video Virtual Try-on with Conditional Diffusion Transformer Inpainter](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21270)
*Cheng Zou,Senlin Cheng,Bolei Xu,Dandan Zheng,Xiaobo Li,Jingdong Chen,Ming Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ViTI (Video Try-on Inpainter) is a novel video virtual try-on method that frames the task as a conditional video inpainting problem using a Diffusion Transformer for heightened spatial-temporal consistency and garment detail preservation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing video virtual try-on methods suffer from inconsistency and fail to preserve garment details well across video frames, calling for a more robust, temporally consistent solution.

Method: The method formulates video virtual try-on as a conditional video inpainting task, using a Diffusion Transformer with 3D spatial-temporal attention. It incorporates progressive adaptation, masking strategies, and multi-stage training.

Result: Experimental results show that ViTI achieves superior spatial-temporal consistency and garment detail preservation compared to prior methods, as supported by both quantitative and qualitative evaluations.

Conclusion: Framing video virtual try-on as a video inpainting challenge, ViTI offers a more consistent and detail-preserving solution, demonstrating its effectiveness over previous approaches.

Abstract: Video virtual try-on aims to naturally fit a garment to a target person in
consecutive video frames. It is a challenging task, on the one hand, the output
video should be in good spatial-temporal consistency, on the other hand, the
details of the given garment need to be preserved well in all the frames.
Naively using image-based try-on methods frame by frame can get poor results
due to severe inconsistency. Recent diffusion-based video try-on methods,
though very few, happen to coincide with a similar solution: inserting temporal
attention into image-based try-on model to adapt it for video try-on task,
which have shown improvements but there still exist inconsistency problems. In
this paper, we propose ViTI (Video Try-on Inpainter), formulate and implement
video virtual try-on as a conditional video inpainting task, which is different
from previous methods. In this way, we start with a video generation problem
instead of an image-based try-on problem, which from the beginning has a better
spatial-temporal consistency. Specifically, at first we build a video
inpainting framework based on Diffusion Transformer with full 3D
spatial-temporal attention, and then we progressively adapt it for video
garment inpainting, with a collection of masking strategies and multi-stage
training. After these steps, the model can inpaint the masked garment area with
appropriate garment pixels according to the prompt with good spatial-temporal
consistency. Finally, as other try-on methods, garment condition is added to
the model to make sure the inpainted garment appearance and details are as
expected. Both quantitative and qualitative experimental results show that ViTI
is superior to previous works.

*Wenda Shi,Yiren Song,Zihan Rao,Dengming Zhang,Jiaming Liu,Xingxing Zou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper addresses the challenge of achieving word-level typography control in generated images by introducing a new dataset, the TIA framework, and the WordCon method.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Precise control over how text appears in generated images is difficult due to the lack of effective models and datasets for word-level scene text rendering.

Method: The paper introduces the TIA framework, which uses grounding models to enhance text-to-image generation. It also proposes WordCon, a parameter-efficient fine-tuning method for selective key parameters and losses to improve text disentanglement in images.

Result: Qualitative and quantitative evaluations demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms current state-of-the-art approaches for text rendering in generated images.

Conclusion: The study contributes novel techniques and datasets, enabling better text rendering with precise control in various applications such as artistic creation and text editing.

Abstract: Achieving precise word-level typography control within generated images
remains a persistent challenge. To address it, we newly construct a word-level
controlled scene text dataset and introduce the Text-Image Alignment (TIA)
framework. This framework leverages cross-modal correspondence between text and
local image regions provided by grounding models to enhance the Text-to-Image
(T2I) model training. Furthermore, we propose WordCon, a hybrid
parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) method. WordCon reparameterizes
selective key parameters, improving both efficiency and portability. This
allows seamless integration into diverse pipelines, including artistic text
rendering, text editing, and image-conditioned text rendering. To further
enhance controllability, the masked loss at the latent level is applied to
guide the model to concentrate on learning the text region in the image, and
the joint-attention loss provides feature-level supervision to promote
disentanglement between different words. Both qualitative and quantitative
results demonstrate the superiority of our method to the state of the art. The
datasets and source code will be available for academic use.

*Diego Biagini,Nassir Navab,Azade Farshad*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HieraSurg introduces a hierarchy-aware framework for generating surgical videos using specialized diffusion models, enabling consistent and fine-grained video outputs tied to surgical actions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of existing surgical video generation approaches, which lack consistency with surgical actions and phases due to insufficient fine-grained guidance and surgical understanding.

Method: The framework utilizes two diffusion models: a segmentation prediction model to handle coarse-grained semantic changes, followed by a second-stage model for texture rendering and integrating fine-grained visual features.

Result: Experimental results on Cholecystectomy videos demonstrate significant quantitative and qualitative improvements, including better generalization and higher frame-rate video generation compared to previous methods.

Conclusion: HieraSurg showcases notable consistency and fine-grained adherence, especially when using provided segmentation maps, and holds promise for practical surgical applications.

Abstract: Surgical Video Synthesis has emerged as a promising research direction
following the success of diffusion models in general-domain video generation.
Although existing approaches achieve high-quality video generation, most are
unconditional and fail to maintain consistency with surgical actions and
phases, lacking the surgical understanding and fine-grained guidance necessary
for factual simulation. We address these challenges by proposing HieraSurg, a
hierarchy-aware surgical video generation framework consisting of two
specialized diffusion models. Given a surgical phase and an initial frame,
HieraSurg first predicts future coarse-grained semantic changes through a
segmentation prediction model. The final video is then generated by a
second-stage model that augments these temporal segmentation maps with
fine-grained visual features, leading to effective texture rendering and
integration of semantic information in the video space. Our approach leverages
surgical information at multiple levels of abstraction, including surgical
phase, action triplets, and panoptic segmentation maps. The experimental
results on Cholecystectomy Surgical Video Generation demonstrate that the model
significantly outperforms prior work both quantitatively and qualitatively,
showing strong generalization capabilities and the ability to generate higher
frame-rate videos. The model exhibits particularly fine-grained adherence when
provided with existing segmentation maps, suggesting its potential for
practical surgical applications.

*Lars Möllenbrok,Behnood Rasti,Begüm Demir*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces CoSMAE, a self-supervised continual learning method for remote sensing based on masked autoencoders, which mitigates catastrophic forgetting without requiring extensive labeled data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Continual learning in remote sensing often relies on many labeled samples, which are costly and limited. There is a need for efficient methods to alleviate catastrophic forgetting while reducing dependency on labeled data.

Method: The proposed CoSMAE uses two components: data mixup to mix current and previous task images and model mixup knowledge distillation to interpolate model weights for better generalization and retention across tasks.

Result: CoSMAE significantly outperforms current state-of-the-art continual learning methods in masked autoencoders, achieving up to a 4.94% improvement.

Conclusion: CoSMAE demonstrates that combining data mixup and model mixup knowledge distillation can enhance continual learning in remote sensing, reducing catastrophic forgetting without reliance on labeled data.

Abstract: The development of continual learning (CL) methods, which aim to learn new
tasks in a sequential manner from the training data acquired continuously, has
gained great attention in remote sensing (RS). The existing CL methods in RS,
while learning new tasks, enhance robustness towards catastrophic forgetting.
This is achieved by using a large number of labeled training samples, which is
costly and not always feasible to gather in RS. To address this problem, we
propose a novel continual self-supervised learning method in the context of
masked autoencoders (denoted as CoSMAE). The proposed CoSMAE consists of two
components: i) data mixup; and ii) model mixup knowledge distillation. Data
mixup is associated with retaining information on previous data distributions
by interpolating images from the current task with those from the previous
tasks. Model mixup knowledge distillation is associated with distilling
knowledge from past models and the current model simultaneously by
interpolating their model weights to form a teacher for the knowledge
distillation. The two components complement each other to regularize the MAE at
the data and model levels to facilitate better generalization across tasks and
reduce the risk of catastrophic forgetting. Experimental results show that
CoSMAE achieves significant improvements of up to 4.94% over state-of-the-art
CL methods applied to MAE. Our code is publicly available at:

Motivation: To address the challenges in visual grounding within text-rich and multilingual document images, which are critical for improving document intelligence and VQA applications.

Method: The approach integrates multilingual OCR, large language models, and a novel region matching algorithm to localize answers at different granular levels (block, line, word, and point). They also introduce a benchmark dataset with fine-grained, human-verified annotations to evaluate their system.

Result: The method achieves state-of-the-art grounding accuracy, with line-level granularity providing the best balance between precision and recall. Limitations of existing vision-language models in precise localization are highlighted through comparative evaluations.

Conclusion: The proposed structured, alignment-based approach offers a more robust, interpretable, and practical solution for document understanding systems, especially in real-world scenarios. Datasets and code are made publicly available for further research.

Abstract: Visual grounding in text-rich document images is a critical yet underexplored
challenge for document intelligence and visual question answering (VQA)
systems. We present \drishtikon, a multi-granular visual grounding framework
designed to enhance interpretability and trust in VQA for complex, multilingual
documents. Our approach integrates robust multi-lingual OCR, large language
models, and a novel region matching algorithm to accurately localize answer
spans at block, line, word, and point levels. We curate a new benchmark from
the CircularsVQA test set, providing fine-grained, human-verified annotations
across multiple granularities. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our
method achieves state-of-the-art grounding accuracy, with line-level
granularity offering the best trade-off between precision and recall. Ablation
studies further highlight the benefits of multi-block and multi-line reasoning.
Comparative evaluations with leading vision-language models reveal the
limitations of current VLMs in precise localization, underscoring the
effectiveness of our structured, alignment-based approach. Our findings pave
the way for more robust and interpretable document understanding systems in

TL;DR: The paper explores leveraging synthetic data for Disentangled Representation Learning to improve real image representation and introduces a new metric to evaluate representation quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Disentangled Representation Learning struggles in real-world applications due to challenges like correlated generative factors and limited access to ground truth labels.

Method: Investigates using synthetic data for training and transferring disentangled representations to real data, complemented by fine-tuning and a novel interpretability metric.

Result: Empirical results demonstrate the possibility and effectiveness of transferring disentangled representations from synthetic to real data, maintaining certain disentanglement properties.

Conclusion: Synthetic data can serve as a useful tool for training representations that generalize to real-world data, with measurable disentanglement.

Abstract: Developing meaningful and efficient representations that separate the
fundamental structure of the data generation mechanism is crucial in
representation learning. However, Disentangled Representation Learning has not
fully shown its potential on real images, because of correlated generative
factors, their resolution and limited access to ground truth labels.
Specifically on the latter, we investigate the possibility of leveraging
synthetic data to learn general-purpose disentangled representations applicable
to real data, discussing the effect of fine-tuning and what properties of
disentanglement are preserved after the transfer. We provide an extensive
empirical study to address these issues. In addition, we propose a new
interpretable intervention-based metric, to measure the quality of factors
encoding in the representation. Our results indicate that some level of
disentanglement, transferring a representation from synthetic to real data, is
possible and effective.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current vision-language models struggle with complex visual tasks like understanding human poses and actions due to the absence of specialized instruction-following data.

Method: The authors created a 200,328-sample dataset integrating human keypoints with captions and bounding boxes, tailored for tasks like conversation, detailed description, and reasoning. The dataset was used to fine-tune the LLaVA-1.5-7B model, named LLaVA-Pose.

Result: The fine-tuned LLaVA-Pose model showed a significant 33.2% improvement in performance on the Extended Human Pose and Action Understanding Benchmark compared to the original model.

Conclusion: Integrating human keypoints into vision-language datasets significantly improves performance on human-centric visual tasks, demonstrating the potential of such datasets for advancing multimodal models.

Abstract: Current vision-language models (VLMs) are well-adapted for general visual
understanding tasks. However, they perform inadequately when handling complex
visual tasks related to human poses and actions due to the lack of specialized
vision-language instruction-following data. We introduce a method for
generating such data by integrating human keypoints with traditional visual
features such as captions and bounding boxes, enabling more precise
understanding of human-centric scenes. Our approach constructs a dataset
comprising 200,328 samples tailored to fine-tune models for human-centric
tasks, focusing on three areas: conversation, detailed description, and complex
reasoning. We establish an Extended Human Pose and Action Understanding
Benchmark (E-HPAUB) to assess model performance on human pose and action
understanding. We fine-tune the LLaVA-1.5-7B model using this dataset and
evaluate our resulting LLaVA-Pose model on the benchmark, achieving significant
improvements. Experimental results show an overall improvement of 33.2%
compared to the original LLaVA-1.5-7B model. These findings highlight the
effectiveness of keypoint-integrated data in enhancing multimodal models for

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a hierarchical input-dependent state space model for analyzing robot-assisted surgeries videos, addressing challenges in processing lengthy footage efficiently.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to improve surgical workflow analysis in robot-assisted surgeries where video processing is challenging due to procedure length and inefficiencies in current models (e.g., transformers).

Method: The paper proposes a state space model with a hierarchical structure: local-aggregation for detailed dynamics and global-relation for entire video dependencies. It also utilizes hybrid discrete-continuous supervision for training.

Result: The method achieves superior performance compared to state-of-the-art approaches, with significant improvements on datasets like Cholec80 (+2.8%), MICCAI2016 (+4.3%), and Heichole (+12.9%).

Conclusion: The proposed model effectively processes full-length surgical videos, capturing both local and global dynamics while outperforming existing methods. Its efficiency opens avenues for practical surgical workflow analysis applications.

Abstract: Surgical workflow analysis is essential in robot-assisted surgeries, yet the
long duration of such procedures poses significant challenges for comprehensive
video analysis. Recent approaches have predominantly relied on transformer
models; however, their quadratic attention mechanism restricts efficient
processing of lengthy surgical videos. In this paper, we propose a novel
hierarchical input-dependent state space model that leverages the linear
scaling property of state space models to enable decision making on full-length
videos while capturing both local and global dynamics. Our framework
incorporates a temporally consistent visual feature extractor, which appends a
state space model head to a visual feature extractor to propagate temporal
information. The proposed model consists of two key modules: a
local-aggregation state space model block that effectively captures intricate
local dynamics, and a global-relation state space model block that models
temporal dependencies across the entire video. The model is trained using a
hybrid discrete-continuous supervision strategy, where both signals of discrete
phase labels and continuous phase progresses are propagated through the
network. Experiments have shown that our method outperforms the current
state-of-the-art methods by a large margin (+2.8% on Cholec80, +4.3% on
MICCAI2016, and +12.9% on Heichole datasets). Code will be publicly available

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces PanSt3R, a novel approach for panoptic segmentation of 3D scenes that avoids test-time optimization and processes multi-view data in a single pass, achieving faster and state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the inefficiencies of relying on 2D panoptic segmentation for inherently 3D tasks, the authors aim to create a more integrated approach that leverages spatial relationships across views and eliminates computationally expensive post-processing.

Method: The authors propose PanSt3R, a model that jointly predicts 3D geometry and multi-view panoptic segmentation without test-time optimization. It builds upon existing 3D reconstruction frameworks (MUSt3R and DUSt3R) and refines multi-view mask merging and segmentation procedures.

Result: PanSt3R achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmarks for 3D scene segmentation and is significantly faster compared to traditional methods.

Conclusion: PanSt3R is a scalable and efficient approach for 3D panoptic segmentation, effectively addressing the limitations of prior solutions by integrating geometry and segmentation prediction.

Abstract: Panoptic segmentation of 3D scenes, involving the segmentation and
classification of object instances in a dense 3D reconstruction of a scene, is
a challenging problem, especially when relying solely on unposed 2D images.
Existing approaches typically leverage off-the-shelf models to extract
per-frame 2D panoptic segmentations, before optimizing an implicit geometric
representation (often based on NeRF) to integrate and fuse the 2D predictions.
We argue that relying on 2D panoptic segmentation for a problem inherently 3D
and multi-view is likely suboptimal as it fails to leverage the full potential
of spatial relationships across views. In addition to requiring camera
parameters, these approaches also necessitate computationally expensive
test-time optimization for each scene. Instead, in this work, we propose a
unified and integrated approach PanSt3R, which eliminates the need for
test-time optimization by jointly predicting 3D geometry and multi-view
panoptic segmentation in a single forward pass. Our approach builds upon recent
advances in 3D reconstruction, specifically upon MUSt3R, a scalable multi-view
version of DUSt3R, and enhances it with semantic awareness and multi-view
panoptic segmentation capabilities. We additionally revisit the standard
post-processing mask merging procedure and introduce a more principled approach
for multi-view segmentation. We also introduce a simple method for generating
novel-view predictions based on the predictions of PanSt3R and vanilla 3DGS.
Overall, the proposed PanSt3R is conceptually simple, yet fast and scalable,
and achieves state-of-the-art performance on several benchmarks, while being
orders of magnitude faster than existing methods.

### [143] [Generalizable Neural Electromagnetic Inverse Scattering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21349)
*Yizhe Cheng,Chunxun Tian,Haoru Wang,Wentao Zhu,Xiaoxuan Ma,Yizhou Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper presents a robust and generalizable physics-driven framework for solving Electromagnetic Inverse Scattering Problems (EISP) by proposing a two-stage model utilizing induced current as an intermediate representation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The traditional approach to solving EISP struggles due to its ill-posed and nonlinear nature, lacks generalization, and fails in sparse transmitter setups.

Method: The authors reformulate EISP as a two-stage inverse problem: a current estimator learns induced currents while a permittivity solver calculates relative permittivity, enabling generalizable end-to-end predictions.

Result: Experiments demonstrate that the proposed method achieves better reconstruction accuracy, generalization to unseen data, and robustness under sparse transmitter setups compared to previous state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: This framework fundamentally advances practical solutions for electromagnetic imaging by introducing a generalizable and physics-driven perspective for solving EISP efficiently.

Abstract: Solving Electromagnetic Inverse Scattering Problems (EISP) is fundamental in
applications such as medical imaging, where the goal is to reconstruct the
relative permittivity from scattered electromagnetic field. This inverse
process is inherently ill-posed and highly nonlinear, making it particularly
challenging. A recent machine learning-based approach, Img-Interiors, shows
promising results by leveraging continuous implicit functions. However, it
requires case-specific optimization, lacks generalization to unseen data, and
fails under sparse transmitter setups (e.g., with only one transmitter). To
address these limitations, we revisit EISP from a physics-informed perspective,
reformulating it as a two stage inverse transmission-scattering process. This
formulation reveals the induced current as a generalizable intermediate
representation, effectively decoupling the nonlinear scattering process from
the ill-posed inverse problem. Built on this insight, we propose the first
generalizable physics-driven framework for EISP, comprising a current estimator
and a permittivity solver, working in an end-to-end manner. The current
estimator explicitly learns the induced current as a physical bridge between
the incident and scattered field, while the permittivity solver computes the
relative permittivity directly from the estimated induced current. This design
enables data-driven training and generalizable feed-forward prediction of
relative permittivity on unseen data while maintaining strong robustness to
transmitter sparsity. Extensive experiments show that our method outperforms
state-of-the-art approaches in reconstruction accuracy, generalization, and
robustness. This work offers a fundamentally new perspective on electromagnetic
inverse scattering and represents a major step toward cost-effective practical
solutions for electromagnetic imaging.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces ShotBench, a benchmark for evaluating Vision-Language Models (VLMs) on cinematic understanding, and ShotQA, a large-scale dataset. Fine-tuned ShotVL surpasses existing models in performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Recent VLMs excel at general visual understanding but lack proficiency in grasping nuanced cinematic grammar, which limits fine-grained visual comprehension and precise AI-driven video generation.

Method: Developed ShotBench, with 3.5k expert QA pairs from 200+ films spanning eight cinematography dimensions, and ShotQA, a 70k-pair dataset. Fine-tuned ShotVL using supervised learning and Group Relative Policy Optimization.

Result: Evaluated 24 VLMs on ShotBench; even top models achieved below 60% accuracy. ShotVL outperformed all other models on cinematic tasks, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance.

Conclusion: The study establishes ShotVL as a significant improvement in AI cinematic understanding, contributing tools, data, and models to advance this domain.

Abstract: Cinematography, the fundamental visual language of film, is essential for
conveying narrative, emotion, and aesthetic quality. While recent
Vision-Language Models (VLMs) demonstrate strong general visual understanding,
their proficiency in comprehending the nuanced cinematic grammar embedded
within individual shots remains largely unexplored and lacks robust evaluation.
This critical gap limits both fine-grained visual comprehension and the
precision of AI-assisted video generation. To address this, we introduce
\textbf{ShotBench}, a comprehensive benchmark specifically designed for
cinematic language understanding. It features over 3.5k expert-annotated QA
pairs from images and video clips, meticulously curated from over 200 acclaimed
(predominantly Oscar-nominated) films and spanning eight key cinematography
dimensions. Our evaluation of 24 leading VLMs on ShotBench reveals their
substantial limitations: even the top-performing model achieves less than 60\%
average accuracy, particularly struggling with fine-grained visual cues and
complex spatial reasoning. To catalyze advancement in this domain, we construct
\textbf{ShotQA}, a large-scale multimodal dataset comprising approximately 70k
cinematic QA pairs. Leveraging ShotQA, we develop \textbf{ShotVL} through
supervised fine-tuning and Group Relative Policy Optimization. ShotVL
significantly outperforms all existing open-source and proprietary models on
ShotBench, establishing new \textbf{state-of-the-art} performance. We
open-source our models, data, and code to foster rapid progress in this crucial
area of AI-driven cinematic understanding and generation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces CoPa-SG, a synthetic dataset for 2D scene graphs featuring precise ground truth and annotated relations, and also proposes parametric and proto-relations for more detailed scene representation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address the lack of accurate scene graph data, which limits current progress in 2D scene understanding frameworks.

Method: They create CoPa-SG, a synthetic dataset with precise object relations, and propose two new relationship types: parametric relations, enriched with metrics like angles or distances, and proto-relations, representing hypothetical relationships in a scene.

Result: Using CoPa-SG, the authors evaluate existing scene graph generation models and successfully integrate the new relation types into applications, improving their reasoning and planning capabilities.

Conclusion: CoPa-SG and the introduction of new relation types enhance the granularity, flexibility, and utility of 2D scene graphs for diverse applications.

Abstract: 2D scene graphs provide a structural and explainable framework for scene
understanding. However, current work still struggles with the lack of accurate
scene graph data. To overcome this data bottleneck, we present CoPa-SG, a
synthetic scene graph dataset with highly precise ground truth and exhaustive
relation annotations between all objects. Moreover, we introduce parametric and
proto-relations, two new fundamental concepts for scene graphs. The former
provides a much more fine-grained representation than its traditional
counterpart by enriching relations with additional parameters such as angles or
distances. The latter encodes hypothetical relations in a scene graph and
describes how relations would form if new objects are placed in the scene.
Using CoPa-SG, we compare the performance of various scene graph generation
models. We demonstrate how our new relation types can be integrated in
downstream applications to enhance planning and reasoning capabilities.

*Zhixin Cheng,Jiacheng Deng,Xinjun Li,Xiaotian Yin,Bohao Liao,Baoqun Yin,Wenfei Yang,Tianzhu Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes enhancements for detection-free image-to-point cloud registration through channel adjustment and global selection methods, achieving state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve matching and registration accuracy between images and point clouds by addressing feature channel differences and redundant correspondences.

Method: The authors propose the Channel Adaptive Adjustment Module (CAA) to refine intra-modal and cross-modal features, and the Global Optimal Selection Module (GOS) to replace local with global correspondences.

Result: Experiments conducted on datasets RGB-D Scenes V2 and 7-Scenes notably improved registration accuracy, outperforming previous methods.

Conclusion: Their approach effectively enhances image-to-point cloud registration and demonstrates its utility in achieving superior matching and accuracy.

Abstract: Detection-free methods typically follow a coarse-to-fine pipeline, extracting
image and point cloud features for patch-level matching and refining dense
pixel-to-point correspondences. However, differences in feature channel
attention between images and point clouds may lead to degraded matching
results, ultimately impairing registration accuracy. Furthermore, similar
structures in the scene could lead to redundant correspondences in cross-modal
matching. To address these issues, we propose Channel Adaptive Adjustment
Module (CAA) and Global Optimal Selection Module (GOS). CAA enhances
intra-modal features and suppresses cross-modal sensitivity, while GOS replaces
local selection with global optimization. Experiments on RGB-D Scenes V2 and
7-Scenes demonstrate the superiority of our method, achieving state-of-the-art
performance in image-to-point cloud registration.

### [148] [FastRef:Fast Prototype Refinement for Few-Shot Industrial Anomaly Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21398)
*Long Tian,Yufei Li,Yuyang Dai,Wenchao Chen,Xiyang Liu,Bo Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduced FastRef, an efficient iterative prototype refinement framework for improving few-shot industrial anomaly detection (FS-IAD) using limited samples.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of FS-IAD in environments with limited normal data, which current methods fail to effectively integrate query image statistics to refine prototypes.

Method: FastRef refines prototypes via two stages: characteristic transfer through linear reconstruction using a transformation matrix, and anomaly suppression via alignment with optimal transport between query features and prototypes.

Result: FastRef is successfully integrated with three existing FS-IAD methods, demonstrating robust effectiveness and computing efficiency across four benchmark datasets (MVTec, ViSA, MPDD, RealIAD) under several few-shot settings.

Conclusion: FastRef refines FS-IAD processing, enabling prototype representativeness and improving anomaly detection in scarce-data conditions.

Abstract: Few-shot industrial anomaly detection (FS-IAD) presents a critical challenge
for practical automated inspection systems operating in data-scarce
environments. While existing approaches predominantly focus on deriving
prototypes from limited normal samples, they typically neglect to
systematically incorporate query image statistics to enhance prototype
representativeness. To address this issue, we propose FastRef, a novel and
efficient prototype refinement framework for FS-IAD. Our method operates
through an iterative two-stage process: (1) characteristic transfer from query
features to prototypes via an optimizable transformation matrix, and (2)
anomaly suppression through prototype alignment. The characteristic transfer is
achieved through linear reconstruction of query features from prototypes, while
the anomaly suppression addresses a key observation in FS-IAD that unlike
conventional IAD with abundant normal prototypes, the limited-sample setting
makes anomaly reconstruction more probable. Therefore, we employ optimal
transport (OT) for non-Gaussian sampled features to measure and minimize the
gap between prototypes and their refined counterparts for anomaly suppression.
For comprehensive evaluation, we integrate FastRef with three competitive
prototype-based FS-IAD methods: PatchCore, FastRecon, WinCLIP, and AnomalyDINO.
Extensive experiments across four benchmark datasets of MVTec, ViSA, MPDD and
RealIAD demonstrate both the effectiveness and computational efficiency of our
approach under 1/2/4-shots.

### [149] [Curve-Aware Gaussian Splatting for 3D Parametric Curve Reconstruction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21401)
*Zhirui Gao. Renjiao Yi,Yaqiao Dai,Xuening Zhu,Wei Chen,Chenyang Zhu,Kai Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a one-stage framework for reconstructing 3D parametric curves from multi-view edge maps, bypassing errors from two-stage methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To eliminate the optimization gap and error accumulation inherent in two-stage methods for 3D curve reconstruction, while achieving higher efficiency and performance.

Method: Introduces a CurveGaussian representation for differentiable rendering of 3D curves and a dynamic topology optimization framework with operations like linearization, merging, splitting, and pruning.

Result: The method achieves superior and cleaner reconstructions on benchmarks like the ABC dataset, while significantly reducing parameter count and improving efficiency.

Conclusion: The proposed one-stage framework outperforms traditional two-stage approaches in terms of reconstruction quality, efficiency, and robustness.

Abstract: This paper presents an end-to-end framework for reconstructing 3D parametric
curves directly from multi-view edge maps. Contrasting with existing two-stage
methods that follow a sequential ``edge point cloud reconstruction and
parametric curve fitting'' pipeline, our one-stage approach optimizes 3D
parametric curves directly from 2D edge maps, eliminating error accumulation
caused by the inherent optimization gap between disconnected stages. However,
parametric curves inherently lack suitability for rendering-based multi-view
optimization, necessitating a complementary representation that preserves their
geometric properties while enabling differentiable rendering. We propose a
novel bi-directional coupling mechanism between parametric curves and
edge-oriented Gaussian components. This tight correspondence formulates a
curve-aware Gaussian representation, \textbf{CurveGaussian}, that enables
differentiable rendering of 3D curves, allowing direct optimization guided by
multi-view evidence. Furthermore, we introduce a dynamically adaptive topology
optimization framework during training to refine curve structures through
linearization, merging, splitting, and pruning operations. Comprehensive
evaluations on the ABC dataset and real-world benchmarks demonstrate our
one-stage method's superiority over two-stage alternatives, particularly in
producing cleaner and more robust reconstructions. Additionally, by directly
optimizing parametric curves, our method significantly reduces the parameter
count during training, achieving both higher efficiency and superior
performance compared to existing approaches.

*Bowen Chen,Mengyi Zhao,Haomiao Sun,Li Chen,Xu Wang,Kang Du,Xinglong Wu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper presents XVerse, a model for precise and editable multi-subject image generation with control over various attributes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing diffusion transformers struggle with fine-grained, independent control of subject identity and semantic attributes in text-to-image generation, especially for multiple subjects, leading to artifact introduction and attribute entanglement.

Method: It introduces XVerse, which uses offset transformations from reference images for token-specific text-stream modulation, ensuring independent control of subjects without disturbing image latents or features.

Result: XVerse provides high-fidelity, editable multi-subject image synthesis, allowing robust and precise control over individual subject characteristics and attributes.

Conclusion: The model enhances personalized and complex scene generation, solving key issues of attribute entanglement and editability in current systems.

Abstract: Achieving fine-grained control over subject identity and semantic attributes
(pose, style, lighting) in text-to-image generation, particularly for multiple
subjects, often undermines the editability and coherence of Diffusion
Transformers (DiTs). Many approaches introduce artifacts or suffer from
attribute entanglement. To overcome these challenges, we propose a novel
multi-subject controlled generation model XVerse. By transforming reference
images into offsets for token-specific text-stream modulation, XVerse allows
for precise and independent control for specific subject without disrupting
image latents or features. Consequently, XVerse offers high-fidelity, editable
multi-subject image synthesis with robust control over individual subject
characteristics and semantic attributes. This advancement significantly
improves personalized and complex scene generation capabilities.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces HyperSORT, a framework using a hyper-network to identify and manage biases in medical imaging datasets, demonstrating its efficacy on synthetic and real-world datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Medical imaging datasets often suffer from diverse biases, such as inconsistent labeling or erroneous annotations, which can adversely affect the performance of deep segmentation networks. Identifying and understanding these biases remain challenging.

Method: The proposed method, HyperSORT, uses a hyper-network to predict UNet parameters from latent vectors that represent the variability of images and annotations. This joint training approach enables learning a complex distribution of UNet parameters, accommodating dataset biases and noise.

Result: HyperSORT was validated on the synthetically perturbed AMOS dataset and the large-scale TotalSegmentator dataset. The model effectively uncovered systematic biases, structured latent space clusters, and produced UNet parameters that perform segmentation in alignment with detected biases.

Conclusion: HyperSORT enhances bias detection and segmentation robustness in medical imaging datasets. It provides insights into dataset-specific biases through its structured latent space and effectively deals with noisy annotations. The authors made the code and dataset analysis publicly available for further research.

Abstract: Medical imaging datasets often contain heterogeneous biases ranging from
erroneous labels to inconsistent labeling styles. Such biases can negatively
impact deep segmentation networks performance. Yet, the identification and
characterization of such biases is a particularly tedious and challenging task.
In this paper, we introduce HyperSORT, a framework using a hyper-network
predicting UNets' parameters from latent vectors representing both the image
and annotation variability. The hyper-network parameters and the latent vector
collection corresponding to each data sample from the training set are jointly
learned. Hence, instead of optimizing a single neural network to fit a dataset,
HyperSORT learns a complex distribution of UNet parameters where low density
areas can capture noise-specific patterns while larger modes robustly segment
organs in differentiated but meaningful manners. We validate our method on two
3D abdominal CT public datasets: first a synthetically perturbed version of the
AMOS dataset, and TotalSegmentator, a large scale dataset containing real
unknown biases and errors. Our experiments show that HyperSORT creates a
structured mapping of the dataset allowing the identification of relevant
systematic biases and erroneous samples. Latent space clusters yield UNet
parameters performing the segmentation task in accordance with the underlying
learned systematic bias. The code and our analysis of the TotalSegmentator
dataset are made available: https://github.com/ImFusionGmbH/HyperSORT

TL;DR: The study benchmarks deep learning approaches for atypical mitotic figure (AMF) classification in breast cancer, achieving strong results using transfer learning and low-rank adaptation (LoRA).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurately identifying atypical mitoses is critical as they are markers of tumor malignancy but difficult to detect due to limited prevalence, subtle differences, and class imbalance in datasets, necessitating automated solutions.

Method: The paper evaluates various deep learning methods, including baseline models, foundation models with linear probing, and LoRA fine-tuned models, using both in-domain (AMi-Br) and out-of-domain datasets (AtNorM-Br and AtNorM-MD).

Result: The study achieves balanced accuracy scores of up to 0.8135 on AMi-Br and approximately 0.77 on AtNorM-Br and AtNorM-MD, with LoRA-based adaptation yielding the best performance.

Conclusion: Deep learning techniques, particularly LoRA-based fine-tuned foundation models, effectively classify atypical mitoses despite challenges, demonstrating the potential of advanced transfer learning methods in medical image analysis.

Abstract: Atypical mitoses mark a deviation in the cell division process that can be an
independent prognostically relevant marker for tumor malignancy. However, their
identification remains challenging due to low prevalence, at times subtle
morphological differences from normal mitoses, low inter-rater agreement among
pathologists, and class imbalance in datasets. Building on the Atypical Mitosis
dataset for Breast Cancer (AMi-Br), this study presents a comprehensive
benchmark comparing deep learning approaches for automated atypical mitotic
figure (AMF) classification, including baseline models, foundation models with
linear probing, and foundation models fine-tuned with low-rank adaptation
(LoRA). For rigorous evaluation, we further introduce two new hold-out AMF
datasets - AtNorM-Br, a dataset of mitoses from the The TCGA breast cancer
cohort, and AtNorM-MD, a multi-domain dataset of mitoses from the MIDOG++
training set. We found average balanced accuracy values of up to 0.8135,
0.7696, and 0.7705 on the in-domain AMi-Br and the out-of-domain AtNorm-Br and
AtNorM-MD datasets, respectively, with the results being particularly good for
LoRA-based adaptation of the Virchow-line of foundation models. Our work shows
that atypical mitosis classification, while being a challenging problem, can be
effectively addressed through the use of recent advances in transfer learning
and model fine-tuning techniques. We make available all code and data used in
this paper in this github repository:

*Mohamed Omran,Dimitris Kalatzis,Jens Petersen,Amirhossein Habibian,Auke Wiggers*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper presents a method for precise object placement in image editing, relying on visual maps and coarse masks combined with a powerful inpainting model.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current image editing methods struggle with accurately placing objects in specific locations and orientations, especially without elaborate prompts or masks.

Method: The proposed method uses a carefully crafted visual map and coarse object masks to generate a conditioning signal that aids object placement without altering the image background.

Result: The experiments in the automotive setting demonstrate the approach's capability to achieve precise placement while maintaining high appearance and pose accuracy.

Conclusion: The method proves effective in allowing fine control over object placement and appearance, offering improvements over existing techniques.

Abstract: Image editing approaches have become more powerful and flexible with the
advent of powerful text-conditioned generative models. However, placing objects
in an environment with a precise location and orientation still remains a
challenge, as this typically requires carefully crafted inpainting masks or
prompts. In this work, we show that a carefully designed visual map, combined
with coarse object masks, is sufficient for high quality object placement. We
design a conditioning signal that resolves ambiguities, while being flexible
enough to allow for changing of shapes or object orientations. By building on
an inpainting model, we leave the background intact by design, in contrast to
methods that model objects and background jointly. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of our method in the automotive setting, where we compare
different conditioning signals in novel object placement tasks. These tasks are
designed to measure edit quality not only in terms of appearance, but also in
terms of pose and location accuracy, including cases that require non-trivial
shape changes. Lastly, we show that fine location control can be combined with
appearance control to place existing objects in precise locations in a scene.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance emergency response capabilities in underground mining by leveraging automated miner detection technologies.

Method: Developed and validated a thermal imaging dataset for miner detection, and assessed various detection algorithms like YOLO models and RT-DETR.

Result: Validated the dataset through evaluation of state-of-the-art detection algorithms, demonstrating its utility for miner detection.

Conclusion: The dataset is a foundational step towards developing reliable thermal-based miner detection systems for emergency applications.

Abstract: Underground mining operations face significant safety challenges that make
emergency response capabilities crucial. While robots have shown promise in
assisting with search and rescue operations, their effectiveness depends on
reliable miner detection capabilities. Deep learning algorithms offer potential
solutions for automated miner detection, but require comprehensive training
datasets, which are currently lacking for underground mining environments. This
paper presents a novel thermal imaging dataset specifically designed to enable
the development and validation of miner detection systems for potential
emergency applications. We systematically captured thermal imagery of various
mining activities and scenarios to create a robust foundation for detection
algorithms. To establish baseline performance metrics, we evaluated several
state-of-the-art object detection algorithms including YOLOv8, YOLOv10, YOLO11,
and RT-DETR on our dataset. While not exhaustive of all possible emergency
situations, this dataset serves as a crucial first step toward developing
reliable thermal-based miner detection systems that could eventually be
deployed in real emergency scenarios. This work demonstrates the feasibility of
using thermal imaging for miner detection and establishes a foundation for
future research in this critical safety application.

### [155] [Rethinking Oversaturation in Classifier-Free Guidance via Low Frequency](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21452)
*Kaiyu Song,Hanjiang Lai*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Low-Frequency Improved Classifier-Free Guidance (LF-CFG) to address oversaturation and unrealistic artifacts in diffusion models caused by high guidance scales.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High guidance scales in Classifier-Free Guidance often cause oversaturation and unrealistic artifacts due to the accumulation of redundant low-frequency information.

Method: The paper proposes LF-CFG, which uses an adaptive threshold-based measurement to identify and down-weight redundant low-frequency signals during diffusion model optimization.

Result: The experimental results show that LF-CFG effectively reduces oversaturation and unrealistic artifacts in several diffusion models, including Stable Diffusion-XL and versions 2.1, 3.0, 3.5, and SiT-XL.

Conclusion: LF-CFG mitigates issues caused by high guidance scales through low-frequency management, improving the quality and realism of conditional diffusion model outputs.

Abstract: Classifier-free guidance (CFG) succeeds in condition diffusion models that
use a guidance scale to balance the influence of conditional and unconditional
terms. A high guidance scale is used to enhance the performance of the
conditional term. However, the high guidance scale often results in
oversaturation and unrealistic artifacts. In this paper, we introduce a new
perspective based on low-frequency signals, identifying the accumulation of
redundant information in these signals as the key factor behind oversaturation
and unrealistic artifacts. Building on this insight, we propose low-frequency
improved classifier-free guidance (LF-CFG) to mitigate these issues.
Specifically, we introduce an adaptive threshold-based measurement to pinpoint
the locations of redundant information. We determine a reasonable threshold by
analyzing the change rate of low-frequency information between prior and
current steps. We then apply a down-weight strategy to reduce the impact of
redundant information in the low-frequency signals. Experimental results
demonstrate that LF-CFG effectively alleviates oversaturation and unrealistic
artifacts across various diffusion models, including Stable Diffusion-XL,
Stable Diffusion 2.1, 3.0, 3.5, and SiT-XL.

*Mohammad Shokrolah Shirazi,Hung-Fu Chang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces three methods (static, dynamic, hybrid) for traffic signal optimization using TMC data and evaluates their performance in realistic simulations across six intersections in Las Vegas.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve traffic flow and congestion management by optimizing signal timing based on TMC data, considering diverse traffic patterns and intersection-specific characteristics.

Method: A vision-based tracking system was used to collect TMC data at six intersections. This data was integrated into SUMO simulations to evaluate signal timing designs under static, dynamic, and hybrid methods, considering different traffic patterns and zones.

Result: Dynamic signal timing performed better in four intersections with higher traffic-to-lane ratios, while static methods worked well for evenly distributed traffic. The hybrid method showed superior performance in managing bimodal traffic patterns by switching between dynamic and static methods.

Conclusion: The proposed hybrid method effectively balances peak and off-peak traffic flows and adapts well to zone-specific traffic patterns, making it a versatile solution for traffic signal design.

Abstract: The turning movement count data is crucial for traffic signal design,
intersection geometry planning, traffic flow, and congestion analysis. This
work proposes three methods called dynamic, static, and hybrid configuration
for TMC-based traffic signals. A vision-based tracking system is developed to
estimate the TMC of six intersections in Las Vegas using traffic cameras. The
intersection design, route (e.g. vehicle movement directions), and signal
configuration files with compatible formats are synthesized and imported into
Simulation of Urban MObility for signal evaluation with realistic data. The
initial experimental results based on estimated waiting times indicate that the
cycle time of 90 and 120 seconds works best for all intersections. In addition,
four intersections show better performance for dynamic signal timing
configuration, and the other two with lower performance have a lower ratio of
total vehicle count to total lanes of the intersection leg. Since daily traffic
flow often exhibits a bimodal pattern, we propose a hybrid signal method that
switches between dynamic and static methods, adapting to peak and off-peak
traffic conditions for improved flow management. So, a built-in traffic
generator module creates vehicle routes for 4 hours, including peak hours, and
a signal design module produces signal schedule cycles according to static,
dynamic, and hybrid methods. Vehicle count distributions are weighted
differently for each zone (i.e., West, North, East, South) to generate diverse
traffic patterns. The extended experimental results for 6 intersections with 4
hours of simulation time imply that zone-based traffic pattern distributions
affect signal design selection. Although the static method works great for
evenly zone-based traffic distribution, the hybrid method works well for highly
weighted traffic at intersection pairs of the West-East and North-South zones.

*Srikumar Sastry,Aayush Dhakal,Eric Xing,Subash Khanal,Nathan Jacobs*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces Radial Cross-Modal Embeddings (RCME) to better model hierarchical structures in vision-language tasks, outperforming previous methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the challenge of learning hierarchical structures in vision-language models, particularly by overcoming limitations in previous entailment learning methods.

Method: The authors propose RCME, a framework that explicitly enforces transitivity in entailment relationships, optimizing the partial order of concepts in hierarchical vision-language models.

Result: RCME demonstrates superior performance over state-of-the-art models in hierarchical species classification and hierarchical retrieval tasks.

Conclusion: RCME effectively models hierarchical relationships in vision-language data, making it a valuable tool for dealing with complex hierarchies like the Tree of Life.

Abstract: Learning the hierarchical structure of data in vision-language models is a
significant challenge. Previous works have attempted to address this challenge
by employing entailment learning. However, these approaches fail to model the
transitive nature of entailment explicitly, which establishes the relationship
between order and semantics within a representation space. In this work, we
introduce Radial Cross-Modal Embeddings (RCME), a framework that enables the
explicit modeling of transitivity-enforced entailment. Our proposed framework
optimizes for the partial order of concepts within vision-language models. By
leveraging our framework, we develop a hierarchical vision-language foundation
model capable of representing the hierarchy in the Tree of Life. Our
experiments on hierarchical species classification and hierarchical retrieval
tasks demonstrate the enhanced performance of our models compared to the
existing state-of-the-art models. Our code and models are open-sourced at

### [158] [TITAN: Query-Token based Domain Adaptive Adversarial Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21484)
*Tajamul Ashraf,Janibul Bashir*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper addresses the source-free domain adaptive object detection problem by proposing a method called TITAN, which improves pseudo-label reliability and reduces domain gaps, achieving superior performance across benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation lies in addressing the challenge of adapting object detection models to an unlabeled target domain when source data is unavailable, with a focus on mitigating performance collapse caused by noise in pseudo-labels.

Method: The paper introduces TITAN, a framework that separates target images into easy and hard subsets using a variance-based strategy and employs query-token-based adversarial modules to reduce domain gaps within a student-teacher framework.

Result: TITAN demonstrates superior performance across four natural imaging datasets and two medical datasets, with significant mAP improvements of up to +22.7% over state-of-the-art methods on various benchmarks.

Conclusion: The proposed TITAN method effectively tackles the problem of source-free domain adaptive object detection, offering a robust solution to domain bias and discrepancies while outperforming existing approaches.

Abstract: We focus on the source-free domain adaptive object detection (SF-DAOD)
problem when source data is unavailable during adaptation and the model must
adapt to an unlabeled target domain. The majority of approaches for the problem
employ a self-supervised approach using a student-teacher (ST) framework where
pseudo-labels are generated via a source-pretrained model for further
fine-tuning. We observe that the performance of a student model often degrades
drastically, due to the collapse of the teacher model, primarily caused by high
noise in pseudo-labels, resulting from domain bias, discrepancies, and a
significant domain shift across domains. To obtain reliable pseudo-labels, we
propose a Target-based Iterative Query-Token Adversarial Network (TITAN), which
separates the target images into two subsets: those similar to the source
(easy) and those dissimilar (hard). We propose a strategy to estimate variance
to partition the target domain. This approach leverages the insight that higher
detection variances correspond to higher recall and greater similarity to the
source domain. Also, we incorporate query-token-based adversarial modules into
a student-teacher baseline framework to reduce the domain gaps between two
feature representations. Experiments conducted on four natural imaging datasets
and two challenging medical datasets have substantiated the superior
performance of TITAN compared to existing state-of-the-art (SOTA)
methodologies. We report an mAP improvement of +22.7, +22.2, +21.1, and +3.7
percent over the current SOTA on C2F, C2B, S2C, and K2C benchmarks,
respectively.

### [159] [Towards Reliable Detection of Empty Space: Conditional Marked Point Processes for Object Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21486)
*Tobias J. Riedlinger,Kira Maag,Hanno Gottschalk*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces a spatial statistics-based object detection model to improve calibration and estimate the uncertainty of free areas in vision tasks, addressing risks in applications like automated driving.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional deep neural network models for object detection and segmentation have poorly calibrated confidence estimates and cannot assess uncertainty in regions without detected objects, posing safety risks for applications like autonomous vehicles.

Method: The authors propose a model based on marked point processes, a statistical framework commonly used for spatial point event occurrences. It includes a likelihood-based training process to deliver better-calibrated predictions and provides confidence estimates about regions being free of obstacles.

Result: The proposed method demonstrated improved calibration and the ability to assess the drivability of empty regions, validated by calibration assessments and performance evaluations.

Conclusion: The work leads to better-calibrated object detection models with safer uncertainty quantification, critical for applications requiring high reliability like automated driving.

Abstract: Deep neural networks have set the state-of-the-art in computer vision tasks
such as bounding box detection and semantic segmentation. Object detectors and
segmentation models assign confidence scores to predictions, reflecting the
model's uncertainty in object detection or pixel-wise classification. However,
these confidence estimates are often miscalibrated, as their architectures and
loss functions are tailored to task performance rather than probabilistic
foundation. Even with well calibrated predictions, object detectors fail to
quantify uncertainty outside detected bounding boxes, i.e., the model does not
make a probability assessment of whether an area without detected objects is
truly free of obstacles. This poses a safety risk in applications such as
automated driving, where uncertainty in empty areas remains unexplored. In this
work, we propose an object detection model grounded in spatial statistics.
Bounding box data matches realizations of a marked point process, commonly used
to describe the probabilistic occurrence of spatial point events identified as
bounding box centers, where marks are used to describe the spatial extension of
bounding boxes and classes. Our statistical framework enables a
likelihood-based training and provides well-defined confidence estimates for
whether a region is drivable, i.e., free of objects. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of our method through calibration assessments and evaluation of
performance.

### [160] [Mitigating Hallucination of Large Vision-Language Models via Dynamic Logits Calibration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21509)
*Jiahe Chen,Jiaying He,Qian Shao,Qiyuan Chen,Jiahe Ying,Hongxia Xu,Jintai Chen,Jianwei Zheng,Jian Wu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces Dynamic Logits Calibration (DLC), a training-free decoding method for Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) to reduce hallucinations by dynamically aligning text generation with visual inputs during inference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LVLMs often generate text that contradicts visual input, known as hallucination, which compromises their reliability.

Method: DLC utilizes CLIP to assess semantic alignment and employs Relative Visual Advantage (RVA) to dynamically adjust token logits for visually grounded text generation. It also integrates an adaptive weighting mechanism informed by context alignment scores.

Result: The DLC framework significantly reduces hallucinations across benchmarks and LVLM architectures like LLaVA, InstructBLIP, and MiniGPT-4, while ensuring high inference efficiency.

Conclusion: DLC offers an effective and efficient solution to enhance LVLM reliability by reducing hallucinations without requiring multiple forward passes.

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have demonstrated significant
advancements in multimodal understanding, yet they are frequently hampered by
hallucination-the generation of text that contradicts visual input. Existing
training-free decoding strategies exhibit critical limitations, including the
use of static constraints that do not adapt to semantic drift during
generation, inefficiency stemming from the need for multiple forward passes,
and degradation of detail due to overly rigid intervention rules. To overcome
these challenges, this paper introduces Dynamic Logits Calibration (DLC), a
novel training-free decoding framework designed to dynamically align text
generation with visual evidence at inference time. At the decoding phase, DLC
step-wise employs CLIP to assess the semantic alignment between the input image
and the generated text sequence. Then, the Relative Visual Advantage (RVA) of
candidate tokens is evaluated against a dynamically updated contextual
baseline, adaptively adjusting output logits to favor tokens that are visually
grounded. Furthermore, an adaptive weighting mechanism, informed by a real-time
context alignment score, carefully balances the visual guidance while ensuring
the overall quality of the textual output. Extensive experiments conducted
across diverse benchmarks and various LVLM architectures (such as LLaVA,
InstructBLIP, and MiniGPT-4) demonstrate that DLC significantly reduces
hallucinations, outperforming current methods while maintaining high inference
efficiency by avoiding multiple forward passes. Overall, we present an
effective and efficient decoding-time solution to mitigate hallucinations,
thereby enhancing the reliability of LVLMs for more practices. Code will be
released on Github.

*Wentao Hu,Shunkai Li,Ziqiao Peng,Haoxian Zhang,Fan Shi,Xiaoqiang Liu,Pengfei Wan,Di Zhang,Hui Tian*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces GGTalker, a method for creating high-quality, generalizable speech-driven 3D talking heads by combining generalizable priors and identity-specific adaptations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses challenges faced by existing methods, such as poor performance in large head rotations and OOD audio, and inefficient identity-specific training due to insufficient 3D priors.

Method: The authors propose a two-stage Prior-Adaptation strategy with Gaussian head priors, along with Audio-Expression and Expression-Visual priors to capture universal patterns. Additional tools like a color MLP and a Body Inpainter enhance texture detail and background blending.

Result: GGTalker demonstrated state-of-the-art performance in rendering quality, 3D consistency, lip-sync accuracy, and improved training efficiency.

Conclusion: GGTalker validates the importance of integrating generalizable and identity-specific adaptations with enhanced priors for robust and photorealistic 3D talking head synthesis.

Abstract: Creating high-quality, generalizable speech-driven 3D talking heads remains a
persistent challenge. Previous methods achieve satisfactory results for fixed
viewpoints and small-scale audio variations, but they struggle with large head
rotations and out-of-distribution (OOD) audio. Moreover, they are constrained
by the need for time-consuming, identity-specific training. We believe the core
issue lies in the lack of sufficient 3D priors, which limits the extrapolation
capabilities of synthesized talking heads. To address this, we propose
GGTalker, which synthesizes talking heads through a combination of
generalizable priors and identity-specific adaptation. We introduce a two-stage
Prior-Adaptation training strategy to learn Gaussian head priors and adapt to
individual characteristics. We train Audio-Expression and Expression-Visual
priors to capture the universal patterns of lip movements and the general
distribution of head textures. During the Customized Adaptation, individual
speaking styles and texture details are precisely modeled. Additionally, we
introduce a color MLP to generate fine-grained, motion-aligned textures and a
Body Inpainter to blend rendered results with the background, producing
indistinguishable, photorealistic video frames. Comprehensive experiments show
that GGTalker achieves state-of-the-art performance in rendering quality, 3D
consistency, lip-sync accuracy, and training efficiency.

*Mohammed Rakib,Arunkumar Bagavathi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces Gradient-Guided Distillation (G$^{2}$D), a framework addressing modality imbalance in multimodal learning, ensuring optimal use of weak modalities and achieving superior performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional multimodal models underutilize weak modalities due to modality imbalance, leading to suboptimal feature representations.

Method: The authors propose G$^{2}$D, which combines unimodal and multimodal objectives in a custom loss function and employs a dynamic sequential modality prioritization technique during training.

Result: Experiments on multiple datasets show that G$^{2}$D enhances weak modalities' significance and outperforms leading methods in classification and regression tasks.

Conclusion: G$^{2}$D effectively addresses modality imbalance, providing a more balanced and impactful multimodal learning framework.

Abstract: Multimodal learning aims to leverage information from diverse data modalities
to achieve more comprehensive performance. However, conventional multimodal
models often suffer from modality imbalance, where one or a few modalities
dominate model optimization, leading to suboptimal feature representation and
underutilization of weak modalities. To address this challenge, we introduce
Gradient-Guided Distillation (G$^{2}$D), a knowledge distillation framework
that optimizes the multimodal model with a custom-built loss function that
fuses both unimodal and multimodal objectives. G$^{2}$D further incorporates a
dynamic sequential modality prioritization (SMP) technique in the learning
process to ensure each modality leads the learning process, avoiding the
pitfall of stronger modalities overshadowing weaker ones. We validate G$^{2}$D
on multiple real-world datasets and show that G$^{2}$D amplifies the
significance of weak modalities while training and outperforms state-of-the-art
methods in classification and regression tasks. Our code is available at

*Polina Karpikova,Daniil Selikhanovych,Kirill Struminsky,Ruslan Musaev,Maria Golitsyna,Dmitry Baranchuk*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MADrive introduces a memory-augmented reconstruction framework for autonomous driving environments by replacing observed vehicles with realistic 3D assets from a large-scale memory bank, enabling photorealistic synthesis of altered scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current scene reconstruction methods struggle with photorealistic synthesis for significantly altered or novel autonomous driving scenarios, necessitating a framework that extends realism and flexibility.

Method: MADrive retrieves 3D vehicle assets from an external memory bank, reconstructs multi-view representations from car videos, and integrates them into AD scenes with orientation alignment and relighting.

Result: The system enables enhanced scene configurations, offering photorealistic synthesis of environments, supported by the release of MAD-Cars, a curated dataset of around 70K car videos captured in diverse settings.

Conclusion: MADrive and MAD-Cars advance scene reconstruction for AD, enabling flexible and realistic modifications to create novel driving scenarios with high photorealism.

Abstract: Recent advances in scene reconstruction have pushed toward highly realistic
modeling of autonomous driving (AD) environments using 3D Gaussian splatting.
However, the resulting reconstructions remain closely tied to the original
observations and struggle to support photorealistic synthesis of significantly
altered or novel driving scenarios. This work introduces MADrive, a
memory-augmented reconstruction framework designed to extend the capabilities
of existing scene reconstruction methods by replacing observed vehicles with
visually similar 3D assets retrieved from a large-scale external memory bank.
Specifically, we release MAD-Cars, a curated dataset of ${\sim}70$K 360{\deg}
car videos captured in the wild and present a retrieval module that finds the
most similar car instances in the memory bank, reconstructs the corresponding
3D assets from video, and integrates them into the target scene through
orientation alignment and relighting. The resulting replacements provide
complete multi-view representations of vehicles in the scene, enabling
photorealistic synthesis of substantially altered configurations, as
demonstrated in our experiments. Project page:

*Yihan Wang,Jia Deng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: WAFT introduces a new method for optical flow using high-resolution warping instead of cost volume, delivering better accuracy and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To challenge the traditional belief that cost volume is necessary for optimal optical flow performance and to create a more efficient and accurate architecture.

Method: WAFT employs high-resolution warping instead of cost volumes, designed as a meta-architecture with minimal inductive biases and less reliance on custom designs.

Result: WAFT achieves top rankings on optical flow benchmarks (Spring and KITTI), demonstrates superior zero-shot generalization, and is up to 4.1x faster than similarly performing methods.

Conclusion: The paper validates that WAFT provides a new, simple, and efficient approach to optical flow, refuting the necessity of cost volumes for high performance.

Abstract: We introduce Warping-Alone Field Transforms (WAFT), a simple and effective
method for optical flow. WAFT is similar to RAFT but replaces cost volume with
high-resolution warping, achieving better accuracy with lower memory cost. This
design challenges the conventional wisdom that constructing cost volumes is
necessary for strong performance. WAFT is a simple and flexible
meta-architecture with minimal inductive biases and reliance on custom designs.
Compared with existing methods, WAFT ranks 1st on Spring and KITTI benchmarks,
achieves the best zero-shot generalization on KITTI, while being up to 4.1x
faster than methods with similar performance. Code and model weights are

*Hani Alomari,Anushka Sivakumar,Andrew Zhang,Chris Thomas*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper addresses challenges in cross-modal image-text retrieval by introducing improved set-based representations and loss functions, achieving state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional single-vector embeddings fail to capture the complex associations between image and text modalities, necessitating richer, set-based approaches.

Method: The authors propose Maximal Pair Assignment Similarity for one-to-one matching and introduce two loss functions—Global Discriminative Loss and Intra-Set Divergence Loss—to enhance the semantic diversity of embedding sets.

Result: The proposed method outperforms existing techniques and sets new benchmarks on MS-COCO and Flickr30k datasets without relying on external data.

Conclusion: Set-based representations, optimized by the presented methods, can effectively address semantic diversity and retrieval limitations in cross-modal tasks.

Abstract: Cross-modal image-text retrieval is challenging because of the diverse
possible associations between content from different modalities. Traditional
methods learn a single-vector embedding to represent semantics of each sample,
but struggle to capture nuanced and diverse relationships that can exist across
modalities. Set-based approaches, which represent each sample with multiple
embeddings, offer a promising alternative, as they can capture richer and more
diverse relationships. In this paper, we show that, despite their promise,
these set-based representations continue to face issues including sparse
supervision and set collapse, which limits their effectiveness. To address
these challenges, we propose Maximal Pair Assignment Similarity to optimize
one-to-one matching between embedding sets which preserve semantic diversity
within the set. We also introduce two loss functions to further enhance the
representations: Global Discriminative Loss to enhance distinction among
embeddings, and Intra-Set Divergence Loss to prevent collapse within each set.
Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on MS-COCO and Flickr30k
without relying on external data.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: StruMamba3D enhances point cloud representation learning by addressing spatial dependencies and input length sensitivity, outperforming other methods in tasks like ModelNet40 and ScanObjectNN.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Challenges in Mamba-based point cloud methods include disrupted adjacency of 3D points and limited long-sequence memory handling.

Method: StruMamba3D introduces spatial states for preserving point adjacency, state-wise update strategies, lightweight convolution for efficient modeling, and a sequence length-adaptive strategy.

Result: The method achieves state-of-the-art performance with 95.1% accuracy on ModelNet40 and 92.75% on ScanObjectNN (challenging split).

Conclusion: StruMamba3D demonstrates improved efficiency and accuracy in self-supervised point cloud representation learning.

Abstract: Recently, Mamba-based methods have demonstrated impressive performance in
point cloud representation learning by leveraging State Space Model (SSM) with
the efficient context modeling ability and linear complexity. However, these
methods still face two key issues that limit the potential of SSM: Destroying
the adjacency of 3D points during SSM processing and failing to retain
long-sequence memory as the input length increases in downstream tasks. To
address these issues, we propose StruMamba3D, a novel paradigm for
self-supervised point cloud representation learning. It enjoys several merits.
First, we design spatial states and use them as proxies to preserve spatial
dependencies among points. Second, we enhance the SSM with a state-wise update
strategy and incorporate a lightweight convolution to facilitate interactions
between spatial states for efficient structure modeling. Third, our method
reduces the sensitivity of pre-trained Mamba-based models to varying input
lengths by introducing a sequence length-adaptive strategy. Experimental
results across four downstream tasks showcase the superior performance of our
method. In addition, our method attains the SOTA 95.1% accuracy on ModelNet40
and 92.75% accuracy on the most challenging split of ScanObjectNN without
voting strategy.

*Yansong Qu,Shaohui Dai,Xinyang Li,Yuze Wang,You Shen,Liujuan Cao,Rongrong Ji*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper presents an end-to-end framework for occlusion-aware 3D object reconstruction using multi-view generation from a single image.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for reconstructing 3D objects struggle under real-world occlusions and inconsistent view synthesis.

Method: The framework utilizes a self-supervised training pipeline with occluded-unoccluded image pairs and pseudo-ground-truth views to synthesize six consistent novel views of a partially occluded image.

Result: The proposed method improves structural consistency in generating views, enabling downstream 3D reconstruction without additional pre-processing.

Conclusion: This approach enhances the quality of 3D reconstructions under occlusions and introduces a first-of-its-kind benchmark for standardized evaluations.

Abstract: Reconstructing 3D objects from a single image is a long-standing challenge,
especially under real-world occlusions. While recent diffusion-based view
synthesis models can generate consistent novel views from a single RGB image,
they generally assume fully visible inputs and fail when parts of the object
are occluded. This leads to inconsistent views and degraded 3D reconstruction
quality. To overcome this limitation, we propose an end-to-end framework for
occlusion-aware multi-view generation. Our method directly synthesizes six
structurally consistent novel views from a single partially occluded image,
enabling downstream 3D reconstruction without requiring prior inpainting or
manual annotations. We construct a self-supervised training pipeline using the
Pix2Gestalt dataset, leveraging occluded-unoccluded image pairs and
pseudo-ground-truth views to teach the model structure-aware completion and
view consistency. Without modifying the original architecture, we fully
fine-tune the view synthesis model to jointly learn completion and multi-view
generation. Additionally, we introduce the first benchmark for occlusion-aware
reconstruction, encompassing diverse occlusion levels, object categories, and
mask patterns. This benchmark provides a standardized protocol for evaluating
future methods under partial occlusions. Our code is available at

Motivation: There is a need for benchmarks capable of integrating multimodal and multiview data for 3D anomaly detection in high-interest manufacturing scenarios.

Method: SiM3D introduces a multimodal multiview dataset with high-resolution images and point clouds, and establishes reference baselines by adapting singleview methods.

Result: SiM3D provides a dataset with 333 instances across eight object types captured using industrial-grade sensors. It includes CAD models and manual annotations for testing, along with novel metrics for evaluation.

Conclusion: SiM3D addresses critical gaps in multiview and multimodal 3D anomaly segmentation, enabling synthetic-to-real generalization for single-instance training setups.

Abstract: We propose SiM3D, the first benchmark considering the integration of
multiview and multimodal information for comprehensive 3D anomaly detection and
segmentation (ADS), where the task is to produce a voxel-based Anomaly Volume.
Moreover, SiM3D focuses on a scenario of high interest in manufacturing:
single-instance anomaly detection, where only one object, either real or
synthetic, is available for training. In this respect, SiM3D stands out as the
first ADS benchmark that addresses the challenge of generalising from synthetic
training data to real test data. SiM3D includes a novel multimodal multiview
dataset acquired using top-tier industrial sensors and robots. The dataset
features multiview high-resolution images (12 Mpx) and point clouds (7M points)
for 333 instances of eight types of objects, alongside a CAD model for each
type. We also provide manually annotated 3D segmentation GTs for anomalous test
samples. To establish reference baselines for the proposed multiview 3D ADS
task, we adapt prominent singleview methods and assess their performance using
novel metrics that operate on Anomaly Volumes.

*Ankur Lahiry,Ayush Pokharel,Seth Ockerman,Amal Gueroudji,Line Pouchard,Tanzima Z. Islam*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: The paper presents a distributed framework to analyze large-scale GPU profiler data efficiently, overcoming memory and runtime constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current performance log analysis tools are inadequate for handling the increasing complexity and size of HPC workflows.

Method: Proposes partitioning data into shards, processed concurrently across MPI ranks, to reduce memory pressure and enhance exploration efficiency.

Result: Demonstration of diagnosing performance variability and identifying memory transfer latency effects on GPU kernel behavior using actual traces.

Conclusion: The framework effectively addresses analysis challenges, enabling scalable, low-latency data investigation for complex workloads.

Abstract: Analyzing large-scale performance logs from GPU profilers often requires
terabytes of memory and hours of runtime, even for basic summaries. These
constraints prevent timely insight and hinder the integration of performance
analytics into automated workflows. Existing analysis tools typically process
data sequentially, making them ill-suited for HPC workflows with growing trace
complexity and volume. We introduce a distributed data analysis framework that
scales with dataset size and compute availability. Rather than treating the
dataset as a single entity, our system partitions it into independently
analyzable shards and processes them concurrently across MPI ranks. This design
reduces per-node memory pressure, avoids central bottlenecks, and enables
low-latency exploration of high-dimensional trace data. We apply the framework
to end-to-end Nsight Compute traces from real HPC and AI workloads, demonstrate
its ability to diagnose performance variability, and uncover the impact of
memory transfer latency on GPU kernel behavior.

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: ClusterRCA is a new framework for diagnosing network failures in HPC systems, combining multimodal data analysis with classifier and graph-based methods to achieve high accuracy and robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address challenges like data heterogeneity and lack of accuracy in existing network failure diagnosis methods for HPC systems.

Method: ClusterRCA leverages multimodal data from connected NIC pairs, combines classifier-based and graph-based approaches, and utilizes a customized random walk on a failure graph to localize root causes and determine failure types.

Result: Experiments show that ClusterRCA demonstrates high accuracy in diagnosing network failures and maintains strong performance across varying application scenarios.

Conclusion: ClusterRCA is an effective and adaptable solution for accurate network failure diagnosis in HPC systems, leveraging multimodal data and a hybrid methodology.

Abstract: Network failure diagnosis is challenging yet critical for high-performance
computing (HPC) systems. Existing methods cannot be directly applied to HPC
scenarios due to data heterogeneity and lack of accuracy. This paper proposes a
novel framework, called ClusterRCA, to localize culprit nodes and determine
failure types by leveraging multimodal data. ClusterRCA extracts features from
topologically connected network interface controller (NIC) pairs to analyze the
diverse, multimodal data in HPC systems. To accurately localize culprit nodes
and determine failure types, ClusterRCA combines classifier-based and
graph-based approaches. A failure graph is constructed based on the output of
the state classifier, and then it performs a customized random walk on the
graph to localize the root cause. Experiments on datasets collected by a
top-tier global HPC device vendor show ClusterRCA achieves high accuracy in
diagnosing network failure for HPC systems. ClusterRCA also maintains robust
performance across different application scenarios.

### [171] [Utility-Driven Speculative Decoding for Mixture-of-Experts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20675)
*Anish Saxena,Po-An Tsai,Hritvik Taneja,Aamer Jaleel,Moinuddin Qureshi*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: The study identifies speculative decoding as inefficient for Mixture of Experts (MoE) models due to increased data movement, proposing Cascade as an adaptive framework for optimizing its utility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address inefficiency in speculative decoding for MoE models where data movement and verification cost hinder practical gains.

Method: Cascade dynamically disables and adjusts speculation K-values based on a utility metric measuring token gains relative to verification costs.

Result: Cascade reduces slowdown to 5% (vs. 1.5x) and boosts throughput by 7-14% over static K in various workloads for MoE models.

Conclusion: Cascade makes speculative decoding feasible for MoE models by adapting implementation to maximize efficiency, overcoming limitations of previous static methods.

Abstract: GPU memory bandwidth is the main bottleneck for low-latency Large Language
Model (LLM) inference. Speculative decoding leverages idle GPU compute by using
a lightweight drafter to propose K tokens, which the LLM verifies in parallel,
boosting token throughput. In conventional dense LLMs, all model weights are
fetched each iteration, so speculation adds no latency overhead. Emerging
Mixture of Experts (MoE) models activate only a subset of weights per token,
greatly reducing data movement. However, we show that speculation is
ineffective for MoEs: draft tokens collectively activate more weights,
increasing data movement and verification time by 2-3x. When token throughput
gains fail to offset this overhead, speculation causes slowdowns up to 1.5x,
making it infeasible. Even when useful, the optimal K varies by task, model,
and even between requests and iterations. Thus, despite widespread use in dense
LLMs, speculation remains impractical in leading MoEs.
  We present Cascade, a utility-driven framework that selectively enables
speculation to avoid slowdowns and dynamically tunes K to accelerate MoE
serving. Cascade uses a lightweight metric, speculation utility, the ratio of
token gains to verification cost, which shows iteration-level locality,
enabling periodic decisions via short test and longer set phases. For each
request, Cascade disables speculation if utility drops below one during
testing, and when utility exceeds one, tests multiple K-values to choose the
utility-maximizing K for the set phase. We implement Cascade in vLLM and
evaluate it on five popular MoEs with workloads spanning code, math,
extraction, and mixed tasks. Cascade limits slowdown to 5% (vs. 1.5x) and
improves throughput by 7-14% over static K, making speculative decoding
practical for MoEs.

*Joshua H. Davis,Daniel Nichols,Ishan Khillan,Abhinav Bhatele*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: This paper introduces ParEval-Repo, a benchmarking and testing framework to evaluate the capability of large language models (LLMs) in translating GPGPU codebases across execution models. Results highlight feasibility for small programs but challenges with larger codebases due to dependency issues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The diversity of GPGPU architectures and associated programming models has led to increased complexity for developers to port and optimize code. The paper seeks to leverage LLMs to reduce this burden.

Method: The authors created ParEval-Repo, a framework featuring scientific computing and AI mini-applications of varied complexity. They used it to evaluate multiple LLMs, examining compilability, correctness, build errors, and inference token costs.

Result: LLMs showed promise in translating small GPGPU programs, but scaling to larger repositories posed challenges due to difficulties in handling functional build systems and cross-file dependencies.

Conclusion: While LLMs hold potential for automating GPGPU code translation, technical obstacles remain for larger codebases. Improvements in handling build systems and dependencies are essential for broader applicability.

Abstract: GPGPU architectures have become significantly diverse in recent years, which
has led to an emergence of a variety of specialized programming models and
software stacks to support them. While portable execution models exist, they
still require significant developer effort to port to and optimize for
different hardware architectures. Recent advances in large language models
(LLMs) can help us reduce some of this programmer burden. In this paper, we
present a novel benchmark and testing framework, ParEval-Repo, which can be
used to evaluate the efficacy of LLM-based approaches in automatically
translating entire codebases across GPGPU execution models. ParEval-Repo
includes several scientific computing and AI mini-applications in a range of
programming models, and levels of repository complexity. We use ParEval-Repo to
evaluate a range of state-of-the-art open-source and commercial LLMs, with both
a non-agentic and a top-down agentic approach. We assess code generated by the
LLMs and approaches in terms of compilability, functional correctness,
categories of build errors, and the cost of translation in terms of the number
of inference tokens. Our results demonstrate that LLM translation of scientific
applications is feasible for small programs but difficulty with generating
functional build systems and cross-file dependencies pose challenges in scaling
to larger codebases.

*Måns I. Andersson,Martin Karp,Niclas Jansson,Stefano Markidis*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: This paper addresses the challenge of targeting diverse HPC architectures by utilizing DaCe for automated high-performance kernel generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: An increasing diversity of hardware architectures in HPC necessitates architecture-specific code, making scientific applications less sustainable.

Method: The proposed approach employs DaCe's Stateful Dataflow Multigraph (SDFG) to automatically generate high-performance kernels for various HPC accelerators and integrate them into existing solvers.

Result: The technique demonstrates portable and competitive performance across multiple GPU platforms, including Nvidia GH200, A100, and AMD MI250X.

Conclusion: DaCe provides a viable and sustainable solution for high-performance computation on diverse HPC platforms, reducing developer effort and improving code portability.

Abstract: With the emergence of new high-performance computing (HPC) accelerators, such
as Nvidia and AMD GPUs, efficiently targeting diverse hardware architectures
has become a major challenge for HPC application developers. The increasing
hardware diversity in HPC systems often necessitates the development of
architecture-specific code, hindering the sustainability of large-scale
scientific applications. In this work, we leverage DaCe, a data-centric
parallel programming framework, to automate the generation of high-performance
kernels. DaCe enables automatic code generation for multicore processors and
various accelerators, reducing the burden on developers who would otherwise
need to rewrite code for each new architecture. Our study demonstrates DaCe's
capabilities by applying its automatic code generation to a critical
computational kernel used in Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD). Specifically,
we focus on Neko, a Fortran-based solver that employs the spectral-element
method, which relies on small tensor operations. We detail the formulation of
this computational kernel using DaCe's Stateful Dataflow Multigraph (SDFG)
representation and discuss how this approach facilitates high-performance code
generation. Additionally, we outline the workflow for seamlessly integrating
DaCe's generated code into the Neko solver. Our results highlight the
portability and performance of the generated code across multiple platforms,
including Nvidia GH200, Nvidia A100, and AMD MI250X GPUs, with competitive
performance results. By demonstrating the potential of automatic code
generation, we emphasise the feasibility of using portable solutions to ensure
the long-term sustainability of large-scale scientific applications.

*Zhaojiacheng Zhou,Hongze Liu,Shijing Yuan,Hanning Zhang,Jiong Lou,Chentao Wu,Jie Li*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: The paper proposes a blockchain-based framework to address hallucinations in Large Language Models (LLMs) by enabling secure and efficient knowledge sharing across isolated silos.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Hallucination issues in LLMs arise from the lack of reliable external knowledge integration. Existing knowledge silos hinder access to task-specific data due to privacy and security concerns.

Method: A blockchain-based framework integrates knowledge from silos, using prompts distilled from local data, transactions on the blockchain, a reputation mechanism, cross-validation, and a query generation framework for LLM API interactions.

Result: Experiments confirm the proposed framework effectively provides secure and efficient knowledge sharing among blockchain-based silos for LLM-related tasks.

Conclusion: The framework bridges knowledge silos and mitigates hallucination problems in LLMs, ensuring data security and incentivizing participation.

Abstract: The hallucination problem of Large Language Models (LLMs) has increasingly
drawn attention. Augmenting LLMs with external knowledge is a promising
solution to address this issue. However, due to privacy and security concerns,
a vast amount of downstream task-related knowledge remains dispersed and
isolated across various "silos," making it difficult to access. To bridge this
knowledge gap, we propose a blockchain-based external knowledge framework that
coordinates multiple knowledge silos to provide reliable foundational knowledge
for large model retrieval while ensuring data security. Technically, we distill
knowledge from local data into prompts and execute transactions and records on
the blockchain. Additionally, we introduce a reputation mechanism and
cross-validation to ensure knowledge quality and provide incentives for
participation. Furthermore, we design a query generation framework that
provides a direct API interface for large model retrieval. To evaluate the
performance of our proposed framework, we conducted extensive experiments on
various knowledge sources. The results demonstrate that the proposed framework
achieves efficient LLM service knowledge sharing in blockchain environments.

*Ryan Croote,Islam El-Ashi,Thomas Locher,Yvonne-Anne Pignolet*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: The paper presents a novel architecture that enables Turing-complete Bitcoin smart contracts on the Internet Computer (IC) without needing a bridging mechanism.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome Bitcoin's limited programmability and improve security by eliminating bridging mechanisms, while enabling advanced smart contracts.

Method: The architecture facilitates direct interaction between IC and Bitcoin nodes, addressing challenges like reconciling Bitcoin's probabilistic nature with IC's finalized state changes.

Result: Evaluation on the mainnet shows fast finalization in a few seconds and low execution costs, making complex Bitcoin-based decentralized applications practical and viable.

Conclusion: The integration opens up new possibilities for Bitcoin-based decentralized applications, bypassing traditional limitations and security concerns associated with bridges.

Abstract: There is growing interest in providing programmatic access to the value
locked in Bitcoin, which famously offers limited programmability itself.
Various approaches have been put forth in recent years, with the vast majority
of proposed mechanisms either building new functionality on top of Bitcoin or
leveraging a bridging mechanism to enable smart contracts that make use of
``wrapped'' bitcoins on entirely different platforms.
  In this work, an architecture is presented that follows a different approach.
The architecture enables the execution of Turing-complete Bitcoin smart
contracts on the Internet Computer (IC), a blockchain platform for hosting and
executing decentralized applications. Instead of using a bridge, IC and Bitcoin
nodes interact directly, eliminating potential security risks that the use of a
bridge entails. This integration requires novel concepts, in particular to
reconcile the probabilistic nature of Bitcoin with the irreversibility of
finalized state changes on the IC, which may be of independent interest.
  In addition to the presentation of the architecture, we provide evaluation
results based on measurements of the Bitcoin integration running on mainnet.
The evaluation results demonstrate that, with finalization in a few seconds and
low execution costs, this integration enables complex Bitcoin-based
decentralized applications that were not practically feasible or economically
viable before.

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: The paper proposes a carbon-aware strategy for microservices that ensures low latencies and user satisfaction while operating under hourly carbon budgets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The increasing carbon footprint of data centers necessitates innovative strategies beyond batch processing to address the operational constraints of real-time service-oriented cloud applications.

Method: The paper introduces a dynamic approach that chooses optimal microservice versions and horizontal scaleouts to meet carbon budget constraints and maximize user experience and revenue.

Result: Experimental findings show that this strategy adapts effectively to fluctuating workloads and varying carbon intensities while maintaining service quality.

Conclusion: This approach highlights the possibility of balancing carbon-conscious strategies with operational needs for microservices, paving the way for sustainable cloud computing solutions.

Abstract: The carbon footprint of data centers has recently become a critical concern.
So far, most carbon-aware strategies have focused on leveraging the flexibility
of scheduling decisions for batch processing by shifting the time and location
of workload executions. However, such approaches cannot be applied to
service-oriented cloud applications, since they have to be reachable at every
point in time and often at low latencies. We propose a carbon-aware approach
for operating microservices under hourly carbon budgets. By choosing the most
appropriate version and horizontal scaleout for each microservice, our strategy
maximizes user experience and revenue while staying within budget constraints.
Experiments across various application configurations and carbon budgets
demonstrate that the approach adapts properly to changing workloads and carbon
intensities.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The complexity of finding cost-efficient cloud configurations that meet service level agreements within massive configuration spaces with numerous parameters.

Result: Discovery Space improves efficiency in finding optimal configurations by enabling knowledge transfer and reuse across search spaces.

Conclusion: The method significantly accelerates configuration searches and streamlines sharing and reuse of optimization data, making it highly effective for diverse workloads.

Abstract: Finding the optimal set of cloud resources to deploy a given workload at
minimal cost while meeting a defined service level agreement is an active area
of research. Combining tens of parameters applicable across a large selection
of compute, storage, and services offered by cloud providers with similar
numbers of application-specific parameters leads to configuration spaces with
millions of deployment options.
  In this paper, we propose Discovery Space, an abstraction that formalizes the
description of workload configuration problems, and exhibits a set of
characteristics required for structured, robust and distributed investigations
of large search spaces. We describe a concrete implementation of the Discovery
Space abstraction and show that it is generalizable across a diverse set of
workloads such as Large Language Model inference and Big Data Analytics.
  We demonstrate that our approach enables safe, transparent sharing of data
between executions of best-of-breed optimizers increasing the efficiency of
optimal configuration detection in large search spaces. We also demonstrate how
Discovery Spaces enable transfer and reuse of knowledge across similar search
spaces, enabling configuration search speed-ups of over 90%.

### [180] [Progressive Size-Adaptive Federated Learning: A Comprehensive Framework for Heterogeneous Multi-Modal Data Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20685)
*Sajid Hussain,Muhammad Sohail,Nauman Ali Khan,Naima Iltaf,Ihtesham ul Islam*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces Size-Based Adaptive Federated Learning (SAFL), a framework focusing on dataset size characteristics for federated training. SAFL achieves impressive performance metrics and communication efficiency across heterogeneous data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing FL approaches overlook the impact of dataset size on training performance, focusing instead on model heterogeneity and aggregation techniques. This paper aims to bridge this gap.

Method: The authors propose SAFL, a progressive training framework that organizes federated learning tasks based on dataset size across different modalities. They conducted experiments on 13 datasets spanning 7 modalities.

Result: Key findings include: an optimal dataset size range (1000-1500 samples), better performance of structured data over unstructured data, degradation for datasets exceeding 2000 samples, and high accuracy and communication efficiency in training.

Conclusion: SAFL offers theoretical and practical advancements in federated learning, optimizing performance based on dataset size while improving network efficiency and offering insights into resource utilization.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) has emerged as a transformative paradigm for
distributed machine learning while preserving data privacy. However, existing
approaches predominantly focus on model heterogeneity and aggregation
techniques, largely overlooking the fundamental impact of dataset size
characteristics on federated training dynamics. This paper introduces
Size-Based Adaptive Federated Learning (SAFL), a novel progressive training
framework that systematically organizes federated learning based on dataset
size characteristics across heterogeneous multi-modal data. Our comprehensive
experimental evaluation across 13 diverse datasets spanning 7 modalities
(vision, text, time series, audio, sensor, medical vision, and multimodal)
reveals critical insights: 1) an optimal dataset size range of 1000-1500
samples for federated learning effectiveness; 2) a clear modality performance
hierarchy with structured data (time series, sensor) significantly
outperforming unstructured data (text, multimodal); and 3) systematic
performance degradation for large datasets exceeding 2000 samples. SAFL
achieves an average accuracy of 87.68% across all datasets, with structured
data modalities reaching 99%+ accuracy. The framework demonstrates superior
communication efficiency, reducing total data transfer to 7.38 GB across 558
communications while maintaining high performance. Our real-time monitoring
framework provides unprecedented insights into system resource utilization,
network efficiency, and training dynamics. This work fills critical gaps in
understanding how data characteristics should drive federated learning
strategies, providing both theoretical insights and practical guidance for
real-world FL deployments in neural network and learning systems.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: E-ABIN is a user-friendly framework combining machine learning and graph-based deep learning to detect gene anomalies, providing insights into disease mechanisms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the need for robust and interpretable systems for analyzing large-scale omics data to identify disease-driving genes.

Method: E-ABIN integrates various machine learning algorithms like SVM, Random Forests, GAEs, and GAANs within a unified analytical and graphical user interface framework.

Result: E-ABIN demonstrates high predictive accuracy and effective detection of biologically relevant anomalies in bladder cancer and coeliac disease datasets.

Conclusion: E-ABIN provides a novel and interpretable tool to analyze gene expression networks, bridging gaps in current gene anomaly detection approaches.

Abstract: The increasing availability of large-scale omics data calls for robust
analytical frameworks capable of handling complex gene expression datasets
while offering interpretable results. Recent advances in artificial
intelligence have enabled the identification of aberrant molecular patterns
distinguishing disease states from healthy controls. Coupled with improvements
in model interpretability, these tools now support the identification of genes
potentially driving disease phenotypes. However, current approaches to gene
anomaly detection often remain limited to single datasets and lack accessible
graphical interfaces. Here, we introduce E-ABIN, a general-purpose, explainable
framework for Anomaly detection in Biological Networks. E-ABIN combines
classical machine learning and graph-based deep learning techniques within a
unified, user-friendly platform, enabling the detection and interpretation of
anomalies from gene expression or methylation-derived networks. By integrating
algorithms such as Support Vector Machines, Random Forests, Graph Autoencoders
(GAEs), and Graph Adversarial Attributed Networks (GAANs), E-ABIN ensures a
high predictive accuracy while maintaining interpretability. We demonstrate the
utility of E-ABIN through case studies of bladder cancer and coeliac disease,
where it effectively uncovers biologically relevant anomalies and offers
insights into disease mechanisms.

### [182] [On Context-Content Uncertainty Principle](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20699)
*Xin Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Context-Content Uncertainty Principle (CCUP), proposing an entropy-based framework for uncertainty inference and presenting a layered model for structuring computations in both brains and machines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To establish a unified framework explaining how brains and machines infer under uncertainty by minimizing entropy through aligning high-entropy contexts with low-entropy content.

Method: The authors developed a layered computational framework based on an entropy asymmetry principle, presenting formal equivalence theorems, dependency lattices, and computational simulations to validate their approach.

Result: The paper introduces four hierarchical layers of operational principles, demonstrating efficiency gains in CCUP-aligned inference through simulations and theoretical analyses.

Conclusion: The study concludes that brains and machines optimize uncertainty minimization by recursively aligning structure and specificity via content-seeded processes, highlighted through the CCUP framework.

Abstract: The Context-Content Uncertainty Principle (CCUP) proposes that inference
under uncertainty is governed by an entropy asymmetry between context and
content: high-entropy contexts must be interpreted through alignment with
low-entropy, structured content. In this paper, we develop a layered
computational framework that derives operational principles from this
foundational asymmetry. At the base level, CCUP formalizes inference as
directional entropy minimization, establishing a variational gradient that
favors content-first structuring. Building upon this, we identify four
hierarchical layers of operational principles: (\textbf{L1}) \emph{Core
Inference Constraints}, including structure-before-specificity, asymmetric
inference flow, cycle-consistent bootstrapping, and conditional compression,
all shown to be mutually reducible; (\textbf{L2}) \emph{Resource Allocation
Principles}, such as precision-weighted attention, asymmetric learning rates,
and attractor-based memory encoding; (\textbf{L3}) \emph{Temporal Bootstrapping
Dynamics}, which organize learning over time via structure-guided curricula;
and (\textbf{L4}) \emph{Spatial Hierarchical Composition}, which integrates
these mechanisms into self-organizing cycles of memory, inference, and
planning. We present formal equivalence theorems, a dependency lattice among
principles, and computational simulations demonstrating the efficiency gains of
CCUP-aligned inference. This work provides a unified theoretical foundation for
understanding how brains and machines minimize uncertainty through recursive
structure-specificity alignment. The brain is not just an inference machine. It
is a cycle-consistent entropy gradient resolver, aligning structure and
specificity via path-dependent, content-seeded simulation.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces an LLM-powered system for automating GPU kernel optimization through iterative refinement and feedback-based adaptation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for optimizing GPU kernels are complex and rely heavily on deep expertise and extensive resources, especially for newer or less-documented architectures.

Method: The methodology employs an LLM in a multi-stage process: selecting promising code versions, generating optimization hypotheses, and autonomously testing them using timing data as feedback.

Result: Qualitative insights are presented to showcase how LLM-driven agents can partially overcome challenges in optimizing on resource-constrained or rapidly evolving GPU architectures, particularly for AMD MI300.

Conclusion: LLM-driven systems have the potential to democratize and accelerate GPU kernel optimization by reducing reliance on deep domain-specific expertise and facilitating exploration of new architectures.

Abstract: Optimizing GPU kernels for high performance is a complex task, often
demanding deep architectural knowledge, extensive profiling, and iterative
experimentation. This challenge is amplified when targeting newer or
less-documented GPU architectures where traditional development aids are
scarce. This paper introduces an LLM-powered "GPU Kernel Scientist," an
automated methodology for iteratively refining accelerator kernels.
  Our methodology employs LLMs in a multi-stage, evolutionary process: (a)
strategically selecting promising prior code versions as a basis for new
iterations; (b) generating hypotheses for optimization experiments, based on
existing code and assimilated knowledge from general GPU literature; and (c)
autonomously implementing these experiments through code modification and
subsequent submission to an external evaluation system, using only observed
timing data as performance feedback. We detail how this approach navigates the
challenges of the AMD MI300 target architecture and leverages LLMs to
compensate for limited domain-specific human expertise.
  Since quantitative results from an ongoing performance competition were
embargoed on paper submission date, we present the architectural design,
operational workflow, and qualitative insights, highlighting the potential of
LLM-driven agents to democratise and accelerate GPU kernel optimization,
especially in resource-constrained or rapidly evolving hardware environments.

### [184] [Diffusion Tree Sampling: Scalable inference-time alignment of diffusion models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20701)
*Vineet Jain,Kusha Sareen,Mohammad Pedramfar,Siamak Ravanbakhsh*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Diffusion Tree Sampling (DTS), a new method to adapt pretrained diffusion models to new objectives during inference, improving sample quality while reducing computational costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current steering methods for diffusion models face issues with inaccurate value estimation at high noise levels and fail to reuse past computations, leading to computational inefficiency and suboptimal sample quality.

Method: Inspired by Monte Carlo Tree Search, the authors propose DTS, which models inference-time alignment as a search problem. It utilizes a tree-based approach to sample from reward-aligned target density, propagates rewards back through the diffusion chain, and iteratively refines value estimates. DTS also features a greedy variant, DTS$^\star$, for global high-reward sample searches.

Result: DTS achieved performance matching the best baselines in MNIST and CIFAR-10 class-conditional generation with up to 10x less computation. DTS$^\star$ effectively performed high-reward searches in text-to-image generation and language completion tasks with up to 5x less compute.

Conclusion: The work presents DTS and DTS$^\star$ as scalable, compute-efficient methods to align diffusion models at inference, significantly improving sample quality and enabling anytime algorithm enhancements with additional compute.

Abstract: Adapting a pretrained diffusion model to new objectives at inference time
remains an open problem in generative modeling. Existing steering methods
suffer from inaccurate value estimation, especially at high noise levels, which
biases guidance. Moreover, information from past runs is not reused to improve
sample quality, resulting in inefficient use of compute. Inspired by the
success of Monte Carlo Tree Search, we address these limitations by casting
inference-time alignment as a search problem that reuses past computations. We
introduce a tree-based approach that samples from the reward-aligned target
density by propagating terminal rewards back through the diffusion chain and
iteratively refining value estimates with each additional generation. Our
proposed method, Diffusion Tree Sampling (DTS), produces asymptotically exact
samples from the target distribution in the limit of infinite rollouts, and its
greedy variant, Diffusion Tree Search (DTS$^\star$), performs a global search
for high reward samples. On MNIST and CIFAR-10 class-conditional generation,
DTS matches the FID of the best-performing baseline with up to $10\times$ less
compute. In text-to-image generation and language completion tasks, DTS$^\star$
effectively searches for high reward samples that match best-of-N with up to
$5\times$ less compute. By reusing information from previous generations, we
get an anytime algorithm that turns additional compute into steadily better
samples, providing a scalable approach for inference-time alignment of
diffusion models.

*Kin Kwan Leung,Rasa Hosseinzadeh,Gabriel Loaiza-Ganem*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper addresses incomplete theoretical underpinnings of the FLIPD LID estimator introduced by Kamkari et al. (2024b) and provides formal correctness proofs under realistic assumptions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Provide theoretical validity for the FLIPD estimator, which estimates local intrinsic dimension (LID) and has important applications in understanding data complexity and detecting anomalies.

Method: Formally prove the correctness of the FLIPD estimator under realistic assumptions, extending beyond prior proofs limited to affine submanifolds. Additionally, analyze variations using uniform convolutions.

Result: Established theoretical correctness of FLIPD for realistic submanifold scenarios and highlighted analogous behavior under uniform convolutions.

Conclusion: FLIPD is validated as a robust LID estimator under realistic settings, reinforcing its utility in various applications while expanding theoretical understanding.

Abstract: The manifold hypothesis asserts that data of interest in high-dimensional
ambient spaces, such as image data, lies on unknown low-dimensional
submanifolds. Diffusion models (DMs) -- which operate by convolving data with
progressively larger amounts of Gaussian noise and then learning to revert this
process -- have risen to prominence as the most performant generative models,
and are known to be able to learn distributions with low-dimensional support.
For a given datum in one of these submanifolds, we should thus intuitively
expect DMs to have implicitly learned its corresponding local intrinsic
dimension (LID), i.e. the dimension of the submanifold it belongs to. Kamkari
et al. (2024b) recently showed that this is indeed the case by linking this LID
to the rate of change of the log marginal densities of the DM with respect to
the amount of added noise, resulting in an LID estimator known as FLIPD. LID
estimators such as FLIPD have a plethora of uses, among others they quantify
the complexity of a given datum, and can be used to detect outliers,
adversarial examples and AI-generated text. FLIPD achieves state-of-the-art
performance at LID estimation, yet its theoretical underpinnings are incomplete
since Kamkari et al. (2024b) only proved its correctness under the highly
unrealistic assumption of affine submanifolds. In this work we bridge this gap
by formally proving the correctness of FLIPD under realistic assumptions.
Additionally, we show that an analogous result holds when Gaussian convolutions
are replaced with uniform ones, and discuss the relevance of this result.

Conclusion: Step-wise symbolic verification is highly effective for addressing complex scientific and mathematical reasoning tasks, showcasing strong potential in physics problem-solving.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown strong capabilities in complex

comparably low cost. Many of these methods have been developed and evaluated on
mathematical reasoning benchmarks such as AIME. This paper investigates whether
the lessons learned from these benchmarks generalize to the domain of advanced
theoretical physics. We evaluate a range of common test-time scaling methods on
the TPBench physics dataset and compare their effectiveness with results on
AIME. To better leverage the structure of physics problems, we develop a novel,
symbolic weak-verifier framework to improve parallel scaling results. Our
empirical results demonstrate that this method significantly outperforms
existing test-time scaling approaches on TPBench. We also evaluate our method
on AIME, confirming its effectiveness in solving advanced mathematical
problems. Our findings highlight the power of step-wise symbolic verification

Conclusion: Foundation models hold significant promise for driving innovation in materials science, but addressing their limitations and streamlining integration into workflows will be critical to realizing their full potential.

Abstract: Foundation models (FMs) are catalyzing a transformative shift in materials
science (MatSci) by enabling scalable, general-purpose, and multimodal AI
systems for scientific discovery. Unlike traditional machine learning models,
which are typically narrow in scope and require task-specific engineering, FMs
offer cross-domain generalization and exhibit emergent capabilities. Their
versatility is especially well-suited to materials science, where research
challenges span diverse data types and scales. This survey provides a
comprehensive overview of foundation models, agentic systems, datasets, and
computational tools supporting this growing field. We introduce a task-driven
taxonomy encompassing six broad application areas: data extraction,
interpretation and Q\&A; atomistic simulation; property prediction; materials
structure, design and discovery; process planning, discovery, and optimization;
and multiscale modeling. We discuss recent advances in both unimodal and
multimodal FMs, as well as emerging large language model (LLM) agents.
Furthermore, we review standardized datasets, open-source tools, and autonomous
experimental platforms that collectively fuel the development and integration
of FMs into research workflows. We assess the early successes of foundation
models and identify persistent limitations, including challenges in
generalizability, interpretability, data imbalance, safety concerns, and
limited multimodal fusion. Finally, we articulate future research directions
centered on scalable pretraining, continual learning, data governance, and
trustworthiness.

### [188] [Multiple Streams of Relation Extraction: Enriching and Recalling in Transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20746)
*Todd Nief,David Reber,Sean Richardson,Ari Holtzman*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores how LLMs retain and utilize information learned during fine-tuning by analyzing specialized information pathways in the model's layers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To better understand the internal workings of fine-tuned LLMs and where learned relational information is stored and utilized.

Method: The authors propose dynamic weight-grafting to analyze information pathways, examining both extraction and recall processes in finetuned models.

Result: Fine-tuned LLMs employ dual pathways for relational information: extraction during entity processing and recall during prediction, supported by specific attention mechanisms and feedforward networks.

Conclusion: Both enrichment and recall pathways are crucial for fine-tuned LLMs; redundancy exists, with tasks-specific mechanisms engaging late-stage layers to enable prediction.

Abstract: When an LLM learns a relation during finetuning (e.g., new movie releases,
corporate mergers, etc.), where does this information go? Is it extracted when
the model processes an entity, recalled just-in-time before a prediction, or
are there multiple separate heuristics? Existing localization approaches (e.g.
activation patching) are ill-suited for this analysis because they tend to
replace parts of the residual stream, potentially deleting information. To fill
this gap, we propose dynamic weight-grafting between fine-tuned and pre-trained
language models to show that fine-tuned language models both (1) extract
relation information learned during finetuning while processing entities and
(2) ``recall" this information in later layers while generating predictions. In
some cases, models need both of these pathways to correctly generate finetuned
information while, in other cases, a single ``enrichment" or ``recall" pathway
alone is sufficient. We examine the necessity and sufficiency of these
information pathways, examining what layers they occur at, how much redundancy
they exhibit, and which model components are involved -- finding that the
``recall" pathway occurs via both task-specific attention mechanisms and a
relation extraction step in the output of the attention and the feedforward
networks at the final layers before next token prediction.

*Huangyuan Su,Mujin Kwun,Stephanie Gil,Sham Kakade,Nikhil Anand*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper evaluates NVIDIA's Microscaling (MX) lower-precision arithmetic formats, identifying training instabilities in large language models and proposing hybrid precision configurations for improved stability and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the high computational cost and inefficiency in training large language models as hardware accelerators move to lower-precision formats.

Method: The authors train nearly one thousand language models and conduct controlled experiments on a smaller proxy model to study instabilities introduced by the MX formats.

Result: MX formats introduce stochastic instabilities during large-scale training due to gradient bias from quantization. Stabilization strategies and hybrid precision configurations can mitigate these instabilities.

Conclusion: Hybrid precision training leverages MX format efficiencies while maintaining competitive performance, showcasing its potential in addressing training challenges in large-scale LLMs.

Abstract: Training large language models is an expensive, compute-bound process that
must be repeated as models scale, algorithms improve, and new data is
collected. To address this, next-generation hardware accelerators increasingly
support lower-precision arithmetic formats, such as the Microscaling (MX)
formats introduced in NVIDIA's Blackwell architecture. These formats use a
shared scale within blocks of parameters to extend representable range and
perform forward/backward GEMM operations in reduced precision for efficiency
gains. In this work, we investigate the challenges and viability of
block-scaled precision formats during model training. Across nearly one
thousand language models trained from scratch -- spanning compute budgets from
$2 \times 10^{17}$ to $4.8 \times 10^{19}$ FLOPs and sweeping over a broad
range of weight-activation precision combinations -- we consistently observe
that training in MX formats exhibits sharp, stochastic instabilities in the
loss, particularly at larger compute scales. To explain this phenomenon, we
conduct controlled experiments and ablations on a smaller proxy model that
exhibits similar behavior as the language model, sweeping across architectural
settings, hyperparameters, and precision formats. These experiments motivate a
simple model in which multiplicative gradient bias introduced by the
quantization of layer-norm affine parameters and a small fraction of
activations can trigger runaway divergence. Through \emph{in situ} intervention
experiments on our proxy model, we demonstrate that instabilities can be
averted or delayed by modifying precision schemes mid-training. Guided by these
findings, we evaluate stabilization strategies in the LLM setting and show that
certain hybrid configurations recover performance competitive with
full-precision training. We release our code at
https://github.com/Hither1/systems-scaling.

### [190] [Stochastic and Non-local Closure Modeling for Nonlinear Dynamical Systems via Latent Score-based Generative Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20771)
*Xinghao Dong,Huchen Yang,Jin-Long Wu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A novel latent score-based AI framework is proposed for learning stochastic closure models in nonlinear dynamical systems, combining conditional diffusion models with latent encoding to reduce computational cost and maintain predictive accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of modeling complex multiscale systems, like turbulent flows, where fully resolving all scales is computationally prohibitive—requiring alternatives to classical deterministic and local methods.

Method: The framework employs convolutional autoencoders and conditional diffusion models in latent spaces, reducing dimensionality and enhancing computational efficiency. Joint training is used to optimize both latent-space discovery and diffusion model performance.

Result: The method effectively discovers a latent space with small reconstruction errors, ensuring the diffusion model functions well in latent space. Numerical simulations show accelerated computation and comparable predictive accuracy to standard diffusion models.

Conclusion: The latent conditional diffusion approach offers a scalable, efficient alternative for stochastic modeling in multiscale dynamical systems, balancing computational feasibility with accuracy.

Abstract: We propose a latent score-based generative AI framework for learning
stochastic, non-local closure models and constitutive laws in nonlinear
dynamical systems of computational mechanics. This work addresses a key
challenge of modeling complex multiscale dynamical systems without a clear
scale separation, for which numerically resolving all scales is prohibitively
expensive, e.g., for engineering turbulent flows. While classical closure
modeling methods leverage domain knowledge to approximate subgrid-scale
phenomena, their deterministic and local assumptions can be too restrictive in
regimes lacking a clear scale separation. Recent developments of
diffusion-based stochastic models have shown promise in the context of closure
modeling, but their prohibitive computational inference cost limits practical
applications for many real-world applications. This work addresses this
limitation by jointly training convolutional autoencoders with conditional
diffusion models in the latent spaces, significantly reducing the
dimensionality of the sampling process while preserving essential physical
characteristics. Numerical results demonstrate that the joint training approach
helps discover a proper latent space that not only guarantees small
reconstruction errors but also ensures good performance of the diffusion model
in the latent space. When integrated into numerical simulations, the proposed
stochastic modeling framework via latent conditional diffusion models achieves
significant computational acceleration while maintaining comparable predictive
accuracy to standard diffusion models in physical spaces.

### [191] [Stochastic Parameter Decomposition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20790)
*Lucius Bushnaq,Dan Braun,Lee Sharkey*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Stochastic Parameter Decomposition (SPD) to overcome issues in reverse engineering neural networks, offering a more scalable alternative to the current decomposition method, Attribution-based Parameter Decomposition (APD).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for scalable and robust decomposition methods for reverse engineering neural networks arises from the limitations of existing methods, such as APD, which are computationally costly and sensitive to hyperparameters.

Method: The authors propose Stochastic Parameter Decomposition (SPD), which decomposes neural network parameters into sparsely used vectors but does so with higher scalability and robustness. This is demonstrated on slightly larger models and through solving synthetic examples.

Result: SPD was found to decompose more complex models than APD, while avoiding issues like parameter shrinkage and identifying ground truth mechanisms more effectively in toy models.

Conclusion: The SPD method reduces practical barriers to scaling linear parameter decomposition methods for studying neural networks, opening avenues for future research in mechanistic interpretability. The authors also offer open-source code for adoption and reproduction of experiments.

Abstract: A key step in reverse engineering neural networks is to decompose them into
simpler parts that can be studied in relative isolation. Linear parameter
decomposition -- a framework that has been proposed to resolve several issues
with current decomposition methods -- decomposes neural network parameters into
a sum of sparsely used vectors in parameter space. However, the current main
method in this framework, Attribution-based Parameter Decomposition (APD), is
impractical on account of its computational cost and sensitivity to
hyperparameters. In this work, we introduce \textit{Stochastic Parameter
Decomposition} (SPD), a method that is more scalable and robust to
hyperparameters than APD, which we demonstrate by decomposing models that are
slightly larger and more complex than was possible to decompose with APD. We
also show that SPD avoids other issues, such as shrinkage of the learned
parameters, and better identifies ground truth mechanisms in toy models. By
bridging causal mediation analysis and network decomposition methods, this
demonstration opens up new research possibilities in mechanistic
interpretability by removing barriers to scaling linear parameter decomposition
methods to larger models. We release a library for running SPD and reproducing
our experiments at https://github.com/goodfire-ai/spd.

*Shashwat Khandelwal,Jakoba Petri-Koenig,Thomas B. Preußer,Michaela Blott,Shreejith Shanker*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper presents a novel approach for deploying LSTMs on FPGAs using the open-source FINN framework, providing a generalizable tool-flow that supports mixed quantization and achieves efficient hardware acceleration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing neural network acceleration tools predominantly cater to feed-forward networks, leaving a gap in deploying recurrent models like LSTMs on FPGAs. Real-time deployment is challenging due to LSTMs' computational complexity in resource-constrained environments.

Method: The paper employs the open-source FINN framework and the Scan operator from ONNX to model LSTM computations. It incorporates custom transformations in the FINN compiler to map quantized computation graphs to hardware blocks for FPGA deployment.

Result: Quantized ConvLSTM models have been validated by training them for a mid-price stock prediction task. The generated hardware IP achieves balanced latency, resource consumption, and inference accuracy comparable with state-of-the-art reduced precision models.

Conclusion: The proposed tool-flow demonstrates a practical pathway for resource-efficient, generalized deployment of RNN accelerators on FPGAs, setting a foundation for future advancements in energy-efficient AI hardware designs.

Abstract: Recurrent neural networks (RNNs), particularly LSTMs, are effective for
time-series tasks like sentiment analysis and short-term stock prediction.
However, their computational complexity poses challenges for real-time
deployment in resource constrained environments. While FPGAs offer a promising
platform for energy-efficient AI acceleration, existing tools mainly target
feed-forward networks, and LSTM acceleration typically requires full custom
implementation. In this paper, we address this gap by leveraging the
open-source and extensible FINN framework to enable the generalized deployment
of LSTMs on FPGAs. Specifically, we leverage the Scan operator from the Open
Neural Network Exchange (ONNX) specification to model the recurrent nature of
LSTM computations, enabling support for mixed quantisation within them and
functional verification of LSTM-based models. Furthermore, we introduce custom
transformations within the FINN compiler to map the quantised ONNX computation
graph to hardware blocks from the HLS kernel library of the FINN compiler and
Vitis HLS. We validate the proposed tool-flow by training a quantised ConvLSTM
model for a mid-price stock prediction task using the widely used dataset and
generating a corresponding hardware IP of the model using our flow, targeting
the XCZU7EV device. We show that the generated quantised ConvLSTM accelerator
through our flow achieves a balance between performance (latency) and resource
consumption, while matching (or bettering) inference accuracy of
state-of-the-art models with reduced precision. We believe that the
generalisable nature of the proposed flow will pave the way for
resource-efficient RNN accelerator designs on FPGAs.

### [193] [Optimal Single-Policy Sample Complexity and Transient Coverage for Average-Reward Offline RL](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20904)
*Matthew Zurek,Guy Zamir,Yudong Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper addresses offline reinforcement learning in average-reward MDPs, introducing novel single-policy-focused bounds, a new algorithm, and lower bounds for improved theoretical understanding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in offline reinforcement learning for average-reward MDPs, which include distribution shift, non-uniform coverage, and a lack of single-policy focused theoretical understanding.

Method: The authors introduce an algorithm based on pessimistic discounted value iteration with a novel quantile clipping technique and sharper empirical-span-based penalty functions, without requiring prior parameter knowledge.

Result: The study achieves single-policy sample complexity bounds, handles weakly communicating MDPs, and proves the necessity of coverage assumptions beyond stationary distributions, alongside matching lower bounds.

Conclusion: This work provides the first sharp single-policy guarantees for average-reward offline RL, introducing new theoretical insights and practical algorithms, moving beyond prior restrictive assumptions.

Abstract: We study offline reinforcement learning in average-reward MDPs, which
presents increased challenges from the perspectives of distribution shift and
non-uniform coverage, and has been relatively underexamined from a theoretical
perspective. While previous work obtains performance guarantees under
single-policy data coverage assumptions, such guarantees utilize additional
complexity measures which are uniform over all policies, such as the uniform
mixing time. We develop sharp guarantees depending only on the target policy,
specifically the bias span and a novel policy hitting radius, yielding the
first fully single-policy sample complexity bound for average-reward offline
RL. We are also the first to handle general weakly communicating MDPs,
contrasting restrictive structural assumptions made in prior work. To achieve
this, we introduce an algorithm based on pessimistic discounted value iteration
enhanced by a novel quantile clipping technique, which enables the use of a
sharper empirical-span-based penalty function. Our algorithm also does not
require any prior parameter knowledge for its implementation. Remarkably, we
show via hard examples that learning under our conditions requires coverage
assumptions beyond the stationary distribution of the target policy,
distinguishing single-policy complexity measures from previously examined
cases. We also develop lower bounds nearly matching our main result.

### [194] [An Information-Theoretic Analysis for Federated Learning under Concept Drift](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21036)
*Fu Peng,Meng Zhang,Ming Tang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper studies the impact of concept drift on federated learning (FL) using information theory and proposes a novel algorithm that enhances FL performance under such conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation stems from the challenge that most FL research assumes static datasets while real-world data often arrives as streams with evolving distributions, leading to concept drift and performance degradation.

Method: The authors model concept drift as a Markov chain, introduce the Stationary Generalization Error metric assessed through KL divergence and mutual information, and propose an algorithm that regularizes empirical risk minimization using these metrics. They evaluate three drift patterns: periodic, gradual, and random.

Result: Experimental results using a Raspberry Pi4 testbed confirm that drift patterns significantly influence FL performance. The proposed method consistently outperforms others in handling these patterns.

Conclusion: The study offers a theoretical framework and practical algorithm to adapt to concept drift in FL, showing improved long-term model performance across various drift scenarios.

Abstract: Recent studies in federated learning (FL) commonly train models on static
datasets. However, real-world data often arrives as streams with shifting
distributions, causing performance degradation known as concept drift. This
paper analyzes FL performance under concept drift using information theory and
proposes an algorithm to mitigate the performance degradation. We model concept
drift as a Markov chain and introduce the \emph{Stationary Generalization
Error} to assess a model's capability to capture characteristics of future
unseen data. Its upper bound is derived using KL divergence and mutual
information. We study three drift patterns (periodic, gradual, and random) and
their impact on FL performance. Inspired by this, we propose an algorithm that
regularizes the empirical risk minimization approach with KL divergence and
mutual information, thereby enhancing long-term performance. We also explore
the performance-cost tradeoff by identifying a Pareto front. To validate our
approach, we build an FL testbed using Raspberry Pi4 devices. Experimental
results corroborate with theoretical findings, confirming that drift patterns
significantly affect performance. Our method consistently outperforms existing
approaches for these three patterns, demonstrating its effectiveness in
adapting concept drift in FL.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes Hellsemble, an ensemble framework focusing on dataset instance difficulty to improve binary classification while maintaining efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional ensemble methods struggle with high computational costs and do not adapt well to varying data complexities.

Method: Hellsemble uses iterative partitioning of datasets based on misclassifications, forming specialized base models, and a router model to assign new data to the appropriate model.

Result: The proposed method outperforms classical ensemble methods on OpenML-CC18 and Tabzilla datasets.

Conclusion: Instance-level difficulty assessment offers a path to creating efficient and robust ensemble systems.

Abstract: Ensemble learning has proven effective in boosting predictive performance,
but traditional methods such as bagging, boosting, and dynamic ensemble
selection (DES) suffer from high computational cost and limited adaptability to
heterogeneous data distributions. To address these limitations, we propose
Hellsemble, a novel and interpretable ensemble framework for binary
classification that leverages dataset complexity during both training and
inference. Hellsemble incrementally partitions the dataset into circles of
difficulty by iteratively passing misclassified instances from simpler models
to subsequent ones, forming a committee of specialised base learners. Each
model is trained on increasingly challenging subsets, while a separate router
model learns to assign new instances to the most suitable base model based on
inferred difficulty. Hellsemble achieves strong classification accuracy while
maintaining computational efficiency and interpretability. Experimental results
on OpenML-CC18 and Tabzilla benchmarks demonstrate that Hellsemble often
outperforms classical ensemble methods. Our findings suggest that embracing
instance-level difficulty offers a promising direction for constructing
efficient and robust ensemble systems.

*Furkan Mumcu,Yasin Yilmaz*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a method to detect adversarial examples in Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) by analyzing prediction errors between early-layer and deeper-layer features, proving it to be effective, efficient, and adaptable across domains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Defense against adversarial attacks on DNNs is underexplored compared to attack methodologies, particularly in detection approaches that are more practical for real-time defense.

Method: A lightweight regression model is trained to predict deeper-layer features based on early-layer features in DNNs. The prediction error from this process is used as an indicator to identify adversarial samples.

Result: The experimental results confirm that the proposed method is effective at adversarial detection, computationally suitable for real-time applications, compatible with various DNN architectures, and applicable across multiple domains.

Conclusion: The developed detection method offers a universal, efficient, and practical solution to the challenge of adversarial robustness in DNNs, addressing limitations of existing approaches.

Abstract: Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are notoriously vulnerable to adversarial input
designs with limited noise budgets. While numerous successful attacks with
subtle modifications to original input have been proposed, defense techniques
against these attacks are relatively understudied. Existing defense approaches
either focus on improving DNN robustness by negating the effects of
perturbations or use a secondary model to detect adversarial data. Although
equally important, the attack detection approach, which is studied in this
work, provides a more practical defense compared to the robustness approach. We
show that the existing detection methods are either ineffective against the
state-of-the-art attack techniques or computationally inefficient for real-time
processing. We propose a novel universal and efficient method to detect
adversarial examples by analyzing the varying degrees of impact of attacks on
different DNN layers. {Our method trains a lightweight regression model that
predicts deeper-layer features from early-layer features, and uses the
prediction error to detect adversarial samples.} Through theoretical arguments
and extensive experiments, we demonstrate that our detection method is highly
effective, computationally efficient for real-time processing, compatible with
any DNN architecture, and applicable across different domains, such as image,
video, and audio.

*Li Fan,Peng Wang,Jing Yang,Cong Shen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces CHOOSE, a shallow Transformer framework optimized for wireless communication symbol detection, which achieves performance comparable to deeper models while being resource-efficient.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformers are powerful for wireless communication but require high computational resources due to their deep architectures. There is a need for an efficient approach suitable for resource-constrained environments.

Method: The study proposes CHOOSE, which incorporates chain-of-thought (CoT) autoregressive latent reasoning steps to enhance reasoning capabilities in shallow Transformer models (1-2 layers).

Result: CHOOSE successfully improves detection performance, exceeding conventional shallow Transformers and matching deep Transformer models, while maintaining lower storage and computational demands.

Conclusion: CHOOSE demonstrates the feasibility of deploying lightweight Transformers in wireless communication systems with limited resources, offering a balanced trade-off between efficiency and performance.

Abstract: Transformers have shown potential in solving wireless communication problems,
particularly via in-context learning (ICL), where models adapt to new tasks
through prompts without requiring model updates. However, prior ICL-based
Transformer models rely on deep architectures with many layers to achieve
satisfactory performance, resulting in substantial storage and computational
costs. In this work, we propose CHain Of thOught Symbol dEtection (CHOOSE), a
CoT-enhanced shallow Transformer framework for wireless symbol detection. By
introducing autoregressive latent reasoning steps within the hidden space,
CHOOSE significantly improves the reasoning capacity of shallow models (1-2
layers) without increasing model depth. This design enables lightweight
Transformers to achieve detection performance comparable to much deeper models,
making them well-suited for deployment on resource-constrained mobile devices.
Experimental results demonstrate that our approach outperforms conventional
shallow Transformers and achieves performance comparable to that of deep
Transformers, while maintaining storage and computational efficiency. This
represents a promising direction for implementing Transformer-based algorithms
in wireless receivers with limited computational resources.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper explores distributed training of GNNs for link prediction, identifies issues such as information loss due to graph partitioning and negative sampling methods, and proposes a sparsification-based solution (SpLPG) to improve efficiency and accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing distributed GNN frameworks focus on node classification, leaving their performance in link prediction largely unaddressed. The paper aims to investigate and resolve performance degradation in distributed GNNs for link prediction.

Method: The authors analyze the source of performance issues when GNNs are trained on graph partitions, particularly focusing on information loss and negative sampling methods, and propose SpLPG, which employs graph sparsification to maintain link prediction accuracy while reducing communication costs.

Result: Experiment results show that SpLPG reduces communication overhead by up to 80% while preserving link prediction accuracy across several real-world datasets.

Conclusion: SpLPG offers a cost-effective solution to address scalability and accuracy challenges in distributed GNN training for link prediction, with reduced communication costs and minimal performance loss.

Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) are powerful tools for solving graph-related
problems. Distributed GNN frameworks and systems enhance the scalability of
GNNs and accelerate model training, yet most are optimized for node
classification. Their performance on link prediction remains underexplored.
This paper demystifies distributed training of GNNs for link prediction by
investigating the issue of performance degradation when each worker trains a
GNN on its assigned partitioned subgraph without having access to the entire
graph. We discover that the main sources of the issue come from not only the
information loss caused by graph partitioning but also the ways of drawing
negative samples during model training. While sharing the complete graph
information with each worker resolves the issue and preserves link prediction
accuracy, it incurs a high communication cost. We propose SpLPG, which
effectively leverages graph sparsification to mitigate the issue of performance
degradation at a reduced communication cost. Experiment results on several
public real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of SpLPG, which
reduces the communication overhead by up to about 80% while mostly preserving
link prediction accuracy.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel linearity-based compression method for compressing neural networks, achieving significant model size reduction without loss of performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to complement existing neural network compression methods by proposing a new strategy based on merging neurons that behave almost linearly due to ReLU-like activation functions.

Method: The method identifies neurons that act almost linearly and merges subsequent layers, leveraging the behavior of ReLU-like activation functions.

Result: The proposed method achieves up to a 75% reduction in model size without performance loss and shows compatibility with existing importance-based compression techniques.

Conclusion: The study establishes that linearity-based compression can enable the creation of smaller and more efficient neural networks, providing a basis for combined compression strategies.

Abstract: In neural network compression, most current methods reduce unnecessary
parameters by measuring importance and redundancy. To augment already highly
optimized existing solutions, we propose linearity-based compression as a novel
way to reduce weights in a neural network. It is based on the intuition that
with ReLU-like activation functions, neurons that are almost always activated
behave linearly, allowing for merging of subsequent layers. We introduce the
theory underlying this compression and evaluate our approach experimentally.
Our novel method achieves a lossless compression down to 1/4 of the original
model size in over the majority of tested models. Applying our method on
already importance-based pruned models shows very little interference between
different types of compression, demonstrating the option of successful
combination of techniques. Overall, our work lays the foundation for a new type
of compression method that enables smaller and ultimately more efficient neural
network models.

Conclusion: The study advances cognitive radar technology by proposing efficient methods for dynamic multi-objective adaptation, useful for balancing competing objectives in radar systems.

Abstract: The time allocation problem in multi-function cognitive radar systems focuses
on the trade-off between scanning for newly emerging targets and tracking the
previously detected targets. We formulate this as a multi-objective
optimization problem and employ deep reinforcement learning to find
Pareto-optimal solutions and compare deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG)
and soft actor-critic (SAC) algorithms. Our results demonstrate the
effectiveness of both algorithms in adapting to various scenarios, with SAC
showing improved stability and sample efficiency compared to DDPG. We further
employ the NSGA-II algorithm to estimate an upper bound on the Pareto front of
the considered problem. This work contributes to the development of more
efficient and adaptive cognitive radar systems capable of balancing multiple
competing objectives in dynamic environments.

TL;DR: The paper evaluates memorization risks in LoRA fine-tuning of LLMs, showing it reduces memorization compared to full fine-tuning while keeping high task performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address vulnerabilities in LLMs related to data memorization during fine-tuning, particularly in LoRA, an efficient strategy.

Method: The study employs a similarity-based memorization metric to compare memorization levels across different fine-tuning strategies.

Result: LoRA fine-tuning significantly decreases memorization risks compared to full fine-tuning, even with varying model scale and data duplication factors.

Conclusion: LoRA fine-tuning emerges as a safer approach to minimize memorization risks while sustaining commendable performance, diverging from trends observed in pre-training and full fine-tuning.

Abstract: Memorization in large language models (LLMs) makes them vulnerable to data
extraction attacks. While pre-training memorization has been extensively
studied, fewer works have explored its impact in fine-tuning, particularly for
LoRA fine-tuning, a widely adopted parameter-efficient method.
  In this work, we re-examine memorization in fine-tuning and uncover a
surprising divergence from prior findings across different fine-tuning
strategies. Factors such as model scale and data duplication, which strongly
influence memorization in pre-training and full fine-tuning, do not follow the
same trend in LoRA fine-tuning. Using a more relaxed similarity-based
memorization metric, we demonstrate that LoRA significantly reduces
memorization risks compared to full fine-tuning, while still maintaining strong
task performance.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Omniwise, a self-supervised fine-tuning approach that leverages large language models for predicting GPU kernel performance metrics directly from code without needing profiling tools, achieving over 90% accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To utilize large language models in a novel application: GPU kernel performance prediction, enhancing efficiency without requiring traditional execution-based profiling methods.

Method: Developed Omniwise, a self-supervised, model-agnostic pipeline leveraging large language models for predicting performance metrics from kernel code. It includes a small-scale 3B-parameter model and integrates tools like an inference server and a code editor plugin.

Result: Omniwise demonstrated over 90% accuracy with predictions within 10% relative error for GPU kernels on AMD MI250 and MI300X architectures.

Conclusion: The study showcases the potential of Omniwise in revolutionizing performance profiling workflows, reducing dependency on traditional tools and enabling seamless integration into developer environments.

Abstract: In recent years, the rapid advancement of deep neural networks (DNNs) has
revolutionized artificial intelligence, enabling models with unprecedented
capabilities in understanding, generating, and processing complex data. These
powerful architectures have transformed a wide range of downstream
applications, tackling tasks beyond human reach. In this paper, we introduce
Omniwise, the first end-to-end, self-supervised fine-tuning pipeline that
applies large language models (LLMs) to GPU kernel performance prediction--a
novel use case in performance profiling. Omniwise is model-agnostic and
lightweight, achieving strong results even with a small 3B-parameter model. It
can predict key performance metrics, including memory bandwidth, cache hit
rates, GFLOPs, and arithmetic intensity, directly from kernel code without the
need for code execution or profiling tools. Our approach achieves over 90% of
predictions within 10% relative error on GPU kernels executed on AMD MI250 and
MI300X architectures. In addition to the pipeline, we develop an online
inference server and a Visual Studio Code plugin that seamlessly integrate
LLM-based performance prediction into developers' workflows.

*Yian Wang,Ali Ebrahimpour-Boroojeny,Hari Sundaram*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: RWFT is introduced as a novel approach to remove a class from a classifier without re-training, outperforming existing methods in both old and new metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper seeks to address challenges in enforcing user deletion rights and correcting biases by removing specific classes from trained models without requiring full retraining, which is costly and inefficient.

Method: The authors propose RWFT, an output-reweighting method that redistributes prediction probabilities for forgotten classes. They also introduce a new metric based on total variation (TV) distance for evaluating residual leakage.

Result: RWFT effectively replicates full retraining results in previous metrics and improves unlearning effectiveness, gaining 2.79% in old metrics and 111.45% improvement in the new TV-based metric.

Conclusion: RWFT is a superior solution to existing machine unlearning methods, robust against novel inference attacks, and better aligns retrained model behavior with forgetting requirements while introducing a novel evaluation metric.

Abstract: In this work, we introduce an output-reweighting unlearning method, RWFT, a
lightweight technique that erases an entire class from a trained classifier
without full retraining. Forgetting specific classes from trained models is
essential for enforcing user deletion rights and mitigating harmful or biased
predictions. The full retraining is costly and existing unlearning methods fail
to replicate the behavior of the retrained models when predicting samples from
the unlearned class. We prove this failure by designing a variant of membership
inference attacks, MIA-NN that successfully reveals the unlearned class for any
of these methods. We propose a simple redistribution of the probability mass
for the prediction on the samples in the forgotten class which is robust to
MIA-NN. We also introduce a new metric based on the total variation (TV)
distance of the prediction probabilities to quantify residual leakage to
prevent future methods from susceptibility to the new attack. Through extensive
experiments with state of the art baselines in machine unlearning, we show that
our approach matches the results of full retraining in both metrics used for
evaluation by prior work and the new metric we propose in this work. Compare to
state-of-the-art methods, we gain 2.79% in previously used metrics and 111.45%
in our new TV-based metric over the best existing method.

*Erfan Hajihashemi,Yanning Shen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces an algorithm for online conformal prediction that reduces computational complexity and prediction set sizes by dynamically selecting a subset of effective models based on feedback.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenges of managing computational complexity and irrelevant models in multi-model online conformal prediction, which can degrade performance and lead to excessively large prediction sets.

Method: The algorithm dynamically identifies and refines a subset of effective models using feedback from a bipartite graph, and incorporates prediction set size and model loss as part of the feedback mechanism.

Result: The proposed methods ensure valid coverage, achieve sublinear regret, and demonstrate improved efficiency by constructing smaller prediction sets in both real and synthetic dataset experiments.

Conclusion: The novel approach outperforms existing multi-model online conformal prediction techniques while maintaining accuracy and reducing prediction set sizes.

Abstract: Online conformal prediction has demonstrated its capability to construct a
prediction set for each incoming data point that covers the true label with a
predetermined probability. To cope with potential distribution shift,
multi-model online conformal prediction has been introduced to select and
leverage different models from a preselected candidate set. Along with the
improved flexibility, the choice of the preselected set also brings challenges.
A candidate set that includes a large number of models may increase the
computational complexity. In addition, the inclusion of irrelevant models with
poor performance may negatively impact the performance and lead to
unnecessarily large prediction sets. To address these challenges, we propose a
novel multi-model online conformal prediction algorithm that identifies a
subset of effective models at each time step by collecting feedback from a
bipartite graph, which is refined upon receiving new data. A model is then
selected from this subset to construct the prediction set, resulting in reduced
computational complexity and smaller prediction sets. Additionally, we
demonstrate that using prediction set size as feedback, alongside model loss,
can significantly improve efficiency by constructing smaller prediction sets
while still satisfying the required coverage guarantee. The proposed algorithms
are proven to ensure valid coverage and achieve sublinear regret. Experiments
on real and synthetic datasets validate that the proposed methods construct
smaller prediction sets and outperform existing multi-model online conformal
prediction approaches.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a modified LIME approach, termed DL-LIME, to enhance explainability in deep reinforcement learning for radar resource management, showing improved fidelity and task performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the 'black box' limitation of neural networks and enhance explainability in decision-making models using XAI techniques, particularly for radar resource management.

Method: A modified LIME approach called DL-LIME is proposed, incorporating deep learning into the sampling process within deep reinforcement learning frameworks.

Result: DL-LIME demonstrates superior fidelity and task performance compared to conventional LIME, while also uncovering key decision-making factors in radar resource management.

Conclusion: Integrating DL into the LIME sampling process enhances explainability and effectiveness in deep reinforcement learning models, providing more reliable and interpretable results for radar resource management.

Abstract: Deep reinforcement learning has been extensively studied in decision-making
processes and has demonstrated superior performance over conventional
approaches in various fields, including radar resource management (RRM).
However, a notable limitation of neural networks is their ``black box" nature
and recent research work has increasingly focused on explainable AI (XAI)
techniques to describe the rationale behind neural network decisions. One
promising XAI method is local interpretable model-agnostic explanations (LIME).
However, the sampling process in LIME ignores the correlations between
features. In this paper, we propose a modified LIME approach that integrates
deep learning (DL) into the sampling process, which we refer to as DL-LIME. We
employ DL-LIME within deep reinforcement learning for radar resource
management. Numerical results show that DL-LIME outperforms conventional LIME
in terms of both fidelity and task performance, demonstrating superior
performance with both metrics. DL-LIME also provides insights on which factors
are more important in decision making for radar resource management.

*Tong Zeng,Srivathsan Badrinarayanan,Janghoon Ock,Cheng-Kai Lai,Amir Barati Farimani*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces a multi-agent framework leveraging large language models to infer operational constraints and optimize chemical processes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to overcome limitations in current optimization methods when operational constraints are poorly characterized or unavailable.

Method: The authors use multi-agent large language models, specifically OpenAI's o3 model, to autonomously infer operating constraints and collaboratively optimize chemical processes.

Result: The framework demonstrated competitive performance against conventional methods with superior computational efficiency, achieving a 31-fold speedup over grid search in a hydrodealkylation process.

Conclusion: This multi-agent framework can significantly enhance optimization for scenarios with ill-defined operational constraints, particularly for emerging or retrofitted processes.

Abstract: Chemical process optimization is crucial to maximize production efficiency
and economic performance. Traditional methods, including gradient-based
solvers, evolutionary algorithms, and parameter grid searches, become
impractical when operating constraints are ill-defined or unavailable,
requiring engineers to rely on subjective heuristics to estimate feasible
parameter ranges. To address this constraint definition bottleneck, we present
a multi-agent framework of large language model (LLM) agents that autonomously
infer operating constraints from minimal process descriptions, then
collaboratively guide optimization using the inferred constraints. Our
AutoGen-based agentic framework employs OpenAI's o3 model, with specialized
agents for constraint generation, parameter validation, simulation execution,
and optimization guidance. Through two phases - autonomous constraint
generation using embedded domain knowledge, followed by iterative multi-agent
optimization - the framework eliminates the need for predefined operational
bounds. Validated on the hydrodealkylation process across cost, yield, and
yield-to-cost ratio metrics, the framework demonstrated competitive performance
with conventional optimization methods while achieving better computational
efficiency, requiring fewer iterations to converge. Our approach converged in
under 20 minutes, achieving a 31-fold speedup over grid search. Beyond
computational efficiency, the framework's reasoning-guided search demonstrates
sophisticated process understanding, correctly identifying utility trade-offs,
and applying domain-informed heuristics. This approach shows significant
potential for optimization scenarios where operational constraints are poorly
characterized or unavailable, particularly for emerging processes and retrofit
applications.

*Shahrzad Behzadimanesh,Pierre Le Bodic,Geoffrey I. Webb,Mario Boley*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces an extension to rule ensembles by incorporating learnable sparse linear transformations, enabling more complex decision boundaries and maintaining interpretability while reducing model complexity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional rule ensembles relying on axis-parallel decision regions can lose interpretability and require complexity when expressive independent features are unavailable.

Method: The authors propose a learning method based on sequential greedy optimization leveraging iteratively reweighted logistic regression to construct the advanced rule ensembles.

Result: Experimental results show the proposed method achieves equivalent test risk to state-of-the-art methods while significantly lowering model complexity across ten benchmark datasets.

Conclusion: The extended rule ensemble framework provides a viable alternative for interpretable models, addressing limitations of classical approaches and achieving balance between accuracy and simplicity.

Abstract: Small additive ensembles of symbolic rules offer interpretable prediction
models. Traditionally, these ensembles use rule conditions based on
conjunctions of simple threshold propositions $x \geq t$ on a single input
variable $x$ and threshold $t$, resulting geometrically in axis-parallel
polytopes as decision regions. While this form ensures a high degree of
interpretability for individual rules and can be learned efficiently using the
gradient boosting approach, it relies on having access to a curated set of
expressive and ideally independent input features so that a small ensemble of
axis-parallel regions can describe the target variable well. Absent such
features, reaching sufficient accuracy requires increasing the number and
complexity of individual rules, which diminishes the interpretability of the
model. Here, we extend classical rule ensembles by introducing logical
propositions with learnable sparse linear transformations of input variables,
i.e., propositions of the form $\mathbf{x}^\mathrm{T}\mathbf{w} \geq t$, where
$\mathbf{w}$ is a learnable sparse weight vector, enabling decision regions as
general polytopes with oblique faces. We propose a learning method using
sequential greedy optimization based on an iteratively reweighted formulation
of logistic regression. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed
method efficiently constructs rule ensembles with the same test risk as
state-of-the-art methods while significantly reducing model complexity across
ten benchmark datasets.

*Keivan Rezaei,Mehrdad Saberi,Abhilasha Ravichander,Soheil Feizi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces MSA, a new method for efficient data unlearning in large language models using model checkpoints, outperforming existing approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Removing the influence of problematic data in large language models is challenging and computationally expensive through retraining.

Method: MSA utilizes model checkpoints to estimate and reverse the influence of specific datapoints without retraining the model.

Result: MSA performed better than current unlearning methods across various benchmarks and metrics.

Conclusion: MSA is a promising, computationally efficient solution for enabling data erasure in large language models, making them more versatile.

Abstract: Large language models are trained on massive corpora of web data, which may
include private data, copyrighted material, factually inaccurate data, or data
that degrades model performance. Eliminating the influence of such problematic
datapoints through complete retraining -- by repeatedly pretraining the model
on datasets that exclude these specific instances -- is computationally
prohibitive. For this reason, unlearning algorithms have emerged that aim to
eliminate the influence of particular datapoints, while otherwise preserving
the model -- at a low computational cost. However, precisely estimating and
undoing the influence of individual datapoints has proved to be challenging. In
this work, we propose a new algorithm, MSA, for estimating and undoing the
influence of datapoints -- by leveraging model checkpoints i.e. artifacts
capturing model states at different stages of pretraining. Our experimental
results demonstrate that MSA consistently outperforms existing machine
unlearning algorithms across multiple benchmarks, models, and evaluation
metrics, suggesting that MSA could be an effective approach towards more
flexible large language models that are capable of data erasure.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses challenges in computational antibody design, focusing on capturing molecular interactions and maintaining structural features, especially for complex antigens.

Method: AbMEGD employs a geometric deep learning approach combining multi-scale embeddings and E(3)-equivariant diffusion for precise and efficient antibody sequence-structure co-design.

Result: Using the SAbDab database, AbMEGD outperforms existing models like DiffAb with increased amino acid recovery (10.13%), improved percentages (3.32%), and lower root mean square deviation (0.062 Å) in critical regions.

Conclusion: AbMEGD establishes a benchmark in affinity optimization and structural integrity in antibody design, demonstrating robust generalizability and improved functionality over prior methods.

Abstract: Antibody design remains a critical challenge in therapeutic and diagnostic
development, particularly for complex antigens with diverse binding interfaces.
Current computational methods face two main limitations: (1) capturing
geometric features while preserving symmetries, and (2) generalizing novel
antigen interfaces. Despite recent advancements, these methods often fail to
accurately capture molecular interactions and maintain structural integrity. To
address these challenges, we propose \textbf{AbMEGD}, an end-to-end framework
integrating \textbf{M}ulti-scale \textbf{E}quivariant \textbf{G}raph
\textbf{D}iffusion for antibody sequence and structure co-design. Leveraging
advanced geometric deep learning, AbMEGD combines atomic-level geometric
features with residue-level embeddings, capturing local atomic details and
global sequence-structure interactions. Its E(3)-equivariant diffusion method
ensures geometric precision, computational efficiency, and robust
generalizability for complex antigens. Furthermore, experiments using the
SAbDab database demonstrate a 10.13\% increase in amino acid recovery, 3.32\%
rise in improvement percentage, and a 0.062~\AA\ reduction in root mean square
deviation within the critical CDR-H3 region compared to DiffAb, a leading
antibody design model. These results highlight AbMEGD's ability to balance
structural integrity with improved functionality, establishing a new benchmark
for sequence-structure co-design and affinity optimization. The code is

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces SharpZO, a BP-free fine-tuning method for vision-language models using forward passes only, achieving improved accuracy and speed over previous methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current fine-tuning of vision-language models requires backpropagation, which is not suitable for resource-constrained devices. Existing BP-free methods have limited performance due to reliance on high-variance optimization techniques.

Method: SharpZO combines a sharpness-aware evolutionary strategy (ES) for global exploration and initialization with sparse zeroth-order (ZO) optimization for local search, all relying solely on forward passes.

Result: SharpZO achieves up to a 7% average accuracy improvement over state-of-the-art forward-only fine-tuning methods on CLIP models, with faster convergence.

Conclusion: The proposed SharpZO effectively addresses the limitations of BP-free fine-tuning for vision-language models, enabling better performance for resource-constrained applications.

Abstract: Fine-tuning vision language models (VLMs) has achieved remarkable performance
across various downstream tasks; yet, it requires access to model gradients
through backpropagation (BP), making them unsuitable for memory-constrained,
inference-only edge devices. To address this limitation, previous work has
explored various BP-free fine-tuning methods. However, these approaches often
rely on high-variance evolutionary strategies (ES) or zeroth-order (ZO)
optimization, and often fail to achieve satisfactory performance. In this
paper, we propose a hybrid Sharpness-aware Zeroth-order optimization (SharpZO)
approach, specifically designed to enhance the performance of ZO VLM
fine-tuning via a sharpness-aware warm-up training. SharpZO features a
two-stage optimization process: a sharpness-aware ES stage that globally
explores and smooths the loss landscape to construct a strong initialization,
followed by a fine-grained local search via sparse ZO optimization. The entire
optimization relies solely on forward passes. Detailed theoretical analysis and
extensive experiments on CLIP models demonstrate that SharpZO significantly
improves accuracy and convergence speed, achieving up to 7% average gain over
state-of-the-art forward-only methods.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper explores knowledge distillation techniques in normalizing flows to improve sampling quality and density estimation of smaller models, achieving better performance and increased efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address challenges in training explicit density models, specifically normalizing flows, and to explore their potential for improved sampling quality despite their training difficulties.

Method: The main method involves introducing novel knowledge distillation techniques in compositional normalizing flows, transferring knowledge through intermediate layers to enhance small student models.

Result: The results demonstrate that student models can be significantly reduced in size while achieving substantial performance improvements compared to non-distilled counterparts.

Conclusion: Knowledge distillation in normalizing flows offers a promising approach to reducing model size while improving performance, showcasing unique transfer techniques within intermediate layers.

Abstract: Explicit density learners are becoming an increasingly popular technique for
generative models because of their ability to better model probability
distributions. They have advantages over Generative Adversarial Networks due to
their ability to perform density estimation and having exact latent-variable
inference. This has many advantages, including: being able to simply
interpolate, calculate sample likelihood, and analyze the probability
distribution. The downside of these models is that they are often more
difficult to train and have lower sampling quality.
  Normalizing flows are explicit density models, that use composable bijective
functions to turn an intractable probability function into a tractable one. In
this work, we present novel knowledge distillation techniques to increase
sampling quality and density estimation of smaller student normalizing flows.
We seek to study the capacity of knowledge distillation in Compositional
Normalizing Flows to understand the benefits and weaknesses provided by these
architectures. Normalizing flows have unique properties that allow for a
non-traditional forms of knowledge transfer, where we can transfer that
knowledge within intermediate layers. We find that through this distillation,
we can make students significantly smaller while making substantial performance
gains over a non-distilled student. With smaller models there is a
proportionally increased throughput as this is dependent upon the number of
bijectors, and thus parameters, in the network.

TL;DR: TRIDENT introduces a framework integrating SMILES, text, and taxonomy for molecular property prediction using novel volume-based and local alignment techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing molecular property prediction methods lack the utilization of textual and taxonomic data, which hold potential to enrich molecular representation.

Method: TRIDENT uses tri-modal data (SMILES, text, taxonomy) and employs volume-based global alignment and local alignment mechanisms, balanced via a momentum-based system.

Result: Achieved state-of-the-art performance across 11 molecular property prediction tasks, showcasing the effectiveness of the integrated tri-modal approach.

Conclusion: Incorporating textual and taxonomic information alongside SMILES provides a richer molecular representation, significantly enhancing prediction accuracy.

Abstract: Molecular property prediction aims to learn representations that map chemical
structures to functional properties. While multimodal learning has emerged as a
powerful paradigm to learn molecular representations, prior works have largely
overlooked textual and taxonomic information of molecules for representation
learning. We introduce TRIDENT, a novel framework that integrates molecular
SMILES, textual descriptions, and taxonomic functional annotations to learn
rich molecular representations. To achieve this, we curate a comprehensive
dataset of molecule-text pairs with structured, multi-level functional
annotations. Instead of relying on conventional contrastive loss, TRIDENT
employs a volume-based alignment objective to jointly align tri-modal features
at the global level, enabling soft, geometry-aware alignment across modalities.
Additionally, TRIDENT introduces a novel local alignment objective that
captures detailed relationships between molecular substructures and their
corresponding sub-textual descriptions. A momentum-based mechanism dynamically
balances global and local alignment, enabling the model to learn both broad
functional semantics and fine-grained structure-function mappings. TRIDENT
achieves state-of-the-art performance on 11 downstream tasks, demonstrating the
value of combining SMILES, textual, and taxonomic functional annotations for
molecular property prediction.

TL;DR: The paper introduces Single-Step Completion Policy (SSCP), a generative policy for reinforcement learning, offering efficient, one-shot action generation without the inefficiencies of traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address high inference costs and training instability in generative models like diffusion and flow-matching for offline reinforcement learning (RL).

Method: The proposed SSCP uses an augmented flow-matching objective to efficiently generate actions in one step and integrates into an off-policy actor-critic framework.

Result: SSCP showed strong performance across offline RL, offline-to-online RL, and goal-conditioned RL tasks, surpassing diffusion-based baselines in speed and adaptability.

Conclusion: SSCP is presented as a versatile and efficient framework for deep RL, combining expressiveness and efficiency with significant practical advantages in decision-making tasks.

Abstract: Generative models such as diffusion and flow-matching offer expressive
policies for offline reinforcement learning (RL) by capturing rich, multimodal
action distributions, but their iterative sampling introduces high inference
costs and training instability due to gradient propagation across sampling
steps. We propose the \textit{Single-Step Completion Policy} (SSCP), a
generative policy trained with an augmented flow-matching objective to predict
direct completion vectors from intermediate flow samples, enabling accurate,
one-shot action generation. In an off-policy actor-critic framework, SSCP
combines the expressiveness of generative models with the training and
inference efficiency of unimodal policies, without requiring long
backpropagation chains. Our method scales effectively to offline,
offline-to-online, and online RL settings, offering substantial gains in speed
and adaptability over diffusion-based baselines. We further extend SSCP to
goal-conditioned RL, enabling flat policies to exploit subgoal structures
without explicit hierarchical inference. SSCP achieves strong results across
standard offline RL and behavior cloning benchmarks, positioning it as a
versatile, expressive, and efficient framework for deep RL and sequential
decision-making.

*Haodong Lu,Chongyang Zhao,Jason Xue,Lina Yao,Kristen Moore,Dong Gong*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper addresses challenges in continual learning with large pre-trained models, proposing a rank-adaptive approach (MoRA) to mitigate interference, redundancy, and ambiguity issues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Continual learning faces difficulties like catastrophic forgetting and task interference when using large pre-trained models. Existing methods, particularly LoRA-based Mixture-of-Experts, mitigate forgetting but struggle with interference, redundancy, and routing ambiguities between tasks.

Method: The paper introduces MoRA, a Mixture-of-Rank Adaptive learning method that decomposes rank-r updates into rank-1 components treated as independent experts. By adopting self-activation, rank pruning, sparse activation budgets, and relevance inference, MoRA achieves fine-grained rank utilization while mitigating interference, redundancy, and ambiguity.

Result: MoRA demonstrates effectiveness on continual learning tasks with models like CLIP and large language models (LLMs). It improves in-domain learning, generalization, and reduces forgetting compared to prior approaches.

Conclusion: MoRA offers a robust approach for continual learning in pre-trained models, addressing core challenges of interference, redundancy, and routing ambiguity while significantly improving performance and adaptability.

Abstract: Continual learning (CL) with large pre-trained models is challenged by
catastrophic forgetting and task interference. Existing LoRA-based
Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) approaches mitigate forgetting by assigning and
freezing task-specific adapters, but suffer from interference, redundancy, and
ambiguous routing due to coarse adapter-level selection. However, this design
introduces three key challenges: 1) Interference: Activating full LoRA experts
per input leads to subspace interference and prevents selective reuse of useful
components across tasks. 2) Redundancy: Newly added experts often duplicate or
contradict existing knowledge due to unnecessary activation of unrelated ranks
and insufficient reuse of relevant ones. 3) Ambiguity: Overlapping features
across tasks confuse the router, resulting in unstable expert assignments. As
more experts accumulate, earlier task routing degrades, accelerating
forgetting. We propose MoRA, a Mixture-of-Rank Adaptive learning approach with
self-activated and sparse rank activation for CL. Unlike mixing multiple
low-rank matrices, MoRA decomposes each rank-r update into r rank-1 components,
each treated as an independent expert, enabling fine-grained mixture of rank-1
expert utilization while mitigating interference and redundancy. To avoid
ambiguous routing, we propose that each rank-1 expert can infer its own
relevance via intermediate activations. Coupled with our proposed rank pruning
and activation budgets, MoRA adaptively selects a sparse mixture of ranks per
input. We validate MoRA on continual learning tasks with CLIP and large
language models (LLMs), analyzing both in-domain learning and out-of-domain
forgetting/generalization during fine-tuning. MoRA shows significant
effectiveness on enhancing CL with PTMs, and improving generalization while
mitigating forgetting.

*Suorong Yang,Peijia Li,Furao Shen,Jian Zhao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes RL-Selector, an RL-focused data selection method that utilizes redundancy quantification to improve training efficiency and model generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep learning models often face computational and storage challenges due to redundant data in large-scale datasets, necessitating more efficient training methods.

Method: The paper introduces epsilon-sample cover to measure sample redundancy and leverages it with a lightweight reinforcement learning agent for adaptive data selection during training.

Result: RL-Selector demonstrates superior training efficiency and model generalization across various datasets compared to state-of-the-art approaches.

Conclusion: The proposed RL-Selector offers an effective approach to reducing training costs by optimizing dataset subsampling, resulting in efficient and high-performing model training.

Abstract: Modern deep architectures often rely on large-scale datasets, but training on
these datasets incurs high computational and storage overhead. Real-world
datasets often contain substantial redundancies, prompting the need for more
data-efficient training paradigms. Data selection has shown promise to mitigate
redundancy by identifying the most representative samples, thereby reducing
training costs without compromising performance. Existing methods typically
rely on static scoring metrics or pretrained models, overlooking the combined
effect of selected samples and their evolving dynamics during training. We
introduce the concept of epsilon-sample cover, which quantifies sample
redundancy based on inter-sample relationships, capturing the intrinsic
structure of the dataset. Based on this, we reformulate data selection as a
reinforcement learning (RL) process and propose RL-Selector, where a
lightweight RL agent optimizes the selection policy by leveraging
epsilon-sample cover derived from evolving dataset distribution as a reward
signal. Extensive experiments across benchmark datasets and diverse
architectures demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms existing
state-of-the-art baselines. Models trained with our selected datasets show
enhanced generalization performance with improved training efficiency.

### [217] [Strict Subgoal Execution: Reliable Long-Horizon Planning in Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21039)
*Jaebak Hwang,Sanghyeon Lee,Jeongmo Kim,Seungyul Han*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces a hierarchical RL framework named Strict Subgoal Execution (SSE) for addressing long-horizon, goal-conditioned tasks. SSE focuses on effective subgoal feasibility and exploration for better performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenges of long-horizon, goal-conditioned reinforcement learning tasks such as distant goals and sparse rewards, where traditional hierarchical and graph-based methods show limitations.

Method: The study proposes SSE, a graph-based hierarchical RL framework with three key features: (1) enforcing single-step subgoal reachability through structured high-level decision-making, (2) using a decoupled exploration policy for coverage of underexplored regions, and (3) failure-aware path refinement by dynamically adjusting edge costs based on low-level success rates.

Result: SSE demonstrates superior performance in efficiency and success rate compared to existing methods on various long-horizon benchmarks.

Conclusion: SSE effectively addresses key challenges in long-horizon RL tasks through structured planning and robust exploration mechanisms, outperforming traditional goal-conditioned and hierarchical RL approaches.

Abstract: Long-horizon goal-conditioned tasks pose fundamental challenges for
reinforcement learning (RL), particularly when goals are distant and rewards
are sparse. While hierarchical and graph-based methods offer partial solutions,
they often suffer from subgoal infeasibility and inefficient planning. We
introduce Strict Subgoal Execution (SSE), a graph-based hierarchical RL
framework that enforces single-step subgoal reachability by structurally
constraining high-level decision-making. To enhance exploration, SSE employs a
decoupled exploration policy that systematically traverses underexplored
regions of the goal space. Furthermore, a failure-aware path refinement, which
refines graph-based planning by dynamically adjusting edge costs according to
observed low-level success rates, thereby improving subgoal reliability.
Experimental results across diverse long-horizon benchmarks demonstrate that
SSE consistently outperforms existing goal-conditioned RL and hierarchical RL
approaches in both efficiency and success rate.

### [218] [Efficient Skill Discovery via Regret-Aware Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21044)
*He Zhang,Ming Zhou,Shaopeng Zhai,Ying Sun,Hui Xiong*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a method for unsupervised skill discovery using a regret-aware adversarial approach to improve efficiency and diversity, outperforming existing methods, especially in high-dimensional environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing unsupervised skill discovery methods focus on exploration and diversity but perform inefficiently, especially in high-dimensional settings.

Method: The method is framed as a min-max game between skill generation and policy learning. A regret-aware mechanism is introduced to guide skill discovery by prioritizing skills needing further exploration. A population of upgradable skill generators facilitates the generation process.

Result: Experiments reveal the proposed method excels in efficiency and diversity, and achieves a 15% zero-shot learning improvement in high-dimensional contexts compared to baseline methods.

Conclusion: The regret-aware skill discovery approach enhances skill diversity and efficiency in open-ended reinforcement learning and demonstrates superior performance over state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: Unsupervised skill discovery aims to learn diverse and distinguishable
behaviors in open-ended reinforcement learning. For existing methods, they
focus on improving diversity through pure exploration, mutual information
optimization, and learning temporal representation. Despite that they perform
well on exploration, they remain limited in terms of efficiency, especially for
the high-dimensional situations. In this work, we frame skill discovery as a
min-max game of skill generation and policy learning, proposing a regret-aware
method on top of temporal representation learning that expands the discovered
skill space along the direction of upgradable policy strength. The key insight
behind the proposed method is that the skill discovery is adversarial to the
policy learning, i.e., skills with weak strength should be further explored
while less exploration for the skills with converged strength. As an
implementation, we score the degree of strength convergence with regret, and
guide the skill discovery with a learnable skill generator. To avoid
degeneration, skill generation comes from an up-gradable population of skill
generators. We conduct experiments on environments with varying complexities
and dimension sizes. Empirical results show that our method outperforms
baselines in both efficiency and diversity. Moreover, our method achieves a 15%
zero shot improvement in high-dimensional environments, compared to existing
methods.

### [219] [FedDAA: Dynamic Client Clustering for Concept Drift Adaptation in Federated Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21054)
*Fu Peng,Ming Tang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper addresses the issue of concept drift in federated learning, proposing a dynamic clustered framework, FedDAA, to adapt to multi-source drift while retaining useful historical knowledge.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To tackle the challenges introduced by temporal and spatial data heterogeneity in federated learning due to concept drift, which existing methods fail to address effectively, especially in virtual and label drift scenarios.

Method: FedDAA incorporates three modules: cluster number determination, real drift detection, and concept drift adaptation to optimize strategies based on different drift sources.

Result: FedDAA achieves significant accuracy improvements (7.84% to 8.52%) over existing state-of-the-art methods on Fashion-MNIST, CIFAR-10, and CIFAR-100 datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed FedDAA framework successfully distinguishes and adapts to multiple drift sources in federated learning, providing better generalization and preserving valuable historical knowledge.

Abstract: In federated learning (FL), the data distribution of each client may change
over time, introducing both temporal and spatial data heterogeneity, known as
concept drift. Data heterogeneity arises from three drift sources: real drift
(a shift in the conditional distribution P(y|x)), virtual drift (a shift in the
input distribution P(x)), and label drift (a shift in the label distribution
P(y)). However, most existing FL methods addressing concept drift primarily
focus on real drift. When clients experience virtual or label drift, these
methods often fail to selectively retain useful historical knowledge, leading
to catastrophic forgetting. A key challenge lies in distinguishing different
sources of drift, as they require distinct adaptation strategies: real drift
calls for discarding outdated data, while virtual or label drift benefits from
retaining historical data. Without explicitly identifying the drift sources, a
general adaptation strategy is suboptimal and may harm generalization. To
address this challenge, we propose FedDAA, a dynamic clustered FL framework
designed to adapt to multi-source concept drift while preserving valuable
historical knowledge. Specifically, FedDAA integrates three modules: a cluster
number determination module to find the optimal number of clusters; a real
drift detection module to distinguish real drift from virtual/label drift; and
a concept drift adaptation module to adapt to new data while retaining useful
historical information. We provide theoretical convergence guarantees, and
experiments show that FedDAA achieves 7.84% to 8.52% accuracy improvements over
state-of-the-art methods on Fashion-MNIST, CIFAR-10, and CIFAR-100.

*Jingwei Wang,Zai Zhang,Hao Qian,Chunjing Gan,Binbin Hu,Ziqi Liu,Zhiqiang Zhang,Jun Zhou,Bin Shi,Bo Dong*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A method leverages knowledge graphs to generate quality instructional data for large language models (LLMs) to enhance their tool usage capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs require improvement in problem-solving through effective tool usage, but current data generation methods yield subpar instructional quality.

Method: The process involves extracting query pathways from a knowledge graph, translating entity relationships into tool actions, and parsing pathways into solution steps for instructional data.

Result: Training LLMs with the synthetic data improved tool usage and overall capabilities, even with a small dataset.

Conclusion: Using knowledge graphs to construct high-quality instructional data can significantly enhance the functionality and tool-handling abilities of LLMs.

Abstract: Teaching large language models (LLMs) to use tools is crucial for improving
their problem-solving abilities and expanding their applications. However,
effectively using tools is challenging because it requires a deep understanding
of tool functionalities and user intentions. Previous methods relied mainly on
LLMs to generate instruction data, but the quality of these data was often
insufficient. In this paper, we propose a new method that uses knowledge graphs
to generate high-quality instruction data for LLMs. Knowledge graphs are
manually curated datasets rich in semantic information. We begin by extracting
various query pathways from a given knowledge graph, which are transformed into
a broad spectrum of user queries. We then translate the relationships between
entities into actionable tools and parse the pathways of each query into
detailed solution steps, thereby creating high-quality instruction data. Our
experiments show that fine-tuning on just a small sample of this synthetic data
can significantly improve the tool utilization and overall capabilities of
LLMs.

*Xenia Heilmann,Luca Corbucci,Mattia Cerrato,Anna Monreale*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces tools and datasets for benchmarking fairness in Federated Learning (FL) to better address biases across heterogeneous client data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fairness in Federated Learning faces challenges due to biases and heterogeneous data distributions among clients, which existing solutions inadequately address.

Method: The authors developed FeDa4Fair, a library for generating datasets and benchmarks tailored to studying fairness-aware FL strategies, along with evaluation functions.

Result: They provided bias-heterogeneous datasets, benchmarks, and tools to enable comparative studies on fairness outcomes in FL systems.

Conclusion: The contributions aim to empower reproducible and robust fairness research in Federated Learning, accommodating diverse fairness needs and biases.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables collaborative model training across multiple
clients without sharing clients' private data. However, fairness remains a key
concern, as biases in local clients' datasets can impact the entire federated
system. Heterogeneous data distributions across clients may lead to models that
are fairer for some clients than others. Although several fairness-enhancing
solutions are present in the literature, most focus on mitigating bias for a
single sensitive attribute, typically binary, overlooking the diverse and
sometimes conflicting fairness needs of different clients. This limited
perspective can limit the effectiveness of fairness interventions for the
different clients. To support more robust and reproducible fairness research in
FL, we aim to enable a consistent benchmarking of fairness-aware FL methods at
both the global and client levels. In this paper, we contribute in three ways:
(1) We introduce FeDa4Fair, a library to generate tabular datasets tailored to
evaluating fair FL methods under heterogeneous client bias; (2) we release four
bias-heterogeneous datasets and corresponding benchmarks to compare fairness
mitigation methods in a controlled environment; (3) we provide ready-to-use
functions for evaluating fairness outcomes for these datasets.

### [222] [Interpretable Hierarchical Concept Reasoning through Attention-Guided Graph Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21102)
*David Debot,Pietro Barbiero,Gabriele Dominici,Giuseppe Marra*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces H-CMR, a novel model that enhances interpretability in concept-based models, addressing their limitation of opaque concept predictions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current Concept-Based Models lack interpretability for intermediate concept predictions, relying on black-box methods.

Method: H-CMR constructs a directed acyclic graph to model concept relations and employs neural attention for hierarchical inference of both concepts and tasks.

Result: H-CMR achieves competitive performance and allows human modifications to improve inference accuracy and training efficiency.

Conclusion: H-CMR successfully balances interpretability and performance, opening the door for better integration of human knowledge into deep learning models.

Abstract: Concept-Based Models (CBMs) are a class of deep learning models that provide
interpretability by explaining predictions through high-level concepts. These
models first predict concepts and then use them to perform a downstream task.
However, current CBMs offer interpretability only for the final task
prediction, while the concept predictions themselves are typically made via
black-box neural networks. To address this limitation, we propose Hierarchical
Concept Memory Reasoner (H-CMR), a new CBM that provides interpretability for
both concept and task predictions. H-CMR models relationships between concepts
using a learned directed acyclic graph, where edges represent logic rules that
define concepts in terms of other concepts. During inference, H-CMR employs a
neural attention mechanism to select a subset of these rules, which are then
applied hierarchically to predict all concepts and the final task. Experimental
results demonstrate that H-CMR matches state-of-the-art performance while
enabling strong human interaction through concept and model interventions. The
former can significantly improve accuracy at inference time, while the latter
can enhance data efficiency during training when background knowledge is
available.

### [223] [Learning to Skip the Middle Layers of Transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21103)
*Tim Lawson,Laurence Aitchison*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes a novel dynamic architecture for conditional computation in Transformers by skipping layers symmetrically from the middle outward, but struggles to outperform dense baselines in terms of trade-offs between validation cross-entropy and FLOPs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformers are computationally expensive, and middle layers exhibit redundancy while early layers aggregate information effectively. There is potential to improve efficiency by focusing on conditional computation for these middle layers.

Method: The architecture uses a gating mechanism to skip central blocks dynamically and includes a gated attention mechanism to control skipped token positions, combined with perilayernorm to handle residual norms and adaptive regularization for gate sparsity.

Result: The method failed to achieve improvement in validation cross-entropy vs. FLOPs trade-offs compared to dense baselines that use fewer layers, even with the novel skipping mechanism.

Conclusion: While the proposed approach introduces innovative strategies and aims for efficiency and multi-level representation, it does not successfully improve computational trade-offs. The code is publicly available for further exploration.

Abstract: Conditional computation is a popular strategy to make Transformers more
efficient. Existing methods often target individual modules (e.g.,
mixture-of-experts layers) or skip layers independently of one another.
However, interpretability research has demonstrated that the middle layers of
Transformers exhibit greater redundancy, and that early layers aggregate
information into token positions. Guided by these insights, we propose a novel
architecture that dynamically skips a variable number of layers from the middle
outward. In particular, a learned gating mechanism determines whether to bypass
a symmetric span of central blocks based on the input, and a gated attention
mechanism prevents subsequent tokens from attending to skipped token positions.
Residual norms are controlled with a 'sandwich' or 'perilayernorm' scheme and
gate sparsity with an adaptive regularization loss. We had aimed to reduce
compute requirements for 'simpler' tokens and potentially foster an emergent
multi-level representational hierarchy but, at the scales investigated, our
approach does not achieve improvements in the trade-off between validation
cross-entropy and estimated FLOPs compared to dense baselines with fewer
layers. We release our code at https://github.com/tim-lawson/skip-middle.

### [224] [Unlasting: Unpaired Single-Cell Multi-Perturbation Estimation by Dual Conditional Diffusion Implicit Bridges](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21107)
*Changxi Chi,Jun Xia,Yufei Huang,Jingbo Zhou,Siyuan Li,Yunfan Liu,Chang Yu,Stan Z. Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper presents a framework called Dual Diffusion Implicit Bridges (DDIB) to study single-cell responses to perturbations in unpaired data scenarios, incorporating biological insights, silent gene prediction, and better evaluation metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Identifying key genes and improving drug screening is greatly hampered by the destructive nature of single-cell sequencing, which precludes matching data before and after perturbation, thereby creating unpaired datasets.

Method: The authors propose DDIB, a dual conditional diffusion model augmented with Gene Regulatory Network (GRN) information and a masking mechanism. It uses biologically meaningful signals and silent gene prediction to address unpaired data and heterogeneity challenges.

Result: DDIB successfully maps unpaired single-cell data distributions and incorporates biologically grounded mechanisms to produce insightful predictions of cell responses under perturbation, while improving silent gene prediction.

Conclusion: The framework provides a robust solution for modeling single-cell perturbation responses in unpaired datasets, integrates biological insights for meaningful data augmentation, and introduces an improved evaluation metric.

Abstract: Estimating single-cell responses across various perturbations facilitates the
identification of key genes and enhances drug screening, significantly boosting
experimental efficiency. However, single-cell sequencing is a destructive
process, making it impossible to capture the same cell's phenotype before and
after perturbation. Consequently, data collected under perturbed and
unperturbed conditions are inherently unpaired. Existing methods either attempt
to forcibly pair unpaired data using random sampling, or neglect the inherent
relationship between unperturbed and perturbed cells during the modeling. In
this work, we propose a framework based on Dual Diffusion Implicit Bridges
(DDIB) to learn the mapping between different data distributions, effectively
addressing the challenge of unpaired data. We further interpret this framework
as a form of data augmentation. We integrate gene regulatory network (GRN)
information to propagate perturbation signals in a biologically meaningful way,
and further incorporate a masking mechanism to predict silent genes, improving
the quality of generated profiles. Moreover, gene expression under the same
perturbation often varies significantly across cells, frequently exhibiting a
bimodal distribution that reflects intrinsic heterogeneity. To capture this, we
introduce a more suitable evaluation metric. We propose Unlasting, dual
conditional diffusion models that overcome the problem of unpaired single-cell
perturbation data and strengthen the model's insight into perturbations under
the guidance of the GRN, with a dedicated mask model designed to improve
generation quality by predicting silent genes. In addition, we introduce a
biologically grounded evaluation metric that better reflects the inherent
heterogeneity in single-cell responses.

*Deepak Kumar Panda,Weisi Guo*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes an antifragile reinforcement learning (RL) framework addressing UAV navigation vulnerabilities to adversarial attacks by dynamically selecting robust policies through a discount Thompson sampling mechanism.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: UAVs navigating through automated systems are highly exposed to adversarial attacks manipulating RL-based decision systems, and existing RL methods struggle with adaptation to distributional shifts induced by such attacks.

Method: A diversified ensemble of robust policies is created to handle a variety of perturbations. These policies are treated as a multi-armed bandit problem, where discounted Thompson sampling dynamically selects the most suitable policy based on observed noisy rewards.

Result: Extensive simulations in dynamic 3D obstacle environments show the framework effectively adapts to adversarial attacks like PGD and spoofing, achieving shorter paths and higher rates of conflict-free travel compared to non-adaptive robust RL methods.

Conclusion: The antifragile RL framework demonstrates superior adaptability and performance, enhancing UAV navigation resilience to adversarial attacks by minimizing the effects of value distribution shifts through dynamic policy switching.

Abstract: The increasing automation of navigation for unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs)
has exposed them to adversarial attacks that exploit vulnerabilities in
reinforcement learning (RL) through sensor manipulation. Although existing
robust RL methods aim to mitigate such threats, their effectiveness has limited
generalization to out-of-distribution shifts from the optimal value
distribution, as they are primarily designed to handle fixed perturbation. To
address this limitation, this paper introduces an antifragile RL framework that
enhances adaptability to broader distributional shifts by incorporating a
switching mechanism based on discounted Thompson sampling (DTS). This mechanism
dynamically selects among multiple robust policies to minimize adversarially
induced state-action-value distribution shifts. The proposed approach first
derives a diverse ensemble of action robust policies by accounting for a range
of perturbations in the policy space. These policies are then modeled as a
multiarmed bandit (MAB) problem, where DTS optimally selects policies in
response to nonstationary Bernoulli rewards, effectively adapting to evolving
adversarial strategies. Theoretical framework has also been provided where by
optimizing the DTS to minimize the overall regrets due to distributional shift,
results in effective adaptation against unseen adversarial attacks thus
inducing antifragility. Extensive numerical simulations validate the
effectiveness of the proposed framework in complex navigation environments with
multiple dynamic three-dimensional obstacles and with stronger projected
gradient descent (PGD) and spoofing attacks. Compared to conventional robust,
non-adaptive RL methods, the antifragile approach achieves superior
performance, demonstrating shorter navigation path lengths and a higher rate of
conflict-free navigation trajectories compared to existing robust RL techniques

*Deepak Kumar Panda,Adolfo Perrusquia,Weisi Guo*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes an antifragile reinforcement learning (RL) framework to improve the resilience of RL policies against observation-space adversarial attacks in safety-critical systems like UAV navigation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current RL policies are fragile when exposed to out-of-distribution adversarial attacks, leading to unsafe or suboptimal decisions in critical applications like UAV navigation.

Method: The study introduces a simulated attacker that incrementally strengthens perturbations in the observation space, enabling the RL agent to adapt through iterative expert-guided critic alignment using Wasserstein distance minimization.

Result: The proposed antifragile RL framework outperforms standard and robust RL baselines, achieving up to 15% higher cumulative rewards and 30% fewer conflict events in a UAV deconfliction scenario when attacked.

Conclusion: Antifragile RL enhances the safety and resilience of RL policies under evolving adversarial scenarios, proving its applicability for secure decision-making in dynamic environments.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) policies deployed in safety-critical systems,
such as unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) navigation in dynamic airspace, are
vulnerable to out-ofdistribution (OOD) adversarial attacks in the observation
space. These attacks induce distributional shifts that significantly degrade
value estimation, leading to unsafe or suboptimal decision making rendering the
existing policy fragile. To address this vulnerability, we propose an
antifragile RL framework designed to adapt against curriculum of incremental
adversarial perturbations. The framework introduces a simulated attacker which
incrementally increases the strength of observation-space perturbations which
enables the RL agent to adapt and generalize across a wider range of OOD
observations and anticipate previously unseen attacks. We begin with a
theoretical characterization of fragility, formally defining catastrophic
forgetting as a monotonic divergence in value function distributions with
increasing perturbation strength. Building on this, we define antifragility as
the boundedness of such value shifts and derive adaptation conditions under
which forgetting is stabilized. Our method enforces these bounds through
iterative expert-guided critic alignment using Wasserstein distance
minimization across incrementally perturbed observations. We empirically
evaluate the approach in a UAV deconfliction scenario involving dynamic 3D
obstacles. Results show that the antifragile policy consistently outperforms
standard and robust RL baselines when subjected to both projected gradient
descent (PGD) and GPS spoofing attacks, achieving up to 15% higher cumulative
reward and over 30% fewer conflict events. These findings demonstrate the
practical and theoretical viability of antifragile reinforcement learning for
secure and resilient decision-making in environments with evolving threat
scenarios.

*Weikang Meng,Yadan Luo,Liangyu Huo,Yaowei Wang,Xin Li,Zheng Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Norm-Aware Linear Attention (NaLaFormer), addressing issues in linear attention by restoring dynamic spikiness and kernel-perturbed norm distributions, resulting in improved performance in vision and language tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Linear attention mechanisms suffer from degraded entropy and missing inner-product interactions due to the neglect of query norms and suppression of negative values.

Method: The authors propose decomposing query and key matrices into norm and direction components, using query-norm aware kernels for entropy control, and leveraging norm-preserving mapping with cosine similarity to ensure non-negativity and norm consistency.

Result: Extensive experiments show NaLaFormer enhances expressiveness and efficiency in vision and language tasks, achieving performance improvements of up to 4.2%.

Conclusion: NaLaFormer successfully addresses core challenges in linear attention, restoring dynamic spikiness and improving task performance while maintaining computational efficiency.

Abstract: Linear attention has emerged as a viable alternative to softmax attention by
reducing complexity from quadratic to linear in sequence length. To preserve
two fundamental properties of softmax, non-negativity and entropy reduction,
current works employ various linearly separatable kernel functions with $L1$
normalization instead of softmax operator. However, query norms are neglected
by the normalization operation in linear attention, such degradation heavily
leads to an entropy gap. Meanwhile, existing works inhibit negative values of
query and key vectors resulting in a missing inner-product interactions after
being mapped. To address these dual challenges, we propose a novel Norm-Aware
Linear Attention mechanism serving to restore norm-guided dynamic spikiness and
recover kernel-perturbed norm distributions. Specifically, we first decouple
query and key matrices into two components: norm and direction, to achieve
norm-aware spikiness control and norm consistency, respectively. We
mathematically reveal that the extent of entropy reduction varies with the
query norm in softmax normalization, motivating a query-norm aware kernel
function for dynamic control over entropy reduction. Furthermore, to ensure
norm consistency and enforce non-negativity constraints, we employ a
norm-preserving mapping to project all elements of the angular matrix into
positive values, leveraging cosine similarity to inhibit dimensions with
opposite directions. We conduct extensive experiments demonstrating that the
NaLaFormer improves performance on vision and language tasks, enhancing both
expressiveness and efficiency by up to 4.2\%.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a more efficient fine-tuning blueprint for LLMs using selective reasoning for complex data based on entropy, achieving better performance with less data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to solve the inefficiency and resource-intensive processes of improving general-purpose LLMs for specific tasks using traditional supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and distillation approaches.

Method: The proposed method categorizes training data into complexity levels using single token answer entropy. Fine-tuning is then applied selectively: SFT and distillation focus on complex data while efficiently handling simpler data.

Result: The approach outperforms traditional SFT methods, improving average accuracy from 0.43 to 0.55, and achieves comparable results to distillation while using 62% less data.

Conclusion: The novel selective fine-tuning pipeline is a practical, data-efficient alternative to traditional methods, suited for advancing LLM capabilities. Open code and data are provided to support further research.

Abstract: General-purpose Large Language Models (LLMs) are frequently fine-tuned
through supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to enhance performance in specific
domains. Better results can be achieved by distilling the chain-of-thought of a
larger model at the cost of numerous expensive calls and a much greater amount
of data. We propose a novel blueprint for efficient fine-tuning that uses
reasoning only for complex data identified by entropy. Specifically, across two
small open models ($\approx 3B$) we split the training data into complexity
categories by a single token answer entropy (ROC AUC $0.73$), fine-tune large
language models (LLMs) via SFT and distillation, and show that our pipeline
significantly outperforms the standard SFT approach ($0.55$ vs $0.43$ average
accuracy) and provides comparable with distillation performance while using
$62\%$ less data ($0.55$ average accuracy for both). We publish our code and
data to facilitate further research in this direction.

*Ziwei Wang,Hongbin Wang,Tianwang Jia,Xingyi He,Siyang Li,Dongrui Wu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposed a novel dual-branch convolutional Transformer model, DBConformer, for EEG signal decoding, which outperformed existing baselines and showed strong interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses limitations in EEG decoding methods such as difficulty capturing long-term temporal dependencies and global inter-channel relationships using existing CNNs and Conformer hybrids.

Method: Introduced DBConformer incorporating temporal and spatial Conformers alongside lightweight channel attention modules to evaluate EEG signals across multiple datasets and settings.

Result: DBConformer outperformed 10 baseline models across motor imagery and seizure detection datasets with fewer parameters and demonstrated physiologically interpretable feature extraction.

Conclusion: DBConformer proves to be a reliable and explainable model for EEG decoding, combining efficiency with enhanced accuracy for complex signal analysis.

Abstract: Electroencephalography (EEG)-based brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) transform
spontaneous/evoked neural activity into control commands for external
communication. While convolutional neural networks (CNNs) remain the mainstream
backbone for EEG decoding, their inherently short receptive field makes it
difficult to capture long-range temporal dependencies and global inter-channel
relationships. Recent CNN-Transformer (Conformers) hybrids partially address
this issue, but most adopt a serial design, resulting in suboptimal integration
of local and global features, and often overlook explicit channel-wise
modeling. To address these limitations, we propose DBConformer, a dual-branch
convolutional Transformer network tailored for EEG decoding. It integrates a
temporal Conformer to model long-range temporal dependencies and a spatial
Conformer to extract inter-channel interactions, capturing both temporal
dynamics and spatial patterns in EEG signals. A lightweight channel attention
module further refines spatial representations by assigning data-driven
importance to EEG channels. Extensive experiments on five motor imagery (MI)
datasets and two seizure detection datasets under three evaluation settings
demonstrate that DBConformer consistently outperforms 10 competitive baseline
models, with over eight times fewer parameters than the high-capacity EEG
Conformer baseline. Further, the visualization results confirm that the
features extracted by DBConformer are physiologically interpretable and aligned
with sensorimotor priors in MI. The superior performance and interpretability
of DBConformer make it reliable for robust and explainable EEG decoding. Code
is publicized at https://github.com/wzwvv/DBConformer.

*Ji Qi,WenPeng Zhu,Li Li,Ming Wu,YingJun Wu,Wu He,Xun Gao,Jason Zeng,Michael Heinrich*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces DiLoCoX, a decentralized training framework for large language models with over 100 billion parameters across slow networks, achieving up to 357x speedup with minimal performance loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for effective training of large language models on decentralized clusters with slow network infrastructure forms the motivation for this work, addressing a significant scalability challenge in model training.

Method: DiLoCoX integrates Pipeline Parallelism, a Dual Optimizer Policy, One-Step-Delay Overlap of Communication and Local Training, and an Adaptive Gradient Compression Scheme to optimize decentralized training.

Result: DiLoCoX achieved a 357x speedup in distributed training of a 107B parameter model on a 1Gbps network compared to vanilla AllReduce, with minor convergence degradation.

Conclusion: DiLoCoX provides a viable solution for decentralized training of large-scale models, unlocking the potential for training beyond centralized fast network clusters.

Abstract: The distributed training of foundation models, particularly large language
models (LLMs), demands a high level of communication. Consequently, it is
highly dependent on a centralized cluster with fast and reliable interconnects.
Can we conduct training on slow networks and thereby unleash the power of
decentralized clusters when dealing with models exceeding 100 billion
parameters? In this paper, we propose DiLoCoX, a low-communication large-scale
decentralized cluster training framework. It combines Pipeline Parallelism with
Dual Optimizer Policy, One-Step-Delay Overlap of Communication and Local
Training, and an Adaptive Gradient Compression Scheme. This combination
significantly improves the scale of parameters and the speed of model
pre-training. We justify the benefits of one-step-delay overlap of
communication and local training, as well as the adaptive gradient compression
scheme, through a theoretical analysis of convergence. Empirically, we
demonstrate that DiLoCoX is capable of pre-training a 107B foundation model
over a 1Gbps network. Compared to vanilla AllReduce, DiLoCoX can achieve a 357x
speedup in distributed training while maintaining negligible degradation in
model convergence. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first
decentralized training framework successfully applied to models with over 100

### [231] [Generative Adversarial Evasion and Out-of-Distribution Detection for UAV Cyber-Attacks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21142)
*Deepak Kumar Panda,Weisi Guo*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes a framework using conditional generative adversarial networks (cGAN) to create stealthy adversarial attacks that evade UAV intrusion detection systems (IDS), and introduces a conditional variational autoencoder (CVAE) to detect such attacks more effectively than traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The integration of UAVs into civilian airspace demands effective intrusion detection systems to counter novel threats, as traditional methods struggle with stealthy adversarial attacks and distinguishing genuine out-of-distribution events.

Method: A robust multi-class IDS classifier was designed based on benign telemetry and cyber-attack datasets. A cGAN was utilized to craft adversarial samples, which misclassify as benign while resembling genuine out-of-distribution distributions. A CVAE was implemented to detect these adversarial perturbations using negative log-likelihood for differentiation.

Result: The CVAE-based framework demonstrated superior performance in detecting stealthy adversarial samples, compared to traditional Mahalanobis distance-based methods, through comparative evaluation.

Conclusion: Advanced probabilistic modeling, such as CVAE, enhances intrusion detection system capabilities against generative-model-based cyber threats, essential for strengthening security in UAV operations.

Abstract: The growing integration of UAVs into civilian airspace underscores the need
for resilient and intelligent intrusion detection systems (IDS), as traditional
anomaly detection methods often fail to identify novel threats. A common
approach treats unfamiliar attacks as out-of-distribution (OOD) samples;
however, this leaves systems vulnerable when mitigation is inadequate.
Moreover, conventional OOD detectors struggle to distinguish stealthy
adversarial attacks from genuine OOD events. This paper introduces a
conditional generative adversarial network (cGAN)-based framework for crafting
stealthy adversarial attacks that evade IDS mechanisms. We first design a
robust multi-class IDS classifier trained on benign UAV telemetry and known
cyber-attacks, including Denial of Service (DoS), false data injection (FDI),
man-in-the-middle (MiTM), and replay attacks. Using this classifier, our cGAN
perturbs known attacks to generate adversarial samples that misclassify as
benign while retaining statistical resemblance to OOD distributions. These
adversarial samples are iteratively refined to achieve high stealth and success
rates. To detect such perturbations, we implement a conditional variational
autoencoder (CVAE), leveraging negative log-likelihood to separate adversarial
inputs from authentic OOD samples. Comparative evaluation shows that CVAE-based
regret scores significantly outperform traditional Mahalanobis distance-based
detectors in identifying stealthy adversarial threats. Our findings emphasize
the importance of advanced probabilistic modeling to strengthen IDS
capabilities against adaptive, generative-model-based cyber intrusions.

### [232] [Personalized Federated Learning via Dual-Prompt Optimization and Cross Fusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21144)
*Yuguang Zhang,Kuangpu Guo,Zhihe Lu,Yunbo Wang,Jian Liang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a personalized federated learning framework called pFedDC that utilizes dual-prompt learning and cross-fusion for better performance under data heterogeneity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges posed by decentralized federated learning systems facing data, computation, and communication heterogeneities, especially under joint label-domain distribution shifts.

Method: The proposed framework integrates global and local prompts across vision and language modalities, alongside a cross-fusion module to generate personalized representations tailored to individual client data distributions.

Result: Experiments conducted across nine datasets demonstrate that pFedDC consistently surpasses state-of-the-art federated learning methods, particularly in heterogeneous scenarios.

Conclusion: pFedDC successfully combines pretrained prompts and fusion methods to manage decentralized data heterogeneity, providing a scalable and personalized federated learning solution.

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) enables collaborative model training across
decentralized clients without sharing local data, but is challenged by
heterogeneity in data, computation, and communication. Pretrained
vision-language models (VLMs), with their strong generalization and lightweight
tuning via prompts, offer a promising solution. However, existing federated
prompt-learning methods rely only on text prompts and overlook joint
label-domain distribution shifts. In this paper, we propose a personalized FL
framework based on dual-prompt learning and cross fusion, termed pFedDC.
Specifically, each client maintains both global and local prompts across vision
and language modalities: global prompts capture common knowledge shared across
the federation, while local prompts encode client-specific semantics and domain
characteristics. Meanwhile, a cross-fusion module is designed to adaptively
integrate prompts from different levels, enabling the model to generate
personalized representations aligned with each client's unique data
distribution. Extensive experiments across nine datasets with various types of
heterogeneity show that pFedDC consistently outperforms state-of-the-art
methods.

### [233] [Latent Prototype Routing: Achieving Near-Perfect Load Balancing in Mixture-of-Experts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21328)
*Jiajie Yang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper addresses load imbalance in mixture-of-experts (MoE) architectures for large language models by introducing Latent Prototype Routing (LPR), which improves expert utilization and maintains performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current MoE systems suffer from severe load imbalances, leading to underutilization of computational resources and model capacity.

Method: The authors propose Latent Prototype Routing (LPR), a framework that revisits expert routing from a clustering perspective to ensure balanced expert activation during training and inference.

Result: LPR reduced the Gini coefficient of expert load from 0.70 to 0.035 and improved the min-max expert load ratio from 1e-6 to 0.70, achieving nearly ideal load balancing across several MoE models.

Conclusion: LPR provides a generalized routing approach that significantly improves load balance in MoE systems without compromising downstream model performance.

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures have emerged as a key strategy for
scaling large language models (LLMs) efficiently. However, current MoE systems
suffer from severe load imbalance, where only a small subset of experts is
consistently activated during training and inference, leading to significant
underutilization of model capacity and computational resources. In this work,
we revisit expert routing through a clustering perspective and propose Latent
Prototype Routing (LPR), a novel routing framework that generalizes existing
approaches while promoting balanced expert utilization without compromising
downstream performance. Extensive experiments across multiple open-source MoE
models -- including DeepSeek-V3, Qwen3-MoE, and Mixtral -- demonstrate that LPR
reduces the Gini coefficient of expert load from 0.70 to 0.035 on average,
improves the min-max expert load ratio from 1e-6 to 0.70, achieving
near-perfect load balancing.

*Hampus Gummesson Svensson,Ola Engkvist,Jon Paul Janet,Christian Tyrchan,Morteza Haghir Chehreghani*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes using diverse mini-batches in reinforcement learning with determinantal point processes to improve diversity and quality in the specific application of drug discovery.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Evaluating new instances in reinforcement learning is both time-consuming and costly, yet diversity in exploration is essential to improve learning outcomes.

Method: The authors introduce a framework for diverse mini-batch selection using determinantal point processes and implement it in de novo drug design tasks.

Result: The experiments demonstrate improved solution diversity and consistent high-quality outcomes in molecular generation tasks.

Conclusion: Diverse mini-batch selection can enhance exploration efficiency in reinforcement learning, with promising applications in accelerating drug discovery.

Abstract: In many real-world applications, evaluating the goodness of instances is
often costly and time-consuming, e.g., human feedback and physics simulations,
in contrast to proposing new instances. In particular, this is even more
critical in reinforcement learning, as new interactions with the environment
(i.e., new instances) need to be evaluated to provide a reward signal to learn
from. As sufficient exploration is crucial, learning from a diverse mini-batch
can have a large impact and help mitigate mode collapse. In this paper, we
introduce diverse mini-batch selection for reinforcement learning and propose
to use determinantal point processes for this task. We study this framework in
the context of a real-world problem, namely drug discovery. We experimentally
study how our proposed framework can improve the effectiveness of chemical
exploration in de novo drug design, where finding diverse and high-quality
solutions is essential. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation with three
well-established molecular generation oracles over numerous generative steps.
Our experiments conclude that our diverse mini-batch selection framework can
substantially improve the diversity of the solutions, while still obtaining
solutions of high quality. In drug discovery, such outcome can potentially lead
to fulfilling unmet medication needs faster.

*Apurva Shah,Axel Abels,Ann Nowé,Tom Lenaerts*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores the use of Artificial Delegates in perpetual voting systems to address absenteeism and its impact on fairness over time.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address the issue of absenteeism in sequential voting systems, which undermines fairness and representational equity.

Method: The researchers analyzed different voting methods, integrating Artificial Delegates trained to represent absent voters, and assessed their impact on fairness and representativeness.

Result: The findings show that absenteeism negatively influences fairness, but Artificial Delegates can effectively mitigate these effects, improving system robustness.

Conclusion: Artificial Delegates are a feasible solution for maintaining fairness and equity in perpetual voting systems, even in cases of partial turnout.

Abstract: Perpetual voting addresses fairness in sequential collective decision-making
by evaluating representational equity over time. However, existing perpetual
voting rules rely on full participation and complete approval information,
assumptions that rarely hold in practice, where partial turnout is the norm. In
this work, we study the integration of Artificial Delegates,
preference-learning agents trained to represent absent voters, into perpetual
voting systems. We examine how absenteeism affects fairness and
representativeness under various voting methods and evaluate the extent to
which Artificial Delegates can compensate for missing participation. Our
findings indicate that while absenteeism significantly affects fairness,
Artificial Delegates reliably mitigate these effects and enhance robustness
across diverse scenarios.

*Colin Samplawski,Adam D. Cobb,Manoj Acharya,Ramneet Kaur,Susmit Jha*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces ScalaBL, a scalable Bayesian approach for large language models (LLMs) that uses stochastic variational subspace inference, achieving competitive results with minimal additional parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs hallucinate and are poorly calibrated, posing risks in critical domains like healthcare. There's a need for efficient uncertainty quantification methods that are scalable to large LLMs.

Method: The proposed ScalaBL repurposes LoRA parameters as projection matrices to perform Bayesian inference in a low-dimensional subspace using stochastic variational inference.

Result: ScalaBL achieves competitive performance with state-of-the-art methods while requiring only approximately 1000 additional parameters and enables scaling to the largest Bayesian LLMs to date.

Conclusion: ScalaBL provides an efficient and scalable method for uncertainty quantification in LLMs, addressing prior limitations in parameter overhead and scalability to larger models.

Abstract: Despite their widespread use, large language models (LLMs) are known to
hallucinate incorrect information and be poorly calibrated. This makes the
uncertainty quantification of these models of critical importance, especially
in high-stakes domains, such as autonomy and healthcare. Prior work has made
Bayesian deep learning-based approaches to this problem more tractable by
performing inference over the low-rank adaptation (LoRA) parameters of a
fine-tuned model. While effective, these approaches struggle to scale to larger
LLMs due to requiring further additional parameters compared to LoRA. In this
work we present $\textbf{Scala}$ble $\textbf{B}$ayesian $\textbf{L}$ow-Rank
Adaptation via Stochastic Variational Subspace Inference (ScalaBL). We perform
Bayesian inference in an $r$-dimensional subspace, for LoRA rank $r$. By
repurposing the LoRA parameters as projection matrices, we are able to map
samples from this subspace into the full weight space of the LLM. This allows
us to learn all the parameters of our approach using stochastic variational
inference. Despite the low dimensionality of our subspace, we are able to
achieve competitive performance with state-of-the-art approaches while only
requiring ${\sim}1000$ additional parameters. Furthermore, it allows us to
scale up to the largest Bayesian LLM to date, with four times as a many base
parameters as prior work.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Component obsolescence creates significant cost and operational challenges, and reliable prediction methods are needed to mitigate these issues. The lack of sufficient data necessitates innovative solutions.

Method: The study uses zero-shot learning with large language models to leverage domain-specific knowledge from tabular datasets, addressing the limitations of traditional methods.

Result: Applied to two real-world datasets, the approach successfully predicted obsolescence risks, and a comparison of four large language models highlighted the importance of selecting the right model.

Conclusion: The proposed method offers an effective solution to the obsolescence risk prediction challenge, emphasizing the benefits of large language models in handling data scarcity.

Abstract: Component obsolescence poses significant challenges in industries reliant on
electronic components, causing increased costs and disruptions in the security
and availability of systems. Accurate obsolescence risk prediction is essential
but hindered by a lack of reliable data. This paper proposes a novel approach
to forecasting obsolescence risk using zero-shot learning (ZSL) with large
language models (LLMs) to address data limitations by leveraging
domain-specific knowledge from tabular datasets. Applied to two real-world
datasets, the method demonstrates effective risk prediction. A comparative
evaluation of four LLMs underscores the importance of selecting the right model

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes new seeding methods for k-means and k-GMM algorithms that improve performance metrics consistently while maintaining modest computational overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance initialization methods for k-means and k-GMM by addressing their shortcomings and exploring new strategies like lookahead and multipass approaches.

Method: They formalized seeding techniques focusing on metrics for seed sampling and selection, introduced lookahead principles and multipass strategies, and analyzed methods experimentally.

Result: Consistent improvement in k-means and k-GMM performance metrics (SSE and log-likelihood) over classical techniques, surpassing previous advanced methods like multi-swap.

Conclusion: The proposed methods are strong alternatives for standard initialization in clustering and open up analytical opportunities for theoretical advancement.

Abstract: We revisit the randomized seeding techniques for k-means clustering and k-GMM
(Gaussian Mixture model fitting with Expectation-Maximization), formalizing
their three key ingredients: the metric used for seed sampling, the number of
candidate seeds, and the metric used for seed selection. This analysis yields
novel families of initialization methods exploiting a lookahead
principle--conditioning the seed selection to an enhanced coherence with the
final metric used to assess the algorithm, and a multipass strategy to tame
down the effect of randomization.
  Experiments show a consistent constant factor improvement over classical
contenders in terms of the final metric (SSE for k-means, log-likelihood for
k-GMM), at a modest overhead. In particular, for k-means, our methods improve
on the recently designed multi-swap strategy, which was the first one to
outperform the greedy k-means++ seeding.
  Our experimental analysis also shed light on subtle properties of k-means
often overlooked, including the (lack of) correlations between the SSE upon
seeding and the final SSE, the variance reduction phenomena observed in
iterative seeding methods, and the sensitivity of the final SSE to the pool
size for greedy methods.
  Practically, our most effective seeding methods are strong candidates to
become one of the--if not the--standard techniques. From a theoretical
perspective, our formalization of seeding opens the door to a new line of
analytical approaches.

*Galvin Brice S. Lim,Brian Godwin S. Lim,Argel A. Bandala,John Anthony C. Jose,Timothy Scott C. Chu,Edwin Sybingco*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces AGTCNet, a novel model for classifying motor imagery EEG, achieving state-of-the-art results with reduced model size, faster inference, and improved accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address challenges in building subject-invariant and session-invariant BCI systems due to EEG variability and equipment constraints, alongside the inefficiency of prior models in spatiotemporal feature extraction.

Method: The researchers propose AGTCNet, which uses the topographic arrangement of EEG electrodes and a graph convolutional attention mechanism to effectively capture spatiotemporal dependencies for EEG signal classification.

Result: AGTCNet significantly outperformed existing classifiers, achieving a moving average accuracy of 66.82% (82.88% fine-tuned) on BCI Competition IV and 64.14%-85.22% accuracy on the EEG Motor Movement/Imagery Dataset, with reduced model size and faster inference times.

Conclusion: The AGTCNet model presents a practical and highly effective approach for BCI applications, demonstrating superiority in accuracy, computational efficiency, and adaptability over existing methods.

Abstract: Brain-computer interface (BCI) technology utilizing electroencephalography
(EEG) marks a transformative innovation, empowering motor-impaired individuals
to engage with their environment on equal footing. Despite its promising
potential, developing subject-invariant and session-invariant BCI systems
remains a significant challenge due to the inherent complexity and variability
of neural activity across individuals and over time, compounded by EEG hardware
constraints. While prior studies have sought to develop robust BCI systems,
existing approaches remain ineffective in capturing the intricate
spatiotemporal dependencies within multichannel EEG signals. This study
addresses this gap by introducing the attentive graph-temporal convolutional
network (AGTCNet), a novel graph-temporal model for motor imagery EEG (MI-EEG)
classification. Specifically, AGTCNet leverages the topographic configuration
of EEG electrodes as an inductive bias and integrates graph convolutional
attention network (GCAT) to jointly learn expressive spatiotemporal EEG
representations. The proposed model significantly outperformed existing MI-EEG
classifiers, achieving state-of-the-art performance while utilizing a compact
architecture, underscoring its effectiveness and practicality for BCI
deployment. With a 49.87% reduction in model size, 64.65% faster inference
time, and shorter input EEG signal, AGTCNet achieved a moving average accuracy
of 66.82% for subject-independent classification on the BCI Competition IV
Dataset 2a, which further improved to 82.88% when fine-tuned for
subject-specific classification. On the EEG Motor Movement/Imagery Dataset,
AGTCNet achieved moving average accuracies of 64.14% and 85.22% for 4-class and
2-class subject-independent classifications, respectively, with further
improvements to 72.13% and 90.54% for subject-specific classifications.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DynamicBench is a benchmark designed to evaluate LLMs in processing real-time information, surpassing previous models in performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional benchmarks fall short by relying on static evaluations, which do not address dynamic, real-time information needs in modern applications.

Method: DynamicBench uses a dual-path retrieval pipeline combining web searches and local databases, testing models in scenarios with and without external documents.

Result: Experimentally, DynamicBench surpasses GPT4o, achieving 7.0% and 5.8% better performance in document-free and document-assisted scenarios, respectively.

Conclusion: DynamicBench effectively assesses LLMs for real-time accuracy and synthesis, establishing a new standard for dynamic information processing.

Abstract: Traditional benchmarks for large language models (LLMs) typically rely on
static evaluations through storytelling or opinion expression, which fail to
capture the dynamic requirements of real-time information processing in
contemporary applications. To address this limitation, we present DynamicBench,
a benchmark designed to evaluate the proficiency of LLMs in storing and
processing up-to-the-minute data. DynamicBench utilizes a dual-path retrieval
pipeline, integrating web searches with local report databases. It necessitates
domain-specific knowledge, ensuring accurate responses report generation within
specialized fields. By evaluating models in scenarios that either provide or
withhold external documents, DynamicBench effectively measures their capability
to independently process recent information or leverage contextual
enhancements. Additionally, we introduce an advanced report generation system
adept at managing dynamic information synthesis. Our experimental results
confirm the efficacy of our approach, with our method achieving
state-of-the-art performance, surpassing GPT4o in document-free and
document-assisted scenarios by 7.0% and 5.8%, respectively. The code and data
will be made publicly available.

*Le Vu Anh,Mehmet Dik,Nguyen Viet Anh*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces a uniform Lipschitz bound for the eigenvalue variation in persistent Laplacians when a simplex is added, ensuring stability and error control in spectral topological data analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address the unknown behavior of individual eigenvalue changes in persistent Laplacians when a single simplex is added, which is important for applications relying on these eigenvalues.

Method: The authors derive and prove a uniform Lipschitz bound that limits the change in eigenvalues of up-persistent Laplacians, independent of filtration scale and complex size.

Result: The derived Lipschitz bound demonstrates that any eigenvalue's variation can be restricted to at most twice the Euclidean norm of the added simplex's boundary.

Conclusion: This establishes eigenvalue-level robustness for spectral topological data analysis, ensuring that spectral features are stable under local updates, making tools such as spectral neural networks and heat-kernel signatures more reliable.

Abstract: Persistent Laplacians are matrix operators that track how the shape and
structure of data transform across scales and are popularly adopted in biology,
physics, and machine learning. Their eigenvalues are concise descriptors of
geometric and topological features in a filtration. Although earlier work
established global algebraic stability for these operators, the precise change
in a single eigenvalue when one simplex, such as a vertex, edge, or triangle,
is added has remained unknown. This is important because downstream tools,
including heat-kernel signatures and spectral neural networks, depend directly
on these eigenvalues. We close this gap by proving a uniform Lipschitz bound:
after inserting one simplex, every up-persistent Laplacian eigenvalue can vary
by at most twice the Euclidean norm of that simplex's boundary, independent of
filtration scale and complex size. This result delivers the first
eigenvalue-level robustness guarantee for spectral topological data analysis.
It guarantees that spectral features remain stable under local updates and
enables reliable error control in dynamic data settings.

TL;DR: This paper explores multimodal in-context learning (ICL) for medical tasks using a novel benchmark, SMMILE, revealing that current models have significant limitations and biases.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multimodal ICL is underexplored in critical applications like medicine, where clinicians often need to adapt quickly to specialized tasks using limited examples.

Method: The authors developed SMMILE, an expert-curated benchmark of 111 medical problems covering 6 specialties and 13 imaging types, and SMMILE++, an augmented version with 1038 variations, to evaluate 15 multimodal large language models' ICL performance.

Result: Most evaluated models showed moderate to poor performance in multimodal ICL, with only an 8-9.4% improvement over zero-shot ability. Models were prone to errors from irrelevant examples and exhibited a recency bias in example ordering.

Conclusion: Current multimodal large language models have critical limitations and biases, making them unreliable for learning complex medical tasks through in-context learning. Further innovation is needed in this domain.

Abstract: Multimodal in-context learning (ICL) remains underexplored despite
significant potential for domains such as medicine. Clinicians routinely
encounter diverse, specialized tasks requiring adaptation from limited
examples, such as drawing insights from a few relevant prior cases or
considering a constrained set of differential diagnoses. While multimodal large
language models (MLLMs) have shown advances in medical visual question
answering (VQA), their ability to learn multimodal tasks from context is
largely unknown. We introduce SMMILE, the first expert-driven multimodal ICL
benchmark for medical tasks. Eleven medical experts curated problems, each
including a multimodal query and multimodal in-context examples as task
demonstrations. SMMILE encompasses 111 problems (517 question-image-answer
triplets) covering 6 medical specialties and 13 imaging modalities. We further
introduce SMMILE++, an augmented variant with 1038 permuted problems. A
comprehensive evaluation of 15 MLLMs demonstrates that most models exhibit
moderate to poor multimodal ICL ability in medical tasks. In open-ended
evaluations, ICL contributes only 8% average improvement over zero-shot on
SMMILE and 9.4% on SMMILE++. We observe a susceptibility for irrelevant
in-context examples: even a single noisy or irrelevant example can degrade
performance by up to 9.5%. Moreover, example ordering exhibits a recency bias,
i.e., placing the most relevant example last can lead to substantial
performance improvements by up to 71%. Our findings highlight critical
limitations and biases in current MLLMs when learning multimodal medical tasks
from context.

in both sample efficiency and longer-term training. Moreover, the addition of
rQdia finally propels model-free continuous control from pixels over the state
encoding baseline.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve energy efficiency in deep neural networks (DNNs) while maintaining a balance with accuracy using hardware approximation.

Method: The paper employs ROUP approximate multipliers in a fine-grained manner across the DNN layers, filters, and kernels. It uses the ResNet-8 model on the CIFAR-10 dataset for evaluation.

Result: Energy efficiency sees an improvement of up to 54% with a slight accuracy loss of 4%. Additionally, it achieves 2x energy gains with better accuracy compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: Fine-grained approximate computing using ROUP multipliers demonstrates substantial energy savings with manageable accuracy loss, showcasing its practical applications in low-power DNNs.

Abstract: Nowadays, the rapid growth of Deep Neural Network (DNN) architectures has
established them as the defacto approach for providing advanced Machine
Learning tasks with excellent accuracy. Targeting low-power DNN computing, this
paper examines the interplay of fine-grained error resilience of DNN workloads
in collaboration with hardware approximation techniques, to achieve higher
levels of energy efficiency. Utilizing the state-of-the-art ROUP approximate
multipliers, we systematically explore their fine-grained distribution across
the network according to our layer-, filter-, and kernel-level approaches, and
examine their impact on accuracy and energy. We use the ResNet-8 model on the
CIFAR-10 dataset to evaluate our approximations. The proposed solution delivers
up to 54% energy gains in exchange for up to 4% accuracy loss, compared to the
baseline quantized model, while it provides 2x energy gains with better
accuracy versus the state-of-the-art DNN approximations.

*Chao Zhou,Tom Jacobs,Advait Gadhikar,Rebekka Burkholz*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces NANOADAM, a finetuning method that focuses on updating only small-magnitude weights in large pretrained neural networks, improving computational efficiency and maintaining performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Finetuning large pretrained neural networks is resource-intensive and can lead to catastrophic forgetting. The authors aim to address this challenge by targeting the relationship between weight magnitudes and gradients.

Method: The authors propose NANOADAM, a technique that updates only small-magnitude weights during finetuning based on their observation that such weights correlate with large gradients. This method avoids gradient computation, preserves critical pretraining features, and allows larger learning rates.

Result: NANOADAM consistently shows better generalization performance across NLP and vision tasks, while maintaining computational efficiency and mitigating catastrophic forgetting.

Conclusion: NANOADAM offers a resource-efficient and effective finetuning approach by leveraging small-magnitude weights, resulting in improved generalization and reduced risk of catastrophic forgetting in large pretrained networks.

Abstract: Finetuning large pretrained neural networks is known to be
resource-intensive, both in terms of memory and computational cost. To mitigate
this, a common approach is to restrict training to a subset of the model
parameters. By analyzing the relationship between gradients and weights during
finetuning, we observe a notable pattern: large gradients are often associated
with small-magnitude weights. This correlation is more pronounced in finetuning
settings than in training from scratch. Motivated by this observation, we
propose NANOADAM, which dynamically updates only the small-magnitude weights
during finetuning and offers several practical advantages: first, this
criterion is gradient-free -- the parameter subset can be determined without
gradient computation; second, it preserves large-magnitude weights, which are
likely to encode critical features learned during pretraining, thereby reducing
the risk of catastrophic forgetting; thirdly, it permits the use of larger
learning rates and consistently leads to better generalization performance in
experiments. We demonstrate this for both NLP and vision tasks.

Method: The authors propose ATGAT with three key modules: multi-scale temporal embeddings, a triple attention mechanism, and weighted BCE loss.

Result: The ATGAT model achieved a notable AUC of 0.9130, significantly outperforming methods like XGBoost, GCN, and standard GAT.

Conclusion: ATGAT demonstrated superior performance and robustness, aiding financial institutions in reliable fraud detection and offering generalizable insights for anomaly detection in other temporal graph tasks.

Abstract: Cryptocurrency transaction fraud detection faces the dual challenges of
increasingly complex transaction patterns and severe class imbalance.
Traditional methods rely on manual feature engineering and struggle to capture
temporal and structural dependencies in transaction networks. This paper
proposes an Augmented Temporal-aware Graph Attention Network (ATGAT) that
enhances detection performance through three modules: (1) designing an advanced
temporal embedding module that fuses multi-scale time difference features with
periodic position encoding; (2) constructing a temporal-aware triple attention
mechanism that jointly optimizes structural, temporal, and global context
attention; (3) employing weighted BCE loss to address class imbalance.
Experiments on the Elliptic++ cryptocurrency dataset demonstrate that ATGAT
achieves an AUC of 0.9130, representing a 9.2% improvement over the best
traditional method XGBoost, 12.0% over GCN, and 10.0% over standard GAT. This
method not only validates the enhancement effect of temporal awareness and
triple attention mechanisms on graph neural networks, but also provides
financial institutions with more reliable fraud detection tools, with its
design principles generalizable to other temporal graph anomaly detection
tasks.

*Jaris Küken,Lennart Purucker,Frank Hutter*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes an early-stopping mechanism for in-context learning in tabular foundation models, reducing inference time with minimal performance loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Tabular foundation models excel at in-context learning but suffer from high inference-time costs, especially on larger datasets.

Method: The authors introduce a dynamic early-stopping mechanism for in-context learning, leveraging a layer-wise decoder for embedding processing upon stopping.

Result: The proposed method accelerates inference by up to 1.3x on small tasks and up to 2.2x on larger ones, with minimal impact on predictive accuracy.

Conclusion: Early exiting is a viable strategy to enhance inference efficiency in tabular in-context learning models while maintaining performance.

Abstract: Tabular foundation models have shown strong performance across various
tabular learning tasks via in-context learning, offering robust generalization
without any downstream finetuning. However, their inference-time costs remain
high, particularly for larger datasets. To address this, we propose
early-stopping the in-context learning process. We achieve this by dynamically
evaluating whether to stop in-context learning after each Transformer encoder
layer. Once stopped, we decode the embedding using a pre-trained layer-wise
decoder. Experiments across 34 small classification tasks size show that early
stopping in-context learning accelerates inference by up to x1.3 with
negligible degradation in predictive performance. To assess scalability, we
further evaluate our method on five larger classification tasks, achieving
speedups of up to x2.2. Our results demonstrate the potential of early exiting
as an effective and practical strategy for improving the efficiency of tabular
in-context learning.

Method: The authors present the Distributed Cross-Channel Hierarchical Aggregation (D-CHAG) method, which is compatible with any vision transformer architecture and model-parallel strategy, enabling efficient handling of large multi-channel datasets.

Result: Experiments showed that D-CHAG reduced memory usage by up to 75% and more than doubled throughput when tested on hyperspectral imaging and weather forecasting tasks using 1,024 AMD GPUs on the Frontier Supercomputer.

Conclusion: The D-CHAG approach demonstrates its effectiveness in improving computational efficiency, addressing key challenges in scientific vision modeling, and making it a valuable tool for advancing discovery.

Abstract: Vision-based scientific foundation models hold significant promise for
advancing scientific discovery and innovation. This potential stems from their
ability to aggregate images from diverse sources such as varying physical
groundings or data acquisition systems and to learn spatio-temporal
correlations using transformer architectures. However, tokenizing and
aggregating images can be compute-intensive, a challenge not fully addressed by
current distributed methods. In this work, we introduce the Distributed
Cross-Channel Hierarchical Aggregation (D-CHAG) approach designed for datasets
with a large number of channels across image modalities. Our method is
compatible with any model-parallel strategy and any type of vision transformer
architecture, significantly improving computational efficiency. We evaluated
D-CHAG on hyperspectral imaging and weather forecasting tasks. When integrated
with tensor parallelism and model sharding, our approach achieved up to a 75%
reduction in memory usage and more than doubled sustained throughput on up to

Motivation: Understanding deception in dyadic interactions could enhance insights into social dynamics and psychotherapy processes. The study targets multimodal machine learning to maximize detection accuracy.

Method: The study utilized audio and video data, including Action Units and gaze, on Swedish truth/lie interactions. Early and late fusion approaches were tested using multimodal data from both participants.

Result: Integrating facial and vocal data, especially using late fusion strategies combining inputs from both deceiver and deceived, resulted in the highest accuracy of 71%.

Conclusion: The research highlights the importance of multimodal data and participant integration in deception detection, aligning findings with psychological theories and offering a foundation for further inquiries in Scandinavian cohorts and therapeutic settings.

Abstract: This study investigates the efficacy of using multimodal machine learning
techniques to detect deception in dyadic interactions, focusing on the
integration of data from both the deceiver and the deceived. We compare early
and late fusion approaches, utilizing audio and video data - specifically,
Action Units and gaze information - across all possible combinations of
modalities and participants. Our dataset, newly collected from Swedish native
speakers engaged in truth or lie scenarios on emotionally relevant topics,
serves as the basis for our analysis. The results demonstrate that
incorporating both speech and facial information yields superior performance
compared to single-modality approaches. Moreover, including data from both
participants significantly enhances deception detection accuracy, with the best
performance (71%) achieved using a late fusion strategy applied to both
modalities and participants. These findings align with psychological theories
suggesting differential control of facial and vocal expressions during initial
interactions. As the first study of its kind on a Scandinavian cohort, this
research lays the groundwork for future investigations into dyadic
interactions, particularly within psychotherapy settings.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper presents a training method for ResNets inspired by optimal control, suggesting penalization of intermediate hidden states leading to improved training dynamics and potential layer pruning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The goal is to draw a connection between training ResNets and optimal control to enhance training efficiency and enable theory-backed pruning strategies.

Method: The method involves penalizing intermediate outputs in ResNets through skip connections and output layers, inspired by optimal control stage cost terms.

Result: The approach biases weights of deeper residual layers to vanish, indicating redundant layers can be pruned effectively.

Conclusion: This proposed formulation not only improves ResNet training but also provides a theoretical framework for deciding which layers can be pruned.

Abstract: We propose a training formulation for ResNets reflecting an optimal control
problem that is applicable for standard architectures and general loss
functions. We suggest bridging both worlds via penalizing intermediate outputs
of hidden states corresponding to stage cost terms in optimal control. For
standard ResNets, we obtain intermediate outputs by propagating the state
through the subsequent skip connections and the output layer. We demonstrate
that our training dynamic biases the weights of the unnecessary deeper residual
layers to vanish. This indicates the potential for a theory-grounded layer
pruning strategy.

TL;DR: The paper presents a hybrid GA-RL framework for optimizing Extended Stability Runge-Kutta (ESRK) methods to improve computational efficiency while maintaining accuracy and stability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Balancing accuracy, stability, and computational efficiency in high-order, low-storage Extended Stability Runge-Kutta (ESRK) methods for large-scale applications is difficult and requires innovation.

Method: A hybrid Genetic Algorithm (GA) and Reinforcement Learning (RL) approach is deployed for automated heuristic discovery, optimizing ESRK methods. GA enables search-space exploration, while RL refines heuristic selection dynamically.

Result: The optimized ESRK heuristic reduces IPOPT runtime by 25% compared to traditional methods, while preserving fourth-order accuracy, stability, and efficiency. Validation was done using benchmark problems like the Brusselator systems and Navier-Stokes equations.

Conclusion: The study introduces an adaptive heuristic discovery framework that enhances resource efficiency for numerical methods and opens opportunities for future research using AI-driven tools like Deep RL and AutoML.

Abstract: Extended Stability Runge-Kutta (ESRK) methods are crucial for solving
large-scale computational problems in science and engineering, including
weather forecasting, aerodynamic analysis, and complex biological modelling.
However, balancing accuracy, stability, and computational efficiency remains
challenging, particularly for high-order, low-storage schemes. This study
introduces a hybrid Genetic Algorithm (GA) and Reinforcement Learning (RL)
approach for automated heuristic discovery, optimising low-storage ESRK
methods. Unlike traditional approaches that rely on manually designed
heuristics or exhaustive numerical searches, our method leverages GA-driven
mutations for search-space exploration and an RL-inspired state transition
mechanism to refine heuristic selection dynamically. This enables systematic
parameter reduction, preserving fourth-order accuracy while significantly
improving computational efficiency.The proposed GA-RL heuristic optimisation
framework is validated through rigorous testing on benchmark problems,
including the 1D and 2D Brusselator systems and the steady-state Navier-Stokes
equations. The best-performing heuristic achieves a 25\% reduction in IPOPT
runtime compared to traditional ESRK optimisation processes while maintaining
numerical stability and accuracy. These findings demonstrate the potential of
adaptive heuristic discovery to improve resource efficiency in high-fidelity
simulations and broaden the applicability of low-storage Runge-Kutta methods in
real-world computational fluid dynamics, physics simulations, and other
demanding fields. This work establishes a new paradigm in heuristic

TL;DR: The paper addresses low cancer screening rates in Telangana by proposing an ML model to predict susceptibility to breast and cervical cancer, coupled with a system to locate nearby hospitals and conduct awareness campaigns.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Low awareness and screening rates for cervical and breast cancer in Telangana, despite early detection being crucial for reducing morbidity and mortality.

Method: Developed ML classification models using decision tree and support vector classifiers to predict cancer susceptibility based on demographic data. Also created a system to suggest hospitals and integrate health records.

Result: Implemented classifiers for predicting cancer susceptibility and designed a framework to improve healthcare access and awareness among the population.

Conclusion: The solution enhances cancer literacy, offers practical tools for early detection, and contributes to lowering cancer mortality in Telangana.

Abstract: According to the data, the percent of women who underwent screening for
cervical cancer, breast and oral cancer in Telangana in the year 2020 was 3.3
percent, 0.3 percent and 2.3 percent respectively. Although early detection is
the only way to reduce morbidity and mortality, people have very low awareness
about cervical and breast cancer signs and symptoms and screening practices. We
developed an ML classification model to predict if a person is susceptible to
breast or cervical cancer based on demographic factors. We devised a system to
provide suggestions for the nearest hospital or Cancer treatment centres based
on the users location or address. In addition to this, we can integrate the
health card to maintain medical records of all individuals and conduct
awareness drives and campaigns. For ML classification models, we used decision
tree classification and support vector classification algorithms for cervical
cancer susceptibility and breast cancer susceptibility respectively. Thus, by
devising this solution we come one step closer to our goal which is spreading
cancer awareness, thereby, decreasing the cancer mortality and increasing
cancer literacy among the people of Telangana.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper presents an unsupervised fault diagnosis methodology that leverages anomaly detection, process mining, and stochastic simulations for analyzing faults in Cyber-Physical Systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fault diagnosis in CPSs is crucial for system reliability and efficiency, but traditional manual approaches are resource-intensive and often result in complex, error-prone models.

Method: The approach involves detecting collective anomalies in multivariate time-series data, converting them into structured event logs, and discovering interpretable process models through process mining with timing distributions added for stochastic simulation.

Result: The methodology's validation on the Robotic Arm Dataset demonstrates its effectiveness in modeling, simulating, and classifying faults, enabling predictive maintenance and digital twin development.

Conclusion: The proposed method simplifies fault diagnosis in CPSs, facilitates better understanding of faulty behaviors, and supports industrial applications like predictive maintenance and digital twins.

Abstract: Fault diagnosis in Cyber-Physical Systems (CPSs) is essential for ensuring
system dependability and operational efficiency by accurately detecting
anomalies and identifying their root causes. However, the manual modeling of
faulty behaviors often demands extensive domain expertise and produces models
that are complex, error-prone, and difficult to interpret. To address this
challenge, we present a novel unsupervised fault diagnosis methodology that
integrates collective anomaly detection in multivariate time series, process
mining, and stochastic simulation. Initially, collective anomalies are detected
from low-level sensor data using multivariate time-series analysis. These
anomalies are then transformed into structured event logs, enabling the
discovery of interpretable process models through process mining. By
incorporating timing distributions into the extracted Petri nets, the approach
supports stochastic simulation of faulty behaviors, thereby enhancing root
cause analysis and behavioral understanding. The methodology is validated using
the Robotic Arm Dataset (RoAD), a widely recognized benchmark in smart
manufacturing. Experimental results demonstrate its effectiveness in modeling,
simulating, and classifying faulty behaviors in CPSs. This enables the creation
of comprehensive fault dictionaries that support predictive maintenance and the
development of digital twins for industrial environments.

Method: The paper introduces mTSBench, a benchmark featuring 344 labeled time series from 19 datasets and evaluates 24 anomaly detection methods, including LLM-based ones, under standardized conditions.

Result: The study confirms that no single detector is universally effective, emphasizing the need for model selection, while exposing significant gaps in state-of-the-art selection methods.

Conclusion: mTSBench aims to advance adaptive anomaly detection and model selection by offering a unified platform for rigorous and reproducible research.

Abstract: Multivariate time series anomaly detection (MTS-AD) is critical in domains
like healthcare, cybersecurity, and industrial monitoring, yet remains
challenging due to complex inter-variable dependencies, temporal dynamics, and
sparse anomaly labels. We introduce mTSBench, the largest benchmark to date for
MTS-AD and unsupervised model selection, spanning 344 labeled time series
across 19 datasets and 12 diverse application domains. mTSBench evaluates 24

for multivariate time series, and systematically benchmarks unsupervised model
selection techniques under standardized conditions. Consistent with prior
findings, our results confirm that no single detector excels across datasets,
underscoring the importance of model selection. However, even state-of-the-art

### [256] [Where to find Grokking in LLM Pretraining? Monitor Memorization-to-Generalization without Test](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21551)
*Ziyue Li,Chenrui Fan,Tianyi Zhou*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper studies grokking—delayed generalization—in neural networks during large language model (LLM) pretraining, revealing gradual shifts from memorization to structured generalization and presenting new metrics to monitor performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand delayed generalization (grokking) in the training of large-scale neural networks, especially during one-pass pretraining, and its implications for reasoning and emerging capabilities.

Method: The authors analyze grokking in a 7B LLM (OLMoE) using diverse tasks (e.g., math reasoning, code generation). They introduce two novel metrics to measure pathway structure and complexity and examine model behavior during pretraining.

Result: Grokking was observed in LLM pretraining with asynchronous data entry. Pathway structure became more shared and less complex, showcasing a memorization-to-generalization transition. The metrics predicted generalization improvement effectively across tasks.

Conclusion: The study provides empirical and theoretical insights into grokking mechanisms, demonstrating the practical utility of their metrics for monitoring generalization during pretraining without fine-tuning or testing.

Abstract: Grokking, i.e., test performance keeps improving long after training loss
converged, has been recently witnessed in neural network training, making the
mechanism of generalization and other emerging capabilities such as reasoning
mysterious. While prior studies usually train small models on a few toy or
highly-specific tasks for thousands of epochs, we conduct the first study of
grokking on checkpoints during one-pass pretraining of a 7B large language
model (LLM), i.e., OLMoE. We compute the training loss and evaluate
generalization on diverse benchmark tasks, including math reasoning, code
generation, and commonsense/domain-specific knowledge retrieval tasks.
  Our study, for the first time, verifies that grokking still happens in the
pretraining of large-scale foundation models, though different data may enter
grokking stages asynchronously. We further demystify grokking's "emergence of
generalization" by investigating LLM internal dynamics. Specifically, we find
that training samples' pathways (i.e., expert choices across layers) evolve
from random, instance-specific to more structured and shareable between samples
during grokking. Also, the complexity of a sample's pathway reduces despite the
converged loss. These indicate a memorization-to-generalization conversion,
providing a mechanistic explanation of delayed generalization. In the study, we
develop two novel metrics to quantify pathway distance and the complexity of a
single pathway. We show their ability to predict the generalization improvement
on diverse downstream tasks. They are efficient, simple to compute and solely
dependent on training data. Hence, they have practical value for pretraining,
enabling us to monitor the generalization performance without finetuning and
test. Theoretically, we show that more structured pathways reduce model
complexity and improve the generalization bound.

TL;DR: The paper introduces the first theoretical framework applying spiking neural networks (SNNs) to SAR interferometric phase unwrapping, focusing on energy-efficient large-scale data processing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address the growing data volumes in Earth observation, which require energy-efficient strategies for sustainable data center operations. They identify a gap where spiking neural networks have not been applied to phase unwrapping in SAR interferometry.

Method: The paper develops spike encoding schemes tailored for wrapped phase data, designs SNN architectures exploiting spatial propagation characteristics, and provides theoretical analyses on computational complexity and convergence properties.

Result: Their framework demonstrates that SNNs can naturally model spatial continuity constraints in phase unwrapping, while achieving potential energy savings of 30-100x compared to conventional methods.

Conclusion: This research pioneers a nexus between neuromorphic computing and SAR interferometry, suggesting SNNs as a sustainable and complementary alternative for large-scale InSAR processing.

Abstract: We present the first theoretical framework for applying spiking neural
networks (SNNs) to synthetic aperture radar (SAR) interferometric phase
unwrapping. Despite extensive research in both domains, our comprehensive
literature review confirms that SNNs have never been applied to phase
unwrapping, representing a significant gap in current methodologies. As Earth
observation data volumes continue to grow exponentially (with missions like
NISAR expected to generate 100PB in two years) energy-efficient processing
becomes critical for sustainable data center operations. SNNs, with their
event-driven computation model, offer potential energy savings of 30-100x
compared to conventional approaches while maintaining comparable accuracy. We
develop spike encoding schemes specifically designed for wrapped phase data,
propose SNN architectures that leverage the spatial propagation nature of phase
unwrapping, and provide theoretical analysis of computational complexity and
convergence properties. Our framework demonstrates how the temporal dynamics
inherent in SNNs can naturally model the spatial continuity constraints
fundamental to phase unwrapping. This work opens a new research direction at
the intersection of neuromorphic computing and SAR interferometry, offering a
complementary approach to existing algorithms that could enable more
sustainable large-scale InSAR processing.

TL;DR: The study presents Brain2Model Transfer Learning (B2M), leveraging neural activity from human cognitive tasks to improve artificial model learning efficiency, leading to faster convergence and higher accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Humans excel at creating efficient, low-dimensional sensorimotor representations compared to artificial models. This motivates exploration into leveraging brain-derived representations for improving artificial network training.

Method: The authors introduce two strategies: (1) Brain Contrastive Transfer, aligning brain activity with neural network activations; and (2) Brain Latent Transfer, mapping brain-extracted features to artificial networks using supervised regression.

Result: Using tasks like memory-based decision-making and scene reconstruction, networks trained with B2M converged faster and achieved higher predictive accuracy compared to isolated training.

Conclusion: Brain-derived representations offer significant value for artificial learners, enabling cost-efficient and faster learning for complex decision-making tasks.

Abstract: Transfer learning enhances the training of novel sensory and decision models
by employing rich feature representations from large, pre-trained teacher
models. Cognitive neuroscience shows that the human brain creates
low-dimensional, abstract representations for efficient sensorimotor coding.
Importantly, the brain can learn these representations with significantly fewer
data points and less computational power than artificial models require. We
introduce Brain2Model Transfer Learning (B2M), a framework where neural
activity from human sensory and decision-making tasks acts as the teacher model
for training artificial neural networks. We propose two B2M strategies: (1)
Brain Contrastive Transfer, which aligns brain activity and network activations
through a contrastive objective; and (2) Brain Latent Transfer, which projects
latent dynamics from similar cognitive tasks onto student networks via
supervised regression of brain-derived features. We validate B2M in
memory-based decision-making with a recurrent neural network and scene
reconstruction for autonomous driving with a variational autoencoder. The
results show that student networks benefiting from brain-based transfer
converge faster and achieve higher predictive accuracy than networks trained in
isolation. Our findings indicate that the brain's representations are valuable
for artificial learners, paving the way for more efficient learning of complex
decision-making representations, which would be costly or slow through purely
artificial training.

TL;DR: This paper introduces a novel stochastic quantum spiking (SQS) neuron model combining quantum computing and neuromorphic computing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the limitations of existing quantum spiking neuron models, such as reliance on classical memory and global backpropagation for training.

Method: The authors propose the SQS neuron, a model using multi-qubit quantum circuits for spike generation, and introduce a local learning rule for training SQS neural networks.

Result: The SQS neuron enables event-driven spiking with internal quantum memory, and SQSNNs can perform scalable, modular computation with hardware-friendly training techniques.

Conclusion: The SQSNN model merges the benefits of neuromorphic and quantum computing, offering an innovative route for scalable and trainable quantum spiking neural networks.

Abstract: Neuromorphic and quantum computing have recently emerged as promising
paradigms for advancing artificial intelligence, each offering complementary
strengths. Neuromorphic systems built on spiking neurons excel at processing
time-series data efficiently through sparse, event-driven computation,
consuming energy only upon input events. Quantum computing, on the other hand,
leverages superposition and entanglement to explore feature spaces that are
exponentially large in the number of qubits. Hybrid approaches combining these
paradigms have begun to show potential, but existing quantum spiking models
have important limitations. Notably, prior quantum spiking neuron
implementations rely on classical memory mechanisms on single qubits, requiring
repeated measurements to estimate firing probabilities, and they use
conventional backpropagation on classical simulators for training. Here we
propose a stochastic quantum spiking (SQS) neuron model that addresses these
challenges. The SQS neuron uses multi-qubit quantum circuits to realize a
spiking unit with internal quantum memory, enabling event-driven probabilistic
spike generation in a single shot. Furthermore, we outline how networks of SQS
neurons -- dubbed SQS neural networks (SQSNNs) -- can be trained via a
hardware-friendly local learning rule, eliminating the need for global
classical backpropagation. The proposed SQSNN model fuses the time-series
efficiency of neuromorphic computing with the exponentially large inner state
space of quantum computing, paving the way for quantum spiking neural networks
that are modular, scalable, and trainable on quantum hardware.

Abstract: The concurrent optimization of language models and instructional prompts
presents a significant challenge for deploying efficient and effective AI
systems, particularly when balancing performance against computational costs
like token usage. This paper introduces and assesses a bi-objective
evolutionary search engine designed to navigate this complex space, focusing
specifically on Small Language Models (SLMs). We employ the NSGA-II algorithm
and prompt grammar to simultaneously optimize for task accuracy and token
efficiency across some reasoning tasks. Our results successfully identify
diverse, high-performing model-prompt combinations, quantitatively revealing
the critical trade-off between the two objectives. This research highlights
task-specific affinities between particular SLMs and prompt structures (e.g.,
instructions, context, chain of thought). The generated practical Pareto fronts
offer decision-makers a portfolio of optimized solutions adaptable to their
specific constraints. This automated approach moves beyond traditional manual
tuning, providing a foundational framework for discovering effective human-AI
interaction patterns.

Conclusion: The proposed framework proves effective in addressing robotic catching challenges by reducing impact stresses and facilitating smooth energy dissipation, showcasing robustness and adaptability in multiple dimensions.

Abstract: Robotic catching of flying objects typically generates high impact forces
that might lead to task failure and potential hardware damages. This is
accentuated when the object mass to robot payload ratio increases, given the
strong inertial components characterizing this task. This paper aims to address
this problem by proposing an implicitly impact-aware framework that
accomplishes the catching task in both pre- and post-catching phases. In the
first phase, a motion planner generates optimal trajectories that minimize
catching forces, while in the second, the object's energy is dissipated
smoothly, minimizing bouncing. In particular, in the pre-catching phase, a
real-time optimal planner is responsible for generating trajectories of the
end-effector that minimize the velocity difference between the robot and the
object to reduce impact forces during catching. In the post-catching phase, the
robot's position, velocity, and stiffness trajectories are generated based on
human demonstrations when catching a series of free-falling objects with
unknown masses. A hierarchical quadratic programming-based controller is used
to enforce the robot's constraints (i.e., joint and torque limits) and create a
stack of tasks that minimizes the reflected mass at the end-effector as a
secondary objective. The initial experiments isolate the problem along one
dimension to accurately study the effects of each contribution on the metrics
proposed. We show how the same task, without velocity matching, would be
infeasible due to excessive joint torques resulting from the impact. The
addition of reflected mass minimization is then investigated, and the catching
height is increased to evaluate the method's robustness. Finally, the setup is
extended to catching along multiple Cartesian axes, to prove its generalization
in space.

*Alexandre Girard,Steven A. Parkison,Philippe Hamelin*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces an estimation method that leverages LiDAR data to localize drones relative to power line conductors accurately, even when faced with noisy or incomplete data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to simplify and improve the drone-based inspection of energized overhead power lines, addressing challenges such as minimal LiDAR data from narrow conductors and distinguishing between conductors and environmental objects.

Method: The method involves a LiDAR-based estimation approach that minimizes errors against a geometric model representing the entire conductor array instead of tracking each conductor separately.

Result: The approach achieved accurate localization, with a solver runtime under 50 ms per frame, and demonstrated resilience to partial observations, noise, and up to twice as many outlier points as valid measurements.

Conclusion: The proposed method offers a robust and efficient solution for drone localization during power line inspection, overcoming significant challenges posed by noisy and sparse LiDAR data.

Abstract: Drones can inspect overhead power lines while they remain energized,
significantly simplifying the inspection process. However, localizing a drone
relative to all conductors using an onboard LiDAR sensor presents several
challenges: (1) conductors provide minimal surface for LiDAR beams limiting the
number of conductor points in a scan, (2) not all conductors are consistently
detected, and (3) distinguishing LiDAR points corresponding to conductors from
other objects, such as trees and pylons, is difficult. This paper proposes an
estimation approach that minimizes the error between LiDAR measurements and a
single geometric model representing the entire conductor array, rather than
tracking individual conductors separately. Experimental results, using data
from a power line drone inspection, demonstrate that this method achieves
accurate tracking, with a solver converging under 50 ms per frame, even in the
presence of partial observations, noise, and outliers. A sensitivity analysis
shows that the estimation approach can tolerate up to twice as many outlier
points as valid conductors measurements.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable multi-drone systems to track moving targets autonomously in challenging, real-world scenarios without dependence on external localization systems.

Result: The framework demonstrated efficient circumnavigation of moving targets in experiments, including scenarios with occlusion and quadrotor failure.

Conclusion: The framework shows robustness and fault tolerance, making it suitable for applications like search-and-rescue operations in complex environments.

Abstract: A cooperative circumnavigation framework is proposed for multi-quadrotor
systems to enclose and track a moving target without reliance on external
localization systems. The distinct relationships between quadrotor-quadrotor
and quadrotor-target interactions are evaluated using a heterogeneous
perception strategy and corresponding state estimation algorithms. A modified
Kalman filter is developed to fuse visual-inertial odometry with range
measurements to enhance the accuracy of inter-quadrotor relative localization.
An event-triggered distributed Kalman filter is designed to achieve robust
target state estimation under visual occlusion by incorporating neighbor
measurements and estimated inter-quadrotor relative positions. Using the
estimation results, a cooperative circumnavigation controller is constructed,
leveraging an oscillator-based autonomous formation flight strategy. We conduct
extensive indoor and outdoor experiments to validate the efficiency of the
proposed circumnavigation framework in occluded environments. Furthermore, a
quadrotor failure experiment highlights the inherent fault tolerance property
of the proposed framework, underscoring its potential for deployment in
search-and-rescue operations.

Conclusion: It presents a conceptual framework for improving VLA model training and development, offering insights aligned with human motor learning to drive future research.

Abstract: Vision-language-action (VLA) models extend vision-language models (VLM) by
integrating action generation modules for robotic manipulation. Leveraging
strengths of VLM in vision perception and instruction understanding, VLA models
exhibit promising generalization across diverse manipulation tasks. However,
applications demanding high precision and accuracy reveal performance gaps
without further adaptation. Evidence from multiple domains highlights the
critical role of post-training to align foundational models with downstream
applications, spurring extensive research on post-training VLA models. VLA
model post-training aims to address the challenge of improving an embodiment's
ability to interact with the environment for the given tasks, analogous to the
process of humans motor skills acquisition. Accordingly, this paper reviews
post-training strategies for VLA models through the lens of human motor
learning, focusing on three dimensions: environments, embodiments, and tasks. A
structured taxonomy is introduced aligned with human learning mechanisms: (1)
enhancing environmental perception, (2) improving embodiment awareness, (3)
deepening task comprehension, and (4) multi-component integration. Finally, key
challenges and trends in post-training VLA models are identified, establishing
a conceptual framework to guide future research. This work delivers both a
comprehensive overview of current VLA model post-training methods from a human

TL;DR: The paper proposes augmenting existing driving robotics datasets with synthetic thermal camera imagery using conditional diffusion models to address the lack of thermal data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Autonomous systems struggle with sensing in degraded environments, and while thermal cameras offer a solution, there is limited thermal data available for robotics tasks.

Method: The authors use conditional diffusion models and self-attention mechanisms to convert RGB images into synthetic thermal images.

Result: The model generates thermal imagery by learning the heat signature of real-world objects, enabling dataset augmentation.

Conclusion: Augmenting robotics datasets with synthetic thermal data will promote the adaptation of thermal cameras in autonomous systems, improving performance in nighttime or degraded conditions.

Abstract: Autonomous systems rely on sensors to estimate the environment around them.
However, cameras, LiDARs, and RADARs have their own limitations. In nighttime
or degraded environments such as fog, mist, or dust, thermal cameras can
provide valuable information regarding the presence of objects of interest due
to their heat signature. They make it easy to identify humans and vehicles that
are usually at higher temperatures compared to their surroundings. In this
paper, we focus on the adaptation of thermal cameras for robotics and
automation, where the biggest hurdle is the lack of data. Several multi-modal
datasets are available for driving robotics research in tasks such as scene
segmentation, object detection, and depth estimation, which are the cornerstone
of autonomous systems. However, they are found to be lacking in thermal
imagery. Our paper proposes a solution to augment these datasets with synthetic
thermal data to enable widespread and rapid adaptation of thermal cameras. We
explore the use of conditional diffusion models to convert existing RGB images
to thermal images using self-attention to learn the thermal properties of
real-world objects.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces the STEP framework for robots to tackle long-horizon tasks with better success rates by breaking tasks into manageable subgoal hierarchies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the limitations of Large Language Models in reasoning for long-horizon embodied tasks, to improve real-world robot task completion.

Method: The method involves constructing a hierarchical subgoal tree through coupled models: a decomposition model to break down tasks and a termination model that decides when a subgoal is complete, with real-time environmental feedback.

Result: STEP improved success rates on VirtualHome WAH-NL benchmarks by up to 34% and on real robots by 25%, surpassing state-of-the-art approaches.

Conclusion: STEP provides a novel and more reliable hierarchical planning framework, making robots more effective in completing long-horizon tasks in diverse environments.

Abstract: The ability to perform reliable long-horizon task planning is crucial for
deploying robots in real-world environments. However, directly employing Large
Language Models (LLMs) as action sequence generators often results in low
success rates due to their limited reasoning ability for long-horizon embodied
tasks. In the STEP framework, we construct a subgoal tree through a pair of
closed-loop models: a subgoal decomposition model and a leaf node termination
model. Within this framework, we develop a hierarchical tree structure that
spans from coarse to fine resolutions. The subgoal decomposition model
leverages a foundation LLM to break down complex goals into manageable
subgoals, thereby spanning the subgoal tree. The leaf node termination model
provides real-time feedback based on environmental states, determining when to
terminate the tree spanning and ensuring each leaf node can be directly
converted into a primitive action. Experiments conducted in both the
VirtualHome WAH-NL benchmark and on real robots demonstrate that STEP achieves
long-horizon embodied task completion with success rates up to 34% (WAH-NL) and
25% (real robot) outperforming SOTA methods.

Result: Experimental results show V2X-REALM's superior performance in robustness, semantic reasoning, safety, and planning accuracy under visually complex driving conditions.

Conclusion: The framework significantly contributes to robust and scalable cooperative autonomous driving under rare, visually degraded scenarios, advancing the field of end-to-end autonomy.

Abstract: Ensuring robust planning and decision-making under rare, diverse, and
visually degraded long-tail scenarios remains a fundamental challenge for
autonomous driving in urban environments. This issue becomes more critical in
cooperative settings, where vehicles and infrastructure jointly perceive and
reason across complex environments. To address this challenge, we propose
V2X-REALM, a vision-language model (VLM)-based framework with adaptive
multimodal learning for robust cooperative autonomous driving under long-tail
scenarios. V2X-REALM introduces three core innovations: (i) a prompt-driven
long-tail scenario generation and evaluation pipeline that leverages foundation
models to synthesize realistic long-tail conditions such as snow and fog across
vehicle- and infrastructure-side views, enriching training diversity
efficiently; (ii) a gated multi-scenario adaptive attention module that
modulates the visual stream using scenario priors to recalibrate ambiguous or
corrupted features; and (iii) a multi-task scenario-aware contrastive learning
objective that improves multimodal alignment and promotes cross-scenario
feature separability. Extensive experiments demonstrate that V2X-REALM
significantly outperforms existing baselines in robustness, semantic reasoning,
safety, and planning accuracy under complex, challenging driving conditions,

Conclusion: CURL-SLAM provides a robust and efficient solution for LiDAR mapping challenges, ensuring continuity, compactness, and consistency. The implementation will be shared with the community for further advancements.

Abstract: This paper studies 3D LiDAR mapping with a focus on developing an updatable
and localizable map representation that enables continuity, compactness and
consistency in 3D maps. Traditional LiDAR Simultaneous Localization and Mapping
(SLAM) systems often rely on 3D point cloud maps, which typically require

In this paper, we propose a novel paradigm for LiDAR SLAM by leveraging the

Our proposed LiDAR mapping approach, CURL-SLAM, produces compact 3D maps
capable of continuous reconstruction at variable densities using CURL's
spherical harmonics implicit encoding, and achieves global map consistency
after loop closure. Unlike popular Iterative Closest Point (ICP)-based LiDAR
odometry techniques, CURL-SLAM formulates LiDAR pose estimation as a unique
optimization problem tailored for CURL and extends it to local Bundle
Adjustment (BA), enabling simultaneous pose refinement and map correction.
Experimental results demonstrate that CURL-SLAM achieves state-of-the-art 3D

TL;DR: This paper proposes a motion planner (DRA-MPPI) for mobile robots to address safety concerns of navigating among humans by accounting for uncertain and complex trajectory predictions in real-time.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To ensure safe navigation of mobile robots among humans by addressing challenges related to uncertainty and complexity of predicted motions of other agents.

Method: DRA-MPPI combines the gradient-free MPPI approach with Monte Carlo methods to approximate joint Collision Probability (CP) for sampled trajectories. This enables consideration of CP within a navigation cost function or rejection of unsafe samples.

Result: The proposed method outperforms existing approaches such as S-MPC, Frenet planner, and vanilla MPPI in both simulated and real-world experiments with dynamic obstacles.

Conclusion: DRA-MPPI enhances robot safety and efficiency by integrating risk-aware motion planning and solves significant challenges, such as the freezing robot problem, in dynamic human-robot environments.

Abstract: Deploying mobile robots safely among humans requires the motion planner to
account for the uncertainty in the other agents' predicted trajectories. This
remains challenging in traditional approaches, especially with arbitrarily
shaped predictions and real-time constraints. To address these challenges, we
propose a Dynamic Risk-Aware Model Predictive Path Integral control (DRA-MPPI),
a motion planner that incorporates uncertain future motions modelled with
potentially non-Gaussian stochastic predictions. By leveraging MPPI's
gradient-free nature, we propose a method that efficiently approximates the
joint Collision Probability (CP) among multiple dynamic obstacles for several
hundred sampled trajectories in real-time via a Monte Carlo (MC) approach. This
enables the rejection of samples exceeding a predefined CP threshold or the
integration of CP as a weighted objective within the navigation cost function.
Consequently, DRA-MPPI mitigates the freezing robot problem while enhancing
safety. Real-world and simulated experiments with multiple dynamic obstacles
demonstrate DRA-MPPI's superior performance compared to state-of-the-art
approaches, including Scenario-based Model Predictive Control (S-MPC), Frenet

Abstract: This paper introduces ACTLLM (Action Consistency Tuned Large Language Model),
a novel approach for robot manipulation in dynamic environments. Traditional
vision-based systems often struggle to learn visual representations that excel
in both task execution and spatial reasoning, thereby limiting their
adaptability in dynamic environments. ACTLLM addresses these challenges by
harnessing language to craft structured scene descriptors, providing a uniform
interface for both spatial understanding and task performance through flexible
language instructions. Moreover, we introduce a novel action consistency
constraint that aligns visual perception with corresponding actions, thereby
enhancing the learning of actionable visual representations. Additionally, we
have reformulated the Markov decision process for manipulation tasks into a

Method: The paper develops and implements an ADRC-based trajectory tracking controller on the DUS V2500. Validation involves simulations including realistic disturbances, followed by field tests in harbor and open sea.

Result: Simulation and field trials show ADRC reduces cross-track error effectively compared to a PID controller but increases energy consumption and control effort.

Conclusion: The proposed ADRC controller improves USV tracking performance under disturbances but comes at the cost of higher energy and control efforts, validated in both simulations and field tests.

Abstract: Unmanned Surface Vessels (USVs) face significant control challenges due to

realistic waves and current disturbances is developed to validate the
controller's performance, supported by further validation through field tests
in the harbour of Scheveningen, the Netherlands, and at sea. Simulation results
demonstrate that ADRC significantly reduces cross-track error across all tested

and energy consumption. Field trials confirm these findings while revealing a
further increase in energy consumption during sea trials compared to the

Result: The system was experimentally validated on simulated rough surfaces, demonstrating robust real-time roughness characterization and improving safety by integrating a Simplex control strategy.

Conclusion: The proposed framework successfully enhances safety and risk management for autonomous vehicles on rough terrain, providing a foundation for addressing roughness-related risks and boosting efficiency.

Abstract: This research addresses critical autonomous vehicle control challenges
arising from road roughness variation, which induces course deviations and
potential loss of road contact during steering operations. We present a novel
real-time road roughness estimation system employing Bayesian calibration
methodology that processes axle accelerations to predict terrain roughness with
quantifiable confidence measures. The technical framework integrates a Gaussian

processing vehicle velocity and road surface roughness parameters to generate
corresponding axle acceleration responses. The Bayesian calibration routine
performs inverse estimation of road roughness from observed accelerations and
velocities, yielding posterior distributions that quantify prediction
uncertainty for adaptive risk management. Training data generation utilizes
Latin Hypercube sampling across comprehensive velocity and roughness parameter
spaces, while the calibrated model integrates seamlessly with a Simplex
controller architecture to dynamically adjust velocity limits based on
real-time roughness predictions. Experimental validation on stochastically
generated surfaces featuring varying roughness regions demonstrates robust
real-time characterization capabilities, with the integrated Simplex control
strategy effectively enhancing autonomous vehicle operational safety through
proactive surface condition response. This innovative Bayesian framework
establishes a comprehensive foundation for mitigating roughness-related
operational risks while simultaneously improving efficiency and safety margins

*Jun Cen,Chaohui Yu,Hangjie Yuan,Yuming Jiang,Siteng Huang,Jiayan Guo,Xin Li,Yibing Song,Hao Luo,Fan Wang,Deli Zhao,Hao Chen*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: WorldVLA, an integrated action-world model unifying vision, language, and action understanding, demonstrates superior performance and mutual enhancement compared to standalone models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Integrate action, image, and language understanding within a unified framework to improve predictive capability and action generation.

Method: WorldVLA combines Vision-Language-Action (VLA) and world models to predict future images and generate subsequent actions, employing an attention mask strategy to mitigate error propagation.

Result: WorldVLA outperformed standalone models and showed improvement in action chunk generation due to masking strategies.

Conclusion: WorldVLA effectively improves the synergy between action generation and environmental prediction, but error propagation remains a challenge in autoregressive sequences.

Abstract: We present WorldVLA, an autoregressive action world model that unifies action
and image understanding and generation. Our WorldVLA intergrates
Vision-Language-Action (VLA) model and world model in one single framework. The
world model predicts future images by leveraging both action and image
understanding, with the purpose of learning the underlying physics of the
environment to improve action generation. Meanwhile, the action model generates
the subsequent actions based on image observations, aiding in visual
understanding and in turn helps visual generation of the world model. We
demonstrate that WorldVLA outperforms standalone action and world models,
highlighting the mutual enhancement between the world model and the action
model. In addition, we find that the performance of the action model
deteriorates when generating sequences of actions in an autoregressive manner.
This phenomenon can be attributed to the model's limited generalization
capability for action prediction, leading to the propagation of errors from
earlier actions to subsequent ones. To address this issue, we propose an
attention mask strategy that selectively masks prior actions during the
generation of the current action, which shows significant performance
improvement in the action chunk generation task.

Model. The main challenge identified across studies was accurate effort
estimation for ML-related tasks. [Conclusion] This study contributes by mapping
the state of the art and identifying open gaps in the field. While relevant
work exists, more robust empirical evaluation is still needed to validate these
contributions.

*Srikar Reddy Gadusu,Larry Callahan,Samir Lababidi,Arunasri Nishtala,Sophia Healey,Hande McGinty*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper addresses challenges in integrating Neo4j databases with OWL and presents a Python-based method for streamlined ontology generation based on FDA adverse drug event data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The growing need for systematic ontology generation methods arises from rapid data expansion, frequent content changes, and the urgent demand for effective storage and retrieval solutions for knowledge graphs.

Method: A novel Python-based approach using the rdflib library is introduced to automate the creation of ontological classes and axioms, facilitating integration of Neo4j databases with OWL.

Result: Integration was demonstrated using the FDA FAERS database, where the Python script successfully generated ontology classes and axioms automatically, overcoming the need for familiarity with description logics syntax.

Conclusion: This user-friendly method simplifies ontology generation for adverse drug event data, enhancing drug safety monitoring and public health decision-making.

Abstract: As data and knowledge expand rapidly, adopting systematic methodologies for
ontology generation has become crucial. With the daily increases in data
volumes and frequent content changes, the demand for databases to store and
retrieve information for the creation of knowledge graphs has become
increasingly urgent. The previously established Knowledge Acquisition and
Representation Methodology (KNARM) outlines a systematic approach to address
these challenges and create knowledge graphs. However, following this
methodology highlights the existing challenge of seamlessly integrating Neo4j
databases with the Web Ontology Language (OWL). Previous attempts to integrate
data from Neo4j into an ontology have been discussed, but these approaches
often require an understanding of description logics (DL) syntax, which may not
be familiar to many users. Thus, a more accessible method is necessary to
bridge this gap. This paper presents a user-friendly approach that utilizes
Python and its rdflib library to support ontology development. We showcase our
novel approach through a Neo4j database we created by integrating data from the
Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS)
database. Using this dataset, we developed a Python script that automatically
generates the required classes and their axioms, facilitating a smoother
integration process. This approach offers a practical solution to the
challenges of ontology generation in the context of rapidly growing adverse
drug event datasets, supporting improved drug safety monitoring and public
health decision-making.

TL;DR: This paper discusses the development and evaluation of five domain-specific Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems for real-world applications, highlighting their implementation challenges and lessons learned.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RAG systems can enhance the factual accuracy and contextual relevance of Large Language Models by grounding them in external knowledge. However, there is a scarcity of empirical research on real-world implementations, user evaluations, and systematic documentation.

Method: The authors developed five RAG applications tailored to areas like governance and medical diagnostics. These systems use multilingual OCR, semantic retrieval via vector embeddings, and domain-adapted LLMs, assessed by 100 participants across six metrics.

Result: The evaluations by users provided insights into the systems' effectiveness across dimensions such as ease of use, relevance, and accuracy. Additionally, twelve lessons were identified that address various challenges encountered.

Conclusion: RAG systems hold significant potential for domain-specific applications, but their deployment involves technical, operational, and ethical challenges that must be addressed to enhance reliability and usability.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems are emerging as a key approach
for grounding Large Language Models (LLMs) in external knowledge, addressing
limitations in factual accuracy and contextual relevance. However, there is a
lack of empirical studies that report on the development of RAG-based
implementations grounded in real-world use cases, evaluated through general
user involvement, and accompanied by systematic documentation of lessons
learned. This paper presents five domain-specific RAG applications developed
for real-world scenarios across governance, cybersecurity, agriculture,
industrial research, and medical diagnostics. Each system incorporates
multilingual OCR, semantic retrieval via vector embeddings, and domain-adapted
LLMs, deployed through local servers or cloud APIs to meet distinct user needs.
A web-based evaluation involving a total of 100 participants assessed the
systems across six dimensions: (i) Ease of Use, (ii) Relevance, (iii)
Transparency, (iv) Responsiveness, (v) Accuracy, and (vi) Likelihood of
Recommendation. Based on user feedback and our development experience, we
documented twelve key lessons learned, highlighting technical, operational, and
ethical challenges affecting the reliability and usability of RAG systems in
practice.

### [283] [Complex Model Transformations by Reinforcement Learning with Uncertain Human Guidance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20883)
*Kyanna Dagenais,Istvan David*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper explores the use of reinforcement learning (RL) combined with human guidance to develop complex model transformation (MT) sequences.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manually developing complex model transformations is error-prone and challenging, yet critical for problems like model synchronization and automated model repair.

Method: The authors incorporate human guidance into an RL framework to map user-defined MTs onto RL primitives, enabling the exploration of optimal MT sequences.

Result: The study shows that uncertain human guidance improves RL performance and facilitates efficient development of complex MTs.

Conclusion: The approach balances the certainty and timeliness of human input, advancing RL-driven human-in-the-loop engineering solutions.

Abstract: Model-driven engineering problems often require complex model transformations
(MTs), i.e., MTs that are chained in extensive sequences. Pertinent examples of
such problems include model synchronization, automated model repair, and design
space exploration. Manually developing complex MTs is an error-prone and often
infeasible process. Reinforcement learning (RL) is an apt way to alleviate
these issues. In RL, an autonomous agent explores the state space through trial
and error to identify beneficial sequences of actions, such as MTs. However, RL
methods exhibit performance issues in complex problems. In these situations,
human guidance can be of high utility. In this paper, we present an approach
and technical framework for developing complex MT sequences through RL, guided
by potentially uncertain human advice. Our framework allows user-defined MTs to
be mapped onto RL primitives, and executes them as RL programs to find optimal
MT sequences. Our evaluation shows that human guidance, even if uncertain,
substantially improves RL performance, and results in more efficient
development of complex MTs. Through a trade-off between the certainty and
timeliness of human advice, our method takes a step towards RL-driven
human-in-the-loop engineering methods.

### [284] [Boosting Vulnerability Detection with Inter-function Multilateral Association Insights](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21014)
*Shaojian Qiu,Mengyang Huang,Jiahao Cheng*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper presents IFMA-VD, a deep learning framework leveraging inter-function multilateral associations for improved vulnerability detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods in vulnerability detection fail to consider the complex interrelations among functions, especially multilateral associations, resulting in missed detections.

Method: IFMA-VD constructs a code behavior hypergraph by converting program dependency graphs into hyperedges and uses hypergraph networks to extract multilateral association features for vulnerability detection.

Result: When tested on three datasets, IFMA-VD demonstrated superior F-measure and Recall compared to baseline methods, highlighting its performance in both experimental and real-world settings.

Conclusion: The inclusion of multilateral association features enhances vulnerability detection and code feature representation, making IFMA-VD an effective solution for securing software systems.

Abstract: Vulnerability detection is a crucial yet challenging technique for ensuring
the security of software systems. Currently, most deep learning-based
vulnerability detection methods focus on stand-alone functions, neglecting the
complex inter-function interrelations, particularly the multilateral
associations. This oversight can fail to detect vulnerabilities in these
interrelations. To address this gap, we present an Inter-Function Multilateral
Association analysis framework for Vulnerability Detection (IFMA-VD). The
cornerstone of the IFMA-VD lies in constructing a code behavior hypergraph and
utilizing hyperedge convolution to extract multilateral association features.
Specifically, we first parse functions into a code property graph to generate
intra-function features. Following this, we construct a code behavior
hypergraph by segmenting the program dependency graph to isolate and encode
behavioral features into hyperedges. Finally, we utilize a hypergraph network
to capture the multilateral association knowledge for augmenting vulnerability
detection. We evaluate IFMA-VD on three widely used vulnerability datasets and
demonstrate improvements in F-measure and Recall compared to baseline methods.
Additionally, we illustrate that multilateral association features can boost
code feature representation and validate the effectiveness of IFMA-VD on
real-world datasets.

*Abdelkarim El-Hajjami,Camille Salinesi*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper addresses the scarcity of labeled requirements datasets in AI for Requirements Engineering (AI4RE) by introducing Synthline v1, a system for generating high-quality synthetic requirements datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The lack of publicly available labeled requirements datasets is a major obstacle in advancing AI4RE. The paper seeks to explore methods for improving synthetic data generation to address this data scarcity.

Method: The authors investigate prompting strategies, automated prompt optimization using PACE, and similarity-based post-generation curation, analyzing their effects on data quality across four classification tasks.

Result: Synthline v1 shows significant improvements in synthetic data generation. Multi-sample prompting enhanced both utility and diversity; PACE led to mixed results by significantly improving functional classification but lowering performance for other tasks. Synthetic data outperformed human data in security and defect classification tasks.

Conclusion: Synthetic data can not only match but in some cases outperform human-authored data. The research provides insights and a practical approach to combat dataset scarcity in AI4RE.

Abstract: The shortage of publicly available, labeled requirements datasets remains a
major barrier to advancing Artificial Intelligence for Requirements Engineering
(AI4RE). While Large Language Models offer promising capabilities for synthetic
data generation, systematic approaches to control and optimize the quality of
generated requirements remain underexplored. This paper presents Synthline v1,
an enhanced Product Line approach for generating synthetic requirements data
that extends our earlier v0 version with advanced generation strategies and
curation techniques. We investigate four research questions assessing how
prompting strategies, automated prompt optimization, and post-generation
curation affect data quality across four classification tasks: defect
detection, functional vs. non-functional, quality vs. non-quality, and security
vs. non-security. Our evaluation shows that multi-sample prompting
significantly boosts both utility and diversity over single-sample generation,
with F1-score gains from 6 to 44 points. The use of PACE (Prompt Actor-Critic
Editing) for automated prompt optimization yields task-dependent results,
greatly improving functional classification (+32.5 points) but reducing
performance on others. Interestingly, similarity-based curation improves
diversity but often harms classification performance, indicating that some
redundancy may help ML models. Most importantly, our results show that
synthetic requirements can match or outperform human-authored ones for specific
tasks, with synthetic data surpassing human data for security (+7.8 points) and
defect classification (+15.4 points). These findings offer practical insights
for AI4RE and chart a viable path to mitigating dataset scarcity through
systematic synthetic generation.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper addresses the limitations of Chain-of-Thought (CoT) techniques in Automatic Program Repair (APR) by introducing the $T^3$ framework, which combines Large Language Models (LLMs) and tree search for better repair precision.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance reasoning capabilities in the domain of Automatic Program Repair (APR), addressing gaps in the application of Chain-of-Thought (CoT) techniques due to complex logic and multi-step reasoning requirements.

Method: The study systematically evaluates Chain-of-Thought (CoT) techniques in APR tasks and introduces a new framework, $T^3$, combining the reasoning power of LLMs with tree search.

Result: The proposed $T^3$ framework demonstrates improved precision in generating candidate repair solutions and offers guidance for optimizing sample selection and repair strategies.

Conclusion: The $T^3$ framework lays the foundation for improved and more efficient automated debugging processes in software development by integrating advanced reasoning methods with structured search approaches.

Abstract: Automatic Program Repair (APR) is a core technology in software development
and maintenance, with aims to enable automated defect repair with minimal human
intervention. In recent years, the substantial advancements in Large Language
Models (LLMs) and the Chain-of-Thought (CoT) techniques have significantly
enhanced the reasoning capabilities of these models. However, due to the
complex logic and multi-step reasoning ability needed, the application of CoT
techniques in the APR domain remains insufficient. This study systematically
evaluates the performance of several common CoT techniques in APR tasks and
proposes an innovative framework $T^3$, which integrates the powerful reasoning
capabilities of LLMs with tree search, effectively improving the precision of
generating candidate repair solutions. Furthermore, $T^3$ provides valuable
guidance for optimizing sample selection and repair strategies in APR tasks,
establishing a robust framework for achieving efficient automated debugging.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper introduces KOALA, a tool designed to improve data collection from students solving programming tasks in JetBrains IDEs, addressing limitations in existing tools.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of existing code data collection tools, such as inconsistent granularity and inadequate programming event logging, and to better understand student behavior and misconceptions while coding.

Method: Developed KOALA, a configurable plugin for JetBrains IDEs, that collects code snapshots, IDE actions, hotkeys usage, and file-switching behaviors. Data is sent to a server and converted to the standardized ProgSnap2 format.

Result: KOALA was tested with 28 students across two programming courses, yielding improved data granularity and insights through enhanced data collection.

Conclusion: KOALA provides a more customizable and effective approach to collecting educational programming data, resolving shortcomings of previous tools and aiding both research and teaching.

Abstract: Collecting data of students solving programming tasks is incredibly valuable
for researchers and educators. It allows verifying that the students correctly
apply the features and concepts they are taught, or finding students'
misconceptions. However, existing data collection tools have limitations, e.g.,
no control over the granularity of the collected code, not collecting the
specific events of the programming environment used, and overall being hard to
configure.
  To overcome these limitations, we propose KOALA, a convenient and highly
configurable tool for collecting code snapshots and feature usage from students
solving programming tasks in JetBrains IDEs. The plugin can be installed in
IDEs and configured to provide the students with the necessary tasks, enable or
disable certain IDE features like code completion, and run surveys. During
problem solving, the plugin collects code snapshots at the configured
granularity, all IDE actions like running and debugging, as well as some data
not collected in prior works, like employed hotkeys and switching focus between
files. The collected data is sent to the server that comes with the tool, where
it is stored and can be converted to the standardized ProgSnap2 format. To
showcase the tool, we collected data from 28 students solving tasks in two
courses within the IDE, highlighting some insights from this data.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper examines the micro frontends architecture style, its implementation in a marketplace company, and evaluates its feasibility and benefits.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To determine the optimal conditions and scenarios for adopting micro frontends in industry, based on challenges and benefits.

Method: Investigated academic and gray literature, implemented micro frontends in a real-world marketplace system, and evaluated developer feedback through a questionnaire.

Result: Micro frontends successfully addressed architectural issues but were not mandatory to achieve the company's goals.

Conclusion: Micro frontends were adopted due to contextual factors like monolith strangulation and microservices, leveraging infrastructure and shared knowledge, though alternatives could have worked too.

Abstract: In the micro frontends architectural style, the frontend is divided into
smaller components, which can range from a simple button to an entire page. The
goal is to improve scalability, resilience, and team independence, albeit at
the cost of increased complexity and infrastructure demands. This paper seeks
to understand when it is worth adopting micro frontends, particularly in the
context of industry. To achieve this, we conducted an investigation into the
state of the art of micro frontends, based on both academic and gray
literature. We then implemented this architectural style in a marketplace for
handcrafted products, which already used microservices. Finally, we evaluated
the implementation through a semi-open questionnaire with the developers. At
the studied marketplace company, the need for architectural change arose due to
the tight coupling between their main system (a Java monolith) and a dedicated
frontend system. Additionally, there were deprecated technologies and poor
developer experience. To address these issues, the micro frontends architecture
was adopted, along with the API Gateway and Backend for Frontend patterns, and
technologies such as Svelte and Fastify. Although the adoption of Micro
Frontends was successful, it was not strictly necessary to meet the company's
needs. According to the analysis of the mixed questionnaire responses, other
alternatives, such as a monolithic frontend, could have achieved comparable
results. What made adopting micro frontends the most convenient choice in the
company's context was the monolith strangulation and microservices adoption,
which facilitated implementation through infrastructure reuse and knowledge
sharing between teams.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a core model for integrating IoT and process data to enhance process mining (PM) and facilitate data sharing within the field, evaluated through a Python prototype.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The integration of IoT devices and business processes generates large amounts of data with untapped potential for insights. However, combining IoT and process data is challenging due to differences in characteristics, hampering data sharing and collaboration.

Method: The authors synthesized features from various existing data integration models into a unified, core model. They then implemented a prototypical Python-based system to evaluate its effectiveness against multiple use cases.

Result: The core model was shown to satisfy common requirements for data integration, demonstrating its utility in facilitating data sharing and collaboration in PM.

Conclusion: The proposed core model is an effective solution for integrating IoT and process data, addressing fragmentation in the PM field and improving data exchange, sharing, and analysis.

Abstract: Advances in Internet-of-Things (IoT) technologies have prompted the
integration of IoT devices with business processes (BPs) in many organizations
across various sectors, such as manufacturing, healthcare and smart spaces. The
proliferation of IoT devices leads to the generation of large amounts of IoT
data providing a window on the physical context of BPs, which facilitates the
discovery of new insights about BPs using process mining (PM) techniques.
However, to achieve these benefits, IoT data need to be combined with
traditional process (event) data, which is challenging due to the very
different characteristics of IoT and process data, for instance in terms of
granularity levels. Recently, several data models were proposed to integrate
IoT data with process data, each focusing on different aspects of data
integration based on different assumptions and requirements. This fragmentation
hampers data exchange and collaboration in the field of PM, e.g., making it
tedious for researchers to share data. In this paper, we present a core model
synthesizing the most important features of existing data models. As the core
model is based on common requirements, it greatly facilitates data sharing and
collaboration in the field. A prototypical Python implementation is used to
evaluate the model against various use cases and demonstrate that it satisfies
these common requirements.

### [290] [Predicting Readiness to Engage in Psychotherapy of People with Chronic Pain Based on their Pain-Related Narratives Saar](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20805)
*Saar Draznin Shiran,Boris Boltyansky,Alexandra Zhuravleva,Dmitry Scherbakov,Pavel Goldstein*

Main category: q-bio.NC

TL;DR: This study used natural language processing (NLP) on pain narratives to predict whether chronic pain patients are ready for psychotherapy, with promising accuracy rates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address chronic pain, a condition affecting 20% of the global population, by improving uptake of psychosocial care through identifying patients' readiness for psychotherapy using their narrated pain stories.

Method: 24 chronic pain patients provided spoken pain narratives, which were processed using a pretrained large-language model and analyzed through machine-learning classifiers to determine readiness probabilities.

Result: The study found that the model focusing on pain perception achieved 95.7% accuracy, and the factors-influencing-pain model achieved 83.3% accuracy. Sentence count positively correlated with willingness to begin treatment.

Conclusion: Spoken pain narratives can effectively indicate patients' readiness for psychosocial treatment. Integrating NLP-based screening into clinical practice could streamline patient assignment to proper interventions, advancing a biopsychosocial approach to chronic pain care.

Abstract: Background. Chronic pain afflicts 20 % of the global population. A strictly
biomedical mind-set leaves many sufferers chasing somatic cures and has fuelled
the opioid crisis. The biopsychosocial model recognises pain subjective,
multifactorial nature, yet uptake of psychosocial care remains low. We
hypothesised that patients own pain narratives would predict their readiness to
engage in psychotherapy.
  Methods. In a cross-sectional pilot, 24 chronic-pain patients recorded
narrated pain stories on Painstory.science. Open questions probed perceived
pain source, interference and influencing factors. Narratives were cleaned,
embedded with a pretrained large-language model and entered into
machine-learning classifiers that output ready/not ready probabilities.
  Results. The perception-domain model achieved 95.7 % accuracy (specificity =
0.80, sensitivity = 1.00, AUC = 0.90). The factors-influencing-pain model
yielded 83.3 % accuracy (specificity = 0.60, sensitivity = 0.90, AUC = 0.75).
Sentence count correlated with readiness for perception narratives (r = 0.54, p
< .01) and factor narratives (r = 0.24, p < .05).
  Conclusion. Brief spoken pain narratives carry reliable signals of
willingness to start psychosocial treatment. NLP-based screening could help
clinicians match chronic-pain patients to appropriate interventions sooner,
supporting a patient-centred biopsychosocial pathway.

*Zhiyi Chen,Zhilin Ren,Wei Li,ZhenZhen Huo,ZhuangZheng Wang,Ye Liu,Bowen Hu,Wanting Chen,Ting Xu,Artemiy Leonov,Chenyan Zhang,Bernhard Hommel,Tingyong Feng*

Main category: q-bio.NC

TL;DR: This study shows that stimulating the brain's DLPFC region decreases procrastination by enhancing how people value future rewards.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Procrastination significantly affects both individual health and societal productivity. Existing theories, like the imbalance between avoiding negative tasks and pursuing positive outcomes, lack real-world validation and practical approaches for interventions.

Method: The researchers conducted a double-blind, randomized controlled trial involving chronic procrastinators. Participants received seven sessions of HD-tDCS to their DLPFC, with their procrastination behavior evaluated over short-term (2-day) and long-term (6-month) periods using experience sampling.

Result: The HD-tDCS intervention substantially reduced procrastination in both short-term and long-term assessments. Task aversiveness decreased, and perceived task outcome value increased, but the behavioral improvements were primarily mediated by the increase in task outcome value.

Conclusion: Enhancing DLPFC function reduces procrastination by amplifying the valuation of future rewards rather than merely minimizing negative emotions about tasks. The study establishes a targeted, value-driven neurocognitive mechanism for self-control and provides a validated, theory-based intervention strategy.

Abstract: Procrastination represents one of the most prevalent behavioral problems
affecting individual health and societal productivity. Although it is often
conceptualized as a form of self-control failure, its underlying neurocognitive
mechanisms are poorly understood. A leading model posits that procrastination
arises from imbalanced competing motivations: the avoidance of negative task
aversiveness and the pursuit of positive task outcomes, yet this theoretical
framework has not fully validated in real-world settings and not applied
effectively to guide interventions. Here, we addressed this gap with a
preregistered, double-blind, randomized controlled trial. We applied seven
sessions of high-definition transcranial direct current stimulation (HD-tDCS)
to the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), a key region for
self-control, in chronic procrastinators. Using the intensive experience
sampling method (iESM), we assessed the effect of anodal HD-tDCS on real-world
procrastination behavior at offline after-effect (2-day interval) and long-term
retention (6-month follow-up). We found that this neuromodulation produced a
lasting reduction in real-world procrastination, with effects sustained at a
6-month follow-up. While the intervention both decreased task aversiveness and
increased perceived task outcome value, causal mediation analysis revealed a
striking mechanism: the increase in task outcome value uniquely and
sufficiently mediated the entire behavioral improvement. In conclusion, these
findings provide causal evidence that enhancing DLPFC function mitigates
procrastination by selectively amplifying the valuation of future rewards, not
by simply reducing negative feelings about the task. This establishes a
precise, value-driven neurocognitive pathway for self-control and offers a
validated, theory-driven strategy for intervention.

*Nina Baldy,Marmaduke M Woodman,Viktor K Jirsa*

Main category: q-bio.NC

TL;DR: The paper introduces a method to create personalized virtual brain models while preserving anonymity and enabling resource-efficient clinical inference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The goal is to address challenges in creating personalized virtual brain models, specifically ensuring anonymized training and lightweight inference for clinical use.

Method: Anonymized personalization is introduced, expanding model priors for mechanistic interpretation and supporting amortized inference.

Result: The approach demonstrates reliability with an example, showcasing its feasibility and impact in neuroscience applications.

Conclusion: The method bridges experimental and computational neuroscience with personalized yet anonymized virtual brain modeling, paving the way for practical clinical applications.

Abstract: Virtual brain twins are personalized digital models of individual human
subject or patient's brains, allowing for mechanistic interpretation of
neuroimaging data features. Training and inference with these models however
presents a pair of challenges: large shared infrastructure do not allow for use
of personal data and inference in clinical applications should not require
significant resources. We introduce "anonymized personalization" to address
both by expanding model priors to include personalization which under amortized
inference allows training to be performed anonymously, while inference is both
personalized and lightweight. We illustrate the basic approach, demonstrate
reliability in an example, and discuss the impact on both experimental and
computational neuroscience. Code is available at

Main category: q-bio.NC

TL;DR: The study identifies subthalamic nucleus (STN) activity biomarkers relevant to pain fluctuations in Parkinson's disease (PD) patients using machine learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Explores the under-researched link between pain fluctuations in PD patients and bilateral STN activity.

Method: Data-driven analysis involving STN signal collection, annotated pain reports, and explainable machine learning to predict pain levels and analyze feature influence.

Result: STN activity influences pain prediction, with specific gamma and beta bands (contralateral) and delta and theta bands (ipsilateral) identified as prominent biomarkers.

Conclusion: Bilateral STN biomarkers play an essential role in understanding endogenous pain fluctuations in PD patients.

Abstract: Parkinson disease (PD) patients experience pain fluctuations that
significantly reduce their quality of life. Despite the vast knowledge of the
subthalamic nucleus (STN) role in PD, the STN biomarkers for pain fluctuations
and the relationship between bilateral subthalamic nucleus (STN) activities and
pain occurrence are still less understood. This observational study used
data-driven methods by collecting annotated pain followed by a series of
corresponding binary pain ratings and wirelessly transmitted STN signals, then
leveraging the explainable machine learning algorithm to predict binary pain
levels and sort the feature influence. The binary pain levels could be
predicted among annotated pain reports corresponding to PD-related pain
characteristics. The STN activity from both sides could impact pain prediction,
with gamma and beta bands in the contralateral STN and delta and theta bands in
the ipsilateral STN showing a prominent role. This study emphasizes the role of
bilateral STN biomarkers on endogenous pain fluctuations.

### [294] [The assumptions that restrain us from understanding consciousness](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21485)
*Jaan Aru*

Main category: q-bio.NC

TL;DR: The paper questions key assumptions in consciousness research, exploring the complexity of underlying computations, neural correlates, and suggesting fresh directions for investigation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To challenge existing theoretical commitments and reassess fundamental assumptions in the science of consciousness.

Method: The author reevaluates established assumptions, such as spiking responses and computational theories of consciousness, and introduces new areas like internal changes of consciousness for exploration.

Result: The author identifies limitations in current approaches and raises the possibility that computations and neural correlates related to consciousness may be more complex or different than currently theorized.

Conclusion: Consciousness research requires revisiting traditional assumptions, considering novel phenomena like internal changes, and reevaluating which theoretical frameworks are truly needed.

Abstract: The science of consciousness has been successful over the last decades. Yet,
it seems that some of the key questions remain unanswered. Perhaps, as a
science of consciousness, we cannot move forward using the same theoretical
commitments that brought us here. It might be necessary to revise some
assumptions we have made along the way. In this piece, I offer no answers, but
I will question some of these fundamental assumptions. We will try to take a
fresh look at the classical question about the neural and explanatory
correlates of consciousness. A key assumption is that neural correlates are to
be found at the level of spiking responses. However, perhaps we should not
simply take it for granted that this assumption holds true. Another common
assumption is that we are close to understanding the computations underlying
consciousness. I will try to show that computations related to consciousness
might be far more complex than our current theories envision. There is little
reason to think that consciousness is an abstract computation, as traditionally
believed. Furthermore, I will try to demonstrate that consciousness research
could benefit from investigating internal changes of consciousness, such as
aha-moments. Finally, I will ask which theories the science of consciousness
really needs.

*Matjaž Omladič,Martin Vuk,Aljaž Zalar*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: This paper resolves a previously open problem in multi-dimensional quasi-copula analysis using an analytical approach.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The interest in quasi-copulas within dependence modeling has grown, yet a statistical interpretation has been lacking. Recently, specific problems about mass distributions in quasi-copulas remained unresolved, including Open Problem 5.

Method: An analytical approach was developed to address the mass distribution issues of multivariate quasi-copulas. This builds on previous results using linear programming.

Result: The authors resolved Open Problem 5 in full using their analytical methodology. A prior conjecture about the problem was disproven.

Conclusion: This paper advances the understanding of quasi-copulas by solving a longstanding open problem analytically, solidifying progress in dependence modeling.

Abstract: A recent survey, nicknamed "Hitchhiker's Guide", J.J. Arias-Garc{\i}a, R.
Mesiar, and B. De Baets, A hitchhiker's guide to quasi-copulas, Fuzzy Sets and
Systems 393 (2020) 1-28, has raised the rating of quasi-copula problems in the
dependence modeling community in spite of the lack of statistical
interpretation of quasi-copulas. In our previous work (arXiv:2410.19339,
accepted in Fuzzy Sets and Systems), we addressed the question of extreme
values of the mass distribution associated with multivariate quasi-copulas.
Using a linear programming approach, we were able to solve Open Problem 5 of
the "Guide" up to dimension d = 17 and disprove a recent conjecture on the
solution to that problem. In this paper, we use an analytical approach to
provide a complete answer to the original question.

### [296] [Stable Minima of ReLU Neural Networks Suffer from the Curse of Dimensionality: The Neural Shattering Phenomenon](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20779)
*Tongtong Liang,Dan Qiao,Yu-Xiang Wang,Rahul Parhi*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: This paper investigates the impact of flatness and low curvature minima on generalization for overparameterized ReLU networks with multivariate inputs, revealing exponential degradation of convergence rates in high-dimensional spaces.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the relationship between flatness in loss landscapes and generalization, especially in the context of gradient-descent training stability and the scalability of generalization with input dimensions.

Method: The authors analyze generalization gaps and mean-squared-error in multivariate cases, develop upper and lower bounds for convergence rates, and construct a minimax lower bound using boundary-localized ReLU neurons. They also run numerical simulations to validate their theoretical results.

Result: Flat minima correlate with generalization, but the convergence rates deteriorate exponentially with increasing input dimensions. An exponential gap was observed between flatness-based solutions and norm-based regularization techniques like weight decay, which avoid dimensionality issues.

Conclusion: Flat minima, while theoretically linked with generalization, fail to generalize effectively in high dimensions due to phenomena like neural shattering, challenging the widespread emphasis on flat solutions for neural network training.

Abstract: We study the implicit bias of flatness / low (loss) curvature and its effects
on generalization in two-layer overparameterized ReLU networks with
multivariate inputs -- a problem well motivated by the minima stability and
edge-of-stability phenomena in gradient-descent training. Existing work either
requires interpolation or focuses only on univariate inputs. This paper
presents new and somewhat surprising theoretical results for multivariate
inputs. On two natural settings (1) generalization gap for flat solutions, and
(2) mean-squared error (MSE) in nonparametric function estimation by stable
minima, we prove upper and lower bounds, which establish that while flatness
does imply generalization, the resulting rates of convergence necessarily
deteriorate exponentially as the input dimension grows. This gives an
exponential separation between the flat solutions vis-\`a-vis low-norm
solutions (i.e., weight decay), which knowingly do not suffer from the curse of
dimensionality. In particular, our minimax lower bound construction, based on a
novel packing argument with boundary-localized ReLU neurons, reveals how flat
solutions can exploit a kind of ''neural shattering'' where neurons rarely
activate, but with high weight magnitudes. This leads to poor performance in
high dimensions. We corroborate these theoretical findings with extensive
numerical simulations. To the best of our knowledge, our analysis provides the
first systematic explanation for why flat minima may fail to generalize in high
dimensions.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in high-dimensional spaces by improving accuracy and computational efficiency for Gaussian Process regression using active learning.

Method: The method integrates a neural network for dimensionality reduction with a Gaussian Process regressor in a latent space, guided by an active learning criterion to minimize global prediction errors.

Result: Experiments using synthetic data show the approach surpasses random sequential learning and handles complex, discontinuous functions effectively.

Conclusion: The framework is practically valuable for scientific and engineering uses, with future plans to focus on scalability and uncertainty-aware improvements.

Abstract: This paper introduces an active learning framework for manifold Gaussian
Process (GP) regression, combining manifold learning with strategic data
selection to improve accuracy in high-dimensional spaces. Our method jointly
optimizes a neural network for dimensionality reduction and a Gaussian process
regressor in the latent space, supervised by an active learning criterion that
minimizes global prediction error. Experiments on synthetic data demonstrate
superior performance over randomly sequential learning. The framework
efficiently handles complex, discontinuous functions while preserving

### [298] [Lower Bounds on the Size of Markov Equivalence Classes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20933)
*Erik Jahn,Frederick Eberhardt,Leonard J. Schulman*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: This paper demonstrates that relaxing standard assumptions in causal discovery (acyclicity, causal sufficiency, and uniform model prior) leads to exponentially larger Markov equivalence classes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how the sizes of Markov equivalence classes change when the typical assumptions in causal discovery are relaxed, and to determine the implications for the learnability of causal graphs from observational data.

Method: The authors analyze different graph settings: sparse random directed acyclic graphs, uniformly random acyclic directed mixed graphs, and uniformly random directed cyclic graphs, deriving theoretical bounds for Markov equivalence class sizes.

Result: They prove exponentially large lower bounds for the expected size of Markov equivalence classes under relaxed assumptions, contrasting with the smaller size under traditional assumptions.

Conclusion: Relaxing canonical assumptions in causal discovery significantly increases the complexity of recovering causal structures, highlighting the challenges in inferring causal graphs under less restrictive conditions.

Abstract: Causal discovery algorithms typically recover causal graphs only up to their
Markov equivalence classes unless additional parametric assumptions are made.
The sizes of these equivalence classes reflect the limits of what can be
learned about the underlying causal graph from purely observational data. Under
the assumptions of acyclicity, causal sufficiency, and a uniform model prior,
Markov equivalence classes are known to be small on average. In this paper, we
show that this is no longer the case when any of these assumptions is relaxed.
Specifically, we prove exponentially large lower bounds for the expected size
of Markov equivalence classes in three settings: sparse random directed acyclic
graphs, uniformly random acyclic directed mixed graphs, and uniformly random
directed cyclic graphs.

### [299] [Forecasting Geopolitical Events with a Sparse Temporal Fusion Transformer and Gaussian Process Hybrid: A Case Study in Middle Eastern and U.S. Conflict Dynamics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20935)
*Hsin-Hsiung Huang,Hayden Hampton*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper introduces the STFT-VNNGP model, which combines a Temporal Fusion Transformer (TFT) and a Variational Nearest Neighbor Gaussian Process (VNNGP) to improve long-horizon forecasts of geopolitical conflict.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard deep learning models struggle with sparse, bursty, and overdispersed data common in geopolitical event forecasting, leading to unreliable predictions.

Method: The model uses a two-stage process: (1) A Temporal Fusion Transformer (TFT) generates multi-quantile forecasts of temporal dynamics, (2) A Variational Nearest Neighbor Gaussian Process (VNNGP) performs principled spatiotemporal smoothing using the TFT's outputs.

Result: STFT-VNNGP demonstrates superior performance over standalone TFT models, particularly in accurately predicting the timing and magnitude of bursty events during long-range horizons in case studies on Middle East and U.S. conflict dynamics.

Conclusion: The STFT-VNNGP provides a robust and reproducible framework for improving the reliability and accuracy of forecasts in sparse and challenging geopolitical event datasets, aiding actionable intelligence.

Abstract: Forecasting geopolitical conflict from data sources like the Global Database
of Events, Language, and Tone (GDELT) is a critical challenge for national
security. The inherent sparsity, burstiness, and overdispersion of such data
cause standard deep learning models, including the Temporal Fusion Transformer
(TFT), to produce unreliable long-horizon predictions. We introduce STFT-VNNGP,
a hybrid architecture that won the 2023 Algorithms for Threat Detection (ATD)
competition by overcoming these limitations. Designed to bridge this gap, our
model employs a two-stage process: first, a TFT captures complex temporal
dynamics to generate multi-quantile forecasts. These quantiles then serve as
informed inputs for a Variational Nearest Neighbor Gaussian Process (VNNGP),
which performs principled spatiotemporal smoothing and uncertainty
quantification. In a case study forecasting conflict dynamics in the Middle
East and the U.S., STFT-VNNGP consistently outperforms a standalone TFT,
showing a superior ability to predict the timing and magnitude of bursty event
periods, particularly at long-range horizons. This work offers a robust
framework for generating more reliable and actionable intelligence from
challenging event data, with all code and workflows made publicly available to
ensure reproducibility.

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper introduces a rescaling approach to approximate multi-agent reinforcement learning dynamics in finite-state Markov games, using an ordinary differential equation (ODE).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to provide a tractable and deterministic approximation for the learning dynamics in complex multi-agent reinforcement learning scenarios.

Method: The method involves rescaling the learning process by reducing the agents' learning rate while increasing their update frequency, combined with analyzing the dynamics convergence to an ordinary differential equation (ODE).

Result: Under ergodicity and continuity assumptions, the rescaled learning process converges to an ODE, offering a simplified and deterministic model for agent dynamics.

Conclusion: The framework makes multi-agent learning dynamics more manageable, with a practical implementation available for broader use.

Abstract: This paper introduces a new approach for approximating the learning dynamics
of multiple reinforcement learning (RL) agents interacting in a finite-state
Markov game. The idea is to rescale the learning process by simultaneously
reducing the learning rate and increasing the update frequency, effectively
treating the agent's parameters as a slow-evolving variable influenced by the
fast-mixing game state. Under mild assumptions-ergodicity of the state process
and continuity of the updates-we prove the convergence of this rescaled process
to an ordinary differential equation (ODE). This ODE provides a tractable,
deterministic approximation of the agent's learning dynamics. An implementation
of the framework is available at\,:

### [301] [Hyperspherical Variational Autoencoders Using Efficient Spherical Cauchy Distribution](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21278)
*Lukas Sablica,Kurt Hornik*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper introduces a spherical Cauchy (spCauchy) latent distribution for variational autoencoders (VAEs) to improve on representation flexibility and stability over traditional latent space distributions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the limitations in current VAE latent distribution approaches like Gaussian and von Mises-Fisher (vMF), particularly in handling hyperspherical latent spaces and avoiding over-regularization or numerical instabilities.

Method: Proposes the use of spCauchy latent distribution with features like heavy tails and provides differentiable reparameterization using Möbius transformations. Also introduces an efficient KL divergence computation using a power series.

Result: Demonstrates that spCauchy offers efficient latent space utilization, mitigates issues with numerical instabilities, and provides a flexible, expressive hyperspherical representation for latent variables compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: spCauchy is a robust, scalable, and theoretically advantageous approach for embedding hyperspherical latent spaces in high-dimensional VAE generative models.

Abstract: We propose a novel variational autoencoder (VAE) architecture that employs a
spherical Cauchy (spCauchy) latent distribution. Unlike traditional Gaussian
latent spaces or the widely used von Mises-Fisher (vMF) distribution, spCauchy
provides a more natural hyperspherical representation of latent variables,
better capturing directional data while maintaining flexibility. Its
heavy-tailed nature prevents over-regularization, ensuring efficient latent
space utilization while offering a more expressive representation.
Additionally, spCauchy circumvents the numerical instabilities inherent to vMF,
which arise from computing normalization constants involving Bessel functions.
Instead, it enables a fully differentiable and efficient reparameterization
trick via M\"obius transformations, allowing for stable and scalable training.
The KL divergence can be computed through a rapidly converging power series,
eliminating concerns of underflow or overflow associated with evaluation of
ratios of hypergeometric functions. These properties make spCauchy a compelling
alternative for VAEs, offering both theoretical advantages and practical
efficiency in high-dimensional generative modeling.

### [302] [Wild refitting for black box prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21460)
*Martin J. Wainwright*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper introduces 'wild refitting,' a computational method for estimating upper bounds on mean-squared prediction errors of penalized estimates. It guarantees performance under mild assumptions and is applicable to various fields.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to develop a computationally efficient procedure for robust error estimation that works with a single dataset and simplifies the process of bounding prediction errors in penalized nonparametric settings.

Method: The method involves three steps: creating residuals, symmetrizing them using Rademacher residual symmetrization, and solving a modified prediction problem recentered at the current estimate.

Result: The proposed approach provides theoretical guarantees for bounding mean-squared prediction error and demonstrates applicability across tasks, like image restoration and kernel-based methods.

Conclusion: The wild refitting procedure offers a theoretically-backed solution for accurate error estimation in diverse scenarios, enhancing stability and utility of various predictive models.

Abstract: We describe and analyze a computionally efficient refitting procedure for
computing high-probability upper bounds on the instance-wise mean-squared
prediction error of penalized nonparametric estimates based on least-squares
minimization. Requiring only a single dataset and black box access to the
prediction method, it consists of three steps: computing suitable residuals,
symmetrizing and scaling them with a pre-factor $\rho$, and using them to
define and solve a modified prediction problem recentered at the current
estimate. We refer to it as wild refitting, since it uses Rademacher residual
symmetrization as in a wild bootstrap variant. Under relatively mild conditions
allowing for noise heterogeneity, we establish a high probability guarantee on
its performance, showing that the wild refit with a suitably chosen wild noise
scale $\rho$ gives an upper bound on prediction error. This theoretical
analysis provides guidance into the design of such procedures, including how
the residuals should be formed, the amount of noise rescaling in the wild
sub-problem needed for upper bounds, and the local stability properties of the
block-box procedure. We illustrate the applicability of this procedure to
various problems, including non-rigid structure-from-motion recovery with
structured matrix penalties; plug-and-play image restoration with deep neural
network priors; and randomized sketching with kernel methods.

TL;DR: This paper develops Gaussian-invariant sampling methods for improved statistical efficiency in Bayesian computation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional random walk Metropolis (RWM) and Metropolis adjusted Langevin algorithms (MALA) have limitations in sampling efficiency, especially for high-dimensional and complex targets.

Method: Introduced Gaussian-invariant versions of RWM, MALA, and Hessian-based MALA that exploit exact solutions to the Poisson equation for Gaussian targets to enable variance reduction using control variates.

Result: The proposed methods showed improved efficiency and competitive performance in high-dimensional latent Gaussian model cases, outperforming advanced methods and achieving state-of-the-art results.

Conclusion: Gaussian-invariant sampling methods are theoretically and empirically effective, providing a new avenue for efficient Bayesian computation.

Abstract: We develop sampling methods, which consist of Gaussian invariant versions of
random walk Metropolis (RWM), Metropolis adjusted Langevin algorithm (MALA) and
second order Hessian or Manifold MALA. Unlike standard RWM and MALA we show
that Gaussian invariant sampling can lead to ergodic estimators with improved
statistical efficiency. This is due to a remarkable property of Gaussian
invariance that allows us to obtain exact analytical solutions to the Poisson
equation for Gaussian targets. These solutions can be used to construct
efficient and easy to use control variates for variance reduction of estimators
under any intractable target. We demonstrate the new samplers and estimators in
several examples, including high dimensional targets in latent Gaussian models
where we compare against several advanced methods and obtain state-of-the-art
results. We also provide theoretical results regarding geometric ergodicity,
and an optimal scaling analysis that shows the dependence of the optimal
acceptance rate on the Gaussianity of the target.

TL;DR: The paper introduces and analyzes a generalization of binary outer-totalistic cellular automata called Life-like network automata, demonstrating their utility in solving synchronization problems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a theoretical framework that extends the concept of binary outer-totalistic cellular automata to network automata and to evaluate their potential applications.

Method: The authors quantitatively describe the network automata's genotype and phenotype using metrics like mean field and Derrida curves, and then correlate them. They apply these metrics to solve the firing squad synchronization problem.

Result: The approach achieves a success rate exceeding 90% in solving the firing squad synchronization problem, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed framework.

Conclusion: Life-like network automata provide a promising extension of classical cellular automata with practical implications for synchronization problems.

Abstract: We present a strong theoretical foundation that frames a well-defined family
of outer-totalistic network automaton models as a topological generalisation of
binary outer-totalistic cellular automata, of which the Game of Life is one
notable particular case. These "Life-like network automata" are quantitatively
described by expressing their genotype (the mean field curve and Derrida curve)
and phenotype (the evolution of the state and defect averages). After
demonstrating that the genotype and phenotype are correlated, we illustrate the
utility of these essential metrics by tackling the firing squad synchronisation
problem in a bottom-up fashion, with results that exceed a 90% success rate.

TL;DR: This paper addresses the overlooked connection between biodiversity and computing, introducing metrics and frameworks to quantify and integrate biodiversity impacts in computing systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aimed to investigate biodiversity loss as a critical planetary boundary and its unexamined connection to computing systems, driven by limited existing metrics and frameworks.

Method: The researchers introduced new metrics--Embodied Biodiversity Index (EBI) and Operational Biodiversity Index (OBI)--to quantify biodiversity impacts. They also developed FABRIC, a modeling framework that links computing workloads to biodiversity.

Result: An evaluation using the proposed metrics and framework demonstrated the necessity to integrate biodiversity concerns into sustainable computing design along with carbon and water.

Conclusion: The study concludes the importance of addressing biodiversity impacts within computing systems, paving the way for more comprehensive sustainable computing strategies.

Abstract: Biodiversity loss is a critical planetary boundary, yet its connection to
computing remains largely unexamined. Prior sustainability efforts in computing
have focused on carbon and water, overlooking biodiversity due to the lack of
appropriate metrics and modeling frameworks. This paper presents the first
end-to-end analysis of biodiversity impact from computing systems. We introduce
two new metrics--Embodied Biodiversity Index (EBI) and Operational Biodiversity
Index (OBI)--to quantify biodiversity impact across the lifecycle, and present
FABRIC, a modeling framework that links computing workloads to biodiversity

### [306] [Our Coding Adventure: Using LLMs to Personalise the Narrative of a Tangible Programming Robot for Preschoolers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20982)
*Martin Ruskov*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: The paper explores how Large Language Models (LLMs) can be indirectly used in preschool education via personalized storytelling for Cubetto robots, avoiding direct interaction with children and addressing challenges like LLM consistency and hallucinations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address risks associated with the direct usage of LLMs in education, particularly among younger children, by proposing an indirect application that leverages LLMs for personalized storytelling in robotics-based learning.

Method: It utilizes action research to develop a process for generating personalized narratives using open-weight, model-agnostic LLMs. The process is tested with five different LLMs in four scenarios and evaluates the challenges of consistency and hallucinations.

Result: The approach successfully produced personalized storytelling as teacher aids, demonstrating reproducible results. However, issues like consistency and hallucinations were identified, with mixed results in overcoming them.

Conclusion: The method provides a practical way for teachers to leverage LLMs without exposing children directly to these systems, making it suitable for use in preschool settings with plans for further real-world experimentation.

Abstract: Finding balanced ways to employ Large Language Models (LLMs) in education is
a challenge due to inherent risks of poor understanding of the technology and
of a susceptible audience. This is particularly so with younger children, who
are known to have difficulties with pervasive screen time. Working with a
tangible programming robot called Cubetto, we propose an approach to benefit
from the capabilities of LLMs by employing such models in the preparation of
personalised storytelling, necessary for preschool children to get accustomed
to the practice of commanding the robot. We engage in action research to
develop an early version of a formalised process to rapidly prototype game
stories for Cubetto. Our approach has both reproducible results, because it
employs open weight models, and is model-agnostic, because we test it with 5
different LLMs. We document on one hand the process, the used materials and
prompts, and on the other the learning experience and outcomes. We deem the
generation successful for the intended purposes of using the results as a
teacher aid. Testing the models on 4 different task scenarios, we encounter
issues of consistency and hallucinations and document the corresponding
evaluation process and attempts (some successful and some not) to overcome
these issues. Importantly, the process does not expose children to LLMs
directly. Rather, the technology is used to help teachers easily develop
personalised narratives on children's preferred topics. We believe our method
is adequate for preschool classes and we are planning to further experiment in
real-world educational settings.

*Siyu Mu,Wei Xuan Chan,Choon Hwai Yap*

Main category: physics.med-ph

TL;DR: The paper proposes IMC-PINN-FE, a physics-informed neural network framework that integrates imaging data with finite element modeling to estimate cardiac biomechanics more efficiently and accurately than traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for modeling the biomechanical behavior of the myocardium are computationally expensive and often fail to align with observed cardiac motions, necessitating an efficient, patient-specific approach.

Method: The framework predicts cardiac motion using pre-trained networks or unsupervised learning, extracts motion modes, and estimates myocardial stiffness and active tension by fitting to pressure data. It integrates these estimates into fast finite element modeling, implementing motion constraints for more accurate displacements.

Result: IMC-PINN-FE achieves a 75x computation speedup, improves Dice metrics from 0.849 to 0.927, and maintains realistic pressure-volume behavior, demonstrating enhanced accuracy and efficiency.

Conclusion: IMC-PINN-FE provides a faster, more accurate, and patient-specific approach for cardiac biomechanical modeling, avoiding the need for large datasets and advancing the integration of imaging and finite element analysis.

Abstract: Elucidating the biomechanical behavior of the myocardium is crucial for
understanding cardiac physiology, but cannot be directly inferred from clinical
imaging and typically requires finite element (FE) simulations. However,
conventional FE methods are computationally expensive and often fail to
reproduce observed cardiac motions. We propose IMC-PINN-FE, a physics-informed
neural network (PINN) framework that integrates imaged motion consistency (IMC)
with FE modeling for patient-specific left ventricular (LV) biomechanics.
Cardiac motion is first estimated from MRI or echocardiography using either a
pre-trained attention-based network or an unsupervised cyclic-regularized
network, followed by extraction of motion modes. IMC-PINN-FE then rapidly
estimates myocardial stiffness and active tension by fitting clinical pressure
measurements, accelerating computation from hours to seconds compared to
traditional inverse FE. Based on these parameters, it performs FE modeling
across the cardiac cycle at 75x speedup. Through motion constraints, it matches
imaged displacements more accurately, improving average Dice from 0.849 to
0.927, while preserving realistic pressure-volume behavior. IMC-PINN-FE
advances previous PINN-FE models by introducing back-computation of material
properties and better motion fidelity. Using motion from a single subject to
reconstruct shape modes also avoids the need for large datasets and improves
patient specificity. IMC-PINN-FE offers a robust and efficient approach for
rapid, personalized, and image-consistent cardiac biomechanical modeling.

*Fangyuan Zhang,Zhengjun Huang,Yingli Zhou,Qintian Guo,Zhixun Li,Wensheng Luo,Di Jiang,Yixiang Fang,Xiaofang Zhou*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: EraRAG introduces a scalable Graph-RAG framework designed to handle dynamic corpus updates efficiently without retraining or expensive recomputation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Graph-RAG approaches are limited by the assumption of a static corpus, requiring costly reconstruction for updates, making them impractical for dynamic and evolving environments.

Method: EraRAG organizes the corpus using hyperplane-based Locality-Sensitive Hashing (LSH) to build hierarchical graph structures, allowing efficient insertions and updates while maintaining retrieval accuracy and low latency.

Result: EraRAG significantly reduces graph update time and token usage by up to an order of magnitude while providing superior retrieval accuracy compared to traditional Graph-RAG systems, as demonstrated in large-scale benchmarks.

Conclusion: EraRAG presents a practical and scalable solution for retrieval-augmented generation systems dealing with growing corpora, maintaining efficiency, adaptability, and high performance.

Abstract: Graph-based Retrieval-Augmented Generation (Graph-RAG) enhances large
language models (LLMs) by structuring retrieval over an external corpus.
However, existing approaches typically assume a static corpus, requiring
expensive full-graph reconstruction whenever new documents arrive, limiting
their scalability in dynamic, evolving environments. To address these
limitations, we introduce EraRAG, a novel multi-layered Graph-RAG framework
that supports efficient and scalable dynamic updates. Our method leverages
hyperplane-based Locality-Sensitive Hashing (LSH) to partition and organize the
original corpus into hierarchical graph structures, enabling efficient and
localized insertions of new data without disrupting the existing topology. The
design eliminates the need for retraining or costly recomputation while
preserving high retrieval accuracy and low latency. Experiments on large-scale
benchmarks demonstrate that EraRag achieves up to an order of magnitude
reduction in update time and token consumption compared to existing Graph-RAG
systems, while providing superior accuracy performance. This work offers a
practical path forward for RAG systems that must operate over continually
growing corpora, bridging the gap between retrieval efficiency and
adaptability. Our code and data are available at

### [310] [On Uniform Weighted Deep Polynomial approximation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21306)
*Kingsley Yeon,Steven B. Damelin*

Main category: math.NA

TL;DR: The paper introduces weighted deep polynomial approximants for efficiently capturing the asymmetric behavior of functions, outperforming existing polynomial approximants.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenge of approximating functions with asymmetric behavior, especially those exhibiting local non-smoothness and global growth/decay.

Method: Introduced weighted deep polynomial approximants combined with a one-sided weight and proposed a stable graph-based parameterization method for optimization.

Result: Numerical experiments showed superior performance of these approximants compared to Taylor, Chebyshev, and standard deep polynomial approximants, using the same number of parameters.

Conclusion: The proposed weighted deep polynomial framework effectively models challenging functions, demonstrating improved approximation capabilities over traditional methods.

Abstract: It is a classical result in rational approximation theory that certain
non-smooth or singular functions, such as $|x|$ and $x^{1/p}$, can be
efficiently approximated using rational functions with root-exponential
convergence in terms of degrees of freedom \cite{Sta, GN}. In contrast,
polynomial approximations admit only algebraic convergence by Jackson's theorem
\cite{Lub2}. Recent work shows that composite polynomial architectures can
recover exponential approximation rates even without smoothness \cite{KY}. In
this work, we introduce and analyze a class of weighted deep polynomial
approximants tailored for functions with asymmetric behavior-growing unbounded
on one side and decaying on the other. By multiplying a learnable deep
polynomial with a one-sided weight, we capture both local non-smoothness and
global growth. We show numerically that this framework outperforms Taylor,
Chebyshev, and standard deep polynomial approximants, even when all use the
same number of parameters. To optimize these approximants in practice, we
propose a stable graph-based parameterization strategy building on \cite{Jar}.

*Xiaoyun Gong,Sloan Nietert,Ziv Goldfeld*

Main category: math.ST

TL;DR: This paper addresses the sensitivity of Gromov-Wasserstein (GW) alignment to outliers, proposing a robust estimator using partial GW distance to minimize distortion in contaminated datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To mitigate the impact of outliers on the GW alignment framework, which aligns heterogeneous datasets by minimizing structural distortion, as existing methods fail in such scenarios.

Method: The paper introduces a robust estimator based on the partial GW distance, which trims a fraction of mass from distributions before aligning them. It proves this estimator to be minimax optimal for population settings and near-optimal for finite-sample settings.

Result: The proposed method provides a robust way to estimate GW alignment cost under contaminated data scenarios, and structural results highlight the pseudo-metric properties of partial GW distance.

Conclusion: The partial GW distance serves as a practical and robust surrogate for traditional GW distance, beneficial when data is contaminated, enhancing reliability in alignment tasks.

Abstract: The Gromov-Wasserstein (GW) problem provides a powerful framework for
aligning heterogeneous datasets by matching their internal structures in a way
that minimizes distortion. However, GW alignment is sensitive to data
contamination by outliers, which can greatly distort the resulting matching
scheme. To address this issue, we study robust GW alignment, where upon
observing contaminated versions of the clean data distributions, our goal is to
accurately estimate the GW alignment cost between the original (uncontaminated)
measures. We propose an estimator based on the partial GW distance, which trims
out a fraction of the mass from each distribution before optimally aligning the
rest. The estimator is shown to be minimax optimal in the population setting
and is near-optimal in the finite-sample regime, where the optimality gap
originates only from the suboptimality of the plug-in estimator in the
empirical estimation setting (i.e., without contamination). Towards the
analysis, we derive new structural results pertaining to the approximate
pseudo-metric structure of the partial GW distance. Overall, our results endow
the partial GW distance with an operational meaning by posing it as a robust
surrogate of the classical distance when the observed data may be contaminated.

*Yatong Bai,Jonah Casebeer,Somayeh Sojoudi,Nicholas J. Bryan*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: DRAGON is a framework for optimizing generative media models using flexible reward functions that evaluate examples or distributions, achieving strong outcomes in model fine-tuning, particularly in text-to-music tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address the rigidity of conventional methods like RLHF or DPO in generative optimization by introducing a flexible framework that can accommodate diverse reward functions tailored for individual examples or distributions.

Method: DRAGON combines online and on-policy generations, scores them to form positive and negative sets, and optimizes the reward functions using contrasts. It incorporates novel reward functions based on exemplar distributions, cross-modality encoders, and innovative metrics like text-to-music diffusion.

Result: DRAGON demonstrated superior performance with an 81.45% average win rate over 20 distinct reward settings and achieved a 60.95% human-voted music quality win rate without needing human preference annotations.

Conclusion: The DRAGON framework offers a flexible and effective method to optimize generative models, enhancing human-perceived media quality by utilizing customizable reward functions and exemplar-based approaches.

Abstract: We present Distributional RewArds for Generative OptimizatioN (DRAGON), a
versatile framework for fine-tuning media generation models towards a desired
outcome. Compared with traditional reinforcement learning with human feedback
(RLHF) or pairwise preference approaches such as direct preference optimization
(DPO), DRAGON is more flexible. It can optimize reward functions that evaluate
either individual examples or distributions of them, making it compatible with
a broad spectrum of instance-wise, instance-to-distribution, and
distribution-to-distribution rewards. Leveraging this versatility, we construct
novel reward functions by selecting an encoder and a set of reference examples
to create an exemplar distribution. When cross-modality encoders such as CLAP
are used, the reference examples may be of a different modality (e.g., text
versus audio). Then, DRAGON gathers online and on-policy generations, scores
them to construct a positive demonstration set and a negative set, and
leverages the contrast between the two sets to maximize the reward. For
evaluation, we fine-tune an audio-domain text-to-music diffusion model with 20
different reward functions, including a custom music aesthetics model, CLAP
score, Vendi diversity, and Frechet audio distance (FAD). We further compare
instance-wise (per-song) and full-dataset FAD settings while ablating multiple
FAD encoders and reference sets. Over all 20 target rewards, DRAGON achieves an
81.45% average win rate. Moreover, reward functions based on exemplar sets
indeed enhance generations and are comparable to model-based rewards. With an
appropriate exemplar set, DRAGON achieves a 60.95% human-voted music quality
win rate without training on human preference annotations. As such, DRAGON
exhibits a new approach to designing and optimizing reward functions for
improving human-perceived quality. Sound examples at

### [313] [Exploring Adapter Design Tradeoffs for Low Resource Music Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21298)
*Atharva Mehta,Shivam Chauhan,Monojit Choudhury*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: This paper explores parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) for music models MusicGen and Mustango, investigating optimal adapter configurations for low-resource genres Hindustani Classical and Turkish Makam music. Trade-offs between convolution-based and transformer-based adapters are identified, and computational needs are analyzed.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large-scale music generation models like MusicGen and Mustango are resource-intensive to fine-tune. PEFT methods could reduce the computational cost, but little is known about optimal adapter configurations for specific use cases, particularly in low-resource music genres.

Method: The study evaluates different adapter configurations (architecture, placement, and size) for MusicGen and Mustango across two genres (Hindustani Classical and Turkish Makam music). Both convolution-based and transformer-based architectures are investigated, along with computational resource analysis.

Result: Convolution-based adapters capture fine musical details, while transformer-based adapters are better for long-range dependencies. Mid-sized adapters (40M parameters) achieve an optimal balance between expressivity and quality. MusicGen is more efficient and offers better quality output, whereas Mustango generates diverse outputs but with higher computational costs.

Conclusion: Fine-tuning with optimal adapter configurations offers a resource-efficient pathway to adapting music generation models for specific genres. Trade-offs exist between adapter types and between the efficiency and output diversity of MusicGen and Mustango.

Abstract: Fine-tuning large-scale music generation models, such as MusicGen and
Mustango, is a computationally expensive process, often requiring updates to
billions of parameters and, therefore, significant hardware resources.
Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) techniques, particularly adapter-based
methods, have emerged as a promising alternative, enabling adaptation with
minimal trainable parameters while preserving model performance. However, the
design choices for adapters, including their architecture, placement, and size,
are numerous, and it is unclear which of these combinations would produce
optimal adapters and why, for a given case of low-resource music genre. In this
paper, we attempt to answer this question by studying various adapter
configurations for two AI music models, MusicGen and Mustango, on two genres:
Hindustani Classical and Turkish Makam music.
  Our findings reveal distinct trade-offs: convolution-based adapters excel in
capturing fine-grained local musical details such as ornamentations and short
melodic phrases, while transformer-based adapters better preserve long-range
dependencies crucial for structured improvisation. Additionally, we analyze
computational resource requirements across different adapter scales,
demonstrating how mid-sized adapters (40M parameters) achieve an optimal
balance between expressivity and quality. Furthermore, we find that Mustango, a
diffusion-based model, generates more diverse outputs with better adherence to
the description in the input prompt while lacking in providing stability in
notes, rhythm alignment, and aesthetics. Also, it is computationally intensive
and requires significantly more time to train. In contrast, autoregressive
models like MusicGen offer faster training and are more efficient, and can
produce better quality output in comparison, but have slightly higher
redundancy in their generations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate instrument recognition in audio is crucial for music cataloging and retrieval. Previous models struggle with instruments lacking sufficient data, motivating exploration of hierarchical classification for improved detection.

Method: The study leverages hierarchical structures based on the Hornbostel-Sachs classification and evaluates methods using the diverse MedleyDB dataset. New strategies and models for hierarchical predictions are proposed and tested.

Result: Hierarchical classification demonstrates enhanced coarse-level instrument detection, bridging the gap between detailed individual identification and broader group recognition.

Conclusion: The findings indicate that hierarchical models improve reliability in detecting instrument activities, especially for coarse-level tasks, offering a pathway to advance music information retrieval systems.

Abstract: Identifying instrument activities within audio excerpts is vital in music
information retrieval, with significant implications for music cataloging and
discovery. Prior deep learning endeavors in musical instrument recognition have
predominantly emphasized instrument classes with ample data availability.
Recent studies have demonstrated the applicability of hierarchical
classification in detecting instrument activities in orchestral music, even
with limited fine-grained annotations at the instrument level. Based on the
Hornbostel-Sachs classification, such a hierarchical classification system is
evaluated using the MedleyDB dataset, renowned for its diversity and richness
concerning various instruments and music genres. This work presents various
strategies to integrate hierarchical structures into models and tests a new
class of models for hierarchical music prediction. This study showcases more
reliable coarse-level instrument detection by bridging the gap between detailed
instrument identification and group-level recognition, paving the way for
further advancements in this domain.

TL;DR: This paper introduces the SZUR-Acoustic Dataset and a deep learning model (BMCNN) for analyzing vehicular noise, achieving high classification accuracy. It demonstrates potential applications in traffic management.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of coupling vehicular noise with driving speed for real-time monitoring, aiding sustainable urban traffic management and noise reduction.

Method: Developed a dataset (SZUR-Acoustic Dataset) and proposed a bimodal-feature-fusion deep convolutional neural network (BMCNN) with preprocessing strategies and attention mechanisms to combine MFCCs and wavelet-packet energy features.

Result: BMCNN achieved a classification accuracy of 87.56% on the SZUR-Acoustic Dataset and 96.28% on the IDMT-Traffic dataset. Ablation studies validated individual module contributions.

Conclusion: The proposed method shows promise for integration into smart-city systems to enhance real-time traffic and noise management, supporting urban sustainability initiatives.

Abstract: This study presents and publicly releases the Suzhou Urban Road Acoustic
Dataset (SZUR-Acoustic Dataset), which is accompanied by comprehensive
data-acquisition protocols and annotation guidelines to ensure transparency and
reproducibility of the experimental workflow. To model the coupling between
vehicular noise and driving speed, we propose a bimodal-feature-fusion deep
convolutional neural network (BMCNN). During preprocessing, an adaptive
denoising and normalization strategy is applied to suppress environmental
background interference; in the network architecture, parallel branches extract
Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCCs) and wavelet-packet energy features,
which are subsequently fused via a cross-modal attention mechanism in the
intermediate feature space to fully exploit time-frequency information.
Experimental results demonstrate that BMCNN achieves a classification accuracy
of 87.56% on the SZUR-Acoustic Dataset and 96.28% on the public IDMT-Traffic
dataset. Ablation studies and robustness tests on the Suzhou dataset further
validate the contributions of each module to performance improvement and
overfitting mitigation. The proposed acoustics-based speed classification
method can be integrated into smart-city traffic management systems for
real-time noise monitoring and speed estimation, thereby optimizing traffic
flow control, reducing roadside noise pollution, and supporting sustainable
urban planning.

*Kehan Sui,Jinxu Xiang,Fang Jin*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: This paper proposes SmoothSinger, a conditional diffusion model for singing voice synthesis (SVS) that mitigates artifacts and improves naturalness by directly refining low-quality audio within a unified framework.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the challenges presented by traditional singing voice synthesis models and diffusion-based methods, which often result in artifacts and degraded naturalness due to complex singing acoustics and the reliance on two-stage pipelines.

Method: The proposed SmoothSinger employs a conditional diffusion-based approach with a reference-guided dual-branch architecture and a modified U-Net, which includes a low-frequency upsampling path to better capture pitch contours and long-term dependencies. Training replaces reference audio with degraded ground truth to ensure alignment.

Result: SmoothSinger achieves state-of-the-art performance on the Opencpop dataset and demonstrates improved naturalness and reduction of artifacts in both objective and subjective evaluations.

Conclusion: The novel approach of a unified diffusion-based framework and reference-guided architecture in SmoothSinger successfully addresses issues in conventional SVS pipelines, offering expressive and high-quality synthesized singing voices.

Abstract: Singing voice synthesis (SVS) aims to generate expressive and high-quality
vocals from musical scores, requiring precise modeling of pitch, duration, and
articulation. While diffusion-based models have achieved remarkable success in
image and video generation, their application to SVS remains challenging due to
the complex acoustic and musical characteristics of singing, often resulting in
artifacts that degrade naturalness. In this work, we propose SmoothSinger, a
conditional diffusion model designed to synthesize high quality and natural
singing voices. Unlike prior methods that depend on vocoders as a final stage
and often introduce distortion, SmoothSinger refines low-quality synthesized
audio directly in a unified framework, mitigating the degradation associated
with two-stage pipelines. The model adopts a reference-guided dual-branch
architecture, using low-quality audio from any baseline system as a reference
to guide the denoising process, enabling more expressive and context-aware
synthesis. Furthermore, it enhances the conventional U-Net with a parallel
low-frequency upsampling path, allowing the model to better capture pitch
contours and long term spectral dependencies. To improve alignment during
training, we replace reference audio with degraded ground truth audio,
addressing temporal mismatch between reference and target signals. Experiments
on the Opencpop dataset, a large-scale Chinese singing corpus, demonstrate that
SmoothSinger achieves state-of-the-art results in both objective and subjective
evaluations. Extensive ablation studies confirm its effectiveness in reducing
artifacts and improving the naturalness of synthesized voices.

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: The paper introduces a differentiable STFT for gradient-based optimization of its parameters, addressing limitations of traditional tuning methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional STFT parameter tuning relies on manual or computationally intensive methods, often yielding suboptimal results.

Method: The paper proposes a unified differentiable formulation of STFT that enables gradient-based optimization and seamless integration with neural networks.

Result: Experiments demonstrate the differentiable STFT enhances time-frequency representation and improves performance in various tasks.

Conclusion: The approach provides a robust solution for STFT parameter optimization and boosts downstream task effectiveness.

Abstract: The short-time Fourier transform (STFT) is widely used for analyzing
non-stationary signals. However, its performance is highly sensitive to its
parameters, and manual or heuristic tuning often yields suboptimal results. To
overcome this limitation, we propose a unified differentiable formulation of
the STFT that enables gradient-based optimization of its parameters. This
approach addresses the limitations of traditional STFT parameter tuning
methods, which often rely on computationally intensive discrete searches. It
enables fine-tuning of the time-frequency representation (TFR) based on any
desired criterion. Moreover, our approach integrates seamlessly with neural
networks, allowing joint optimization of the STFT parameters and network
weights. The efficacy of the proposed differentiable STFT in enhancing TFRs and
improving performance in downstream tasks is demonstrated through experiments
on both simulated and real-world data.

TL;DR: This paper introduces a scalable Charge Deposition (CD) optimization for the Particle-In-Cell (PIC) plasma simulation method, improving parallel performance by reducing memory conflicts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address scalability and computational bottlenecks in 2D and 3D device-scale plasma simulations, particularly focusing on inefficiencies in the Charge Deposition (CD) subroutine of the Particle-In-Cell method.

Method: The paper proposes a novel particle-thread binding strategy that optimizes memory usage by requiring only four private grids per node or per system in parallel computing setups. This maintains existing data structures with minimal code changes and incorporates flags to manage concurrent grid access.

Result: The proposed method demonstrated improved scalability and performance in Charge Deposition on both shared memory and distributed memory systems (tested up to 1000 cores). It also showed minimal hardware dependency, making it broadly applicable.

Conclusion: The novel approach effectively enhances the efficiency and scalability of PIC simulations, maintaining compatibility with existing methods and requiring few alterations to established codes.

Abstract: The Particle-In-Cell (PIC) method for plasma simulation tracks particle phase
space information using particle and grid data structures. High computational
costs in 2D and 3D device-scale PIC simulations necessitate parallelization,
with the Charge Deposition (CD) subroutine often becoming a bottleneck due to
frequent particle-grid interactions. Conventional methods mitigate dependencies
by generating private grids for each core, but this approach faces scalability
issues. We propose a novel approach based on a particle-thread binding strategy
that requires only four private grids per node in distributed memory systems or
four private grids in shared memory systems, enhancing CD scalability and
performance while maintaining conventional data structures and requiring
minimal changes to existing PIC codes. This method ensures complete
accessibility of grid data structure for concurrent threads and avoids
simultaneous access to particles within the same cell using additional
functions and flags. Performance evaluations using a PIC benchmark for
low-temperature partially magnetized E x B discharge simulation on a shared
memory as well as a distributed memory system (1000 cores) demonstrate the
method's scalability, and additionally, we show the method has little hardware
dependency.

*Alexander Selivanov,Philip Müller,Özgün Turgut,Nil Stolt-Ansó,Daniel Rückert*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: This paper introduces PTACL, a method to enhance ECG-based diagnostics by incorporating insights from CMR datasets through multimodal contrastive learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional ECGs, while effective for detecting electrical heart abnormalities, cannot measure functional cardiac parameters like ventricular volumes, unlike CMR, the standard but expensive and less accessible option.

Method: PTACL utilizes a multimodal contrastive learning framework combining global patient-level and fine-grained temporal-level contrastive losses to align ECG and CMR representations without adding learnable parameters.

Result: PTACL performed strongly on UK Biobank data for two tasks: cardiac phenotype retrieval and prediction of functional parameters such as ejection fraction, surpassing baseline methods.

Conclusion: PTACL enhances ECG's diagnostic capacities by leveraging CMR data, potentially improving non-invasive cardiac assessments cost-effectively.

Abstract: An electrocardiogram (ECG) is a widely used, cost-effective tool for
detecting electrical abnormalities in the heart. However, it cannot directly
measure functional parameters, such as ventricular volumes and ejection
fraction, which are crucial for assessing cardiac function. Cardiac magnetic
resonance (CMR) is the gold standard for these measurements, providing detailed
structural and functional insights, but is expensive and less accessible. To
bridge this gap, we propose PTACL (Patient and Temporal Alignment Contrastive
Learning), a multimodal contrastive learning framework that enhances ECG
representations by integrating spatio-temporal information from CMR. PTACL uses
global patient-level contrastive loss and local temporal-level contrastive
loss. The global loss aligns patient-level representations by pulling ECG and
CMR embeddings from the same patient closer together, while pushing apart
embeddings from different patients. Local loss enforces fine-grained temporal
alignment within each patient by contrasting encoded ECG segments with
corresponding encoded CMR frames. This approach enriches ECG representations
with diagnostic information beyond electrical activity and transfers more
insights between modalities than global alignment alone, all without
introducing new learnable weights. We evaluate PTACL on paired ECG-CMR data
from 27,951 subjects in the UK Biobank. Compared to baseline approaches, PTACL
achieves better performance in two clinically relevant tasks: (1) retrieving
patients with similar cardiac phenotypes and (2) predicting CMR-derived cardiac
function parameters, such as ventricular volumes and ejection fraction. Our
results highlight the potential of PTACL to enhance non-invasive cardiac
diagnostics using ECG. The code is available at:

TL;DR: This paper introduces U-R-Veda, a deep learning model utilizing advanced techniques like vision transformers and attention mechanisms to achieve highly accurate semantic segmentation of cardiac MRI images.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the need for automated and accurate methods for cardiac image segmentation, enabling improved diagnosis and management of cardiac disorders.

Method: The enhanced UNet model, U-R-Veda, combines convolution blocks, vision transformers, residual links, channel-attention, spatial-attention, and edge-detection skip connections for better segmentation results.

Result: The proposed model achieves an average segmentation accuracy of 95.2%, surpassing existing methods particularly in the differentiation of right-ventricle and left-ventricle-myocardium regions.

Conclusion: U-R-Veda significantly improves cardiac image semantic segmentation accuracy, aiding the development of more effective automated medical image analysis tools.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence, including deep learning models, will play a
transformative role in automated medical image analysis for the diagnosis of
cardiac disorders and their management. Automated accurate delineation of
cardiac images is the first necessary initial step for the quantification and
automated diagnosis of cardiac disorders. In this paper, we propose a deep
learning based enhanced UNet model, U-R-Veda, which integrates convolution
transformations, vision transformer, residual links, channel-attention, and
spatial attention, together with edge-detection based skip-connections for an
accurate fully-automated semantic segmentation of cardiac magnetic resonance
(CMR) images. The model extracts local-features and their interrelationships
using a stack of combination convolution blocks, with embedded channel and
spatial attention in the convolution block, and vision transformers. Deep
embedding of channel and spatial attention in the convolution block identifies
important features and their spatial localization. The combined edge
information with channel and spatial attention as skip connection reduces
information-loss during convolution transformations. The overall model
significantly improves the semantic segmentation of CMR images necessary for
improved medical image analysis. An algorithm for the dual attention module
(channel and spatial attention) has been presented. Performance results show
that U-R-Veda achieves an average accuracy of 95.2%, based on DSC metrics. The
model outperforms the accuracy attained by other models, based on DSC and HD
metrics, especially for the delineation of right-ventricle and

Motivation: The motivation stems from the need to overcome challenges in tumor identification using 3D ultrasound, which impedes its broader therapeutic application in clinical settings.

Method: The paper proposes a 2D US-CT/MRI registration method leveraging 3D US as an intermediary and introduces a multimodal image visualization technique for efficient workflow verification.

Result: The 2D US-CT/MRI registration method achieved a landmark distance error of 2–4 mm with 0.22s runtime per pair, and non-rigid registration reduced alignment error by 40% compared to rigid methods.

Conclusion: The framework enhanced 3D US imaging's integration into clinical workflows and demonstrated its potential to improve tumor ablation outcomes, suggesting a broader therapeutic role for 3D US in clinical interventions.

Abstract: 3D ultrasound (US) imaging has shown significant benefits in enhancing the

crucial for transitioning 3D US into the therapeutic domain. However,
challenges of tumour identification in US images continue to hinder its broader
adoption. In this work, we propose a novel framework for integrating 3D US into
the standard ablation workflow. We present a key component, a clinically viable
2D US-CT/MRI registration approach, leveraging 3D US as an intermediary to
reduce registration complexity. To facilitate efficient verification of the
registration workflow, we also propose an intuitive multimodal image
visualization technique. In our study, 2D US-CT/MRI registration achieved a
landmark distance error of approximately 2-4 mm with a runtime of 0.22s per
image pair. Additionally, non-rigid registration reduced the mean alignment
error by approximately 40% compared to rigid registration. Results demonstrated
the efficacy of the proposed 2D US-CT/MRI registration workflow. Our
integration framework advanced the capabilities of 3D US imaging in improving
percutaneous tumour ablation, demonstrating the potential to expand the
therapeutic role of 3D US in clinical interventions.

*Shuki Maruyama,Hidenori Takeshima*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: The paper presents a deep learning-based spectral analysis method that improves accuracy under static magnetic field B0 inhomogeneity by leveraging modeled spectra.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges caused by static magnetic field (B0) inhomogeneity in spectral analysis and improve analysis accuracy.

Method: The authors developed a deep learning model trained on modeled spectra, which were generated using B0 maps and metabolite ratios from the human brain. The method involved dividing B0 maps into subregions, estimating components, and integrating averaged metabolites for accurate modeling.

Result: The proposed model reduced mean squared errors (MSEs) by up to 49.89% compared to traditional methods. It also exhibited significantly lower mean absolute percentage errors (MAPEs) than LCModel under varied B0 inhomogeneity conditions.

Conclusion: This proposed method effectively enhances spectral analysis accuracy by incorporating modeled spectra into training. It demonstrates potential for addressing spectral variations induced by B0 inhomogeneity.

Abstract: Purpose:To develop a method that enhances the accuracy of spectral analysis
in the presence of static magnetic field B0 inhomogeneity. Methods:The authors
proposed a new spectral analysis method utilizing a deep learning model trained
on modeled spectra that consistently represent the spectral variations induced
by B0 inhomogeneity. These modeled spectra were generated from the B0 map and
metabolite ratios of the healthy human brain. The B0 map was divided into a
patch size of subregions, and the separately estimated metabolites and baseline
components were averaged and then integrated. The quality of the modeled
spectra was visually and quantitatively evaluated against the measured spectra.
The analysis models were trained using measured, simulated, and modeled
spectra. The performance of the proposed method was assessed using mean squared
errors (MSEs) of metabolite ratios. The mean absolute percentage errors (MAPEs)
of the metabolite ratios were also compared to LCModel when analyzing the
phantom spectra acquired under two types of B0 inhomogeneity. Results:The
modeled spectra exhibited broadened and narrowed spectral peaks depending on
the B0 inhomogeneity and were quantitatively close to the measured spectra. The
analysis model trained using measured spectra with modeled spectra improved
MSEs by 49.89% compared to that trained using measured spectra alone, and by
26.66% compared to that trained using measured spectra with simulated spectra.
The performance improved as the number of modeled spectra increased from 0 to
1,000. This model showed significantly lower MAPEs than LCModel under both
types of B0 inhomogeneity. Conclusion:A new spectral analysis-trained deep
learning model using the modeled spectra was developed. The results suggest
that the proposed method has the potential to improve the accuracy of spectral
analysis by increasing the training samples of spectra.

*Mohammed Baharoon,Jun Ma,Congyu Fang,Augustin Toma,Bo Wang*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: The paper investigates the design considerations for applying Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to automated 3D CT Radiology Report Generation (RRG), evaluates strategies for improving performance, and introduces augmentation methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to improve automation in radiology report generation by exploring the potential of MLLMs to address challenges and enhance performance in real-world healthcare applications.

Method: The authors evaluated various factors such as visual input representation, LLM size, projectors, and fine-tuning while introducing knowledge-based report augmentation methods. They conducted experiments on a dataset of 1,687 3D CT cases.

Result: The proposed methods improved GREEN scores by up to 10% and secured 2nd place in the MICCAI 2024 AMOS-MM challenge. Findings show that RRG is size-independent of LLMs and larger volume sizes don't always improve performance.

Conclusion: RRG performance can be optimized through careful design strategies involving input representation, segmentation masks, and tailored pre-training while using MLLMs. The code has been made publicly accessible for further research.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have emerged as a promising way to
automate Radiology Report Generation (RRG). In this work, we systematically
investigate the design space of 3D MLLMs, including visual input
representation, projectors, Large Language Models (LLMs), and fine-tuning
techniques for 3D CT report generation. We also introduce two knowledge-based
report augmentation methods that improve performance on the GREEN score by up
to 10\%, achieving the 2nd place on the MICCAI 2024 AMOS-MM challenge. Our
results on the 1,687 cases from the AMOS-MM dataset show that RRG is largely
independent of the size of LLM under the same training protocol. We also show
that larger volume size does not always improve performance if the original ViT
was pre-trained on a smaller volume size. Lastly, we show that using a
segmentation mask along with the CT volume improves performance. The code is

### [324] [Uncover Treasures in DCT: Advancing JPEG Quality Enhancement by Exploiting Latent Correlations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21171)
*Jing Yang,Qunliang Xing,Mai Xu,Minglang Qiao*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a method (AJQE) for improving JPEG image quality by working directly in the DCT domain to exploit correlations in DCT coefficients, achieving better performance and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: JPEG compression introduces artifacts, and current methods for enhancing JPEG quality in the DCT domain underperform compared to pixel-domain approaches.

Method: A novel Advanced JPEG Quality Enhancement (AJQE) method leverages two critical correlations within DCT coefficients to adapt pixel-domain models for use in the DCT domain.

Result: The proposed AJQE method achieves a 0.35 dB improvement in PSNR and a 60.5% increase in processing throughput compared to pixel-domain techniques.

Conclusion: AJQE offers enhanced JPEG image quality with lower computational cost, making it an efficient alternative to pixel-domain methods.

Abstract: Joint Photographic Experts Group (JPEG) achieves data compression by
quantizing Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) coefficients, which inevitably
introduces compression artifacts. Most existing JPEG quality enhancement
methods operate in the pixel domain, suffering from the high computational
costs of decoding. Consequently, direct enhancement of JPEG images in the DCT
domain has gained increasing attention. However, current DCT-domain methods
often exhibit limited performance. To address this challenge, we identify two
critical types of correlations within the DCT coefficients of JPEG images.
Building on this insight, we propose an Advanced DCT-domain JPEG Quality
Enhancement (AJQE) method that fully exploits these correlations. The AJQE
method enables the adaptation of numerous well-established pixel-domain models
to the DCT domain, achieving superior performance with reduced computational
complexity. Compared to the pixel-domain counterparts, the DCT-domain models
derived by our method demonstrate a 0.35 dB improvement in PSNR and a 60.5%
increase in enhancement throughput on average.

### [326] [Lightweight Physics-Informed Zero-Shot Ultrasound Plane Wave Denoising](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21499)
*Hojat Asgariandehkordi,Mostafa Sharifzadeh,Hassan Rivaz*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a zero-shot denoising framework for Ultrasound Coherent Plane Wave Compounding (CPWC) that enhances image contrast in noisy and low-angle acquisitions without requiring external training data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Challenges like reduced frame rate, blurring artifacts in fast-moving targets, and susceptibility to noise in CPWC motivate the development of a new denoising method.

Method: The method divides transmission angles into subsets, forms noisy compounded images, and employs a self-supervised residual learning scheme in a lightweight deep learning architecture to suppress noise.

Result: Superior contrast enhancement and preservation of anatomical structures are achieved, validated across simulation, phantom, and in vivo data.

Conclusion: The lightweight framework operates efficiently, requires no supervised training, and adapts across various anatomical and acquisition setups, outperforming existing methods.

Abstract: Ultrasound Coherent Plane Wave Compounding (CPWC) enhances image contrast by
combining echoes from multiple steered transmissions. While increasing the
number of angles generally improves image quality, it drastically reduces the
frame rate and can introduce blurring artifacts in fast-moving targets.
Moreover, compounded images remain susceptible to noise, particularly when
acquired with a limited number of transmissions. We propose a zero-shot
denoising framework tailored for low-angle CPWC acquisitions, which enhances
contrast without relying on a separate training dataset. The method divides the
available transmission angles into two disjoint subsets, each used to form
compound images that include higher noise levels. The new compounded images are
then used to train a deep model via a self-supervised residual learning scheme,
enabling it to suppress incoherent noise while preserving anatomical
structures. Because angle-dependent artifacts vary between the subsets while
the underlying tissue response is similar, this physics-informed pairing allows
the network to learn to disentangle the inconsistent artifacts from the
consistent tissue signal. Unlike supervised methods, our model requires no
domain-specific fine-tuning or paired data, making it adaptable across
anatomical regions and acquisition setups. The entire pipeline supports
efficient training with low computational cost due to the use of a lightweight
architecture, which comprises only two convolutional layers. Evaluations on
simulation, phantom, and in vivo data demonstrate superior contrast enhancement
and structure preservation compared to both classical and deep learning-based
denoising methods.

groundwork for developing more accurate and resilient forecasting models.

*Tamim Al Mahmud,B M Mainul Hossain,Dilshad Ara*

Main category: cs.DL

TL;DR: The paper presents a method for automatically selecting suitable reviewers for research papers by analyzing references, keywords, and researchers’ metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation stems from the difficulty in efficiently selecting expert reviewers for increasing numbers of research papers in various emerging fields.

Method: The method involves analyzing paper references to identify relevant authors, extracting topic keywords, evaluating researchers’ academic metrics (e.g., h-index), and filtering out co-authors to rank potential reviewers.

Result: The proposed program ranks the most suitable reviewers for a paper by automating the selection process based on relevance and expertise.

Conclusion: The method provides an efficient solution for identifying expert reviewers, improving the peer review process while addressing scalability and expertise challenges.

Abstract: Everyday, a vast stream of research documents is submitted to conferences,
anthologies, journals, newsletters, annual reports, daily papers, and various
periodicals. Many such publications use independent external specialists to
review submissions. This process is called peer review, and the reviewers are
called referees. However, it is not always possible to pick the best referee
for reviewing. Moreover, new research fields are emerging in every sector, and
the number of research papers is increasing dramatically. To review all these
papers, every journal assigns a small team of referees who may not be experts
in all areas. For example, a research paper in communication technology should
be reviewed by an expert from the same field. Thus, efficiently selecting the
best reviewer or referee for a research paper is a big challenge.
  In this research, we propose and implement program that uses a new strategy
to automatically select the best reviewers for a research paper. Every research
paper contains references at the end, usually from the same area. First, we
collect the references and count authors who have at least one paper in the
references. Then, we automatically browse the web to extract research topic
keywords. Next, we search for top researchers in the specific topic and count
their h-index, i10-index, and citations for the first n authors. Afterward, we
rank the top n authors based on a score and automatically browse their
homepages to retrieve email addresses. We also check their co-authors and
colleagues online and discard them from the list. The remaining top n authors,
generally professors, are likely the best referees for reviewing the research
paper.

TL;DR: This paper explores using PDE discovery methods to link micro-scale and meso-scale dynamics in biological systems, focusing on calcium diffusion in astrocytes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address the challenge of characterizing complex biological systems that operate on multiple spatial and temporal scales, which involves bridging gaps between micro-scale and meso-scale dynamics.

Method: Combines particle-based simulations with PDE discovery techniques to assess five PDE discovery methods for accurately capturing meso-scale dynamics by analyzing calcium diffusion in astrocytes.

Result: Several methods demonstrated accurate recovery of diffusion terms, indicating their effectiveness in forecasting calcium concentration variations and extracting macroscopic dynamics.

Conclusion: The results confirm the promise of PDE discovery as a powerful approach to understand biological system dynamics from microscopic data.

Abstract: Biological systems are non-linear, include unobserved variables and the
physical principles that govern their dynamics are partly unknown. This makes
the characterization of their behavior very challenging. Notably, their
activity occurs on multiple interdependent spatial and temporal scales that
require linking mechanisms across scales. To address the challenge of bridging
gaps between scales, we leverage partial differential equations (PDE)
discovery. PDE discovery suggests meso-scale dynamics characteristics from
micro-scale data. In this article, we present our framework combining
particle-based simulations and PDE discovery and conduct preliminary
experiments to assess equation discovery in controlled settings. We evaluate
five state-of-the-art PDE discovery methods on particle-based simulations of
calcium diffusion in astrocytes. The performances of the methods are evaluated
on both the form of the discovered equation and the forecasted temporal
variations of calcium concentration. Our results show that several methods
accurately recover the diffusion term, highlighting the potential of PDE
discovery for capturing macroscopic dynamics in biological systems from
microscopic data.

TL;DR: The paper introduces an adaptive hybrid sorting algorithm that chooses the optimal sorting method based on input data characteristics, offering improved efficiency and execution time.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Sorting algorithms impact performance in diverse computing areas but lack universal optimality across all input datasets, necessitating adaptive solutions.

Method: The paper proposes a framework that uses feature extraction to analyze input data parameters and applies a decision engine combining a Finite State Machine and XGBoost classifier to select the optimal sorting algorithm.

Result: Experimental results using synthetic and real datasets showed the adaptive sorting framework outperformed fixed traditional sorting algorithms in various metrics such as execution time, flexibility, and efficiency.

Conclusion: The adaptive hybrid sorting paradigm is scalable and applicable across disciplines like big data analytics and edge computing, demonstrating its potential as a versatile solution.

Abstract: Sorting is an essential operation in computer science with direct
consequences on the performance of large scale data systems, real-time systems,
and embedded computation. However, no sorting algorithm is optimal under all
distributions of data. The new adaptive hybrid sorting paradigm proposed in
this paper is the paradigm that automatically selects the most effective
sorting algorithm Counting Sort, Radix Sort, or QuickSort based on real-time
monitoring of patterns in input data. The architecture begins by having a
feature extraction module to compute significant parameters such as data
volume, value range and entropy. These parameters are sent to a decision engine
involving Finite State Machine and XGBoost classifier to aid smart and
effective in choosing the optimal sorting strategy. It implements Counting Sort
on small key ranges, Radix Sort on large range structured input with
low-entropy keys and QuickSort on general purpose sorting. The experimental
findings of both synthetic and real life dataset confirm that the proposed
solution is actually inclined to excel significantly by comparison in execution
time, flexibility and the efficiency of conventional static sorting algorithms.
The proposed framework provides a scalable, high perhaps and applicable to a
wide range of data processing operations like big data analytics, edge
computing, and systems with hardware limitations.

a comprehensive methodology utilizing a mixed density network (MDN) model,
trained on extensive experimental data from literature. This approach uniquely
predicts the distribution of dislocation density, inferred as a latent

Main category: q-bio.BM

TL;DR: MegaFold accelerates AlphaFold3 (AF3) protein structure prediction training by addressing computational bottlenecks, reducing memory usage by up to 1.23x, and improving training speed up to 1.73x.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AlphaFold3 introduces computational advancements for protein structure prediction, but its high computational and memory demands hinder scalability.

Method: MegaFold optimizes AF3 with ahead-of-time caching, Triton-based kernels for memory-efficient computations, and deep fusion for key operators, enhancing efficiency on heterogeneous devices.

Result: MegaFold decreases memory usage, shortens training time, and supports longer protein sequence lengths, improving overall scalability without running out of memory.

Conclusion: MegaFold makes AF3 training more scalable and efficient, overcoming key limitations, and its open-source availability invites further development.

Abstract: Protein structure prediction models such as AlphaFold3 (AF3) push the
frontier of biomolecular modeling by incorporating science-informed
architectural changes to the transformer architecture. However, these advances
come at a steep system cost, introducing: compute- and memory-intensive
operators, 2D attention mechanisms, and retrieval-augmented data pipelines,
which collectively hinder the scalability of AF3 training. In this work, we
present MegaFold, a cross-platform system to accelerate AF3 training. MegaFold
tackles key bottlenecks through ahead-of-time caching to eliminate GPU idle
time from the retrieval-augmented data pipeline, Triton-based kernels for
memory-efficient EvoAttention on heterogeneous devices, and deep fusion for
common and critical small operators in AF3. Evaluation on both NVIDIA H200 and
AMD MI250 GPUs shows that MegaFold reduces peak memory usage of AF3 training by
up to 1.23$\times$ and improves per-iteration training time by up-to
1.73$\times$ and 1.62$\times$ respectively. More importantly, MegaFold enables
training on 1.35$\times$ longer sequence lengths compared to PyTorch baselines
without running out-of-memory, significantly improving the scalability of
modern protein folding models. We open source our code at

TL;DR: The paper introduces CovDocker, a benchmark tailored for covalent docking, to improve predictions around covalent bond formation and associated molecular transformations in drug design.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing docking methods largely overlook covalent interactions and the structural changes they cause, despite these interactions' strong and enduring binding advantages.

Method: CovDocker decomposes covalent docking into three tasks: reactive location prediction, covalent reaction prediction, and docking. Baseline performance is demonstrated using advanced models like Uni-Mol and Chemformer.

Result: CovDocker effectively predicts covalent interaction sites and models associated molecular transformations, advancing research in covalent drug design.

Conclusion: The benchmark is a robust framework promoting data-driven approaches to accelerate covalent inhibitor discovery and address therapeutic development challenges.

Abstract: Molecular docking plays a crucial role in predicting the binding mode of
ligands to target proteins, and covalent interactions, which involve the
formation of a covalent bond between the ligand and the target, are
particularly valuable due to their strong, enduring binding nature. However,
most existing docking methods and deep learning approaches hardly account for
the formation of covalent bonds and the associated structural changes. To
address this gap, we introduce a comprehensive benchmark for covalent docking,
CovDocker, which is designed to better capture the complexities of covalent
binding. We decompose the covalent docking process into three main tasks:
reactive location prediction, covalent reaction prediction, and covalent
docking. By adapting state-of-the-art models, such as Uni-Mol and Chemformer,
we establish baseline performances and demonstrate the effectiveness of the
benchmark in accurately predicting interaction sites and modeling the molecular
transformations involved in covalent binding. These results confirm the role of
the benchmark as a rigorous framework for advancing research in covalent drug
design. It underscores the potential of data-driven approaches to accelerate
the discovery of selective covalent inhibitors and addresses critical
challenges in therapeutic development.

Main category: eess.AS

TL;DR: This paper explores hybrid modeling for Arabic dialect recognition using MFCC + CNN and DWT + RNN in low-resource scenarios, finding MFCC + CNN to be more effective with 91.2% accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Arabic dialect recognition is challenging due to linguistic diversity and the scarcity of large annotated datasets, especially for underrepresented dialects.

Method: The study used two hybrid models: MFCC + CNN and DWT + RNN, trained on dialect-filtered subsets of the Common Voice Arabic dataset with speaker-metadata labels.

Result: The MFCC + CNN model achieved superior accuracy (91.2%) compared to the DWT + RNN model (66.5%), also excelling in precision, recall, and F1-scores.

Conclusion: Spectral features combined with convolutional models are effective for Arabic dialect recognition in low-resource settings, and future research should focus on larger datasets, self-supervised learning, and advanced architectures like Transformers.

Abstract: Arabic dialect recognition presents a significant challenge in speech
technology due to the linguistic diversity of Arabic and the scarcity of large
annotated datasets, particularly for underrepresented dialects. This research
investigates hybrid modeling strategies that integrate classical signal
processing techniques with deep learning architectures to address this problem
in low-resource scenarios. Two hybrid models were developed and evaluated: (1)
Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC) combined with a Convolutional Neural
Network (CNN), and (2) Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) features combined with
a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN). The models were trained on a dialect-filtered
subset of the Common Voice Arabic dataset, with dialect labels assigned based
on speaker metadata. Experimental results demonstrate that the MFCC + CNN
architecture achieved superior performance, with an accuracy of 91.2% and
strong precision, recall, and F1-scores, significantly outperforming the
Wavelet + RNN configuration, which achieved an accuracy of 66.5%. These
findings highlight the effectiveness of leveraging spectral features with
convolutional models for Arabic dialect recognition, especially when working
with limited labeled data. The study also identifies limitations related to
dataset size, potential regional overlaps in labeling, and model optimization,
providing a roadmap for future research. Recommendations for further
improvement include the adoption of larger annotated corpora, integration of
self-supervised learning techniques, and exploration of advanced neural
architectures such as Transformers. Overall, this research establishes a strong
baseline for future developments in Arabic dialect recognition within
resource-constrained environments.

TL;DR: This paper enhances audio-tagging for the DCASE 2025 Challenge by introducing spectral roll-off and chroma features, applying agent-based label correction, and refining the training dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address limitations of mel-spectrograms in capturing subtle audio cues within mixed sound scenes.

Method: Incorporated spectral roll-off and chroma features, used agent-based label correction, and refined the dataset by removing irrelevant samples and adding external data.

Result: Demonstrated CA-SDRi improvement of up to 14.7% compared to the baseline for DCASE 2025 Challenge Task 4.

Conclusion: The proposed combination of new features, label refinement, and dataset optimization effectively enhances classification performance.

Abstract: This technical report presents submission systems for Task 4 of the DCASE
2025 Challenge. This model incorporates additional audio features (spectral
roll-off and chroma features) into the embedding feature extracted from the
mel-spectral feature to im-prove the classification capabilities of an
audio-tagging model in the spatial semantic segmentation of sound scenes (S5)
system. This approach is motivated by the fact that mixed audio often contains
subtle cues that are difficult to capture with mel-spectrograms alone. Thus,
these additional features offer alterna-tive perspectives for the model.
Second, an agent-based label correction system is applied to the outputs
processed by the S5 system. This system reduces false positives, improving the
final class-aware signal-to-distortion ratio improvement (CA-SDRi) metric.
Finally, we refine the training dataset to enhance the classi-fication accuracy
of low-performing classes by removing irrele-vant samples and incorporating
external data. That is, audio mix-tures are generated from a limited number of
data points; thus, even a small number of out-of-class data points could
degrade model performance. The experiments demonstrate that the submit-ted
systems employing these approaches relatively improve CA-SDRi by up to 14.7%
compared to the baseline of DCASE 2025 Challenge Task 4.

TL;DR: The paper introduces ThinkSound, a framework combining Chain-of-Thought reasoning and multimodal models to enhance video-to-audio generation by producing high-fidelity, interactive audio tailored to visual content.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing video-to-audio generation methods struggle to capture nuanced, high-fidelity audio that aligns with complex visual attributes, requiring thoughtful reasoning about dynamics, environments, and temporal context.

Method: ThinkSound employs a three-step approach: foundational foley generation for coherent soundscapes, object-specific refinements via user input, and natural language-guided audio editing. A multimodal language model provides context-aware Chain-of-Thought reasoning during each stage.

Result: Experiments show ThinkSound outperforms existing methods in video-to-audio conversion, delivering state-of-the-art results on standard audio and reasoning metrics and surpassing benchmarks like Movie Gen Audio.

Conclusion: ThinkSound advances video-to-audio generation by integrating structured reasoning and multimodal modeling, enabling high-quality and context-aware audio synthesis for diverse applications.

Abstract: While end-to-end video-to-audio generation has greatly improved, producing
high-fidelity audio that authentically captures the nuances of visual content
remains challenging. Like professionals in the creative industries, such
generation requires sophisticated reasoning about items such as visual
dynamics, acoustic environments, and temporal relationships. We present
\textbf{ThinkSound}, a novel framework that leverages Chain-of-Thought (CoT)
reasoning to enable stepwise, interactive audio generation and editing for
videos. Our approach decomposes the process into three complementary stages:
foundational foley generation that creates semantically coherent soundscapes,
interactive object-centric refinement through precise user interactions, and
targeted editing guided by natural language instructions. At each stage, a
multimodal large language model generates contextually aligned CoT reasoning
that guides a unified audio foundation model. Furthermore, we introduce
\textbf{AudioCoT}, a comprehensive dataset with structured reasoning
annotations that establishes connections between visual content, textual
descriptions, and sound synthesis. Experiments demonstrate that ThinkSound
achieves state-of-the-art performance in video-to-audio generation across both
audio metrics and CoT metrics and excels in out-of-distribution Movie Gen Audio
benchmark. The demo page is available at https://ThinkSound-Demo.github.io.

### [337] [Poster: Enhancing GNN Robustness for Network Intrusion Detection via Agent-based Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20806)
*Zhonghao Zhan,Huichi Zhou,Hamed Haddadi*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The study enhances Graph Neural Network (GNN)-based Network Intrusion Detection Systems (NIDS) by incorporating Large Language Models (LLMs) for mitigating distribution drift and adversarial attacks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the performance degradation of GNN-based NIDS caused by distribution drift and limited robustness against realistic adversarial attacks, identified as critical challenges in IoT security.

Method: The researchers introduce an agentic pipeline where LLMs act as simulated cybersecurity expert agents. These agents analyze graph structures from network flow data to identify and mitigate adversarial elements before they are processed by GNNs.

Result: Experiments using realistic adversarial attack scenarios and a dataset from physical testbeds show that the integration of LLMs improves the robustness of GNN-based NIDS.

Conclusion: Incorporating LLMs enhances GNN-NIDS resilience, making them better suited for real-world adversarial challenges and showcasing the benefit of combining GNNs with LLM-based analysis.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) show great promise for Network Intrusion
Detection Systems (NIDS), particularly in IoT environments, but suffer
performance degradation due to distribution drift and lack robustness against
realistic adversarial attacks. Current robustness evaluations often rely on
unrealistic synthetic perturbations and lack demonstrations on systematic
analysis of different kinds of adversarial attack, which encompass both
black-box and white-box scenarios. This work proposes a novel approach to
enhance GNN robustness and generalization by employing Large Language Models
(LLMs) in an agentic pipeline as simulated cybersecurity expert agents. These
agents scrutinize graph structures derived from network flow data, identifying
and potentially mitigating suspicious or adversarially perturbed elements
before GNN processing. Our experiments, using a framework designed for
realistic evaluation and testing with a variety of adversarial attacks
including a dataset collected from physical testbed experiments, demonstrate
that integrating LLM analysis can significantly improve the resilience of
GNN-based NIDS against challenges, showcasing the potential of LLM agent as a
complementary layer in intrusion detection architectures.

*Mina Namazi,Alexander Nemecek,Erman Ayday*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This paper introduces ZKPROV, a cryptographic framework enabling zero-knowledge proofs to ensure LLM training provenance without revealing sensitive data or model details.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the critical need for verifying computational provenance of large language models (LLMs) in sensitive, regulated domains like healthcare, where dataset integrity and confidentiality are paramount.

Method: ZKPROV uses zero-knowledge proofs to bind trained models to their authorized datasets through dataset-signed metadata and parameter commitments, avoiding the computational expense of verifying every training step.

Result: ZKPROV proves efficient and scalable in experiments, offering a practical solution for verifying LLM training provenance while maintaining confidentiality.

Conclusion: ZKPROV enables privacy-preserving and sound assurances of LLM provenance, offering a secure and efficient tool for real-world deployment in regulated sectors.

Abstract: As the deployment of large language models (LLMs) grows in sensitive domains,
ensuring the integrity of their computational provenance becomes a critical
challenge, particularly in regulated sectors such as healthcare, where strict
requirements are applied in dataset usage. We introduce ZKPROV, a novel
cryptographic framework that enables zero-knowledge proofs of LLM provenance.
It allows users to verify that a model is trained on a reliable dataset without
revealing sensitive information about it or its parameters. Unlike prior
approaches that focus on complete verification of the training process
(incurring significant computational cost) or depend on trusted execution
environments, ZKPROV offers a distinct balance. Our method cryptographically
binds a trained model to its authorized training dataset(s) through
zero-knowledge proofs while avoiding proof of every training step. By
leveraging dataset-signed metadata and compact model parameter commitments,
ZKPROV provides sound and privacy-preserving assurances that the result of the
LLM is derived from a model trained on the claimed authorized and relevant
dataset. Experimental results demonstrate the efficiency and scalability of the
ZKPROV in generating this proof and verifying it, achieving a practical
solution for real-world deployments. We also provide formal security
guarantees, proving that our approach preserves dataset confidentiality while
ensuring trustworthy dataset provenance.

*Osama Zafar,Rosemarie Santa González,Mina Namazi,Alfonso Morales,Erman Ayday*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper proposes a privacy-preserving framework that ensures secure data sharing in agriculture through methods like PCA and differential privacy, mitigating privacy concerns while maintaining data utility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address privacy concerns that deter farmers from sharing agricultural data for research and collaboration.

Method: The framework combines dimensionality reduction techniques like PCA with differential privacy mechanisms (e.g., Laplacian noise) to protect sensitive data.

Result: The framework effectively protects privacy against adversarial attacks while maintaining utility comparable to centralized systems, as validated on real datasets.

Conclusion: The adoption of this framework can enable secure data sharing and collaboration, fostering responsible innovation and sustainable development in data-driven agriculture.

Abstract: Data-driven agriculture, which integrates technology and data into
agricultural practices, has the potential to improve crop yield, disease
resilience, and long-term soil health. However, privacy concerns, such as
adverse pricing, discrimination, and resource manipulation, deter farmers from
sharing data, as it can be used against them. To address this barrier, we
propose a privacy-preserving framework that enables secure data sharing and
collaboration for research and development while mitigating privacy risks. The
framework combines dimensionality reduction techniques (like Principal
Component Analysis (PCA)) and differential privacy by introducing Laplacian
noise to protect sensitive information. The proposed framework allows
researchers to identify potential collaborators for a target farmer and train
personalized machine learning models either on the data of identified
collaborators via federated learning or directly on the aggregated
privacy-protected data. It also allows farmers to identify potential
collaborators based on similarities. We have validated this on real-life
datasets, demonstrating robust privacy protection against adversarial attacks
and utility performance comparable to a centralized system. We demonstrate how
this framework can facilitate collaboration among farmers and help researchers
pursue broader research objectives. The adoption of the framework can empower
researchers and policymakers to leverage agricultural data responsibly, paving
the way for transformative advances in data-driven agriculture. By addressing
critical privacy challenges, this work supports secure data integration,
fostering innovation and sustainability in agricultural systems.

*He Li,Haoang Chi,Mingyu Liu,Wanrong Huang,Liyang Xu,Wenjing Yang*

Main category: stat.ME

TL;DR: This paper introduces a novel framework utilizing Transformers for estimating counterfactual outcomes with spatial-temporal attributes, improving performance over classical models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Estimating counterfactual outcomes with spatial-temporal attributes is important for understanding complex real-world problems, but existing statistical models face performance and generalization issues.

Method: The framework employs Transformers for better estimation and establishes consistency and asymptotic normality under certain assumptions. Validation is conducted through simulation experiments and real-world data analysis.

Result: The proposed estimator outperforms traditional methods in simulations and elucidates the causal relationship between conflicts and forest loss in Colombia using real-world data.

Conclusion: The framework demonstrates significant improvements in counterfactual estimation with spatial-temporal attributes, with practical insights into environmental impacts in conflict zones.

Abstract: The real world naturally has dimensions of time and space. Therefore,
estimating the counterfactual outcomes with spatial-temporal attributes is a
crucial problem. However, previous methods are based on classical statistical
models, which still have limitations in performance and generalization. This
paper proposes a novel framework for estimating counterfactual outcomes with
spatial-temporal attributes using the Transformer, exhibiting stronger
estimation ability. Under mild assumptions, the proposed estimator within this
framework is consistent and asymptotically normal. To validate the
effectiveness of our approach, we conduct simulation experiments and real data
experiments. Simulation experiments show that our estimator has a stronger
estimation capability than baseline methods. Real data experiments provide a
valuable conclusion to the causal effect of conflicts on forest loss in
Colombia. The source code is available at

Main category: physics.geo-ph

TL;DR: The paper compares Temporal Fusion Transformers (TFTs) with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks for rainfall-runoff modeling, emphasizing TFT's slight edge, especially for handling longer sequences and providing scientific insights.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether Temporal Fusion Transformers offer advantages over Long Short-Term Memory networks in hydrological sequence modeling, especially regarding performance and explainability.

Method: Researchers trained and tested ten models of both TFT and LSTM across 531 catchments in the CAMELS dataset and five subsets of the Caravan dataset, evaluating their performance and variability in different regional contexts.

Result: TFT marginally outperformed LSTM, especially in simulating hydrograph midsections and peaks. It also highlighted key variables as an explainable AI technique but showed performance drops with Caravan datasets.

Conclusion: The study indicates TFT's potential as a valuable tool for hydrological modeling with enhanced capabilities and better scientific insights, despite challenges posed by certain datasets.

Abstract: Combining attention with recurrence has shown to be valuable in sequence
modeling, including hydrological predictions. Here, we explore the strength of
Temporal Fusion Transformers (TFTs) over Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks
in rainfall-runoff modeling. We train ten randomly initialized models, TFT and
LSTM, for 531 CAMELS catchments in the US. We repeat the experiment with five
subsets of the Caravan dataset, each representing catchments in the US,
Australia, Brazil, Great Britain, and Chile. Then, the performance of the
models, their variability regarding the catchment attributes, and the
difference according to the datasets are assessed. Our findings show that TFT
slightly outperforms LSTM, especially in simulating the midsection and peak of
hydrographs. Furthermore, we show the ability of TFT to handle longer sequences
and why it can be a better candidate for higher or larger catchments. Being an
explainable AI technique, TFT identifies the key dynamic and static variables,
providing valuable scientific insights. However, both TFT and LSTM exhibit a
considerable drop in performance with the Caravan dataset, indicating possible
data quality issues. Overall, the study highlights the potential of TFT in
improving hydrological modeling and understanding.

Main category: astro-ph.IM

TL;DR: This paper proposes a Bayesian model for analyzing astrophysical signals, which efficiently separates various emission components and diagnoses model errors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Modern observatories produce complex astrophysical data, necessitating robust methods to reconstruct signals corrupted by noise and instrumental effects.

Method: The authors develop a multi-frequency Bayesian framework leveraging latent-space tensions to identify model misspecifications and guide the separation of astrophysical components.

Result: The approach successfully separates diffuse, point-like, and extended emissions with high accuracy, demonstrated on synthetic data and eROSITA X-ray observations.

Conclusion: The proposed method offers a versatile tool for astrophysical data analysis, emphasizing its applicability to next-generation astronomical surveys.

Abstract: Modern observatories are designed to deliver increasingly detailed views of
astrophysical signals. To fully realize the potential of these observations,
principled data-analysis methods are required to effectively separate and
reconstruct the underlying astrophysical components from data corrupted by
noise and instrumental effects. In this work, we introduce a novel
multi-frequency Bayesian model of the sky emission field that leverages
latent-space tension as an indicator of model misspecification, enabling
automated separation of diffuse, point-like, and extended astrophysical
emission components across wavelength bands. Deviations from latent-space prior
expectations are used as diagnostics for model misspecification, thus
systematically guiding the introduction of new sky components, such as
point-like and extended sources. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this
method on synthetic multi-frequency imaging data and apply it to observational
X-ray data from the eROSITA Early Data Release (EDR) of the SN1987A region in
the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC). Our results highlight the method's capability
to reconstruct astrophysical components with high accuracy, achieving sub-pixel
localization of point sources, robust separation of extended emission, and
detailed uncertainty quantification. The developed methodology offers a general
and well-founded framework applicable to a wide variety of astronomical
datasets, and is therefore well suited to support the analysis needs of
next-generation multi-wavelength and multi-messenger surveys.

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: This paper explores the effects of haptic feedback on walking behavior in dense VR pedestrian flows.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how haptic feedback influences collision avoidance and walking behaviors in virtual environments, especially in crowded pedestrian scenarios.

Method: A user study was conducted, analyzing walking motion and collision avoidance behaviors in VR, with and without haptic feedback, using metrics like trajectory length, pelvis angle, and lateral position.

Result: Haptic feedback increased walking trajectory length, pelvis angle changes, lateral position displacements, and users' responsiveness to collisions. It also enhanced awareness, visual exploration, and walking speed variability.

Conclusion: Haptic feedback enhances users' sensitivity and responses in dense VR pedestrian environments, improving collision awareness and adaptation.

Abstract: Human crowd simulation in virtual reality (VR) is a powerful tool with
potential applications including emergency evacuation training and assessment
of building layout. While haptic feedback in VR enhances immersive experience,
its effect on walking behavior in dense and dynamic pedestrian flows is
unknown. Through a user study, we investigated how haptic feedback changes user
walking motion in crowded pedestrian flows in VR. The results indicate that
haptic feedback changed users' collision avoidance movements, as measured by
increased walking trajectory length and change in pelvis angle. The
displacements of users' lateral position and pelvis angle were also increased
in the instantaneous response to a collision with a non-player character (NPC),
even when the NPC was inside the field of view. Haptic feedback also enhanced
users' awareness and visual exploration when an NPC approached from the side
and back. Furthermore, variation in walking speed was increased by the haptic
feedback. These results suggested that the haptic feedback enhanced users'
sensitivity to a collision in VR environment.

*Jingshu Li,Zicheng Zhu,Renwen Zhang,Yi-Chieh Lee*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: The study investigates how chatbot anthropomorphism impacts human empathy and willingness to assist chatbots, finding that human identity and emotional expression foster prosocial behaviors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address a research gap in understanding the factors that motivate humans to help chatbots, a direction that offers benefits such as improved chatbot performance and human well-being.

Method: The researchers conducted an online experiment involving 244 participants, where chatbots made mistakes in a task and provided explanations. Various measures of human empathy and prosocial behaviors toward chatbots were analyzed.

Result: Human-like identity and emotional expression by chatbots resulted in increased empathy and prosocial behavior from participants. Empathy served as a mediating factor.

Conclusion: Enhancing chatbot anthropomorphism can effectively promote human empathy and prosocial behaviors, suggesting new ways to improve human-chatbot collaborations.

Abstract: Chatbots are increasingly integrated into people's lives and are widely used
to help people. Recently, there has also been growing interest in the reverse
direction-humans help chatbots-due to a wide range of benefits including better
chatbot performance, human well-being, and collaborative outcomes. However,
little research has explored the factors that motivate people to help chatbots.
To address this gap, we draw on the Computers Are Social Actors (CASA)
framework to examine how chatbot anthropomorphism-including human-like
identity, emotional expression, and non-verbal expression-influences human
empathy toward chatbots and their subsequent prosocial behaviors and
intentions. We also explore people's own interpretations of their prosocial
behaviors toward chatbots. We conducted an online experiment (N = 244) in which
chatbots made mistakes in a collaborative image labeling task and explained the
reasons to participants. We then measured participants' prosocial behaviors and
intentions toward the chatbots. Our findings revealed that human identity and
emotional expression of chatbots increased participants' prosocial behavior and
intention toward chatbots, with empathy mediating these effects. Qualitative
analysis further identified two motivations for participants' prosocial
behaviors: empathy for the chatbot and perceiving the chatbot as human-like. We
discuss the implications of these results for understanding and promoting human
prosocial behaviors toward chatbots.

*Hong Wang,Natalia Calvo-Barajas,Katie Winkle,Ginevra Castellano*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: The study investigates how a robot's transparency and sociability influence trust and decision-making when its information conflicts with a user's memory, highlighting user tendencies to overtrust robots.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the effects of robotic transparency and sociability on user trust and decision-making, particularly when robots provide conflicting healthcare information.

Method: An online study with 176 participants who watched videos of a Furhat robot acting as a family healthcare assistant. Transparency and sociability levels were varied in a 2x2 between-subjects design.

Result: Transparency affected how users interpreted discrepancies. Low transparency led to users doubting their memory, while high transparency prompted attribution to external causes. Users tended to overtrust the robot's recommendations even when suspecting malfunctions or interference.

Conclusion: Transparency mechanisms in robots influence user behavior and decision-making. While transparency improves understanding, risks like overtrust and inappropriate reliance on robots in healthcare demand attention.

Abstract: Advancements in robotic capabilities for providing physical assistance,
psychological support, and daily health management are making the deployment of
intelligent healthcare robots in home environments increasingly feasible in the
near future. However, challenges arise when the information provided by these
robots contradicts users' memory, raising concerns about user trust and
decision-making. This paper presents a study that examines how varying a
robot's level of transparency and sociability influences user interpretation,
decision-making and perceived trust when faced with conflicting information
from a robot. In a 2 x 2 between-subjects online study, 176 participants
watched videos of a Furhat robot acting as a family healthcare assistant and
suggesting a fictional user to take medication at a different time from that
remembered by the user. Results indicate that robot transparency influenced
users' interpretation of information discrepancies: with a low transparency
robot, the most frequent assumption was that the user had not correctly
remembered the time, while with the high transparency robot, participants were
more likely to attribute the discrepancy to external factors, such as a partner
or another household member modifying the robot's information. Additionally,
participants exhibited a tendency toward overtrust, often prioritizing the
robot's recommendations over the user's memory, even when suspecting system
malfunctions or third-party interference. These findings highlight the impact
of transparency mechanisms in robotic systems, the complexity and importance
associated with system access control for multi-user robots deployed in home
environments, and the potential risks of users' over reliance on robots in
sensitive domains such as healthcare.

Motivation: To provide a foundation for designing co-creative AI systems by analyzing prior works and identifying design dimensions and considerations.

Method: Conducted a systematic literature review of 62 papers on co-creative systems spanning applications like visual arts, design, and writing.

Result: Identified dimensions like creative task, user control, proactive behavior, and extracted 24 design considerations that enhance user satisfaction, trust, and collaboration.

Conclusion: High user control and adaptive proactive systems improve human-AI collaboration. However, early-stage creative support and user adaptation to AI remain areas for improvement.

Abstract: The co creativity community is making significant progress in developing more
sophisticated and tailored systems to support and enhance human creativity.
Design considerations from prior work can serve as a valuable and efficient
foundation for future systems. To support this effort, we conducted a
systematic literature review of 62 papers on co-creative systems. These papers
cover a diverse range of applications, including visual arts, design, and
writing, where the AI acts not just as a tool but as an active collaborator in
the creative process. From this review, we identified several key dimensions
relevant to system design: phase of the creative process, creative task,
proactive behavior of the system, user control, system embodiment, and AI model
type. Our findings suggest that systems offering high user control lead to
greater satisfaction, trust, and a stronger sense of ownership over creative
outcomes. Furthermore, proactive systems, when adaptive and context sensitive,
can enhance collaboration. We also extracted 24 design considerations,
highlighting the value of encouraging users to externalize their thoughts and
of increasing the system's social presence and transparency to foster trust.
Despite recent advancements, important gaps remain, such as limited support for
early creative phases like problem clarification, and challenges related to
user adaptation to AI systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current multimodal models lack the ability to decode mappings and extract structured information from visualizations, hindering effective understanding.

Method: A novel dataset is created combining chart images, vectorized representations, encoding schemes, and data features, enabling large language models to better reconstruct visualization content.

Result: Experimental findings highlight enhanced data extraction accuracy and superior chart reconstruction quality.

Conclusion: Specialized training enables multimodal LLMs to better understand visualization semantics and improve communication of complex data.

Abstract: Visualizations are crucial for data communication, yet understanding them
requires comprehension of both visual elements and their underlying data
relationships. Current multimodal large models, while effective in natural
image understanding, struggle with visualization due to their inability to
decode the data-to-visual mapping rules and extract structured information. To
address these challenges, we present a novel dataset and train multimodal
visualization LLMs specifically designed for understanding. Our approach
combines chart images with their corresponding vectorized representations,
encoding schemes, and data features. The proposed vector format enables compact
and accurate reconstruction of visualization content. Experimental results
demonstrate significant improvements in both data extraction accuracy and chart
reconstruction quality.

*Chi-Sheng Chen,Xinyu Zhang,Ya-Chuan Chen*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: The paper introduces a hybrid quantum-classical reinforcement learning framework for sector rotation in the Taiwan stock market, comparing classical and quantum-enhanced models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the potential of quantum-enhanced reinforcement learning models in financial applications and understand their challenges.

Method: The framework uses Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) with both classical architectures (LSTM, Transformer) and quantum models (QNN, QRWKV, QASA) as policy and value networks, supported by automated feature engineering for model input consistency.

Result: Quantum-enhanced models achieve higher rewards during training but underperform classical models in real-world metrics, indicating a mismatch between reward signals and investment objectives.

Conclusion: The study highlights optimization instability challenges of quantum circuits and suggests improvements such as reward shaping, regularization, and early stopping to address practical issues in applying quantum reinforcement learning to finance.

Abstract: We propose a hybrid quantum-classical reinforcement learning framework for
sector rotation in the Taiwan stock market. Our system employs Proximal Policy
Optimization (PPO) as the backbone algorithm and integrates both classical
architectures (LSTM, Transformer) and quantum-enhanced models (QNN, QRWKV,
QASA) as policy and value networks. An automated feature engineering pipeline
extracts financial indicators from capital share data to ensure consistent
model input across all configurations. Empirical backtesting reveals a key
finding: although quantum-enhanced models consistently achieve higher training
rewards, they underperform classical models in real-world investment metrics
such as cumulative return and Sharpe ratio. This discrepancy highlights a core
challenge in applying reinforcement learning to financial domains -- namely,
the mismatch between proxy reward signals and true investment objectives. Our
analysis suggests that current reward designs may incentivize overfitting to
short-term volatility rather than optimizing risk-adjusted returns. This issue
is compounded by the inherent expressiveness and optimization instability of
quantum circuits under Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) constraints. We
discuss the implications of this reward-performance gap and propose directions
for future improvement, including reward shaping, model regularization, and
validation-based early stopping. Our work offers a reproducible benchmark and
critical insights into the practical challenges of deploying quantum
reinforcement learning in real-world finance.

TL;DR: scMamba is a new method for integrating single-cell multi-omics data that avoids feature selection. It utilizes innovative patch-based tokenization and contrastive learning for superior results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for single-cell multi-omics integration often lose important biological information due to the need for feature selection.

Method: scMamba employs a foundation model with a patch-based cell tokenization strategy and a novel contrastive learning approach enhanced by cosine similarity regularization.

Result: scMamba shows superior performance in preserving biological variation, aligning omics layers, and improving downstream tasks like clustering, annotation, and trajectory inference.

Conclusion: scMamba is a robust and scalable tool for biological discovery through single-cell multi-omics integration, outperforming existing methods.

Abstract: The advent of single-cell multi-omics technologies has enabled the
simultaneous profiling of diverse omics layers within individual cells.
Integrating such multimodal data provides unprecedented insights into cellular
identity, regulatory processes, and disease mechanisms. However, it remains
challenging, as current methods often rely on selecting highly variable genes
or peaks during preprocessing, which may inadvertently discard crucial
biological information. Here, we present scMamba, a foundation model designed
to integrate single-cell multi-omics data without the need for prior feature
selection while preserving genomic positional information. scMamba introduces a
patch-based cell tokenization strategy that treats genomics regions as words
(tokens) and cells as sentences. Building upon the concept of state space
duality, scMamba distills rich biological insights from high-dimensional,
sparse single-cell multi-omics data. Additionally, our novel contrastive
learning approach, enhanced with cosine similarity regularization, enables
superior alignment across omics layers compared to traditional methods.
Systematic benchmarking across multiple datasets demonstrates that scMamba
significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in preserving biological
variation, aligning omics layers, and enhancing key downstream tasks such as
clustering, cell type annotation, and trajectory inference. Our findings
position scMamba as a powerful tool for large-scale single-cell multi-omics
integration, capable of handling large-scale atlases and advancing biological
discovery.

### [352] [Faster Fixed-Point Methods for Multichain MDPs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20910)
*Matthew Zurek,Yudong Chen*

Main category: math.OC

TL;DR: This paper proposes improved value-iteration algorithms for solving multichain Markov decision processes under the average-reward criterion, achieving faster convergence and addressing key theoretical challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the fundamental challenges in solving multichain Markov decision processes under the average-reward criterion, including non-contractivity, the non-uniqueness of solutions, and the navigation subproblem.

Method: The authors develop algorithms that effectively handle the navigation subproblem and strengthen convergence by leveraging new connections between discounted and average-reward problems, employing optimal fixed-point methods, achieving sublinear convergence rates, and refining suboptimality decompositions.

Result: The proposed algorithms exhibit improved convergence rates and sharper complexity bounds compared to existing methods, with theoretical components applicable to broader settings.

Conclusion: The study enhances the theoretical foundations of value-iteration approaches for average-reward problems, achieving faster convergence rates and contributing novel insights into solving multichain MDPs.

Abstract: We study value-iteration (VI) algorithms for solving general (a.k.a.
multichain) Markov decision processes (MDPs) under the average-reward
criterion, a fundamental but theoretically challenging setting. Beyond the
difficulties inherent to all average-reward problems posed by the lack of
contractivity and non-uniqueness of solutions to the Bellman operator, in the
multichain setting an optimal policy must solve the navigation subproblem of
steering towards the best connected component, in addition to optimizing
long-run performance within each component. We develop algorithms which better
solve this navigational subproblem in order to achieve faster convergence for
multichain MDPs, obtaining improved rates of convergence and sharper measures
of complexity relative to prior work. Many key components of our results are of
potential independent interest, including novel connections between
average-reward and discounted problems, optimal fixed-point methods for
discounted VI which extend to general Banach spaces, new sublinear convergence
rates for the discounted value error, and refined suboptimality decompositions
for multichain MDPs. Overall our results yield faster convergence rates for
discounted and average-reward problems and expand the theoretical foundations
of VI approaches.

### [353] [Control and optimization for Neural Partial Differential Equations in Supervised Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20764)
*Alain Bensoussan,Minh-Binh Tran,Bangjie Wang*

Main category: math.OC

TL;DR: The paper explores a novel control and optimization problem in PDEs, interpreting neural networks as PDEs and focusing on the coefficients of parabolic and hyperbolic operators.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Controlling and optimizing coefficients in operators of PDEs have not been adequately studied, despite their relevance in neural networks and supervised learning.

Method: The authors reformulate neural network problems into control problems for PDEs, propose a dual system for parabolic PDEs, and provide theoretical proofs for control existence in parabolic and hyperbolic cases.

Result: They demonstrate minimizers for parabolic PDEs and prove existence solutions for an approximated control problem with hyperbolic PDEs.

Conclusion: This work initiates a new research avenue in PDE control theory, particularly targeting coefficient optimization in neural networks.

Abstract: Although there is a substantial body of literature on control and
optimization problems for parabolic and hyperbolic systems, the specific
problem of controlling and optimizing the coefficients of the associated
operators within such systems has not yet been thoroughly explored. In this
work, we aim to initiate a line of research in control theory focused on
optimizing and controlling the coefficients of these operators-a problem that
naturally arises in the context of neural networks and supervised learning.
  In supervised learning, the primary objective is to transport initial data
toward target data through the layers of a neural network. We propose a novel
perspective: neural networks can be interpreted as partial differential
equations (PDEs). From this viewpoint, the control problem traditionally
studied in the context of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) is
reformulated as a control problem for PDEs, specifically targeting the
optimization and control of coefficients in parabolic and hyperbolic operators.
To the best of our knowledge, this specific problem has not yet been
systematically addressed in the control theory of PDEs.
  To this end, we propose a dual system formulation for the control and
optimization problem associated with parabolic PDEs, laying the groundwork for
the development of efficient numerical schemes in future research. We also
provide a theoretical proof showing that the control and optimization problem
for parabolic PDEs admits minimizers. Finally, we investigate the control
problem associated with hyperbolic PDEs and prove the existence of solutions
for a corresponding approximated control problem.

TL;DR: VideoTex is a framework for synthesis of seamless and coherent 3D textures using video generation models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing spatial and temporal inconsistencies in 3D texture synthesis by leveraging recent successes in video generation models.

Method: Uses a geometry-aware condition approach combined with a structure-wise UV diffusion strategy to improve texture quality and coherence.

Result: VideoTex achieves smoother transitions across UV boundaries, high-quality textures, and strong temporal stability over video frames.

Conclusion: VideoTex significantly outperforms previous methods, providing high fidelity textures and seamless transitions suitable for dynamic real-time applications.

Abstract: Current texture synthesis methods, which generate textures from fixed
viewpoints, suffer from inconsistencies due to the lack of global context and
geometric understanding. Meanwhile, recent advancements in video generation
models have demonstrated remarkable success in achieving temporally consistent
videos. In this paper, we introduce VideoTex, a novel framework for seamless
texture synthesis that leverages video generation models to address both
spatial and temporal inconsistencies in 3D textures. Our approach incorporates
geometry-aware conditions, enabling precise utilization of 3D mesh structures.
Additionally, we propose a structure-wise UV diffusion strategy, which enhances
the generation of occluded areas by preserving semantic information, resulting
in smoother and more coherent textures. VideoTex not only achieves smoother
transitions across UV boundaries but also ensures high-quality, temporally
stable textures across video frames. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
VideoTex outperforms existing methods in texture fidelity, seam blending, and
stability, paving the way for dynamic real-time applications that demand both
visual quality and temporal coherence.

### [355] [Generative Blocks World: Moving Things Around in Pictures](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20703)
*Vaibhav Vavilala,Seemandhar Jain,Rahul Vasanth,D. A. Forsyth,Anand Bhattad*

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: The paper introduces Generative Blocks World, a framework for generating and editing images by manipulating scenes composed of 3D geometric primitives, producing superior visual fidelity and editability over previous methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable more flexible, accurate, and consistent editing of generated images by representing scenes through geometrically abstract 3D primitives.

Method: Scenes are represented using assemblies of convex 3D primitives, with variable granularity, and edited geometry is then used for image generation via a flow-based method conditioned on depth and texture hints.

Result: Quantitative and qualitative tests showed that the approach offers higher visual fidelity, improved editability, and better compositional generalization compared to prior techniques.

Conclusion: The method provides a new way to interact with generated images, offering more precise control over scene manipulation while preserving object identities and ensuring consistent textures.

Abstract: We describe Generative Blocks World to interact with the scene of a generated
image by manipulating simple geometric abstractions. Our method represents
scenes as assemblies of convex 3D primitives, and the same scene can be
represented by different numbers of primitives, allowing an editor to move
either whole structures or small details. Once the scene geometry has been
edited, the image is generated by a flow-based method which is conditioned on
depth and a texture hint. Our texture hint takes into account the modified 3D
primitives, exceeding texture-consistency provided by existing key-value
caching techniques. These texture hints (a) allow accurate object and camera
moves and (b) largely preserve the identity of objects depicted. Quantitative
and qualitative experiments demonstrate that our approach outperforms prior
works in visual fidelity, editability, and compositional generalization.

### [356] [3DGH: 3D Head Generation with Composable Hair and Face](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20875)
*Chengan He,Junxuan Li,Tobias Kirschstein,Artem Sevastopolsky,Shunsuke Saito,Qingyang Tan,Javier Romero,Chen Cao,Holly Rushmeier,Giljoo Nam*

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: The paper presents 3DGH, a generative model for 3D human heads that separates hair and face modeling using template-based 3D Gaussian Splatting and dual generators.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the entangled modeling of hair and face in previous 3D head synthesis methods by introducing a novel separation framework.

Method: The method involves using a template-based 3D Gaussian Splatting representation with deformable hair geometry, dual GAN-based generators, and a cross-attention mechanism to model hair-face correlation. Training is stabilized by objectives tailored for hair-face separation.

Result: 3DGH demonstrates effective and high-quality results in unconditional 3D head image generation and 3D hairstyle editing, outperforming state-of-the-art GAN methods.

Conclusion: The approach provides a new way of composable modeling for 3D human heads, allowing for independent editing of hair and face components while maintaining the correlation between them.

Abstract: We present 3DGH, an unconditional generative model for 3D human heads with
composable hair and face components. Unlike previous work that entangles the
modeling of hair and face, we propose to separate them using a novel data
representation with template-based 3D Gaussian Splatting, in which deformable
hair geometry is introduced to capture the geometric variations across
different hairstyles. Based on this data representation, we design a 3D
GAN-based architecture with dual generators and employ a cross-attention
mechanism to model the inherent correlation between hair and face. The model is
trained on synthetic renderings using carefully designed objectives to
stabilize training and facilitate hair-face separation. We conduct extensive
experiments to validate the design choice of 3DGH, and evaluate it both
qualitatively and quantitatively by comparing with several state-of-the-art 3D
GAN methods, demonstrating its effectiveness in unconditional full-head image
synthesis and composable 3D hairstyle editing. More details will be available

### [357] [FairyGen: Storied Cartoon Video from a Single Child-Drawn Character](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21272)
*Jiayi Zheng,Xiaodong Cun*

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: FairyGen is a system for creating story-driven cartoon videos from a single child's drawing, preserving artistic style via advanced techniques like storyboard generation, style propagation, shot design, and 3D modeling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to overcome limitations in existing storytelling methods, such as lack of style preservation and cinematic diversity, to create personalized artistic animations.

Method: FairyGen employs MLLM to generate structured storyboards, adapts visual styles with a propagation adapter, enhances cinematic design via multi-view synthesis, and leverages a two-stage motion adapter for realistic animation.

Result: Experiments show FairyGen generates animations that are visually consistent, stylistically faithful, and narratively engaging based on given inputs.

Conclusion: FairyGen demonstrates the capability to produce cartoons that align with artistic vision and storytelling needs, offering a new approach to personalized story animation creation.

Abstract: We propose FairyGen, an automatic system for generating story-driven cartoon
videos from a single child's drawing, while faithfully preserving its unique
artistic style. Unlike previous storytelling methods that primarily focus on
character consistency and basic motion, FairyGen explicitly disentangles
character modeling from stylized background generation and incorporates
cinematic shot design to support expressive and coherent storytelling. Given a
single character sketch, we first employ an MLLM to generate a structured
storyboard with shot-level descriptions that specify environment settings,
character actions, and camera perspectives. To ensure visual consistency, we
introduce a style propagation adapter that captures the character's visual
style and applies it to the background, faithfully retaining the character's
full visual identity while synthesizing style-consistent scenes. A shot design
module further enhances visual diversity and cinematic quality through frame
cropping and multi-view synthesis based on the storyboard. To animate the
story, we reconstruct a 3D proxy of the character to derive physically
plausible motion sequences, which are then used to fine-tune an MMDiT-based
image-to-video diffusion model. We further propose a two-stage motion
customization adapter: the first stage learns appearance features from
temporally unordered frames, disentangling identity from motion; the second
stage models temporal dynamics using a timestep-shift strategy with frozen
identity weights. Once trained, FairyGen directly renders diverse and coherent
video scenes aligned with the storyboard. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that our system produces animations that are stylistically faithful,
narratively structured natural motion, highlighting its potential for
personalized and engaging story animation. The code will be available at

### [358] [Enhancing Homophily-Heterophily Separation: Relation-Aware Learning in Heterogeneous Graphs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20980)
*Ziyu Zheng,Yaming Yang,Ziyu Guan,Wei Zhao,Weigang Lu*

Main category: cs.SI

TL;DR: The paper introduces RASH, a contrastive learning framework for tackling node heterophily in heterogeneous graphs, leveraging dual hypergraphs and multi-relation contrastive loss to separate homophilic and heterophilic patterns.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Node heterophily is prevalent in real-world networks, particularly in heterogeneous graphs, but existing methods fail to adequately address both heterogeneity and heterophily simultaneously.

Method: RASH employs dual heterogeneous hypergraphs to dynamically separate homophilic and heterophilic patterns and introduces a multi-relation contrastive loss to maximize mutual information across views.

Result: Experiments on benchmark datasets verify the effectiveness of RASH across a variety of downstream tasks.

Conclusion: RASH effectively models and resolves node heterophily and heterogeneity in heterogeneous graphs, presenting significant improvements over existing methods.

Abstract: Real-world networks usually have a property of node heterophily, that is, the
connected nodes usually have different features or different labels. This
heterophily issue has been extensively studied in homogeneous graphs but
remains under-explored in heterogeneous graphs, where there are multiple types
of nodes and edges. Capturing node heterophily in heterogeneous graphs is very
challenging since both node/edge heterogeneity and node heterophily should be
carefully taken into consideration. Existing methods typically convert
heterogeneous graphs into homogeneous ones to learn node heterophily, which
will inevitably lose the potential heterophily conveyed by heterogeneous
relations. To bridge this gap, we propose Relation-Aware Separation of
Homophily and Heterophily (RASH), a novel contrastive learning framework that
explicitly models high-order semantics of heterogeneous interactions and
adaptively separates homophilic and heterophilic patterns. Particularly, RASH
introduces dual heterogeneous hypergraphs to encode multi-relational bipartite
subgraphs and dynamically constructs homophilic graphs and heterophilic graphs
based on relation importance. A multi-relation contrastive loss is designed to
align heterogeneous and homophilic/heterophilic views by maximizing mutual
information. In this way, RASH simultaneously resolves the challenges of
heterogeneity and heterophily in heterogeneous graphs. Extensive experiments on
benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of RASH across various
downstream tasks. The code is available at:

### [359] [Structural System Identification via Validation and Adaptation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20799)
*Cristian López,Keegan J. Moore*

Main category: math.DS

TL;DR: This paper introduces a neural-network-based method for estimating governing equation parameters of complex systems, focusing on accuracy, uncertainty quantification, and validation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve the integration of experimental data with scientific theory by accurately estimating parameters of governing equations and validating structural system models.

Method: A neural-network-based generative model maps noise to parameters, employs a mean square error loss to compare these to real data, and uses a discriminator network for validation.

Result: The proposed method demonstrates accurate parameter estimation and effective validation in both analytical and real-world nonlinear structural systems.

Conclusion: The approach offers a significant step forward in structural system identification, combining parameter estimation with model validation to bridge experimental data and theoretical understanding.

Abstract: Estimating the governing equation parameter values is essential for
integrating experimental data with scientific theory to understand, validate,
and predict the dynamics of complex systems. In this work, we propose a new
method for structural system identification (SI), uncertainty quantification,
and validation directly from data. Inspired by generative modeling frameworks,
a neural network maps random noise to physically meaningful parameters. These
parameters are then used in the known equation of motion to obtain fake
accelerations, which are compared to real training data via a mean square error
loss. To simultaneously validate the learned parameters, we use independent
validation datasets. The generated accelerations from these datasets are
evaluated by a discriminator network, which determines whether the output is
real or fake, and guides the parameter-generator network. Analytical and real
experiments show the parameter estimation accuracy and model validation for
different nonlinear structural systems.
