On\nthe other hand, diffusion models generate a diverse set of SR images, but\nselecting the most trustworthy solution from this set remains a challenge. This\npaper introduces a robust, automated framework for identifying the most\ntrustworthy SR sample from a diffusion-generated set by leveraging the semantic\nreasoning capabilities of vision-language models (VLMs). Specifically, VLMs\nsuch as BLIP-2, GPT-4o, and their variants are prompted with structured queries\nto assess semantic correctness, visual quality, and artifact presence. The\ntop-ranked SR candidates are then ensembled to yield a single trustworthy\noutput in a cost-effective manner. To rigorously assess the validity of\nVLM-selected samples, we propose a novel Trustworthiness Score (TWS) a hybrid\nmetric that quantifies SR reliability based on three complementary components:\nsemantic similarity via CLIP embeddings, structural integrity using SSIM on\nedge maps, and artifact sensitivity through multi-level wavelet decomposition.\nWe empirically show that TWS correlates strongly with human preference in both\nambiguous and natural images, and that VLM-guided selections consistently yield\nhigh TWS values. Compared to conventional metrics like PSNR, LPIPS, which fail\nto reflect information fidelity, our approach offers a principled, scalable,\nand generalizable solution for navigating the uncertainty of the diffusion SR\nspace. By aligning outputs with human expectations and semantic correctness,\nthis work sets a new benchmark for trustworthiness in generative SR.", "AI": {"tldr": "The paper proposes a method to select the most reliable super-resolution (SR) output from diffusion-based models, using vision-language models (VLMs) and a novel Trustworthiness Score (TWS).", "motivation": "Super-resolution (SR) is prone to artifacts and ambiguity, making it unreliable for information-critical tasks.

Unlike previous storytelling methods that primarily focus on\ncharacter consistency and basic motion, FairyGen explicitly disentangles\ncharacter modeling from stylized background generation and incorporates\ncinematic shot design to support expressive and coherent storytelling. Given a\nsingle character sketch, we first employ an MLLM to generate a structured\nstoryboard with shot-level descriptions that specify environment settings,\ncharacter actions, and camera perspectives. To ensure visual consistency, we\nintroduce a style propagation adapter that captures the character's visual\nstyle and applies it to the background, faithfully retaining the character's\nfull visual identity while synthesizing style-consistent scenes. A shot design\nmodule further enhances visual diversity and cinematic quality through frame\ncropping and multi-view synthesis based on the storyboard. To animate the\nstory, we reconstruct a 3D proxy of the character to derive physically\nplausible motion sequences, which are then used to fine-tune an MMDiT-based\nimage-to-video diffusion model. We further propose a two-stage motion\ncustomization adapter: the first stage learns appearance features from\ntemporally unordered frames, disentangling identity from motion; the second\nstage models temporal dynamics using a timestep-shift strategy with frozen\nidentity weights. Once trained, FairyGen directly renders diverse and coherent\nvideo scenes aligned with the storyboard.
