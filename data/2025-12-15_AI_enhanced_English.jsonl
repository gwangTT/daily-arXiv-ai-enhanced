However, these approaches typically rely on supervised learning, assume access to true optimal decisions, and use surrogates for the MILP gradients. In this work, we introduce a proof of concept CORL framework that end to end fine tunes an MILP scheme using reinforcement learning (RL) on real world data to maximize its operational performance.

However, as prompts grow to tens of thousands of tokens, edge hardware performance drops sharply with sequence length due to quadratic prefill cost and rapidly increasing KV-cache bandwidth demands, making inference latency of longer context length a first-order system concern. Recent studies on LLMs expose a fundamental prefill-decode asymmetry: prefill is compute-bound and dominated by dense matrix-matrix operations, whereas decoding is memory-bandwidth-bound and dominated by KV-cache traffic. A static accelerator must provision resources and a single dataflow for both regimes, leading to duplicated attention logic, underutilized fabric, and tight LUT/URAM limits that cap model size and usable context.

To tackle this challenge, we introduce a scalable data synthesis pipeline that transforms noisy rollouts into reliable supervision without human annotation. The core idea is step-level filtering, which evaluates actions individually to retain only correct steps, complemented by reasoning augmentation for improved planning.

Central to this view is the Parity Principle, a homological partition between even-dimensional scaffolds encoding stable content ($\u03a6$) and odd-dimensional flows encoding dynamic context ($\u03a8$).

We formalize this intuition using information theory, defining representational ambiguity as the conditional entropy H(I|R) over possible interpretations I given a representation R. Through experiments on neural networks trained to classify MNIST digits, we demonstrate that relational structures in network connectivity can unambiguously encode representational content. Using both learned decoders and direct geometric matching, we achieve perfect (100%) accuracy for dropout-trained networks and 38% for standard backpropagation in identifying output neuron class identity, despite identical task performance, demonstrating that representational ambiguity can arise orthogonally to behavioral accuracy. We further show that spatial position information of input neurons can be decoded from network connectivity with R2 up to 0.844.

We present an extension of Guarded Interaction Trees to support formal reasoning about context-dependent effects.

Using and reasoning about such effects is challenging since certain compositionality principles no longer hold in the presence of such effects. For example, the so-called ``bind rule'' in modern program logics is no longer valid. The goal of our extension is to support representation and reasoning about context-dependent effects in the most painless way possible. To that end, our extension is conservative: the reasoning principles for context-independent effects remain the same. We use it to give direct-style denotational semantics for higher-order programming languages with call/cc and with delimited continuations. We extend the program logic for Guarded Interaction Trees to account for context-dependent effects, and we use the program logic to prove that the denotational semantics is adequate with respect to the operational semantics. Additionally, we retain the ability to combine multiple effects in a modular way, which we demonstrate by showing type soundness for safe interoperability of a programming language with delimited continuations and a programming language with higher-order store.

These risks restrict the deployment of CodeLLMs in sensitive domains and limit their training datasets to publicly available sources. To mitigate the memorization risk without compromising their task performance, we apply Differential Privacy (DP) to CodeLLMs. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first comprehensive study that systematically evaluates the effectiveness of DP in CodeLLMs. DP adds calibrated noise to the training process to protect individual data points while still allowing the model to learn useful patterns. To this end, we first identify and understand the driving reasons of the memorization behaviour of the CodeLLMs during their fine-tuning. Then, to address this issue, we empirically evaluate the effect of DP on mitigating memorization while preserving code generation capabilities. Our findings show that DP substantially reduces memorization in CodeLLMs across all the tested snippet types. The snippet types most prone to memorization are also the most effectively mitigated by DP. Furthermore, we observe that DP slightly increases perplexity but preserves, and can even enhance, the code generation capabilities of CodeLLMs, which makes it feasible to apply DP in practice without significantly compromising model utility.

Most of the RGB-based navigation systems only guarantee coarse, meter-level accuracy, making them less suitable for the precise positioning phase of mobile manipulation. This gap prevents manipulation policies from operating within the distribution of their training demonstrations, resulting in frequent execution failures. We address this gap by introducing an object-centric imitation learning framework for last-meter navigation, enabling a quadruped mobile manipulator robot to achieve manipulation-ready positioning using only RGB observations from its onboard cameras. Our method conditions the navigation policy on three inputs: goal images, multi-view RGB observations from the onboard cameras, and a text prompt specifying the target object. A language-driven segmentation module and a spatial score-matrix decoder then supply explicit object grounding and relative pose reasoning. Using real-world data from a single object instance within a category, the system generalizes to unseen object instances across diverse environments with challenging lighting and background conditions. To comprehensively evaluate this, we introduce two metrics: an edge-alignment metric, which uses ground truth orientation, and an object-alignment metric, which evaluates how well the robot visually faces the target. Under these metrics, our policy achieves 73.47% success in edge-alignment and 96.94% success in object-alignment when positioning relative to unseen target objects.

We introduce VDAWorld, a framework where a Vision-Language Model (VLM) acts as an intelligent agent to orchestrate this process. The VLM autonomously constructs a grounded (2D or 3D) scene representation by selecting from a suite of vision tools, and accordingly chooses a compatible physics simulator (e.g., rigid body, fluid) to act upon it.

In this paper, we propose a Lightweight 3D Gaussian Splatting (GS) Compression method based on Video codec (LGSCV). First, a two-stage Morton scan is proposed to generate blockwise 2D maps that are friendly for canonical video codecs in which the coding units (CU) are square blocks. A 3D Morton scan is used to permute GS primitives, followed by a 2D Morton scan to map the ordered GS primitives to 2D maps in a blockwise style. However, although the blockwise 2D maps report close performance to the PLAS map in high-bitrate regions, they show a quality collapse at medium-to-low bitrates. Therefore, a principal component analysis (PCA) is used to reduce the dimensionality of spherical harmonics (SH), and a MiniPLAS, which is flexible and fast, is designed to permute the primitives within certain block sizes. Incorporating SH PCA and MiniPLAS leads to a significant gain in rate-distortion (RD) performance, especially at medium and low bitrates. MiniPLAS can also guide the setting of the codec CU size configuration and significantly reduce encoding time. Experimental results on the MPEG dataset demonstrate that the proposed LGSCV achieves over 20% RD gain compared with state-of-the-art methods, while reducing 2D map generation time to approximately 1 second and cutting encoding time by 50%.

Many recent methods represent the world through images, and reduce forecasting to stochastic video generation. Although such methods excel at realism and visual fidelity, predicting pixels is computationally intensive and not directly useful in many applications, as it requires translating RGB into signals useful for decision making. An alternative approach uses features from vision foundation models (VFMs) as world representations, performing deterministic regression to predict future world states. These features can be directly translated into actionable signals such as semantic segmentation and depth, while remaining computationally efficient. However, deterministic regression averages over multiple plausible futures, undermining forecast accuracy by failing to capture uncertainty. To address this crucial limitation, we introduce a generative forecaster that performs autoregressive flow matching in VFM feature space. Our key insight is that generative modeling in this space requires encoding VFM features into a compact latent space suitable for diffusion. We show that this latent space preserves information more effectively than previously used PCA-based alternatives, both for forecasting and other applications, such as image generation. Our latent predictions can be easily decoded into multiple useful and interpretable output modalities: semantic segmentation, depth, surface normals, and even RGB.

First, it employs an autoregressive diffusion paradigm to achieve arbitrary-length video generation. To address the challenge of consistency, our key insight is to decouple the problem into inter-shot consistency and intra-shot coherence. We achieve this through a dual-level cache mechanism: a shot memory caches keyframes from preceding shots to maintain character and scene identity, while a temporal memory retains a history of frames from the current shot to ensure smooth, continuous motion.

Second, for efficient adaptation of CLIP to FSAR, recent work performing fine-tuning via skip-fusion layers (which we refer to as side layers) has significantly reduced memory cost. However, the newly introduced side layers are often difficult to optimize under limited data conditions.

Continual Learning (CL) focuses on long-term retention and mitigating catastrophic forgetting, often without strict real-time constraints. Stream Learning (SL) emphasizes rapid, efficient adaptation to high-frequency data streams, but typically neglects forgetting. Recent efforts have tried to combine these paradigms, yet no clear algorithmic overlap exists. We argue that large in-context tabular models (LTMs) provide a natural bridge for Streaming Continual Learning (SCL).

To clarify this bridge, we show how the SL and CL communities implicitly adopt a divide-to-conquer strategy to manage the tension between plasticity (performing well on the current distribution) and stability (retaining past knowledge), while also imposing a minimal complexity constraint that motivates diversification (avoiding redundancy in what is stored) and retrieval (re-prioritizing past information when needed).

The approach quantifies how the contribution of each element depends on those added before it, revealing patterns that distinguish interaction, independence, and redundancy on a unified scale. When pairwise contributions are visualized as two--dimensional point clouds, redundant pairs form L--shaped patterns where only the first-added element contributes, while synergistic pairs form L--shaped patterns where only elements contribute together.

While implicit neural representations (INRs) have recently established state-of-the-art performance in self-supervised slice-to-volume reconstruction (SVR), they suffer from a critical computational bottleneck: accurately modeling the image acquisition physics requires expensive stochastic Monte Carlo sampling to approximate the point spread function (PSF).

By predicting multiple masked tokens rather than holistic refinement, MGTs exhibit a localized decoding paradigm that endows them with the inherent capacity to explicitly preserve non-relevant regions during the editing process. Building upon this insight, we introduce the first MGT-based image editing framework, termed EditMGT. We first demonstrate that MGT's cross-attention maps provide informative localization signals for localizing edit-relevant regions and devise a multi-layer attention consolidation scheme that refines these maps to achieve fine-grained and precise localization.

However, it relies on simplified, order-dependent alpha blending and coarse approximations of the density integral within the rasterizer, thereby limiting its ability to render complex, overlapping semi-transparent objects. In this paper, we extend rasterization-based rendering of 3D Gaussian representations with a novel method for high-fidelity transmittance computation, entirely avoiding the need for ray tracing or per-pixel sample sorting. Building on prior work in moment-based order-independent transparency, our key idea is to characterize the density distribution along each camera ray with a compact and continuous representation based on statistical moments. To this end, we analytically derive and compute a set of per-pixel moments from all contributing 3D Gaussians. From these moments, a continuous transmittance function is reconstructed for each ray, which is then independently sampled within each Gaussian. As a result, our method bridges the gap between rasterization and physical accuracy by modeling light attenuation in complex translucent media, significantly improving overall reconstruction and rendering quality.", "AI": {"tldr": "This paper proposes a method to improve 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) by introducing a new transmittance computation approach for accurate rendering of complex, semi-transparent objects.", "motivation": "To address the limitations of 3D Gaussian Splatting, specifically in rendering complex overlapping semi-transparent objects due to simplified alpha blending and density integral approximations.", "method": "The authors introduce a novel statistical moments-based approach to compute a continuous transmittance function.

However, this task faces a fundamental challenge when the governing equations are unknown and observational data are sparse. System stiffness, the coupling of multiple time-scales, further exacerbates this problem and hinders long-term prediction. Existing methods fall short: purely data-driven methods demand massive datasets, whereas physics-aware approaches are constrained by their reliance on known equations and fine-grained time steps. To overcome these limitations, we introduce an equation-free learning framework, namely, the Stable Spectral Neural Operator (SSNO), for modeling stiff partial differential equation (PDE) systems based on limited data. Instead of encoding specific equation terms, SSNO embeds spectrally inspired structures in its architecture, yielding strong inductive biases for learning the underlying physics. It automatically learns local and global spatial interactions in the frequency domain, while handling system stiffness with a robust integrating factor time-stepping scheme. Demonstrated across multiple 2D and 3D benchmarks in Cartesian and spherical geometries, SSNO achieves prediction errors one to two orders of magnitude lower than leading models.

To address these challenges, we introduce LUCID (Learning-enabled Uncertainty-aware Certification of stochastIc Dynamical systems), a verification engine for certifying safety of black-box stochastic dynamical systems from a finite dataset of random state transitions. As such, LUCID is the first known tool capable of establishing quantified safety guarantees for such systems. Thanks to its modular architecture and extensive documentation, LUCID is designed for easy extensibility. LUCID employs a data-driven methodology rooted in control barrier certificates, which are learned directly from system transition data, to ensure formal safety guarantees. We use conditional mean embeddings to embed data into a reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS), where an RKHS ambiguity set is constructed that can be inflated to robustify the result to out-of-distribution behavior. A key innovation within LUCID is its use of a finite Fourier kernel expansion to reformulate a semi-infinite non-convex optimization problem into a tractable linear program. The resulting spectral barrier allows us to leverage the fast Fourier transform to generate the relaxed problem efficiently, offering a scalable yet distributionally robust framework for verifying safety.
