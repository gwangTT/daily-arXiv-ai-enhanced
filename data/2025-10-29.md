### [1] [Discovering Heuristics with Large Language Models (LLMs) for Mixed-Integer Programs: Single-Machine Scheduling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24013)
*İbrahim Oğuz Çetinkaya,İ. Esra Büyüktahtakın,Parshin Shojaee,Chandan K. Reddy*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper presents novel heuristics for solving the combinatorial optimization problem SMTT by leveraging large language models (LLMs), achieving superior performance in scalability and efficiency compared to traditional heuristics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to improve the computational efficiency and scalability of solving the single-machine total tardiness (SMTT) problem, which is an NP-hard optimization challenge in scheduling, using innovative methods inspired by LLM capabilities.

Method: Two novel heuristics, EDD Challenger (EDDC) and MDD Challenger (MDDC), inspired by EDD and MDD rules, are developed via Large Language Models (LLMs). Their performance is rigorously evaluated against state-of-the-art methods using metrics like optimality gaps and solution times, derived from mixed-integer programming (MIP) models.

Result: EDD Challenger (EDDC) and MDD Challenger (MDDC) outperform traditional methods and remain competitive with exact approaches, particularly on problem instances with large job sizes (up to 500 jobs). Mixed-integer programming and dynamic programming methods become inefficient for larger instances.

Conclusion: Human-LLM collaboration can effectively produce scalable, high-performing heuristics for complex combinatorial optimization problems. These methods are competitive with exact approaches and enable solving larger instances under computational constraints.

Abstract: Our study contributes to the scheduling and combinatorial optimization
literature with new heuristics discovered by leveraging the power of Large
Language Models (LLMs). We focus on the single-machine total tardiness (SMTT)
problem, which aims to minimize total tardiness by sequencing n jobs on a
single processor without preemption, given processing times and due dates. We
develop and benchmark two novel LLM-discovered heuristics, the EDD Challenger
(EDDC) and MDD Challenger (MDDC), inspired by the well-known Earliest Due Date
(EDD) and Modified Due Date (MDD) rules. In contrast to prior studies that
employed simpler rule-based heuristics, we evaluate our LLM-discovered
algorithms using rigorous criteria, including optimality gaps and solution time
derived from a mixed-integer programming (MIP) formulation of SMTT. We compare
their performance against state-of-the-art heuristics and exact methods across
various job sizes (20, 100, 200, and 500 jobs). For instances with more than
100 jobs, exact methods such as MIP and dynamic programming become
computationally intractable. Up to 500 jobs, EDDC improves upon the classic EDD
rule and another widely used algorithm in the literature. MDDC consistently
outperforms traditional heuristics and remains competitive with exact
approaches, particularly on larger and more complex instances. This study shows
that human-LLM collaboration can produce scalable, high-performing heuristics
for NP-hard constrained combinatorial optimization, even under limited
resources when effectively configured.

### [2] [Game-TARS: Pretrained Foundation Models for Scalable Generalist Multimodal Game Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23691)
*Zihao Wang,Xujing Li,Yining Ye,Junjie Fang,Haoming Wang,Longxiang Liu,Shihao Liang,Junting Lu,Zhiyong Wu,Jiazhan Feng,Wanjun Zhong,Zili Li,Yu Wang,Yu Miao,Bo Zhou,Yuanfan Li,Hao Wang,Zhongkai Zhao,Faming Wu,Zhengxuan Jiang,Weihao Tan,Heyuan Yao,Shi Yan,Xiangyang Li,Yitao Liang,Yujia Qin,Guang Shi*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Game-TARS is a generalist game agent trained with a scalable action space based on keyboard-mouse inputs, showing strong pre-training capabilities and success across diverse game environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a generalist game agent capable of operating in diverse environments using human-like keyboard and mouse inputs rather than traditional GUI or API-based approaches.

Method: Game-TARS employs a unified scalable action space anchored to keyboard-mouse inputs, pre-trained on 500 billion tokens through diverse trajectories and multimodal data. Methods such as decaying continual loss and Sparse-Thinking strategy improve reasoning and reduce computational demands.

Result: Game-TARS demonstrates twice the success rate of previous state-of-the-art models in Minecraft, approaches human-level generality in unseen web 3D games, and outperforms competitors like GPT-5 and Claude-4-Sonnet in FPS benchmarks.

Conclusion: Simple and scalable action representations combined with large-scale pre-training are effective for building generalist agents with broad applicability in computer-use scenarios.

Abstract: We present Game-TARS, a generalist game agent trained with a unified,
scalable action space anchored to human-aligned native keyboard-mouse inputs.
Unlike API- or GUI-based approaches, this paradigm enables large-scale
continual pre-training across heterogeneous domains, including OS, web, and
simulation games. Game-TARS is pre-trained on over 500B tokens with diverse
trajectories and multimodal data. Key techniques include a decaying continual
loss to reduce causal confusion and an efficient Sparse-Thinking strategy that
balances reasoning depth and inference cost. Experiments show that Game-TARS
achieves about 2 times the success rate over the previous sota model on
open-world Minecraft tasks, is close to the generality of fresh humans in
unseen web 3d games, and outperforms GPT-5, Gemini-2.5-Pro, and Claude-4-Sonnet
in FPS benchmarks. Scaling results on training-time and test-time confirm that
the unified action space sustains improvements when scaled to cross-game and
multimodal data. Our results demonstrate that simple, scalable action
representations combined with large-scale pre-training provide a promising path
toward generalist agents with broad computer-use abilities.

### [3] [AI and the Decentering of Disciplinary Creativity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23734)
*Eamon Duede*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper investigates how AI influences scientific problem-solving and disciplinary creativity, highlighting AI's potential to both extend and displace creative expertise in disciplines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To examine how AI impacts disciplinary creativity in problem-solving within scientific fields by analyzing both benefits and potential drawbacks.

Method: The study utilizes philosophical frameworks on creativity and provides case studies in mathematics to explore the dual role of AI in enhancing or displacing disciplinary creativity.

Result: AI was found to have the capacity to extend creativity in scientific domains but could also displace it, altering the fundamental value of scientific exploration.

Conclusion: AI's influence on disciplinary creativity is double-edged, capable of both enhancing and diminishing the value and nature of scientific pursuits.

Abstract: This paper examines the role of artificial intelligence in scientific
problem-solving, with a focus on its implications for disciplinary creativity.
Drawing on recent work in the philosophy of creativity, I distinguish between
creative approaches and creative products, and introduce the concept of
disciplinary creativity -the creative application of discipline-specific
expertise to a valued problem within that field. Through two cases in
mathematics, I show that while computation can extend disciplinary creativity,
certain approaches involving AI can serve to displace it. This displacement has
the potential to alter (and, perhaps, diminish) the value of scientific
pursuit.

### [4] [Multi-Environment POMDPs: Discrete Model Uncertainty Under Partial Observability](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23744)
*Eline M. Bovy,Caleb Probine,Marnix Suilen,Ufuk Topcu,Nils Jansen*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces Multi-environment POMDPs (ME-POMDPs) with model uncertainties and proposes algorithms to compute robust policies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenges arising from model uncertainty in POMDP scenarios, such as varying opinions of domain experts.

Method: Generalization of ME-POMDPs to adversarial-belief POMDPs (AB-POMDPs), reduction of arbitrary ME-POMDPs into manageable forms, and development of exact and approximate algorithms.

Result: Able to compute robust policies for POMDP benchmarks extended to multi-environment setups.

Conclusion: The proposed methods make it possible to manage model uncertainties and compute worst-case optimal policies for ME-POMDPs efficiently.

Abstract: Multi-environment POMDPs (ME-POMDPs) extend standard POMDPs with discrete
model uncertainty. ME-POMDPs represent a finite set of POMDPs that share the
same state, action, and observation spaces, but may arbitrarily vary in their
transition, observation, and reward models. Such models arise, for instance,
when multiple domain experts disagree on how to model a problem. The goal is to
find a single policy that is robust against any choice of POMDP within the set,
i.e., a policy that maximizes the worst-case reward across all POMDPs. We
generalize and expand on existing work in the following way. First, we show
that ME-POMDPs can be generalized to POMDPs with sets of initial beliefs, which
we call adversarial-belief POMDPs (AB-POMDPs). Second, we show that any
arbitrary ME-POMDP can be reduced to a ME-POMDP that only varies in its
transition and reward functions or only in its observation and reward
functions, while preserving (optimal) policies. We then devise exact and
approximate (point-based) algorithms to compute robust policies for AB-POMDPs,
and thus ME-POMDPs. We demonstrate that we can compute policies for standard
POMDP benchmarks extended to the multi-environment setting.

### [5] [Test-Time Tuned Language Models Enable End-to-end De Novo Molecular Structure Generation from MS/MS Spectra](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23746)
*Laura Mismetti,Marvin Alberts,Andreas Krause,Mara Graziani*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A new approach leverages a pre-trained transformer model with test-time tuning to directly generate molecular structures from tandem mass spectra, bypassing manual annotations and intermediate steps.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods struggle to accurately identify molecular structures, especially for compounds absent in existing databases.

Method: The paper introduces an end-to-end framework using test-time tuning and a pre-trained transformer model, enabling de novo molecular structure generation directly from mass spectra and molecular formulae.

Result: The proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art DiffMS approach on benchmarks (NPLIB1 by 100%, MassSpecGym by 20%) and achieves a 62% relative improvement in fine-tuning on MassSpecGym.

Conclusion: The method enables dynamic adaptation to novel spectra, produces structurally accurate candidates even when deviating from ground truth, and improves reliability and interpretability in molecular identification.

Abstract: Tandem Mass Spectrometry enables the identification of unknown compounds in
crucial fields such as metabolomics, natural product discovery and
environmental analysis. However, current methods rely on database matching from
previously observed molecules, or on multi-step pipelines that require
intermediate fragment or fingerprint prediction. This makes finding the correct
molecule highly challenging, particularly for compounds absent from reference
databases. We introduce a framework that, by leveraging test-time tuning,
enhances the learning of a pre-trained transformer model to address this gap,
enabling end-to-end de novo molecular structure generation directly from the
tandem mass spectra and molecular formulae, bypassing manual annotations and
intermediate steps. We surpass the de-facto state-of-the-art approach DiffMS on
two popular benchmarks NPLIB1 and MassSpecGym by 100% and 20%, respectively.
Test-time tuning on experimental spectra allows the model to dynamically adapt
to novel spectra, and the relative performance gain over conventional
fine-tuning is of 62% on MassSpecGym. When predictions deviate from the ground
truth, the generated molecular candidates remain structurally accurate,
providing valuable guidance for human interpretation and more reliable
identification.

### [7] [Why Foundation Models in Pathology Are Failing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23807)
*Hamid R. Tizhoosh*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Foundation models fail to deliver expected breakthroughs in computational pathology due to conceptual mismatches with tissue complexity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Foundation models have revolutionized non-medical domains, prompting their adoption for advancements in computational pathology.

Method: The paper systematically examines weaknesses of pathology foundation models and identifies seven interrelated causes for these shortcomings.

Result: The evaluation reveals diagnostic inaccuracy, robustness issues, computational difficulties, and safety concerns, stemming from biological and conceptual misalignments.

Conclusion: Current pathology foundation models are misaligned with tissue morphology, necessitating a fundamental paradigm shift for further progress.

Abstract: In non-medical domains, foundation models (FMs) have revolutionized computer
vision and language processing through large-scale self-supervised and
multimodal learning. Consequently, their rapid adoption in computational
pathology was expected to deliver comparable breakthroughs in cancer diagnosis,
prognostication, and multimodal retrieval. However, recent systematic
evaluations reveal fundamental weaknesses: low diagnostic accuracy, poor
robustness, geometric instability, heavy computational demands, and concerning
safety vulnerabilities. This short paper examines these shortcomings and argues
that they stem from deeper conceptual mismatches between the assumptions
underlying generic foundation modeling in mainstream AI and the intrinsic
complexity of human tissue. Seven interrelated causes are identified:
biological complexity, ineffective self-supervision, overgeneralization,
excessive architectural complexity, lack of domain-specific innovation,
insufficient data, and a fundamental design flaw related to tissue patch size.
These findings suggest that current pathology foundation models remain
conceptually misaligned with the nature of tissue morphology and call for a
fundamental rethinking of the paradigm itself.

### [8] [ReCAP: Recursive Context-Aware Reasoning and Planning for Large Language Model Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23822)
*Zhenyu Zhang,Tianyi Chen,Weiran Xu,Alex Pentland,Jiaxin Pei*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ReCAP improves reasoning and planning in LLMs for long-horizon tasks with hierarchical framework, showing significant success rate improvements in benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges like context drift, goal loss, and inefficiencies in long-horizon reasoning tasks for LLMs.

Method: ReCAP uses plan-ahead decomposition, structured re-injection of parent plans, and memory-efficient execution to maintain context alignment and scalable task handling.

Result: Experiments show ReCAP achieves 32% improvement on synchronous Robotouille and 29% on asynchronous Robotouille under strict pass@1 protocol.

Conclusion: ReCAP successfully enhances long-horizon reasoning tasks by aligning high-level plans with low-level actions, preserving context, and improving task performance.

Abstract: Long-horizon tasks requiring multi-step reasoning and dynamic re-planning
remain challenging for large language models (LLMs). Sequential prompting
methods are prone to context drift, loss of goal information, and recurrent
failure cycles, while hierarchical prompting methods often weaken cross-level
continuity or incur substantial runtime overhead. We introduce ReCAP (Recursive
Context-Aware Reasoning and Planning), a hierarchical framework with shared
context for reasoning and planning in LLMs. ReCAP combines three key
mechanisms: (i) plan-ahead decomposition, in which the model generates a full
subtask list, executes the first item, and refines the remainder; (ii)
structured re-injection of parent plans, maintaining consistent multi-level
context during recursive return; and (iii) memory-efficient execution, bounding
the active prompt so costs scale linearly with task depth. Together these
mechanisms align high-level goals with low-level actions, reduce redundant
prompting, and preserve coherent context updates across recursion. Experiments
demonstrate that ReCAP substantially improves subgoal alignment and success
rates on various long-horizon reasoning benchmarks, achieving a 32% gain on
synchronous Robotouille and a 29% improvement on asynchronous Robotouille under
the strict pass@1 protocol.

### [9] [Decentralized Multi-Agent Goal Assignment for Path Planning using Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23824)
*Murad Ismayilov,Edwin Meriaux,Shuo Wen,Gregory Dudek*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A study on decentralized goal assignment for multi-agent path planning, demonstrating the potential of Large Language Models (LLMs) for improved performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of coordinating multiple autonomous agents in shared environments under decentralized conditions, specifically for multi-agent path planning.

Method: Agents independently generate ranked preferences over goals using structured environment representations. They exchange these rankings and a deterministic conflict-resolution rule assigns goals without negotiation or iterative coordination. Greedy heuristics, optimal algorithms, and LLM-based agents were compared.

Result: LLM-based agents, with appropriate prompts and relevant information, achieved near-optimal performance and surpassed traditional methods consistently.

Conclusion: LLMs show promise for decentralized goal assignment in multi-agent systems, emphasizing the impact of structured information.

Abstract: Coordinating multiple autonomous agents in shared environments under
decentralized conditions is a long-standing challenge in robotics and
artificial intelligence. This work addresses the problem of decentralized goal
assignment for multi-agent path planning, where agents independently generate
ranked preferences over goals based on structured representations of the
environment, including grid visualizations and scenario data. After this
reasoning phase, agents exchange their goal rankings, and assignments are
determined by a fixed, deterministic conflict-resolution rule (e.g., agent
index ordering), without negotiation or iterative coordination. We
systematically compare greedy heuristics, optimal assignment, and large
language model (LLM)-based agents in fully observable grid-world settings. Our
results show that LLM-based agents, when provided with well-designed prompts
and relevant quantitative information, can achieve near-optimal makespans and
consistently outperform traditional heuristics. These findings underscore the
potential of language models for decentralized goal assignment in multi-agent
path planning and highlight the importance of information structure in such
systems.

*Segev Shlomov,Alon Oved,Sami Marreed,Ido Levy,Offer Akrabi,Avi Yaeli,Łukasz Strąk,Elizabeth Koumpan,Yinon Goldshtein,Eilam Shapira,Nir Mashkif,Asaf Adi*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper discusses IBM's development and initial evaluation of the Computer Using Generalist Agent (CUGA), aimed at addressing challenges in deploying generalist agents in enterprise settings for measurable business value.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to overcome challenges like fragmented frameworks, slow development, and lack of standardized evaluation in deploying generalist agents in enterprise environments and achieve measurable business outcomes.

Method: The paper introduces CUGA, a generalist agent built on a hierarchical planner-executor architecture, evaluated with benchmarks (AppWorld, WebArena) and a custom BPO-TA benchmark for enterprise scalability and governance.

Result: CUGA showed competitive performance near specialized agents in accuracy while demonstrating potential to reduce development time and costs in enterprise settings within its pilot implementation.

Conclusion: The paper highlights early evidence that CUGA can operate at enterprise scale and extracts technical and organizational lessons for advancing research-grade agents into production-ready systems.

Abstract: Agents are rapidly advancing in automating digital work, but enterprises face
a harder challenge: moving beyond prototypes to deployed systems that deliver
measurable business value. This path is complicated by fragmented frameworks,
slow development, and the absence of standardized evaluation practices.
Generalist agents have emerged as a promising direction, excelling on academic
benchmarks and offering flexibility across task types, applications, and
modalities. Yet, evidence of their use in production enterprise settings
remains limited. This paper reports IBM's experience developing and piloting
the Computer Using Generalist Agent (CUGA), which has been open-sourced for the
community (https://github.com/cuga-project/cuga-agent). CUGA adopts a
hierarchical planner--executor architecture with strong analytical foundations,
achieving state-of-the-art performance on AppWorld and WebArena. Beyond
benchmarks, it was evaluated in a pilot within the Business-Process-Outsourcing
talent acquisition domain, addressing enterprise requirements for scalability,
auditability, safety, and governance. To support assessment, we introduce
BPO-TA, a 26-task benchmark spanning 13 analytics endpoints. In preliminary
evaluations, CUGA approached the accuracy of specialized agents while
indicating potential for reducing development time and cost. Our contribution
is twofold: presenting early evidence of generalist agents operating at
enterprise scale, and distilling technical and organizational lessons from this
initial pilot. We outline requirements and next steps for advancing
research-grade architectures like CUGA into robust, enterprise-ready systems.

Result: RL model improves counter-intuitive puzzle generation by 10x, outperforms datasets and models, and creates puzzles rated highly by experts.

Conclusion: AI-generated chess puzzles achieve high creativity and uniqueness, meeting expert approval and surpassing traditional methods.

Abstract: While Generative AI rapidly advances in various domains, generating truly
creative, aesthetic, and counter-intuitive outputs remains a challenge. This
paper presents an approach to tackle these difficulties in the domain of chess
puzzles. We start by benchmarking Generative AI architectures, and then
introduce an RL framework with novel rewards based on chess engine search
statistics to overcome some of those shortcomings. The rewards are designed to
enhance a puzzle's uniqueness, counter-intuitiveness, diversity, and realism.
Our RL approach dramatically increases counter-intuitive puzzle generation by
10x, from 0.22\% (supervised) to 2.5\%, surpassing existing dataset rates
(2.1\%) and the best Lichess-trained model (0.4\%). Our puzzles meet novelty
and diversity benchmarks, retain aesthetic themes, and are rated by human
experts as more creative, enjoyable, and counter-intuitive than composed book
puzzles, even approaching classic compositions. Our final outcome is a curated
booklet of these AI-generated puzzles, which is acknowledged for creativity by
three world-renowned experts.

Abstract: This work investigates the use of digital twins for dynamical system modeling
and control, integrating physics-based, data-driven, and hybrid approaches with
both traditional and AI-driven controllers. Using a miniature greenhouse as a
test platform, four predictive models Linear, Physics-Based Modeling (PBM),
Long Short Term Memory (LSTM), and Hybrid Analysis and Modeling (HAM) are

precision at greater resource cost. Among controllers, MPC delivers robust and
predictable performance, RL demonstrates strong adaptability, and LLM-based
controllers offer flexible human-AI interaction when coupled with predictive
tools.

*Guohao Sun,Hang Hua,Jian Wang,Jiebo Luo,Sohail Dianat,Majid Rabbani,Raghuveer Rao,Zhiqiang Tao*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes a new training method for Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) to improve reasoning using a scalable posterior inference approach and sparse reward functions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LVLM training algorithms have limitations in generalizing reasoning tasks and rely on biased reward models, demanding better solutions for interpretability and reliability.

Method: The researchers used amortized variational inference combined with diversity-seeking reinforcement learning and sparse token-level rewards to enhance reasoning capabilities in LVLMs. They introduced Bayesian inference-scaling to rank rationales and answers more efficiently.

Result: The proposed method achieved improvement in reasoning benchmarks, outperforming state-of-the-art LVLMs in terms of effectiveness, generalization, and interpretability.

Conclusion: The paper provides an effective, generalized, and interpretable approach to overcome reasoning task limitations in LVLMs, addressing deterministic sampling and reward hacking concerns.

Abstract: Chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning is critical for improving the
interpretability and reliability of Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs).
However, existing training algorithms such as SFT, PPO, and GRPO may not
generalize well across unseen reasoning tasks and heavily rely on a biased
reward model. To address this challenge, we reformulate reasoning in LVLMs as
posterior inference and propose a scalable training algorithm based on
amortized variational inference. By leveraging diversity-seeking reinforcement
learning algorithms, we introduce a novel sparse reward function for
token-level learning signals that encourage diverse, high-likelihood latent
CoT, overcoming deterministic sampling limitations and avoiding reward hacking.
Additionally, we implement a Bayesian inference-scaling strategy that replaces
costly Best-of-N and Beam Search with a marginal likelihood to efficiently rank
optimal rationales and answers. We empirically demonstrate that the proposed

### [15] [Decentralized Causal Discovery using Judo Calculus](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23942)
*Sridhar Mahadevan*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper presents a decentralized framework for causal discovery called judo calculus, using sheaf theory and intuitionistic logic to address context-dependent causal effects in diverse domains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world causal effects often depend on context-specific regimes such as age, country, or genotype, posing challenges for global inference models. This paper aims to formalize and computationally address these context dependencies.

Method: The authors use j-stable causal inference via j-do-calculus within a sheaf-theoretic structure, enabling local truths for causal claims validated across specific regimes, paired with algorithmic integration of score-based, constraint-based, and gradient-based methods.

Result: Experimental results on synthetic and real-world datasets from biology and economics demonstrate computational efficiency and improved performance compared to classical methods.

Conclusion: The intuitionistic, decentralized framework proves effective in addressing complex real-world causal discovery challenges, improving computational efficiency and accuracy by leveraging contextual information.

Abstract: We describe a theory and implementation of an intuitionistic decentralized
framework for causal discovery using judo calculus, which is formally defined
as j-stable causal inference using j-do-calculus in a topos of sheaves. In
real-world applications -- from biology to medicine and social science --
causal effects depend on regime (age, country, dose, genotype, or lab
protocol). Our proposed judo calculus formalizes this context dependence
formally as local truth: a causal claim is proven true on a cover of regimes,
not everywhere at once. The Lawvere-Tierney modal operator j chooses which
regimes are relevant; j-stability means the claim holds constructively and
consistently across that family. We describe an algorithmic and implementation
framework for judo calculus, combining it with standard score-based,
constraint-based, and gradient-based causal discovery methods. We describe
experimental results on a range of domains, from synthetic to real-world
datasets from biology and economics. Our experimental results show the
computational efficiency gained by the decentralized nature of sheaf-theoretic
causal discovery, as well as improved performance over classical causal
discovery methods.

### [16] [The Sign Estimator: LLM Alignment in the Face of Choice Heterogeneity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23965)
*Aymane El Gadarri,Ali Aouad,Vivek F. Farias*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces the sign estimator, a new method for LLM alignment, which uses binary classification loss for consistent aggregation of human preferences, improving population-average utility estimation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM alignment methods face challenges due to variations in human preferences, which lead to inconsistent measures of social welfare.

Method: The sign estimator replaces cross-entropy with binary classification loss in the aggregation step, providing a consistent and efficient estimator for aligning LLMs.

Result: In simulations using digital personas, the sign estimator reduced preference distortion by 35% and decreased disagreement with population preferences from 12% to 8%, outperforming RLHF and other heuristics.

Conclusion: The sign estimator improves LLM alignment and user preference modeling without requiring individual-level data tracking, offering a simpler yet effective alternative to current methods.

Abstract: Traditional LLM alignment methods are vulnerable to heterogeneity in human
preferences. Fitting a na\"ive probabilistic model to pairwise comparison data
(say over prompt-completion pairs) yields an inconsistent estimate of the
population-average utility -a canonical measure of social welfare. We propose a
new method, dubbed the sign estimator, that provides a simple, provably
consistent, and efficient estimator by replacing cross-entropy with binary
classification loss in the aggregation step. This simple modification recovers
consistent ordinal alignment under mild assumptions and achieves the first
polynomial finite-sample error bounds in this setting. In realistic simulations
of LLM alignment using digital twins, the sign estimator substantially reduces
preference distortion over a panel of simulated personas, cutting (angular)
estimation error by nearly 35% and decreasing disagreement with true population
preferences from 12% to 8% compared to standard RLHF. Our method also compares
favorably to panel data heuristics that explicitly model user heterogeneity and
require tracking individual-level preference data-all while maintaining the
implementation simplicity of existing LLM alignment pipelines.

### [17] [Learning Individual Movement Shifts After Urban Disruptions with Social Infrastructure Reliance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23989)
*Shangde Gao,Zelin Xu,Zhe Jiang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This study proposes a conditioned deep learning model, integrating individuals' social infrastructure resilience (SIR) and spatial context, to improve predictions of post-event movement patterns.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding and predicting shifts in individual movement patterns after disruptive events helps to manage community resource demands effectively.

Method: The paper introduces measures for SIR, integrates these into a conditioned deep learning model, and analyzes large-scale and sparse individual-level data to explore the connection between movement and spatial context.

Result: Incorporating SIR and spatial context improves prediction capabilities and highlights how individuals with similar pre-event movement patterns can diverge post-event based on SIR.

Conclusion: By capturing SIR's role and spatial context interactions, the conditioned model advances decision-making for post-event individual movement predictions.

Abstract: Shifts in individual movement patterns following disruptive events can reveal
changing demands for community resources. However, predicting such shifts
before disruptive events remains challenging for several reasons. First,
measures are lacking for individuals' heterogeneous social infrastructure
resilience (SIR), which directly influences their movement patterns, and
commonly used features are often limited or unavailable at scale, e.g.,
sociodemographic characteristics. Second, the complex interactions between
individual movement patterns and spatial contexts have not been sufficiently
captured. Third, individual-level movement may be spatially sparse and not
well-suited to traditional decision-making methods for movement predictions.
This study incorporates individuals' SIR into a conditioned deep learning model
to capture the complex relationships between individual movement patterns and
local spatial context using large-scale, sparse individual-level data. Our
experiments demonstrate that incorporating individuals' SIR and spatial context
can enhance the model's ability to predict post-event individual movement
patterns. The conditioned model can capture the divergent shifts in movement
patterns among individuals who exhibit similar pre-event patterns but differ in
SIR.

### [18] [OneCast: Structured Decomposition and Modular Generation for Cross-Domain Time Series Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24028)
*Tingyue Pan,Mingyue Cheng,Shilong Zhang,Zhiding Liu,Xiaoyu Tao,Yucong Luo,Jintao Zhang,Qi Liu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: OneCast is a modular framework for cross-domain time series forecasting, decomposing data into seasonal and trend components for improved prediction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The research aims to address the inefficiencies of existing forecasting methods in handling heterogeneous cross-domain time series data by decoupling structural components.

Method: OneCast decomposes time series into seasonal and trend components. Seasonal patterns are modeled via basis functions, while trends are encoded as discrete tokens with semantic-aware tokenization and diffusion inference.

Result: OneCast achieves state-of-the-art forecasting performance across eight domains by effectively capturing seasonal and domain-specific trends.

Conclusion: The structured decomposition in OneCast makes it effective in forecasting heterogeneous time series data, outperforming existing methods.

Abstract: Cross-domain time series forecasting is a valuable task in various web
applications. Despite its rapid advancement, achieving effective generalization
across heterogeneous time series data remains a significant challenge. Existing
methods have made progress by extending single-domain models, yet often fall
short when facing domain-specific trend shifts and inconsistent periodic
patterns. We argue that a key limitation lies in treating temporal series as
undifferentiated sequence, without explicitly decoupling their inherent
structural components. To address this, we propose OneCast, a structured and
modular forecasting framework that decomposes time series into seasonal and
trend components, each modeled through tailored generative pathways.
Specifically, the seasonal component is captured by a lightweight projection
module that reconstructs periodic patterns via interpretable basis functions.
In parallel, the trend component is encoded into discrete tokens at segment
level via a semantic-aware tokenizer, and subsequently inferred through a
masked discrete diffusion mechanism. The outputs from both branches are
combined to produce a final forecast that captures seasonal patterns while
tracking domain-specific trends. Extensive experiments across eight domains
demonstrate that OneCast mostly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines.

*Habtom Kahsay Gidey,Niklas Huber,Alexander Lenz,Alois Knoll*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper proposes a novel framework using architectural patterns to help software agents dynamically construct and maintain task-relevant world models from structured digital data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Software agents face challenges in constructing internal world models due to the complexity of structured data like HTML and the rigidity of static API integrations.

Method: The paper introduces two architectural patterns: DOM Transduction for converting verbose DOM into compact models, and Hypermedia Affordances Recognition for dynamically enriching world models by parsing semantic descriptions of web services.

Result: The proposed framework enables agents to efficiently create adaptive world models, optimizing scalability and interoperability across web resources.

Conclusion: The patterns presented serve as a robust solution, allowing autonomous agents to better perform reasoning and adapt to evolving digital environments.

Abstract: The autonomy of software agents is fundamentally dependent on their ability
to construct an actionable internal world model from the structured data that
defines their digital environment, such as the Document Object Model (DOM) of
web pages and the semantic descriptions of web services. However, constructing
this world model from raw structured data presents two critical challenges: the
verbosity of raw HTML makes it computationally intractable for direct use by
foundation models, while the static nature of hardcoded API integrations
prevents agents from adapting to evolving services.
  This paper introduces a pattern language for world modeling from structured
data, presenting two complementary architectural patterns. The DOM Transduction
Pattern addresses the challenge of web page complexity by distilling} a
verbose, raw DOM into a compact, task-relevant representation or world model
optimized for an agent's reasoning core. Concurrently, the Hypermedia
Affordances Recognition Pattern enables the agent to dynamically enrich its
world model by parsing standardized semantic descriptions to discover and
integrate the capabilities of unknown web services at runtime. Together, these
patterns provide a robust framework for engineering agents that can efficiently
construct and maintain an accurate world model, enabling scalable, adaptive,
and interoperable automation across the web and its extended resources.

TL;DR: The paper introduces LLMLogAnalyzer, a chatbot for efficient log analysis using LLMs and ML, showing 39%-68% performance gains over other systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Organizations face challenges in analyzing large and diverse system logs due to high costs, expertise gaps, and time constraints.

Method: The study presents LLMLogAnalyzer, using a modular architecture with clustering techniques, LLMs, and ML to address summarized log analysis, anomaly detection, and pattern recognition issues.

Result: The system demonstrates a performance improvement of 39%-68% on various tasks compared to other tools and shows robust analysis with a 93% IQR reduction.

Conclusion: LLMLogAnalyzer improves structured text analysis accuracy and robustness, benefiting both technical and non-technical users in cybersecurity fields.

Abstract: System logs are a cornerstone of cybersecurity, supporting proactive breach
prevention and post-incident investigations. However, analyzing vast amounts of
diverse log data remains significantly challenging, as high costs, lack of
in-house expertise, and time constraints make even basic analysis difficult for
many organizations. This study introduces LLMLogAnalyzer, a clustering-based
log analysis chatbot that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) and Machine
Learning (ML) algorithms to simplify and streamline log analysis processes.
This innovative approach addresses key LLM limitations, including context
window constraints and poor structured text handling capabilities, enabling
more effective summarization, pattern extraction, and anomaly detection tasks.
LLMLogAnalyzer is evaluated across four distinct domain logs and various tasks.
Results demonstrate significant performance improvements over state-of-the-art
LLM-based chatbots, including ChatGPT, ChatPDF, and NotebookLM, with consistent
gains ranging from 39% to 68% across different tasks. The system also exhibits
strong robustness, achieving a 93% reduction in interquartile range (IQR) when
using ROUGE-1 scores, indicating significantly lower result variability. The
framework's effectiveness stems from its modular architecture comprising a
router, log recognizer, log parser, and search tools. This design enhances LLM
capabilities for structured text analysis while improving accuracy and
robustness, making it a valuable resource for both cybersecurity experts and
non-technical users.

*Md. Shihab Uddin,Md Nazmus Shakib,Rahul Bhadani*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The study evaluates classical and machine learning models for electric vehicle (EV) car following behavior, finding that a Random Forest Regressor outperforms traditional physics-based models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To analyze and improve EV driving behavior for traffic safety and smart driving systems, considering the increasing prevalence of electric vehicles.

Method: The research compares classical models like IDM, OVM, CACC against a machine learning-based Random Forest Regressor, using real-world datasets of EVs following ICE vehicles, and assesses their performance based on RMSE values.

Result: The Random Forest Regressor achieves significantly lower RMSE values than classical models across varying gap scenarios, demonstrating its superior accuracy in predicting EV acceleration behavior.

Conclusion: Machine learning models, specifically Random Forest, offer greater accuracy than physics-based models for simulating EV behavior, aiding in mixed autonomy traffic and EV-related developments.

Abstract: The increasing adoption of electric vehicles (EVs) necessitates an
understanding of their driving behavior to enhance traffic safety and develop
smart driving systems. This study compares classical and machine learning
models for EV car following behavior. Classical models include the Intelligent
Driver Model (IDM), Optimum Velocity Model (OVM), Optimal Velocity Relative
Velocity (OVRV), and a simplified CACC model, while the machine learning
approach employs a Random Forest Regressor. Using a real world dataset of an EV
following an internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicle under varied driving
conditions, we calibrated classical model parameters by minimizing the RMSE
between predictions and real data. The Random Forest model predicts
acceleration using spacing, speed, and gap type as inputs. Results demonstrate
the Random Forest's superior accuracy, achieving RMSEs of 0.0046 (medium gap),
0.0016 (long gap), and 0.0025 (extra long gap). Among physics based models,
CACC performed best, with an RMSE of 2.67 for long gaps. These findings
highlight the machine learning model's performance across all scenarios. Such
models are valuable for simulating EV behavior and analyzing mixed autonomy
traffic dynamics in EV integrated environments.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: HistoLens provides transparent AI assistance for pathologists, offering plain English queries, structured reports, and visual proofs for findings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable pathologists to trust and collaborate with AI by providing transparency and usability akin to a human colleague.

Method: Developed HistoLens system that translates plain English questions into accurate AI queries and provides visual heatmaps for findings.

Result: The system ensures AI focuses solely on tissue analysis, enhancing the confidence and efficiency of pathologists' workflow.

Conclusion: HistoLens creates a trustworthy, collaborative AI assistant, empowering pathologists to make faster and more reliable diagnoses.

Abstract: For doctors to truly trust artificial intelligence, it can't be a black box.
They need to understand its reasoning, almost as if they were consulting a
colleague. We created HistoLens1 to be that transparent, collaborative partner.
It allows a pathologist to simply ask a question in plain English about a
tissue slide--just as they would ask a trainee. Our system intelligently
translates this question into a precise query for its AI engine, which then
provides a clear, structured report. But it doesn't stop there. If a doctor
ever asks, "Why?", HistoLens can instantly provide a 'visual proof' for any
finding--a heatmap that points to the exact cells and regions the AI used for
its analysis. We've also ensured the AI focuses only on the patient's tissue,
just like a trained pathologist would, by teaching it to ignore distracting
background noise. The result is a workflow where the pathologist remains the
expert in charge, using a trustworthy AI assistant to verify their insights and
make faster, more confident diagnoses.

*Yu Luo,Jiamin Jiang,Jingfei Feng,Lei Tao,Qingliang Zhang,Xidao Wen,Yongqian Sun,Shenglin Zhang,Jielong Huang,Nan Qi,Dan Pei*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: OpsAgent is proposed as a lightweight, efficient, and self-evolving multi-agent system for incident management in cloud systems, addressing limitations of existing approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual incident management in large-scale cloud systems is labor-intensive and error-prone due to massive and heterogeneous data. Existing automated approaches struggle with generalization, interpretability, and high deployment costs, limiting adoption.

Method: OpsAgent employs a training-free data processor to structure observability data into textual descriptions, uses a multi-agent collaboration framework for transparent diagnostic inference, and introduces a dual self-evolution mechanism for internal model updates and external experience accumulation.

Result: Experimental evaluation on the OPENRCA benchmark shows OpsAgent achieves state-of-the-art performance with generalizability, interpretability, cost-efficiency, and self-evolution properties.

Conclusion: OpsAgent is a practical, deployable, and sustainable solution for long-term incident management operations in real-world cloud systems.

Abstract: Incident management (IM) is central to the reliability of large-scale cloud
systems. Yet manual IM, where on-call engineers examine metrics, logs, and
traces is labor-intensive and error-prone in the face of massive and
heterogeneous observability data. Existing automated IM approaches often
struggle to generalize across systems, provide limited interpretability, and
incur high deployment costs, which hinders adoption in practice. In this paper,
we present OpsAgent, a lightweight, self-evolving multi-agent system for IM
that employs a training-free data processor to convert heterogeneous
observability data into structured textual descriptions, along with a
multi-agent collaboration framework that makes diagnostic inference transparent
and auditable. To support continual capability growth, OpsAgent also introduces
a dual self-evolution mechanism that integrates internal model updates with
external experience accumulation, thereby closing the deployment loop.
Comprehensive experiments on the OPENRCA benchmark demonstrate state-of-the-art
performance and show that OpsAgent is generalizable, interpretable,
cost-efficient, and self-evolving, making it a practically deployable and
sustainable solution for long-term operation in real-world cloud systems.

### [24] [BMGQ: A Bottom-up Method for Generating Complex Multi-hop Reasoning Questions from Semi-structured Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24151)
*Bingsen Qiu,Zijian Liu,Xiao Liu,Haoshen Yang,Zeren Gao,Bingjie Wang,Feier Zhang,Yixuan Qin,Chunyan Li*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces an automated framework to generate complex multi-hop QA datasets from semi-structured knowledge sources, reducing human effort while maintaining high difficulty for model training and evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to tackle the challenge of creating multi-hop QA datasets that require advanced retrieval and reasoning by addressing scalability issues and reducing reliance on manual curation.

Method: The framework uses Natural Language Inference for relation typing, reverse question construction for generating oblique cues, and a two-step evaluation with multi-model consensus filtering and evidence-matching for quality assurance.

Result: The automated system generates high-quality, training-ready multi-hop questions that preserve difficulty while being suitable for supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning, solving the data bottleneck.

Conclusion: This solution reduces human efforts in data creation, scales effectively, and supports the training and evaluation of high-capability QA systems.

Abstract: Building training-ready multi-hop question answering (QA) datasets that truly
stress a model's retrieval and reasoning abilities remains highly challenging
recently. While there have been a few recent evaluation datasets that capture
the characteristics of hard-to-search but easy-to-verify problems -- requiring
the integration of ambiguous, indirect, and cross-domain cues -- these data
resources remain scarce and are mostly designed for evaluation, making them
unsuitable for supervised fine-tuning (SFT) or reinforcement learning (RL).
Meanwhile, manually curating non-trivially retrievable questions -- where
answers cannot be found through a single direct query but instead require
multi-hop reasoning over oblique and loosely connected evidence -- incurs
prohibitive human costs and fails to scale, creating a critical data bottleneck
for training high-capability retrieval-and-reasoning agents.
  To address this, we present an automated framework for generating
high-difficulty, training-ready multi-hop questions from semi-structured
knowledge sources. The system (i) grows diverse, logically labeled evidence
clusters through Natural Language Inference (NLI)-based relation typing and
diversity-aware expansion; (ii) applies reverse question construction to
compose oblique cues so that isolated signals are underinformative but their
combination uniquely identifies the target entity; and (iii) enforces quality
with a two-step evaluation pipeline that combines multi-model consensus
filtering with structured constraint decomposition and evidence-based matching.
The result is a scalable process that yields complex, retrieval-resistant yet
verifiable questions suitable for SFT/RL training as well as challenging
evaluation, substantially reducing human curation effort while preserving the
difficulty profile of strong evaluation benchmarks.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces Boundless Large Model (BLM$_1$), addressing limitations in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) and proposing improvements to generalization across digital and physical spaces, embodiments, and tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address poor generalization of existing MLLMs, VLAs, and ELLMs across digital and physical tasks, embodiments, and spaces, and develop a unified model for seamless multi-space and multi-task operations.

Method: BLM$_1$ uses a two-stage training paradigm: Stage I introduces embodied knowledge via curated digital corpora while maintaining language competence, and Stage II trains a policy module for high-level control via an intent-bridging interface, supported by cross-embodiment demonstration data.

Result: BLM$_1$ achieves around a 6% performance gain in digital benchmarks and approximately 3% improvement in physical benchmarks, outperforming four major model families.

Conclusion: The proposed BLM$_1$ model demonstrates significant advancements in task generalization, cross-embodiment control, and seamless operation in both digital and physical spaces.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have advanced vision-language
reasoning and are increasingly deployed in embodied agents. However,
significant limitations remain: MLLMs generalize poorly across digital-physical
spaces and embodiments; vision-language-action models (VLAs) produce low-level
actions yet lack robust high-level embodied reasoning; and most embodied large
language models (ELLMs) are constrained to digital-space with poor
generalization to the physical world. Thus, unified models that operate
seamlessly across digital and physical spaces while generalizing across
embodiments and tasks remain absent. We introduce the \textbf{Boundless Large
Model (BLM$_1$)}, a multimodal spatial foundation model that preserves
instruction following and reasoning, incorporates embodied knowledge, and
supports robust cross-embodiment control. BLM$_1$ integrates three key
capabilities -- \textit{cross-space transfer, cross-task learning, and
cross-embodiment generalization} -- via a two-stage training paradigm. Stage I
injects embodied knowledge into the MLLM through curated digital corpora while
maintaining language competence. Stage II trains a policy module through an
intent-bridging interface that extracts high-level semantics from the MLLM to
guide control, without fine-tuning the MLLM backbone. This process is supported
by a self-collected cross-embodiment demonstration suite spanning four robot
embodiments and six progressively challenging tasks. Evaluations across digital
and physical benchmarks show that a single BLM$_1$ instance outperforms four
model families -- MLLMs, ELLMs, VLAs, and GMLMs -- achieving
$\sim\!\textbf{6%}$ gains in digital tasks and $\sim\!\textbf{3%}$ in physical
tasks.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper presents UniPlanner, a novel planning framework for autonomous vehicles that integrates multiple datasets to improve trajectory planning robustness and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing deep learning methods for motion planning in autonomous vehicles are limited to single-dataset training, which restricts their robustness and applicability across diverse scenarios.

Method: Three innovations were introduced: 1) a History-Future Trajectory Dictionary Network (HFTDN) for guidance using trajectory similarity, 2) a Gradient-Free Trajectory Mapper (GFTM) for universal planning priors, and 3) Sparse-to-Dense (S2D) adaptive dropout to balance robustness during training and performance during inference.

Result: UniPlanner successfully achieves unified cross-dataset learning, enhancing safety and efficiency in autonomous vehicle trajectory planning.

Conclusion: UniPlanner is a pioneering framework that addresses multi-dataset integration in autonomous driving, demonstrating its potential to improve the robustness and effectiveness of motion planning systems.

Abstract: Motion planning is a critical component of autonomous vehicle decision-making
systems, directly determining trajectory safety and driving efficiency. While
deep learning approaches have advanced planning capabilities, existing methods
remain confined to single-dataset training, limiting their robustness in
planning.
  Through systematic analysis, we discover that vehicular trajectory
distributions and history-future correlations demonstrate remarkable
consistency across different datasets. Based on these findings, we propose
UniPlanner, the first planning framework designed for multi-dataset integration
in autonomous vehicle decision-making. UniPlanner achieves unified
cross-dataset learning through three synergistic innovations.
  First, the History-Future Trajectory Dictionary Network (HFTDN) aggregates
history-future trajectory pairs from multiple datasets, using historical
trajectory similarity to retrieve relevant futures and generate cross-dataset
planning guidance.
  Second, the Gradient-Free Trajectory Mapper (GFTM) learns robust
history-future correlations from multiple datasets, transforming historical
trajectories into universal planning priors. Its gradient-free design ensures
the introduction of valuable priors while preventing shortcut learning, making
the planning knowledge safely transferable. Third, the Sparse-to-Dense (S2D)
paradigm implements adaptive dropout to selectively suppress planning priors
during training for robust learning, while enabling full prior utilization
during inference to maximize planning performance.

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Memory-Driven GUI Agent (MGA), a novel approach for robust and efficient interaction with GUI environments by addressing existing issues in GUI-based agents.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Develop GUI agents capable of better handling complex desktop and web interfaces while mitigating error propagation and local exploration bias.

Method: MGA adopts an 'observe first, then decide' principle, modeling GUI interaction as independent context-rich environment states featuring a triad of screenshot, spatial information, and structured memory.

Result: Experiments conducted on OSworld benchmarks, real desktop applications, and cross-task transfer highlight MGA's improvements in robustness, generalization, and efficiency compared to baseline methods.

Conclusion: MGA represents a significant advancement in GUI agent development, offering improved interaction principles for diverse environments.

Abstract: The rapid progress of Large Language Models (LLMs) and their multimodal
extensions (MLLMs) has enabled agentic systems capable of perceiving and acting
across diverse environments. A challenging yet impactful frontier is the
development of GUI agents, which must navigate complex desktop and web
interfaces while maintaining robustness and generalization. Existing paradigms
typically model tasks as long-chain executions, concatenating historical
trajectories into the context. While approaches such as Mirage and GTA1 refine
planning or introduce multi-branch action selection, they remain constrained by
two persistent issues: Dependence on historical trajectories, which amplifies
error propagation. And Local exploration bias, where "decision-first,
observation-later" mechanisms overlook critical interface cues. We introduce
the Memory-Driven GUI Agent (MGA), which reframes GUI interaction around the
principle of observe first, then decide. MGA models each step as an
independent, context-rich environment state represented by a triad: current
screenshot, task-agnostic spatial information, and a dynamically updated
structured memory. Experiments on OSworld benchmarks, real desktop applications
(Chrome, VSCode, VLC), and cross-task transfer demonstrate that MGA achieves
substantial gains in robustness, generalization, and efficiency compared to
state-of-the-art baselines. The code is publicly available at:

Conclusion: MCP-Flow provides a scalable solution for improving LLM agents in real-world MCP environments and is publicly accessible.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) increasingly rely on external tools to perform
complex, realistic tasks, yet their ability to utilize the rapidly expanding
Model Contextual Protocol (MCP) ecosystem remains limited. Existing MCP
research covers few servers, depends on costly manual curation, and lacks

exceeding prior work in scale and diversity. Extensive experiments demonstrate
MCP-Flow's effectiveness in driving superior MCP tool selection, function-call

Motivation: MCTS's inefficiency arises from its low sample efficiency, especially when using abstractions. Existing models like pruned OGA fail to address issues with tiebreaks between actions in the same abstract node.

Method: The paper introduces alternative intra-abstraction policies to manage tiebreak scenarios. These methods are empirically evaluated across various scenarios and parameter settings.

Result: The proposed intra-abstraction policies outperform the random tiebreak policy used in standard abstraction methods in MCTS across most environments tested.

Conclusion: Adopting specific intra-abstraction policies can improve the performance of MCTS, highlighting the importance of detailed strategies for managing abstract nodes and tiebreak situations.

Abstract: One weakness of Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) is its sample efficiency which
can be addressed by building and using state and/or action abstractions in
parallel to the tree search such that information can be shared among nodes of
the same layer. The primary usage of abstractions for MCTS is to enhance the
Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) value during the tree policy by aggregating visits
and returns of an abstract node. However, this direct usage of abstractions
does not take the case into account where multiple actions with the same parent
might be in the same abstract node, as these would then all have the same UCB
value, thus requiring a tiebreak rule. In state-of-the-art abstraction
algorithms such as pruned On the Go Abstractions (pruned OGA), this case has
not been noticed, and a random tiebreak rule was implicitly chosen. In this
paper, we propose and empirically evaluate several alternative
intra-abstraction policies, several of which outperform the random policy
across a majority of environments and parameter settings.

### [30] [Verifying Large Language Models' Reasoning Paths via Correlation Matrix Rank](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24299)
*Jiayu Liu,Wei Dai,Zhenya Huang,Ning Miao,Enhong Chen*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The study proposes a method to assess the correctness of large language models' reasoning based on internal behaviors without external resources, significantly enhancing their output accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large language models frequently make reasoning errors and hallucinations, necessitating an efficient way to verify their outputs without external dependencies.

Method: The method examines the rank of the correlation matrix between the input problem and output reasoning paths as a correctness indicator and introduces a Self-Indicator method for reweighing reasoning paths.

Result: Experiments demonstrate that the Self-Indicator method achieves over 75% accuracy in distinguishing correct reasoning and improves accuracies across benchmarks by over 8%, with minimal computational overhead.

Conclusion: Internal behaviors of LLMs can imply the credibility of reasoning, and the Self-Indicator method provides a robust, domain-agnostic mechanism to enhance reasoning accuracy efficiently.

Abstract: Despite the strong reasoning ability of large language models~(LLMs), they
are prone to errors and hallucinations. As a result, how to check their outputs
effectively and efficiently has become a critical problem in their
applications. Existing checking methods heavily rely on external resources,
such as trained verifiers (e.g., process/outcome reward models) or elaborate
prompts, which lead to high computational overhead and are only applicable to
specific domains. In this paper, we investigate whether the internal behaviors
of LLMs have already implied the credibility of their reasoning paths.
Specifically, we find that the rank of the correlation matrix between the input
problem and the output reasoning path is a robust indicator of reasoning
correctness. Different from other correctness indicators for LLMs, the
calculation of the correlation matrix only relies on the LLM itself, which
avoids the hassle of training a separate model or designing complicated
prompts. Based on it, we design a simple, plug-and-play Self-Indicator method
to reweight candidate reasoning paths, which achieves significant performance
improvements than other voting and verification methods with very few
computational overhead. Our experiments across multiple LLMs of varying scales
and model families have further shown the effectiveness of Self-Indicator. It
achieves over 75% accuracy in distinguishing correct reasoning paths from
incorrect ones, and, in turn, improves the accuracies on three reasoning
benchmarks by more than 8%.

### [31] [Retrieval and Argumentation Enhanced Multi-Agent LLMs for Judgmental Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24303)
*Deniz Gorur,Antoni Rago,Francesca Toni*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper explores judgmental forecasting using a novel multi-agent framework for claim verification, combining evidence from agents to improve accuracy and provide explainable outputs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance judgmental forecasting by leveraging diverse perspectives from multiple agents and achieve explainable claim verification.

Method: The authors propose a multi-agent framework involving Large Language Models (LLMs), incorporating methods like ArgLLM, RbAM, and RAG-ArgLLM to generate and evaluate quantitative bipolar argumentation frameworks (QBAFs).

Result: Experiments conducted with two datasets show improved forecasting accuracy when combining evidence from two or three agents, particularly with three-agent setups.

Conclusion: Using multiple agents equipped with different methods significantly improves forecasting outcomes and provides a transparent way to evaluate claims using evidence.

Abstract: Judgmental forecasting is the task of making predictions about future events
based on human judgment. This task can be seen as a form of claim verification,
where the claim corresponds to a future event and the task is to assess the
plausibility of that event. In this paper, we propose a novel multi-agent
framework for claim verification, whereby different agents may disagree on
claim veracity and bring specific evidence for and against the claims,
represented as quantitative bipolar argumentation frameworks (QBAFs). We then
instantiate the framework for supporting claim verification, with a variety of
agents realised with Large Language Models (LLMs): (1) ArgLLM agents, an
existing approach for claim verification that generates and evaluates QBAFs;
(2) RbAM agents, whereby LLM-empowered Relation-based Argument Mining (RbAM)
from external sources is used to generate QBAFs; (3) RAG-ArgLLM agents,
extending ArgLLM agents with a form of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) of
arguments from external sources. Finally, we conduct experiments with two
standard judgmental forecasting datasets, with instances of our framework with
two or three agents, empowered by six different base LLMs. We observe that
combining evidence from agents can improve forecasting accuracy, especially in
the case of three agents, while providing an explainable combination of
evidence for claim verification.

*Daria Kravets-Meinke,Hannah Schmid-Petri,Sonja Niemann,Ute Schmid*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Generative Large Language Models (gLLMs) like ChatGPT outperform traditional methods in communication research tasks and present a paradigm shift in automated content analysis, but face critical adoption challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the underdevelopment of gLLMs as a methodological tool in communication research and tackle challenges in their application for quantitative content analysis.

Method: Synthesis of current research on gLLM-assisted quantitative content analysis and proposing a best-practice guide to overcome challenges like model selection, parameter tuning, prompt crafting, and validation.

Result: The paper identifies seven key challenges for gLLM-assisted content analysis and offers a comprehensive guide to enable wider adoption by communication researchers.

Conclusion: gLLMs present innovative opportunities for efficient and high-quality content analysis in communication research, but the adoption requires careful navigation of operational challenges to conform to disciplinary standards.

Abstract: Generative Large Language Models (gLLMs), such as ChatGPT, are increasingly
being used in communication research for content analysis. Studies show that
gLLMs can outperform both crowd workers and trained coders, such as research
assistants, on various coding tasks relevant to communication science, often at
a fraction of the time and cost. Additionally, gLLMs can decode implicit
meanings and contextual information, be instructed using natural language,
deployed with only basic programming skills, and require little to no annotated
data beyond a validation dataset - constituting a paradigm shift in automated
content analysis. Despite their potential, the integration of gLLMs into the
methodological toolkit of communication research remains underdeveloped. In
gLLM-assisted quantitative content analysis, researchers must address at least
seven critical challenges that impact result quality: (1) codebook development,
(2) prompt engineering, (3) model selection, (4) parameter tuning, (5)
iterative refinement, (6) validation of the model's reliability, and
optionally, (7) performance enhancement. This paper synthesizes emerging
research on gLLM-assisted quantitative content analysis and proposes a
comprehensive best-practice guide to navigate these challenges. Our goal is to
make gLLM-based content analysis more accessible to a broader range of
communication researchers and ensure adherence to established disciplinary
quality standards of validity, reliability, reproducibility, and research
ethics.

*Yunxuan Jiang,Silan Hu,Xiaoning Wang,Yuanyuan Zhang,Xiangyu Chang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper presents VDSAgents, a PCS-guided multi-agent system enhancing the reliability of LLM-driven data science workflows.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM-based systems for data science often lack robustness due to reliance solely on internal reasoning without scientific principles.

Method: VDSAgents utilizes PCS principles in a modular workflow with specialized agents for each phase, ensuring scientific auditability and functionality.

Result: VDSAgents outperforms state-of-the-art systems like AutoKaggle and DataInterpreter across nine diverse datasets.

Conclusion: Embedding PCS principles into LLM-driven automation improves trustworthiness, scalability, and effectiveness in data science workflows.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) become increasingly integrated into data science
workflows for automated system design. However, these LLM-driven data science
systems rely solely on the internal reasoning of LLMs, lacking guidance from
scientific and theoretical principles. This limits their trustworthiness and
robustness, especially when dealing with noisy and complex real-world datasets.
This paper provides VDSAgents, a multi-agent system grounded in the
Predictability-Computability-Stability (PCS) principles proposed in the
Veridical Data Science (VDS) framework. Guided by PCS principles, the system
implements a modular workflow for data cleaning, feature engineering, modeling,
and evaluation. Each phase is handled by an elegant agent, incorporating
perturbation analysis, unit testing, and model validation to ensure both
functionality and scientific auditability. We evaluate VDSAgents on nine
datasets with diverse characteristics, comparing it with state-of-the-art
end-to-end data science systems, such as AutoKaggle and DataInterpreter, using
DeepSeek-V3 and GPT-4o as backends. VDSAgents consistently outperforms the
results of AutoKaggle and DataInterpreter, which validates the feasibility of
embedding PCS principles into LLM-driven data science automation.

*Silin Chen,Yuzhong Chen,Zifan Wang,Junhao Wang,Zifeng Jia,Keith M Kendrick,Tuo Zhang,Lin Zhao,Dezhong Yao,Tianming Liu,Xi Jiang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes "Brain-like Space," a unified framework to measure and compare the intrinsic organization of AI models with human brain networks, revealing varied "brain-likeness" among AI models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge the gap between neuroscience and AI by investigating whether modern neural networks organize information like the human brain.

Method: Introduced the concept of "Brain-like Space" for mapping AI models onto human brain networks. Conducted analysis on 151 Transformer-based AI models across different modalities (vision, language, multimodal).

Result: Identified an arc-shaped geometry within the Brain-like Space, showing degrees of brain-likeness based on pretraining paradigms and positional encoding schemes.

Conclusion: Brain-like Space allows comparisons of intelligence in AI models across domains, suggesting principles that unite machine and brain organization.

Abstract: For decades, neuroscientists and computer scientists have pursued a shared
ambition: to understand intelligence and build it. Modern artificial neural
networks now rival humans in language, perception, and reasoning, yet it is
still largely unknown whether these artificial systems organize information as
the brain does. Existing brain-AI alignment studies have shown the striking
correspondence between the two systems, but such comparisons remain bound to
specific inputs and tasks, offering no common ground for comparing how AI
models with different kinds of modalities-vision, language, or multimodal-are
intrinsically organized. Here we introduce a groundbreaking concept of
Brain-like Space: a unified geometric space in which every AI model can be
precisely situated and compared by mapping its intrinsic spatial attention
topological organization onto canonical human functional brain networks,
regardless of input modality, task, or sensory domain. Our extensive analysis
of 151 Transformer-based models spanning state-of-the-art large vision models,
large language models, and large multimodal models uncovers a continuous
arc-shaped geometry within this space, reflecting a gradual increase of
brain-likeness; different models exhibit distinct distribution patterns within
this geometry associated with different degrees of brain-likeness, shaped not
merely by their modality but by whether the pretraining paradigm emphasizes
global semantic abstraction and whether the positional encoding scheme
facilitates deep fusion across different modalities. Moreover, the degree of
brain-likeness for a model and its downstream task performance are not
"identical twins". The Brain-like Space provides the first unified framework
for situating, quantifying, and comparing intelligence across domains,
revealing the deep organizational principles that bridge machines and the
brain.

*Pedram Fard,Alaleh Azhir,Neguine Rezaii,Jiazi Tian,Hossein Estiri*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper outlines a new AI framework in medicine aiming to center decision-making on individual patient needs, reducing reliance on population averages.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AI systems in medicine optimize for average patient accuracy, which compromises equity and trust for atypical cases such as rare variants or diverse demographics.

Method: Proposes a multi-agent framework where agents specialize based on organ systems or demographics and coordinate to deliver personalized decision-support packets using shared models and tools.

Result: The ecosystem enhances individualized reliability by focusing error reduction in low-density data areas and balancing risk-coverage trade-offs.

Conclusion: Shifting from traditional population-focused AI designs to orchestrated intelligence addresses equity and transparency, aligning medical AI with patient-centered care principles.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence in medicine is built to serve the average patient. By
minimizing error across large datasets, most systems deliver strong aggregate
accuracy yet falter at the margins: patients with rare variants,
multimorbidity, or underrepresented demographics. This average patient fallacy
erodes both equity and trust. We propose a different design: a multi-agent
ecosystem for N-of-1 decision support. In this environment, agents clustered by
organ systems, patient populations, and analytic modalities draw on a shared
library of models and evidence synthesis tools. Their results converge in a
coordination layer that weighs reliability, uncertainty, and data density
before presenting the clinician with a decision-support packet: risk estimates
bounded by confidence ranges, outlier flags, and linked evidence. Validation
shifts from population averages to individual reliability, measured by error in
low-density regions, calibration in the small, and risk--coverage trade-offs.
Anticipated challenges include computational demands, automation bias, and
regulatory fit, addressed through caching strategies, consensus checks, and
adaptive trial frameworks. By moving from monolithic models to orchestrated
intelligence, this approach seeks to align medical AI with the first principle
of medicine: care that is transparent, equitable, and centered on the
individual.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Policy Cards provide a standardized, machine-readable way to enforce operational, regulatory, and ethical constraints for AI agents at runtime, ensuring compliance and accountability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the need for AI agents to adhere to operational, regulatory, and ethical constraints in real-time deployments and to bridge the gap between high-level AI governance and hands-on engineering practices.

Method: Introduces Policy Cards, machine-readable deployment-layer artifacts that extend transparency standards (e.g., Model and System Cards) by encoding normative rules such as allow/deny, obligations, and mappings to assurance frameworks like NIST AI RMF and EU AI Act.

Result: Policy Cards enable automated validation, runtime enforcement, and continuous-audit pipelines for autonomous agents, ensuring verifiable compliance with governance frameworks.

Conclusion: Policy Cards provide a scalable mechanism to integrate governance with engineering practices, enhance accountability, and establish a foundation for distributed assurance in multi-agent environments.

Abstract: Policy Cards are introduced as a machine-readable, deployment-layer standard
for expressing operational, regulatory, and ethical constraints for AI agents.
The Policy Card sits with the agent and enables it to follow required
constraints at runtime. It tells the agent what it must and must not do. As
such, it becomes an integral part of the deployed agent. Policy Cards extend
existing transparency artifacts such as Model, Data, and System Cards by
defining a normative layer that encodes allow/deny rules, obligations,
evidentiary requirements, and crosswalk mappings to assurance frameworks
including NIST AI RMF, ISO/IEC 42001, and the EU AI Act. Each Policy Card can
be validated automatically, version-controlled, and linked to runtime
enforcement or continuous-audit pipelines. The framework enables verifiable
compliance for autonomous agents, forming a foundation for distributed
assurance in multi-agent ecosystems. Policy Cards provide a practical mechanism
for integrating high-level governance with hands-on engineering practice and
enabling accountable autonomy at scale.

### [37] [Improving LLM Reasoning via Dependency-Aware Query Decomposition and Logic-Parallel Content Expansion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24390)
*Xianjun Gao,Jianchun Liu,Hongli Xu,Liusheng Huang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces Orion, a framework for enhancing the efficiency and quality of Large Language Model (LLM) reasoning in real-time web applications, addressing challenges of latency and throughput by utilizing dependency-aware query decomposition and parallel content expansion.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation for this paper is to overcome the inefficiencies in current LLM reasoning methods, which hinder real-time web applications like AI-powered search and conversational agents that demand both low latency and high-quality reasoning.

Method: The method involves a two-phase framework: (1) key point generation using retrieval-augmented few-shot prompting to distill logical structures, and (2) content parallel expansion based on a dependency graph to elaborate on these points. Additionally, Orion introduces pipeline scheduling to optimize cross-query parallelism, balancing computational loads.

Result: Orion achieves up to 4.33x faster token generation, 3.42x lower answer latency, and 18.75% improvement in reasoning quality compared to existing approaches.

Conclusion: Orion successfully addresses the dual challenges of efficiency and quality in LLM reasoning for web applications, making it a practical solution for modern interactive services.

Abstract: The integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) into real-time Web
applications, such as AI-powered search and conversational agents, presents a
fundamental Web infrastructure challenge: reconciling the demand for
high-quality, complex reasoning with the stringent low-latency and
high-throughput requirements of interactive services. Current LLM reasoning,
hindered by computationally inefficient sequential generation and rigid
reasoning strategies, creates a critical bottleneck for the Web services.
Existing approaches typically optimize the LLM reasoning for either efficiency
or quality but struggle to achieve both, and thus fail to meet the dual
requirements of modern Web platforms. To overcome these limitations, we propose
Orion, a novel and efficient reasoning framework that enables dependency-aware
query decomposition and logic-parallel content expansion. Concretely, Orion
decomposes a single query reasoning process into two synergistic phases: (1)
\textit{key point generation}, which distills logically structured key points
through retrieval-augmented few-shot prompting, and (2) \textit{content
parallel expansion}, which concurrently elaborates on these points based on a
dependency graph to ensure logical consistency. Furthermore, Orion introduces a
pipeline scheduling mechanism that exploits the complementary computational
characteristics of the two phases (generation imposes pressure on GPU computing
and expansion stresses on GPU memory) across multiple queries, enabling
cross-query parallelism and dramatically improving reasoning performance (\ie,
efficiency and quality). Experiments on diverse benchmarks show that Orion not
only delivers up to 4.33x higher token generation speed and 3.42x lower answer
latency over the baselines but also improves reasoning quality by up to 18.75%
through explicitly modeling inter-point dependencies.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: APTBench is introduced as a benchmark for evaluating agentic potentials of LLMs during pre-training, filling the gap between isolated skill benchmarks and post-training evaluations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current benchmarks focus too narrowly on isolated skills or post-training agent capabilities, leaving a gap in evaluating agentic potentials during pre-training.

Method: APTBench converts real-world agent tasks, including planning and action, into multiple-choice or text completion questions tailored for base models.

Result: APTBench provides a lightweight and cost-effective predictive signal of downstream agent performance compared to general-purpose benchmarks.

Conclusion: APTBench bridges the gap in assessing agentic abilities during LLM pre-training, offering insights to better guide model training and align LLMs more effectively with autonomous tasks.

Abstract: With the rapid development of LLM-based agents, there is a growing trend to
incorporate agent-specific data into the pre-training stage of LLMs, aiming to
better align LLMs with real-world autonomous task execution. However, current
pre-training benchmarks primarily focus on isolated and static skills, e.g.,
common knowledge or mathematical/code reasoning, and fail to reflect model's
agentic capabilities. On the other hand, agent benchmarks are typically
designed for post-trained models, requiring multi-turn task execution abilities
that base models struggle to support. Thus, there is a compelling need for a
benchmark that can evaluate agentic potentials during pre-training and guide
the model training more effectively. To address this gap, we propose APTBench,
a framework that converts real-world agent tasks and successful trajectories
into multiple-choice or text completion questions tailored for base models. It
focuses on core agentic abilities, e.g., planning and action, and covers key
agent scenarios, software engineering and deep research. Compared to existing
general-purpose benchmarks, APTBench offers a more predictive signal of a
model's downstream performance as an agent, while remaining significantly more
lightweight and cost-effective than full-scale, end-to-end agent evaluations
after post-training.

Motivation: Detect unsafe operations by computer-using agents in complex mobile environments, addressing challenges in safety detection.

Method: Developed a dynamic sandbox (MobileRisk-Live) with detailed annotations and proposed OS-Sentinel, a hybrid framework combining formal verification and Vision-Language Model assessments.

Result: OS-Sentinel showed 10%-30% improvement in detecting safety violations compared to previous methods across various metrics.

Conclusion: The study provides tools and insights for safer autonomous mobile agents, advancing research in safety verification.

Abstract: Computer-using agents powered by Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have
demonstrated human-like capabilities in operating digital environments like
mobile platforms. While these agents hold great promise for advancing digital
automation, their potential for unsafe operations, such as system compromise
and privacy leakage, is raising significant concerns. Detecting these safety
concerns across the vast and complex operational space of mobile environments
presents a formidable challenge that remains critically underexplored. To
establish a foundation for mobile agent safety research, we introduce
MobileRisk-Live, a dynamic sandbox environment accompanied by a safety
detection benchmark comprising realistic trajectories with fine-grained
annotations. Built upon this, we propose OS-Sentinel, a novel hybrid safety
detection framework that synergistically combines a Formal Verifier for
detecting explicit system-level violations with a VLM-based Contextual Judge
for assessing contextual risks and agent actions. Experiments show that
OS-Sentinel achieves 10%-30% improvements over existing approaches across
multiple metrics. Further analysis provides critical insights that foster the
development of safer and more reliable autonomous mobile agents.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces "Law in Silico," a framework using Large Language Models to simulate legal systems, showcasing their potential for modeling crime trends and legal mechanisms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world legal experiments are often impractical due to costs or feasibility, so simulating legal systems with AI offers an effective alternative for testing and developing legal theories.

Method: The researchers developed "Law in Silico," using LLM-based agents to simulate dynamic legal scenarios with mechanisms for legislation, adjudication, enforcement, and individual decision-making.

Result: Experiments showed simulated crime rates correlating with real-world crime trends, while micro-level insights revealed the importance of adaptive and transparent legal systems for protecting vulnerable individuals.

Conclusion: LLMs are effective tools for modeling legal societies, suggesting their potential for use in legal theory development and administration.

Abstract: Since real-world legal experiments are often costly or infeasible, simulating
legal societies with Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems provides an effective
alternative for verifying and developing legal theory, as well as supporting
legal administration. Large Language Models (LLMs), with their world knowledge
and role-playing capabilities, are strong candidates to serve as the foundation
for legal society simulation. However, the application of LLMs to simulate
legal systems remains underexplored. In this work, we introduce Law in Silico,
an LLM-based agent framework for simulating legal scenarios with individual
decision-making and institutional mechanisms of legislation, adjudication, and
enforcement. Our experiments, which compare simulated crime rates with
real-world data, demonstrate that LLM-based agents can largely reproduce
macro-level crime trends and provide insights that align with real-world
observations. At the same time, micro-level simulations reveal that a
well-functioning, transparent, and adaptive legal system offers better
protection of the rights of vulnerable individuals.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Neuromorphic computing systems enhance energy efficiency in robotics and use SNNs for temporal processing. This paper addresses optimization challenges in SNNs for RL tasks using surrogate gradients and proposes a novel guiding policy to improve training performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To resolve inefficiencies in applying Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) for complex control tasks in robotics, particularly addressing challenges in gradient optimization and sequence training in reinforcement learning environments.

Method: The authors systematically analyze surrogate gradient slope effects and propose a training approach that combines a privileged guiding policy with adaptive slope scheduling.

Result: Shallower or scheduled slopes lead to 2.1x improvements in RL settings. For a drone position control task, the proposed method achieves an average return of 400 points, outperforming prior techniques' --200 points.

Conclusion: This research improves the theoretical understanding of surrogate learning in SNNs and develops effective training strategies for real-world neuromorphic robotics systems.

Abstract: Neuromorphic computing systems are set to revolutionize energy-constrained
robotics by achieving orders-of-magnitude efficiency gains, while enabling
native temporal processing. Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) represent a
promising algorithmic approach for these systems, yet their application to
complex control tasks faces two critical challenges: (1) the non-differentiable
nature of spiking neurons necessitates surrogate gradients with unclear
optimization properties, and (2) the stateful dynamics of SNNs require training
on sequences, which in reinforcement learning (RL) is hindered by limited
sequence lengths during early training, preventing the network from bridging
its warm-up period.
  We address these challenges by systematically analyzing surrogate gradient
slope settings, showing that shallower slopes increase gradient magnitude in
deeper layers but reduce alignment with true gradients. In supervised learning,
we find no clear preference for fixed or scheduled slopes. The effect is much
more pronounced in RL settings, where shallower slopes or scheduled slopes lead
to a 2.1x improvement in both training and final deployed performance. Next, we
propose a novel training approach that leverages a privileged guiding policy to
bootstrap the learning process, while still exploiting online environment
interactions with the spiking policy. Combining our method with an adaptive
slope schedule for a real-world drone position control task, we achieve an
average return of 400 points, substantially outperforming prior techniques,
including Behavioral Cloning and TD3BC, which achieve at most --200 points
under the same conditions. This work advances both the theoretical
understanding of surrogate gradient learning in SNNs and practical training
methodologies for neuromorphic controllers demonstrated in real-world robotic
systems.

*Zihan Chen,Song Wang,Xingbo Fu,Chengshuai Shi,Zhenyu Lei,Cong Shen,Jundong Li*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces a two-stage pipeline that reduces labeling costs for in-context learning by combining cross-task supervision, label propagation, and limited LLM usage.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address the high cost and labor-intensive process of collecting quality examples for large language models (LLMs) on new or challenging tasks.

Method: The proposed method first uses cross-task examples to prompt an LLM for pseudo-labeling a small target dataset. Then, a graph-based label propagation method assigns labels to the rest of the dataset without further LLM involvement.

Result: Experiments on five tasks show that the pipeline achieves strong performance while significantly reducing data labeling costs.

Conclusion: The proposed approach efficiently balances cost, scalability, and performance, facilitating cost-effective in-context learning leveraging LLM capabilities.

Abstract: The capability of in-context learning (ICL) enables large language models
(LLMs) to perform novel tasks without parameter updates by conditioning on a
few input-output examples. However, collecting high-quality examples for new or
challenging tasks can be costly and labor-intensive. In this work, we propose a
cost-efficient two-stage pipeline that reduces reliance on LLMs for data
labeling. Our approach first leverages readily available cross-task examples to
prompt an LLM and pseudo-label a small set of target task instances. We then
introduce a graph-based label propagation method that spreads label information
to the remaining target examples without additional LLM queries. The resulting
fully pseudo-labeled dataset is used to construct in-task demonstrations for
ICL. This pipeline combines the flexibility of cross-task supervision with the
scalability of LLM-free propagation. Experiments across five tasks demonstrate
that our method achieves strong performance while lowering labeling costs.

TL;DR: This paper discusses how Generative AI (GenAI) can revolutionize healthcare by creating a medical data ecosystem to support its deployment effectively.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation of this paper is to address the challenges in deploying GenAI in healthcare, emphasizing the need for an efficient medical data ecosystem to enable transformative benefits like better diagnosis and personalized treatments.

Method: The proposed method focuses on a data-centric approach for designing and deploying GenAI systems. It involves creating an integrated medical data ecosystem for seamless data integration, representation, and retrieval using tools like semantic vector search and contextual querying.

Result: The medical data ecosystem serves as the foundational framework for GenAI in healthcare. It provides high-quality, multimodal data for training and fine-tuning GenAI models while supporting task-specific knowledge retrieval and inference.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that a comprehensive medical data ecosystem can enable the transformative capabilities of GenAI, enhancing healthcare delivery while reducing clinicians' cognitive burden.

Abstract: Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) is taking the world by storm. It
promises transformative opportunities for advancing and disrupting existing
practices, including healthcare. From large language models (LLMs) for clinical
note synthesis and conversational assistance to multimodal systems that
integrate medical imaging, electronic health records, and genomic data for
decision support, GenAI is transforming the practice of medicine and the
delivery of healthcare, such as diagnosis and personalized treatments, with
great potential in reducing the cognitive burden on clinicians, thereby
improving overall healthcare delivery. However, GenAI deployment in healthcare
requires an in-depth understanding of healthcare tasks and what can and cannot
be achieved. In this paper, we propose a data-centric paradigm in the design
and deployment of GenAI systems for healthcare. Specifically, we reposition the
data life cycle by making the medical data ecosystem as the foundational
substrate for generative healthcare systems. This ecosystem is designed to
sustainably support the integration, representation, and retrieval of diverse
medical data and knowledge. With effective and efficient data processing
pipelines, such as semantic vector search and contextual querying, it enables
GenAI-powered operations for upstream model components and downstream clinical
applications. Ultimately, it not only supplies foundation models with
high-quality, multimodal data for large-scale pretraining and domain-specific
fine-tuning, but also serves as a knowledge retrieval backend to support
task-specific inference via the agentic layer. The ecosystem enables the
deployment of GenAI for high-quality and effective healthcare delivery.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper presents FunReason-MT, a framework for synthesizing high-quality multi-turn training data for function calling (FC) in LLMs, resolving challenges in training data generation and achieving state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of high-quality, multi-turn training data critically needed for advanced AI systems that rely on function calling to interact with external tools in real-world environments.

Method: The proposed FunReason-MT framework employs Environment-API Graph Interactions for diverse data collection, Advanced Tool-Query Synthesis for simplifying complex data generation, and a Guided Iterative Chain for creating sophisticated chain-of-thought data.

Result: Using FunReason-MT, a 4B model achieves state-of-the-art performance on the Berkeley Function-Calling Leaderboard (BFCLv3) and shows further improvement on BFCLv4, outperforming most comparable and closed-source models.

Conclusion: FunReason-MT enables a dependable and robust source of training data for agentic learning, effectively enhancing the multi-turn function calling capabilities of large language models in complex real-world applications.

Abstract: Function calling (FC) empowers large language models (LLMs) and autonomous
agents to interface with external tools, a critical capability for solving
complex, real-world problems. As this ability becomes increasingly central to
advanced AI systems, the need for high-quality, multi-turn training data to
develop and refine it cannot be overstated. Existing data synthesis methods,
such as random environment sampling or multi-agent role-playing, are not
powerful enough to generate high-quality data in real-world environments.
Practical challenges come in three folds: targeted model training, isolation of
tool architecture, and multi-turn logical dependency. To address these
structural deficiencies, we present FunReason-MT, a novel data synthesis
framework for real-world multi-turn tool use. FunReason-MT resolves the
complexity barrier in multi-turn FC data by employing 1) Environment-API Graph
Interactions to gather varied high-quality trajectories, 2) Advanced Tool-Query
Synthesis to simplify hard query construction, and 3) Guided Iterative Chain
for sophisticated CoT generation. Evaluations on Berkeley Function-Calling
Leaderboard (BFCLv3) demonstrate the power of our framework: a 4B model built
upon FunReason-MT generated data achieves state-of-the-art performance among
comparable-sized models, outperforming most close-source models. Further
performance improvements on BFCLv4 confirm that FunReason-MT provides a
reliable and robust source for agentic learning.

*Nitin Rai,Daeun,Choi,Nathan S. Boyd,Arnold W. Schumann*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper reviews the use of foundation models (FMs), such as large-language models (LLMs) and vision-language models (VLMs), in site-specific disease management (SSDM) for crops. Focus areas include adaptive and reinforcement learning, digital twin simulations, and multi-modal FMs to enhance disease detection and treatment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance real-time and precise disease management in crops through advanced AI technologies like FMs, integrating visual, textual, and interactive capabilities.

Method: The study screened around 40 articles focusing on FMs' application in SSDM, emphasizing LLMs and VLMs, adaptive learning, reinforcement learning, and digital twin frameworks.

Result: FMs, especially VLMs, are gaining rapid adoption, with significant advancements in 2023-2024. However, RL and adaptive learning are still developing, and challenges like sim-to-real gaps and limited human-robot collaboration remain.

Conclusion: Foundation models with multi-modal capabilities and real-time feedback are key to the future of SSDM. While promising, advancements are needed in RL, adaptive learning, and human-robot interaction to enable robust real-world applications.

Abstract: Site-specific disease management (SSDM) in crops has advanced rapidly through
machine and deep learning (ML and DL) for real-time computer vision. Research
evolved from handcrafted feature extraction to large-scale automated feature
learning. With foundation models (FMs), crop disease datasets are now processed
in fundamentally new ways. Unlike traditional neural networks, FMs integrate
visual and textual data, interpret symptoms in text, reason about
symptom-management relationships, and support interactive QA for growers and
educators. Adaptive and imitation learning in robotics further enables
field-based disease management. This review screened approx. 40 articles on FM
applications for SSDM, focusing on large-language models (LLMs) and
vision-language models (VLMs), and discussing their role in adaptive learning
(AL), reinforcement learning (RL), and digital twin frameworks for targeted
spraying. Key findings: (a) FMs are gaining traction with surging literature in
2023-24; (b) VLMs outpace LLMs, with a 5-10x increase in publications; (c) RL
and AL are still nascent for smart spraying; (d) digital twins with RL can
simulate targeted spraying virtually; (e) addressing the sim-to-real gap is
critical for real-world deployment; (f) human-robot collaboration remains
limited, especially in human-in-the-loop approaches where robots detect early
symptoms and humans validate uncertain cases; (g) multi-modal FMs with
real-time feedback will drive next-gen SSDM. For updates, resources, and

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of attention to multi-turn tool interactions in agentic tool use despite its growing relevance.

Method: Developing OrchDAG, a synthetic data pipeline modeling tool execution as DAGs, together with proposing a graph-based reward for enhanced training using GRPO-style algorithms.

Result: The dataset provides a challenging benchmark, and the proposed graph-based reward demonstrates effectiveness in enhancing training.

Conclusion: Leveraging the topological structure of DAGs and incorporating data complexity are crucial for advancing multi-turn tool use in agent training.

Abstract: Agentic tool use has gained traction with the rise of agentic tool calling,
yet most existing work overlooks the complexity of multi-turn tool
interactions. We introduce OrchDAG, a synthetic data generation pipeline that
models tool execution as directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) with controllable
complexity. Using this dataset, we benchmark model performance and propose a
graph-based reward to enhance RLVR training. Experiments show that the dataset
presents a challenging but solvable benchmark, and the proposed reward is
effective when combined with GRPO-style algorithms, highlighting the importance
of leveraging topological structure and data complexity in multi-turn tool use.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a method to enhance artifact generation by linking tools and domain knowledge graphs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve automated plan generation by exploiting dependencies between tools and procedural knowledge.

Method: Construct and fuse tool and domain knowledge graphs using DeepResearch-inspired analysis, followed by deep-sparse integration.

Result: Experiments show improved modeling of tool interactions and better plan generation.

Conclusion: Linking tool graphs with domain knowledge graphs significantly benefits tool-augmented reasoning and planning.

Abstract: We present a framework for uncovering and exploiting dependencies among tools
and documents to enhance exemplar artifact generation. Our method begins by
constructing a tool knowledge graph from tool schemas,including descriptions,
arguments, and output payloads, using a DeepResearch-inspired analysis. In
parallel, we derive a complementary knowledge graph from internal documents and
SOPs, which is then fused with the tool graph. To generate exemplar plans, we
adopt a deep-sparse integration strategy that aligns structural tool
dependencies with procedural knowledge. Experiments demonstrate that this
unified framework effectively models tool interactions and improves plan
generation, underscoring the benefits of linking tool graphs with domain
knowledge graphs for tool-augmented reasoning and planning.

TL;DR: This paper presents SlowPoke, a lightweight on-chip framework for detecting fail-slow failures in many-core architectures, achieving high compression rates, detection accuracy, and scalability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The desire to address fail-slow failures in many-core architectures, which hinder performance and cannot be effectively detected using existing memory-intensive methods that lack topology awareness.

Method: Proposing SlowPoke, a framework that employs compiler-based instrumentation for low-overhead monitoring, trace compression to fit limited on-chip memory, and a topology-aware ranking algorithm to detect and analyze failures.

Result: SlowPoke achieves an average reduction of traces' storage overhead by 115.9×, a fail-slow detection accuracy of 86.77%, and a false positive rate of 12.11%, and it scales effectively with various architectures.

Conclusion: SlowPoke provides a practical, scalable, and efficient solution for on-chip fail-slow detection in many-core architectures, demonstrating significant improvement in memory efficiency and detection capabilities for high-performance computing.

Abstract: Many-core architectures are essential for high-performance computing, but
their performance is undermined by widespread fail-slow failures. Detecting
such failures on-chip is challenging, as prior methods from distributed systems
are unsuitable due to strict memory limits and their inability to track
failures across the hardware topology. This paper introduces SlowPoke, a
lightweight, hardware-aware framework for practical on-chip fail-slow
detection. SlowPoke combines compiler-based instrumentation for low-overhead
monitoring, on-the-fly trace compression to operate within kilobytes of memory,
and a novel topology-aware ranking algorithm to pinpoint a failure's root
cause. We evaluate SlowPoke on a wide range of representative many-core
workloads, and the results demonstrate that SlowPoke reduces the storage
overhead of detection traces by an average of 115.9$\times$, while achieving an
average fail-slow detection accuracy of 86.77% and a false positive rate (FPR)
of 12.11%. More importantly, SlowPoke scales effectively across different
many-core architectures, making it practical for large-scale deployments.

*Arnav Shukla,Harsh Sharma,Srikant Bharadwaj,Vinayak Abrol,Sujay Deb*

Main category: cs.AR

TL;DR: The paper addresses latency issues in heterogeneous chiplet-based systems caused by memory transfers, proposing a multi-objective topology generator to optimize performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address performance degradation and SLA violations caused by bursty, memory-driven data transfers in Network-on-Interposer (NoI) for heterogeneous systems.

Method: The authors introduce an Interference Score (IS) metric and use a Partition-Aware Reinforcement Learner (PARL) for designing NoI topologies that balance multiple objectives like throughput, latency, and power.

Result: PARL-generated topologies reduced contention at memory cuts, maintained competitive throughput, and minimized worst-case slowdowns to 1.2 times.

Conclusion: Reframing NoI design with workload-aware optimization significantly enhances the performance of heterogeneous chiplet accelerators while meeting SLAs.

Abstract: Heterogeneous chiplet-based systems improve scaling by disag-gregating
CPUs/GPUs and emerging technologies (HBM/DRAM).However this on-package
disaggregation introduces a latency inNetwork-on-Interposer(NoI). We observe
that in modern large-modelinference, parameters and activations routinely move
backand forth from HBM/DRAM, injecting large, bursty flows into theinterposer.
These memory-driven transfers inflate tail latency andviolate Service Level
Agreements (SLAs) across k-ary n-cube base-line NoI topologies. To address this
gap we introduce an InterferenceScore (IS) that quantifies worst-case slowdown
under contention.We then formulate NoI synthesis as a multi-objective
optimization(MOO) problem. We develop PARL (Partition-Aware
ReinforcementLearner), a topology generator that balances throughput,
latency,and power. PARL-generated topologies reduce contention at the memory
cut, meet SLAs, and cut worst-case slowdown to 1.2 times while maintaining
competitive mean throughput relative to link-rich meshes. Overall, this
reframes NoI design for heterogeneouschiplet accelerators with workload-aware
objectives.

Motivation: Optimizing computation in deep neural networks by designing energy-efficient matrix multiplication engines.

Method: Designed new exact and approximate processing elements (PEs) using Positive Partial Product Cells (PPC) and Negative Partial Product Cells (NPPC), integrating them into systolic arrays.

Result: Achieved 22% and 32% energy savings in 8x8 systolic arrays, high quality outputs with PSNR 38.21 dB for DCT and PSNR 30.45 dB for edge detection.

Conclusion: Proposed designs enable energy-efficient and error-resilient image and vision processing suitable for DNN applications.

Abstract: Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) require highly efficient matrix multiplication
engines for complex computations. This paper presents a systolic array
architecture incorporating novel exact and approximate processing elements
(PEs), designed using energy-efficient positive partial product and negative
partial product cells, termed as PPC and NPPC, respectively. The proposed 8-bit
exact and approximate PE designs are employed in a 8x8 systolic array, which
achieves a energy savings of 22% and 32%, respectively, compared to the
existing design. To demonstrate their effectiveness, the proposed PEs are
integrated into a systolic array (SA) for Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT)
computation, achieving high output quality with a PSNR of 38.21,dB.
Furthermore, in an edge detection application using convolution, the
approximate PE achieves a PSNR of 30.45,dB. These results highlight the
potential of the proposed design to deliver significant energy efficiency while
maintaining competitive output quality, making it well-suited for
error-resilient image and vision processing applications.

*Alessandra Terranova,Björn Ross,Alexandra Birch*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Large language models (LLMs) need memory for effective conversational continuity and learning. A systematic study of memory-augmented methods shows significant token savings with competitive accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To determine the most effective types of memory for long-context conversational tasks and enhance the experiential learning capabilities of LLMs.

Method: The study uses LoCoMo, a benchmark with synthetic long-context dialogues, to evaluate different memory methods: full-context prompting, retrieval-augmented generation, episodic memory, and procedural memory.

Result: Memory-augmented methods reduce token usage by over 90% while maintaining accuracy. Benefits vary by model capability: RAG benefits smaller models, while episodic memory and complex semantic memory aid stronger models.

Conclusion: Memory systems should align with the capabilities of language models. Episodic memory, in particular, supports recognizing knowledge limits.

Abstract: In order for large language models to achieve true conversational continuity
and benefit from experiential learning, they need memory. While research has
focused on the development of complex memory systems, it remains unclear which
types of memory are most effective for long-context conversational tasks. We
present a systematic evaluation of memory-augmented methods using LoCoMo, a
benchmark of synthetic long-context dialogues annotated for question-answering
tasks that require diverse reasoning strategies. We analyse full-context
prompting, semantic memory through retrieval-augmented generation and agentic
memory, episodic memory through in-context learning, and procedural memory
through prompt optimization. Our findings show that memory-augmented approaches
reduce token usage by over 90% while maintaining competitive accuracy. Memory
architecture complexity should scale with model capability, with small
foundation models benefitting most from RAG, and strong instruction-tuned
reasoning model gaining from episodic learning through reflections and more
complex agentic semantic memory. In particular, episodic memory can help LLMs
recognise the limits of their own knowledge.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper evaluates interactions in LLM efficiency techniques and introduces BitSkip, a framework, demonstrating that a simple 8-bit quantized model without Hadamard transforms performs better than its complex counterparts, while exploring speed-quality trade-offs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the gap in understanding the compositional effects of complex techniques like extreme quantization and dynamic routing on LLM performance.

Method: The authors propose the BitSkip framework to systematically analyze the interactions among different quantization schemes and architectural choices in LLMs.

Result: BitSkip-V1, an 8-bit quantized model without Hadamard transforms, outperforms more complex models in quality (perplexity: 1.13 vs. 1.19) and demonstrates superior efficiency with a speed gain of 32.5% for minor quality loss.

Conclusion: Simple designs, such as BitSkip-V1, can outperform more complex methods, and incorporating Hadamard transforms can degrade performance. Proper design can achieve better trade-offs between model speed and quality.

Abstract: The pursuit of efficient Large Language Models (LLMs) has led to increasingly
complex techniques like extreme quantization and dynamic routing. While
individual benefits of these methods are well-documented, their compositional
effects remain poorly understood. This paper introduces BitSkip, a hybrid
architectural framework for systematically exploring these interactions.
Counter-intuitively, our findings reveal that a simple 8-bit quantized model
without Hadamard transform (BitSkip-V1) not only outperforms its more complex
4-bit and Hadamard-enhanced counterparts but also competes the full-precision
baseline in quality (perplexity of 1.13 vs 1.19) . The introduction of Hadamard
transforms, even at 8-bit precision, catastrophically degraded performance by
over 37,000%, tracing fundamental training instability. Our BitSkip-V1 recipe
demonstrates superior early-exit characteristics, with layer 18 providing
optimal 32.5% speed gain for minimal 4% quality loss.

TL;DR: This study examines dyslexic reading costs through a dataset, evaluating word-level features that influence reading time.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand where and under what conditions dyslexic reading difficulties occur and quantify these costs.

Method: Eye-tracking data aligned with word-level features (word length, frequency, and predictability) was analyzed to model the effects on reading times.

Result: Dyslexic readers show significant sensitivities to predictability, length, and frequency. Counterfactual manipulations narrowed the dyslexic-control reading gap by one third.

Conclusion: The study highlights actionable insights for interventions and computational models to reduce dyslexic reading difficulties, while emphasizing further research areas like lexical complexity and parafoveal preview benefits.

Abstract: We ask where, and under what conditions, dyslexic reading costs arise in a
large-scale naturalistic reading dataset. Using eye-tracking aligned to
word-level features (word length, frequency, and predictability), we model how
each feature influences dyslexic time costs. We find that all three features
robustly change reading times in both typical and dyslexic readers, and that
dyslexic readers show stronger sensitivities to each, especially
predictability. Counterfactual manipulations of these features substantially
narrow the dyslexic-control gap by about one third, with predictability showing
the strongest effect, followed by length and frequency. These patterns align
with dyslexia theories that posit heightened demands on linguistic working
memory and phonological encoding, and they motivate further work on lexical
complexity and parafoveal preview benefits to explain the remaining gap. In
short, we quantify when extra dyslexic costs arise, how large they are, and
offer actionable guidance for interventions and computational models for
dyslexics.

*Mena Attia,Aashiq Muhamed,Mai Alkhamissi,Thamar Solorio,Mona Diab*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper evaluates how large language models (LLMs) process culturally nuanced figurative language, showcasing their limitations in understanding and using such language appropriately, particularly in Arabic.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess the capability of LLMs in understanding and pragmatically using cultural nuances and local knowledge encoded in figurative language.

Method: Evaluation tasks focused on contextual understanding, pragmatic use, and connotation interpretation of figurative expressions in Arabic and English, with tests conducted on multiple LLMs using Egyptian Arabic idioms, multidialectal Arabic proverbs, and English proverbs.

Result: Performance hierarchy revealed lower accuracy for Arabic proverbs compared to English proverbs, and further reduced accuracy for Egyptian idioms. Pragmatic use was less accurate than understanding, though contextual sentences improved results. Models struggled with connotative meaning and did not fully align with human interpretations.

Conclusion: Figurative language serves as a useful diagnostic tool for evaluating cultural reasoning in LLMs, emphasizing their challenges in pragmatic application. The released Kinayat dataset can support future research in this domain.

Abstract: We present a comprehensive evaluation of the ability of large language models
(LLMs) to process culturally grounded language, specifically to understand and
pragmatically use figurative expressions that encode local knowledge and
cultural nuance. Using figurative language as a proxy for cultural nuance and
local knowledge, we design evaluation tasks for contextual understanding,
pragmatic use, and connotation interpretation in Arabic and English. We
evaluate 22 open- and closed-source LLMs on Egyptian Arabic idioms,
multidialectal Arabic proverbs, and English proverbs. Our results show a
consistent hierarchy: the average accuracy for Arabic proverbs is 4.29% lower
than for English proverbs, and performance for Egyptian idioms is 10.28% lower
than for Arabic proverbs. For the pragmatic use task, accuracy drops by 14.07%
relative to understanding, though providing contextual idiomatic sentences
improves accuracy by 10.66%. Models also struggle with connotative meaning,
reaching at most 85.58% agreement with human annotators on idioms with 100%
inter-annotator agreement. These findings demonstrate that figurative language
serves as an effective diagnostic for cultural reasoning: while LLMs can often
interpret figurative meaning, they face challenges in using it appropriately.
To support future research, we release Kinayat, the first dataset of Egyptian
Arabic idioms designed for both figurative understanding and pragmatic use
evaluation.

*Saki Imai,Lee Kezar,Laurel Aichler,Mert Inan,Erin Walker,Alicia Wooten,Lorna Quandt,Malihe Alikhani*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper analyzes ASL STEM dialogue data to investigate sign articulation adaptations in conversational vs isolated contexts, focusing on entrainment and pragmatic effects.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most existing sign language models ignore the dynamic nature of natural dialogues, especially those seen in educational contexts such as STEM subjects.

Method: The authors collected a motion capture dataset of ASL STEM dialogue and analyzed kinematic features to identify dialogue-specific entrainment and spatiotemporal changes in repeated terms.

Result: The study found that dialogue signs are significantly shorter in duration (24.6%-44.6%) compared to isolated signs, demonstrating changes absent in monologue contexts.

Conclusion: Pragmatics influence sign language articulation, and understanding these variations could enhance sign language technologies and models for dynamic and natural interactions.

Abstract: Most state-of-the-art sign language models are trained on interpreter or
isolated vocabulary data, which overlooks the variability that characterizes
natural dialogue. However, human communication dynamically adapts to contexts
and interlocutors through spatiotemporal changes and articulation style. This
specifically manifests itself in educational settings, where novel vocabularies
are used by teachers, and students. To address this gap, we collect a motion
capture dataset of American Sign Language (ASL) STEM (Science, Technology,
Engineering, and Mathematics) dialogue that enables quantitative comparison
between dyadic interactive signing, solo signed lecture, and interpreted
articles. Using continuous kinematic features, we disentangle dialogue-specific
entrainment from individual effort reduction and show spatiotemporal changes
across repeated mentions of STEM terms. On average, dialogue signs are
24.6%-44.6% shorter in duration than the isolated signs, and show significant
reductions absent in monologue contexts. Finally, we evaluate sign embedding
models on their ability to recognize STEM signs and approximate how entrained
the participants become over time. Our study bridges linguistic analysis and
computational modeling to understand how pragmatics shape sign articulation and
its representation in sign language technologies.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces CRADLE BENCH, a benchmark for detecting various mental health crisis situations using language models, along with annotated data and complementary model fine-tuning approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of effective tools for detecting diverse mental health crises in language model interactions, recognizing the potential severe consequences of failure.

Method: Developed CRADLE BENCH with seven crisis types, clinician-annotated examples, automatic annotation using a majority-vote ensemble, and fine-tuning six models based on different agreement criteria.

Result: Provided a novel benchmark with annotated datasets, demonstrated ensemble annotation effectiveness, and presented models trained on subsets with distinct criteria.

Conclusion: The work advances crisis detection in language models by introducing a robust benchmark and multiple fine-tuned detection models covering diverse crisis scenarios.

Abstract: Detecting mental health crisis situations such as suicide ideation, rape,
domestic violence, child abuse, and sexual harassment is a critical yet
underexplored challenge for language models. When such situations arise during
user--model interactions, models must reliably flag them, as failure to do so
can have serious consequences. In this work, we introduce CRADLE BENCH, a
benchmark for multi-faceted crisis detection. Unlike previous efforts that
focus on a limited set of crisis types, our benchmark covers seven types
defined in line with clinical standards and is the first to incorporate
temporal labels. Our benchmark provides 600 clinician-annotated evaluation
examples and 420 development examples, together with a training corpus of
around 4K examples automatically labeled using a majority-vote ensemble of
multiple language models, which significantly outperforms single-model
annotation. We further fine-tune six crisis detection models on subsets defined
by consensus and unanimous ensemble agreement, providing complementary models
trained under different agreement criteria.

*Yize Cheng,Arshia Soltani Moakhar,Chenrui Fan,Kazem Faghih,Parsa Hosseini,Wenxiao Wang,Soheil Feizi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper addresses the temporal unawareness of large language models (LLMs) in multi-turn conversations, introducing the TicToc-v1 dataset to study tool-calling decisions based on time sensitivity. Results show models struggle to align tool usage with human preferences, even with timestamps.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the limitation of LLMs in accounting for elapsed time in multi-turn conversations, which affects their tool-calling decisions based on dynamic temporal context.

Method: The authors created the TicToc-v1 test set with user-agent trajectories, augmented dialogue messages with timestamps, collected human preferences, and evaluated models' tool-calling decisions against human judgments under varying time intervals.

Result: Models perform slightly better than random without time data, achieving a top alignment rate of just over 60%. Adding timestamps improved performance modestly to about 65%, revealing limited effectiveness of naive alignment strategies.

Conclusion: The study highlights the need for developing specific post-training alignment strategies to ensure LLMs better account for human temporal perception and align their tool usage accordingly.

Abstract: Large language model agents are increasingly used in multi-turn
conversational settings to interact with and execute tasks in dynamic
environments. However, a key limitation is their temporal blindness: they, by
default, operate with a stationary context, failing to account for the
real-world time elapsed between messages. This becomes a critical liability
when an agent must decide whether to invoke a tool based on how much time has
passed since the last observation. Without temporal awareness, agents often
either over-rely on previous context (skipping necessary tool calls), or
under-rely on it (unnecessarily repeating tool calls). To study this challenge,
we introduce TicToc-v1, a test set of multi-turn user-agent trajectories across
34 scenarios with varying time sensitivity. Each trajectory ends with a user
question, where the need for a tool call depends on the amount of time elapsed
since the last message. To give LLMs temporal context, we augment dialogue
messages with explicit timestamps, bridging the gap between static dialogue and
evolving environments. We then collected human preferences for these samples,
creating two subsets: one where humans preferred relying on the previous
observation (prefer-noTool), and another where they preferred a new tool call
(prefer-Tool). We evaluated how well LLM tool-calling decisions align with
human preferences under varying time intervals on TicToc-v1. Our analysis show
that without time information, most models perform only slightly better than
random, with the top alignment rate being just over 60%. While adding
timestamps leads to a slight improvement, particularly for larger models, the
improvement is modest, peaking at around 65%. We also show that naive,
prompt-based alignment have limited effectiveness. Our findings highlight the
need for specific post-training alignment to align multi-turn LLM tool use with
human temporal perception.

### [59] [Can LLMs Narrate Tabular Data? An Evaluation Framework for Natural Language Representations of Text-to-SQL System Outputs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23854)
*Jyotika Singh,Weiyi Sun,Amit Agarwal,Viji Krishnamurthy,Yassine Benajiba,Sujith Ravi,Dan Roth*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces Combo-Eval, an evaluation method for judging the quality of LLM-generated NL representations from tabular DB results, and introduces the NLR-BIRD dataset for benchmarking.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current NLR generation by LLMs often suffers from information loss and errors while presenting tabular DB results, which limits the optimal use of chat-based industry systems.

Method: Proposes Combo-Eval, an evaluation technique combining multiple methods, optimizing evaluations while reducing the number of LLM calls significantly. Additionally, presents NLR-BIRD dataset for specialized benchmarking.

Result: Combo-Eval achieves superior alignment with human evaluation judgments, reducing LLM calls by 25-61%. It proves effective across instances with or without reference ground truths.

Conclusion: The proposed evaluation method and dataset enhance the fidelity and reliability of NLR generation assessments in multi-turn chat systems, addressing previously unexamined challenges of information loss/errors.

Abstract: In modern industry systems like multi-turn chat agents, Text-to-SQL
technology bridges natural language (NL) questions and database (DB) querying.
The conversion of tabular DB results into NL representations (NLRs) enables the
chat-based interaction. Currently, NLR generation is typically handled by large
language models (LLMs), but information loss or errors in presenting tabular
results in NL remains largely unexplored. This paper introduces a novel
evaluation method - Combo-Eval - for judgment of LLM-generated NLRs that
combines the benefits of multiple existing methods, optimizing evaluation
fidelity and achieving a significant reduction in LLM calls by 25-61%.
Accompanying our method is NLR-BIRD, the first dedicated dataset for NLR
benchmarking. Through human evaluations, we demonstrate the superior alignment
of Combo-Eval with human judgments, applicable across scenarios with and
without ground truth references.

### [60] [OraPlan-SQL: A Planning-Centric Framework for Complex Bilingual NL2SQL Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23870)
*Marianne Menglin Liu,Sai Ashish Somayajula,Syed Fahad Allam Shah,Sujith Ravi,Dan Roth*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: OraPlan-SQL is a bilingual NL2SQL system that ranked first in the Archer NL2SQL Evaluation Challenge 2025 by achieving superior execution accuracy and SQL validity. It uses a planner agent and an SQL agent with innovative methods such as feedback-guided meta-prompting and plan diversification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation behind this paper is to create a bilingual NL2SQL system capable of handling complex reasoning tasks (arithmetic, commonsense, hypothetical inference) across languages with high accuracy and reliability.

Method: The system comprises a Planner agent generating stepwise natural language plans and an SQL agent converting these into executable SQL. It employs feedback-guided meta-prompting to refine the Planner and integrates entity-linking guidelines for multilingual adaptability. Additionally, plan diversification selects the final SQL query via majority voting.

Result: OraPlan-SQL achieved first place in execution accuracy (55.0% in English and 56.7% in Chinese) and over 99% SQL validity (VA) in the Archer NL2SQL Evaluation Challenge 2025.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates a novel approach to NL2SQL tasks, showcasing high performance and linguistic adaptability by incorporating efficient planning improvements, entity-linking strategies, and diversified plan selection with minimal complexity.

Abstract: We present OraPlan-SQL, our system for the Archer NL2SQL Evaluation Challenge
2025, a bilingual benchmark requiring complex reasoning such as arithmetic,
commonsense, and hypothetical inference. OraPlan-SQL ranked first, exceeding
the second-best system by more than 6% in execution accuracy (EX), with 55.0%
in English and 56.7% in Chinese, while maintaining over 99% SQL validity (VA).
Our system follows an agentic framework with two components: Planner agent that
generates stepwise natural language plans, and SQL agent that converts these
plans into executable SQL. Since SQL agent reliably adheres to the plan, our
refinements focus on the planner. Unlike prior methods that rely on multiple
sub-agents for planning and suffer from orchestration overhead, we introduce a
feedback-guided meta-prompting strategy to refine a single planner. Failure
cases from a held-out set are clustered with human input, and an LLM distills
them into corrective guidelines that are integrated into the planner's system
prompt, improving generalization without added complexity. For the multilingual
scenario, to address transliteration and entity mismatch issues, we incorporate
entity-linking guidelines that generate alternative surface forms for entities
and explicitly include them in the plan. Finally, we enhance reliability
through plan diversification: multiple candidate plans are generated for each
query, with the SQL agent producing a query for each plan, and final output
selected via majority voting over their executions.

*Kosei Uemura,Miaoran Zhang,David Ifeoluwa Adelani*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper presents AfriMTEB, a multilingual text embedding benchmark targeting 59 African languages, and introduces AfriE5, a high-performing model adapted for these languages.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the underrepresentation of African languages in multilingual text embedding benchmarks and provide comprehensive datasets and tasks for these languages.

Method: Developed AfriMTEB, covering 59 African languages with 14 tasks and 38 datasets, and proposed AfriE5, a model trained with cross-lingual contrastive distillation for African languages.

Result: AfriE5 outperforms strong baselines like Gemini-Embeddings and mE5 in multilingual benchmarks for African languages.

Conclusion: AfriMTEB and AfriE5 significantly improve representation, benchmarking, and performance for African languages in NLP tasks.

Abstract: Text embeddings are an essential building component of several NLP tasks such
as retrieval-augmented generation which is crucial for preventing
hallucinations in LLMs. Despite the recent release of massively multilingual
MTEB (MMTEB), African languages remain underrepresented, with existing tasks
often repurposed from translation benchmarks such as FLORES clustering or
SIB-200. In this paper, we introduce AfriMTEB -- a regional expansion of MMTEB
covering 59 languages, 14 tasks, and 38 datasets, including six newly added
datasets. Unlike many MMTEB datasets that include fewer than five languages,
the new additions span 14 to 56 African languages and introduce entirely new
tasks, such as hate speech detection, intent detection, and emotion
classification, which were not previously covered. Complementing this, we
present AfriE5, an adaptation of the instruction-tuned mE5 model to African
languages through cross-lingual contrastive distillation. Our evaluation shows
that AfriE5 achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming strong
baselines such as Gemini-Embeddings and mE5.

*Kaveh Eskandari Miandoab,Mahammed Kamruzzaman,Arshia Gharooni,Gene Louis Kim,Vasanth Sarathy,Ninareh Mehrabi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces a novel, general framework for improving fairness evaluation in Large Language Models (LLMs) by addressing stereotypical biases, showing models' susceptibility to biased behavior especially towards underrepresented demographics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to tackle the persistent issue of stereotypical biases in Large Language Models arising from discriminatory training data, highlighting that current bias alignment methods are brittle and inadequate.

Method: The authors propose a three-step, plug-and-play augmentation framework, applicable across various fairness evaluation benchmarks, which systematically applies input perturbations to evaluate biases in LLMs.

Result: The framework demonstrates increased stereotypical behaviors in LLMs, including top-tier models, and reveals biases are more pronounced towards underrepresented communities in literature.

Conclusion: Findings stress the importance of expanding fairness and safety research in LLMs to include diverse communities, addressing biases caused by limited representative study of minority demographics.

Abstract: Large Language Models have been shown to demonstrate stereotypical biases in
their representations and behavior due to the discriminative nature of the data
that they have been trained on. Despite significant progress in the development
of methods and models that refrain from using stereotypical information in
their decision-making, recent work has shown that approaches used for bias
alignment are brittle. In this work, we introduce a novel and general
augmentation framework that involves three plug-and-play steps and is
applicable to a number of fairness evaluation benchmarks. Through application
of augmentation to a fairness evaluation dataset (Bias Benchmark for Question
Answering (BBQ)), we find that Large Language Models (LLMs), including
state-of-the-art open and closed weight models, are susceptible to
perturbations to their inputs, showcasing a higher likelihood to behave
stereotypically. Furthermore, we find that such models are more likely to have
biased behavior in cases where the target demographic belongs to a community
less studied by the literature, underlining the need to expand the fairness and
safety research to include more diverse communities.

*Dina Pisarevskaya,Arkaitz Zubiaga*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A novel agent-based approach is introduced for automated claim matching using instruction-following LLMs, combining prompt generation and binary classification tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to enhance automated claim matching capabilities and improve efficiency by employing a novel two-step pipeline with large language models (LLMs).

Method: The approach utilizes LLMs in two steps: first generating prompts, then performing claim matching as a binary classification task. Smaller LLMs are shown to be effective in this process, saving computational resources.

Result: LLM-generated prompts outperform state-of-the-art human-generated prompts. Various LLMs used in different steps of the pipeline demonstrate high effectiveness and provide insights into LLMs' understanding of claim matching.

Conclusion: Leveraging LLMs for prompt generation and claim matching offers a computationally efficient and accurate approach that surpasses traditional methods and sheds light on LLM comprehension processes.

Abstract: We present a novel agent-based approach for the automated claim matching task
with instruction-following LLMs. We propose a two-step pipeline that first
generates prompts with LLMs, to then perform claim matching as a binary
classification task with LLMs. We demonstrate that LLM-generated prompts can
outperform SOTA with human-generated prompts, and that smaller LLMs can do as
well as larger ones in the generation process, allowing to save computational
resources. We also demonstrate the effectiveness of using different LLMs for
each step of the pipeline, i.e. using an LLM for prompt generation, and another
for claim matching. Our investigation into the prompt generation process in
turn reveals insights into the LLMs' understanding of claim matching.

*Soham Satyadharma,Fatemeh Sheikholeslami,Swati Kaul,Aziz Umit Batur,Suleiman A. Khan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a training-free method for automatically generating prompts to evaluate product quality in e-commerce, improving accuracy and reducing domain expert effort.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges of scaling domain-specific product quality assessment in e-commerce, especially across diverse catalogs and multiple languages.

Method: The authors developed a cascade that starts with human-crafted prompts and progressively refines them to optimize instructions tailored to specific catalogs without requiring model training or fine-tuning.

Result: The auto-prompt cascade improves precision and recall by 8-10%, reduces expert effort by 99%, and generalizes effectively across languages and tasks.

Conclusion: The method provides a scalable, efficient solution for product quality assessment in e-commerce, bridging general language understanding with specific domain needs.

Abstract: We introduce a novel, training free cascade for auto-prompting Large Language
Models (LLMs) to assess product quality in e-commerce. Our system requires no
training labels or model fine-tuning, instead automatically generating and
refining prompts for evaluating attribute quality across tens of thousands of
product category-attribute pairs. Starting from a seed of human-crafted
prompts, the cascade progressively optimizes instructions to meet
catalog-specific requirements. This approach bridges the gap between general
language understanding and domain-specific knowledge at scale in complex
industrial catalogs. Our extensive empirical evaluations shows the auto-prompt
cascade improves precision and recall by $8-10\%$ over traditional
chain-of-thought prompting. Notably, it achieves these gains while reducing
domain expert effort from 5.1 hours to 3 minutes per attribute - a $99\%$
reduction. Additionally, the cascade generalizes effectively across five
languages and multiple quality assessment tasks, consistently maintaining
performance gains.

*Kyomin Hwang,Hyeonjin Kim,Seungyeon Kim,Sunghyun Wee,Nojun Kwak*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper identifies and addresses language confusion in multilingual large language models (LLMs), proposing a semantic-based evaluation metric for unlearning tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance the evaluation of multilingual LLMs during unlearning tasks, especially addressing limitations caused by language confusion where the model responds in a different language than the input prompt.

Method: The authors introduce the N-Mix score, a novel metric for analyzing language confusion, and demonstrate its impact on reference-based metrics, suggesting the need for an alternative semantic-based evaluation metric.

Result: The analysis proves language confusion is a pervasive issue in multilingual LLMs during unlearning tasks, and reliance on reference-based metrics can produce false negatives under high language confusion scenarios.

Conclusion: A semantic-based evaluation method is required to accurately assess unlearning performance in multilingual LLMs, overcoming the limitations of existing reference-based metrics affected by language confusion.

Abstract: There have been a couple of studies showing that attempting to erase
multilingual knowledge using only English data is insufficient for multilingual
LLMs. However, their analyses remain highly performance-oriented. In this
paper, we switch the point of view to evaluation, and address an additional
blind spot which reveals itself when the multilingual LLM is fully finetuned
with parallel multilingual dataset before unlearning. Here, language confusion
occurs whereby a model responds in language different from that of the input
prompt. Language confusion is a problematic phenomenon in unlearning, causing
the standard reference-based metrics to fail. We tackle this phenomenon in
three steps: (1) introduce N-gram-based Language-Mix (N-Mix) score to
quantitatively show the language confusion is pervasive and consistent in
multilingual LLMs, (2) demonstrate that reference-based metrics result in false
negatives when N-Mix score is high, and(3) suggest the need of new type of
unlearning evaluation that can directly assess the content of the generated
sentences. We call this type of metrics as semantic-based metric.

*Mengzhou Sun,Sendong Zhao,Jianyu Chen,Haochun Wang,Bin Qin*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper presents M-Eval, a method improving the accuracy of Retrieval-augmented Generation (RAG) in medical question-answering systems, achieving up to a 23.31% accuracy improvement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current RAG systems face challenges such as hallucinations and improper use of external knowledge in medical question-answering.

Method: M-Eval uses heterogeneity analysis from Evidence-Based Medicine (EBM) to verify factual accuracy and the reliability of responses by retrieving evidence from external sources.

Result: M-Eval improves system accuracy by up to 23.31% across various LLMs, enhancing reliability and reducing diagnostic errors in medical applications.

Conclusion: The method makes RAG-based medical systems more reliable, assisting in error detection and reducing potential diagnostic errors.

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented Generation (RAG) has demonstrated potential in enhancing
medical question-answering systems through the integration of large language
models (LLMs) with external medical literature. LLMs can retrieve relevant
medical articles to generate more professional responses efficiently. However,
current RAG applications still face problems. They generate incorrect
information, such as hallucinations, and they fail to use external knowledge
correctly. To solve these issues, we propose a new method named M-Eval. This
method is inspired by the heterogeneity analysis approach used in
Evidence-Based Medicine (EBM). Our approach can check for factual errors in RAG
responses using evidence from multiple sources. First, we extract additional
medical literature from external knowledge bases. Then, we retrieve the
evidence documents generated by the RAG system. We use heterogeneity analysis
to check whether the evidence supports different viewpoints in the response. In
addition to verifying the accuracy of the response, we also assess the
reliability of the evidence provided by the RAG system. Our method shows an
improvement of up to 23.31% accuracy across various LLMs. This work can help
detect errors in current RAG-based medical systems. It also makes the
applications of LLMs more reliable and reduces diagnostic errors.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces PICOs-RAG, a method to optimize medical query generation and retrieval for evidence-based medicine.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the objectivity and efficiency limits of current manual and automated methods in retrieving relevant evidence for medical queries.

Method: The authors propose PICOs-RAG, a system that reformats user queries into a professional, normalized format using the PICO framework to enhance search efficiency and relevance.

Result: PICOs-RAG demonstrated up to an 8.8% improvement in evidence retrieval performance compared to existing methods in their evaluation.

Conclusion: The PICOs-RAG system enhances the effectiveness of large language models, making them more efficient and reliable for medical evidence retrieval and application in clinical scenarios.

Abstract: Evidence-based medicine (EBM) research has always been of paramount
importance. It is important to find appropriate medical theoretical support for
the needs from physicians or patients to reduce the occurrence of medical
accidents. This process is often carried out by human querying relevant
literature databases, which lacks objectivity and efficiency. Therefore,
researchers utilize retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to search for evidence
and generate responses automatically. However, current RAG methods struggle to
handle complex queries in real-world clinical scenarios. For example, when
queries lack certain information or use imprecise language, the model may
retrieve irrelevant evidence and generate unhelpful answers. To address this
issue, we present the PICOs-RAG to expand the user queries into a better
format. Our method can expand and normalize the queries into professional ones
and use the PICO format, a search strategy tool present in EBM, to extract the
most important information used for retrieval. This approach significantly
enhances retrieval efficiency and relevance, resulting in up to an 8.8\%
improvement compared to the baseline evaluated by our method. Thereby the
PICOs-RAG improves the performance of the large language models into a helpful
and reliable medical assistant in EBM.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Large language models like RAG enhance evidence-based medicine by re-ranking medical evidence, achieving up to 11.4% accuracy improvement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Evidence-based medicine requires high-quality medical evidence to minimize misdiagnoses, but existing techniques like RAG struggle to distinguish reliable evidence.

Method: This study employs meta-analysis inspired methods, including reliability, heterogeneity, and extrapolation analyses, to re-rank and filter medical evidence for LLM-based diagnosis.

Result: The proposed method enhances evidence extraction from the PubMed dataset, achieving an accuracy improvement of up to 11.4% while reducing misinformation.

Conclusion: Re-ranking medical evidence allows RAG to reliably support evidence-based medicine tasks, promoting better diagnostic accuracy and reducing errors.

Abstract: Evidence-based medicine (EBM) holds a crucial role in clinical application.
Given suitable medical articles, doctors effectively reduce the incidence of
misdiagnoses. Researchers find it efficient to use large language models (LLMs)
techniques like RAG for EBM tasks. However, the EBM maintains stringent
requirements for evidence, and RAG applications in EBM struggle to efficiently
distinguish high-quality evidence. Therefore, inspired by the meta-analysis
used in EBM, we provide a new method to re-rank and filter the medical
evidence. This method presents multiple principles to filter the best evidence
for LLMs to diagnose. We employ a combination of several EBM methods to emulate
the meta-analysis, which includes reliability analysis, heterogeneity analysis,
and extrapolation analysis. These processes allow the users to retrieve the
best medical evidence for the LLMs. Ultimately, we evaluate these high-quality
articles and show an accuracy improvement of up to 11.4% in our experiments and
results. Our method successfully enables RAG to extract higher-quality and more
reliable evidence from the PubMed dataset. This work can reduce the infusion of
incorrect knowledge into responses and help users receive more effective
replies.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper formulates the IE task as TEXT2DB, where IE outputs are updated into the target database following user instructions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge the gap between IE output and downstream application needs by integrating extracted information into a target database.

Method: Introduced a benchmark for TEXT2DB tasks and proposed an LLM agent framework, OPAL, consisting of Observer, Planner, and Analyzer components.

Result: OPAL successfully adapts to diverse database schemas, handles user instructions, and highlights challenges like complex dependencies and hallucination.

Conclusion: The TEXT2DB task offers new dimensions for IE research by focusing on DB/KB schema adaptations, suggesting meaningful areas like handling complex data dependencies for future exploration.

Abstract: The task of information extraction (IE) is to extract structured knowledge
from text. However, it is often not straightforward to utilize IE output due to
the mismatch between the IE ontology and the downstream application needs. We
propose a new formulation of IE TEXT2DB that emphasizes the integration of IE
output and the target database (or knowledge base). Given a user instruction, a
document set, and a database, our task requires the model to update the
database with values from the document set to satisfy the user instruction.
This task requires understanding user instructions for what to extract and
adapting to the given DB/KB schema for how to extract on the fly. To evaluate
this new task, we introduce a new benchmark featuring common demands such as
data infilling, row population, and column addition. In addition, we propose an
LLM agent framework OPAL (Observe-PlanAnalyze LLM) which includes an Observer
component that interacts with the database, the Planner component that
generates a code-based plan with calls to IE models, and the Analyzer component
that provides feedback regarding code quality before execution. Experiments
show that OPAL can successfully adapt to diverse database schemas by generating
different code plans and calling the required IE models. We also highlight
difficult cases such as dealing with large databases with complex dependencies
and extraction hallucination, which we believe deserve further investigation.

### [72] [Teaching LLMs to Abstain via Fine-Grained Semantic Confidence Reward](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24020)
*Hao An,Yang Xu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a reinforcement learning framework using fine-grained semantic confidence to enhance Large Language Models' (LLMs) ability to abstain from answering questions outside their knowledge scope.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for reducing hallucinations in LLMs rely on broad confidence signals and struggle with precise knowledge boundary awareness, leading to unreliable abstention.

Method: The proposed Fine-grained Semantic Confidence Reward (FSCORE) framework uses semantic clustering to refine LLMs, training them to discard low-confidence answers and retain high-confidence ones.

Result: The method improves the reliability of LLMs in abstaining from answering incorrect questions in both in-domain and out-of-distribution tasks.

Conclusion: FSCORE is effective for fine-tuning LLMs to mitigate hallucinations by enabling sample-specific abstention and enhancing overall reliability.

Abstract: Mitigating hallucinations in Large Language Models (LLMs) is critical for
their reliable deployment. Existing methods typically fine-tune LLMs to abstain
from answering questions beyond their knowledge scope. However, these methods
often rely on coarse-grained signals to guide LLMs to abstain, such as overall
confidence or uncertainty scores on multiple sampled answers, which may result
in an imprecise awareness of the model's own knowledge boundaries. To this end,
we propose a novel reinforcement learning framework built on
$\textbf{\underline{Fi}ne-grained \underline{S}emantic \underline{Co}nfidence
\underline{Re}ward (\Ours)}$, which guides LLMs to abstain via sample-specific
confidence. Specifically, our method operates by sampling multiple candidate
answers and conducting semantic clustering, then training the LLM to retain
answers within high-confidence clusters and discard those within low-confidence
ones, thereby promoting accurate post-hoc abstention. Additionally, we propose
a new metric for evaluating the reliability of abstention fine-tuning tasks
more comprehensively. Our method significantly enhances reliability in both
in-domain and out-of-distribution benchmarks.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces ComboBench, a benchmark to assess Large Language Models’ (LLMs) ability to translate semantic actions into VR manipulation sequences, reveals their capabilities and limitations, and provides resources for further study.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Investigate whether LLMs can replicate humans' ability to translate semantic actions into precise VR device manipulations, a skill crucial for VR gaming.

Method: The authors evaluated seven LLMs using ComboBench across 262 scenarios from popular VR games, comparing their performance against annotated ground truth and human capabilities, with additional analysis of few-shot examples.

Result: Top-performing models demonstrate strong task decomposition but struggle with procedural and spatial reasoning compared to humans. Performance varies by game complexity, and few-shot examples effectively boost model performance.

Conclusion: LLMs show promise in VR manipulation tasks but require targeted improvements in procedural reasoning and spatial understanding for better performance.

Abstract: Virtual Reality (VR) games require players to translate high-level semantic
actions into precise device manipulations using controllers and head-mounted
displays (HMDs). While humans intuitively perform this translation based on
common sense and embodied understanding, whether Large Language Models (LLMs)
can effectively replicate this ability remains underexplored. This paper
introduces a benchmark, ComboBench, evaluating LLMs' capability to translate
semantic actions into VR device manipulation sequences across 262 scenarios
from four popular VR games: Half-Life: Alyx, Into the Radius, Moss: Book II,
and Vivecraft. We evaluate seven LLMs, including GPT-3.5, GPT-4, GPT-4o,
Gemini-1.5-Pro, LLaMA-3-8B, Mixtral-8x7B, and GLM-4-Flash, compared against
annotated ground truth and human performance. Our results reveal that while
top-performing models like Gemini-1.5-Pro demonstrate strong task decomposition
capabilities, they still struggle with procedural reasoning and spatial
understanding compared to humans. Performance varies significantly across
games, suggesting sensitivity to interaction complexity. Few-shot examples

### [74] [SpecKD: Speculative Decoding for Effective Knowledge Distillation of LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24021)
*Haiduo Huang,Jiangcheng Song,Yadong Zhang,Pengju Ren*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Speculative Knowledge Distillation (SpecKD) improves the knowledge distillation process for Large Language Models (LLMs) by selectively applying loss to tokens where the teacher's prediction is confident.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the issue of conventional knowledge distillation approaches forcing students to mimic high-entropy predictions from larger models, which negatively affects student performance.

Method: SpecKD employs a dynamic token-level gating mechanism inspired by speculative decoding, selectively using distillation loss only on teacher-verified predictions and masking out uncertain tokens.

Result: SpecKD outperforms conventional knowledge distillation methods, producing more stable training, stronger student models, and state-of-the-art results for text generation tasks.

Conclusion: The proposed SpecKD framework enhances the efficiency and accuracy of student models by targeting selective, confident predictions from teacher models in the distillation process.

Abstract: Knowledge Distillation (KD) has become a cornerstone technique for
compressing Large Language Models (LLMs) into smaller, more efficient student
models. However, conventional KD approaches typically apply the distillation
loss uniformly across all tokens, regardless of the teacher's confidence. This
indiscriminate mimicry can introduce noise, as the student is forced to learn
from the teacher's uncertain or high-entropy predictions, which may ultimately
harm student performance-especially when the teacher is much larger and more
powerful. To address this, we propose Speculative Knowledge Distillation
(SpecKD), a novel, plug-and-play framework that introduces a dynamic,
token-level gating mechanism inspired by the "propose-and-verify" paradigm of
speculative decoding. At each step, the student's token proposal is verified
against the teacher's distribution; the distillation loss is selectively
applied only to "accepted" tokens, while "rejected" tokens are masked out.
Extensive experiments on diverse text generation tasks show that SpecKD
consistently and significantly outperforms strong KD baselines, leading to more
stable training and more capable student models, and achieving state-of-the-art
results.

### [75] [Success and Cost Elicit Convention Formation for Efficient Communication](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24023)
*Saujas Vaduguru,Yilun Hua,Yoav Artzi,Daniel Fried*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces a method for training large multimodal models to form conversational conventions through simulated reference games, improving efficiency and success in communication with humans.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to bridge the gap between human-like communication efficiency and model performance by enabling models to form ad hoc linguistic conventions for easier understanding and faster interactions.

Method: The method involves training multimodal models using simulated reference games, focusing on reducing communication cost and increasing success, without relying on additional human-produced data.

Result: The trained models showed a 41% reduction in message length and a 15% increase in success during interactions with humans. Additionally, human listeners responded faster to models trained to form conventions.

Conclusion: Training multimodal models on both success and cost is essential for fostering convention formation, leading to more efficient and effective human-model interactions.

Abstract: Humans leverage shared conversational context to become increasingly
successful and efficient at communicating over time. One manifestation of this
is the formation of ad hoc linguistic conventions, which allow people to
coordinate on short, less costly utterances that are understood using shared
conversational context. We present a method to train large multimodal models to
form conventions, enabling efficient communication. Our approach uses simulated
reference games between models, and requires no additional human-produced data.
In repeated reference games involving photographs and tangram images, our
method enables models to communicate efficiently with people: reducing the
message length by up to 41% while increasing success by 15% over the course of
the interaction. Human listeners respond faster when interacting with our model
that forms conventions. We also show that training based on success or cost
alone is insufficient - both are necessary to elicit convention formation.

### [76] [Pie: A Programmable Serving System for Emerging LLM Applications](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24051)
*In Gim,Zhiyao Ma,Seung-seob Lee,Lin Zhong*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces Pie, a programmable LLM serving system that breaks down the traditional token generation loop into smaller service handlers, allowing for more flexible and efficient language model applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLM serving systems struggle to keep up with diverse reasoning strategies and agentic workflows, necessitating a new approach for flexibility and performance.

Method: The authors implemented Pie, which decomposes the standard generation loop into programmable service handlers managed by user-provided programs called inferlets. WebAssembly is used for execution, ensuring lightweight sandboxing.

Result: Pie achieves competitive performance on standard tasks with minimal latency overhead (3-12%) and notably improves latency and throughput (1.3x to 3.4x higher) for agentic workflows.

Conclusion: Pie enables flexible customization of LLMs by empowering applications to optimize specific workflows without altering the serving system, significantly enhancing efficiency.

Abstract: Emerging large language model (LLM) applications involve diverse reasoning
strategies and agentic workflows, straining the capabilities of existing
serving systems built on a monolithic token generation loop. This paper
introduces Pie, a programmable LLM serving system designed for flexibility and
efficiency. Pie decomposes the traditional generation loop into fine-grained
service handlers exposed via an API and delegates control of the generation
process to user-provided programs, called inferlets. This enables applications
to implement new KV cache strategies, bespoke generation logic, and seamlessly
integrate computation and I/O-entirely within the application, without
requiring modifications to the serving system. Pie executes inferlets using
WebAssembly, benefiting from its lightweight sandboxing. Our evaluation shows
Pie matches state-of-the-art performance on standard tasks (3-12% latency
overhead) while significantly improving latency and throughput (1.3x-3.4x
higher) on agentic workflows by enabling application-specific optimizations.

### [77] [Challenging Multilingual LLMs: A New Taxonomy and Benchmark for Unraveling Hallucination in Translation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24073)
*Xinwei Wu,Heng Liu,Jiang Zhou,Xiaohu Zhao,Linlong Xu,Longyue Wang,Weihua Luo,Kaifu Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper identifies hallucination issues in multilingual LLMs for machine translation and introduces HalloMTBench, a benchmark to diagnose those failures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a need to diagnose hallucination vulnerabilities in Large Language Models used for multilingual machine translation, as existing benchmarks fall short.

Method: The authors proposed a taxonomy separating Instruction Detachment from Source Detachment, created HalloMTBench for multilingual human-verified evaluation, and used 4 LLMs along with expert validation to curate data.

Result: The study evaluated 17 LLMs on the benchmark, revealing unique hallucination triggers like model scale, linguistic biases, and RL-influenced language mixing.

Conclusion: HalloMTBench provides a valuable tool for diagnosing translation-related hallucination failures in multilingual LLMs and is publicly available for further research.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have advanced machine translation but remain
vulnerable to hallucinations. Unfortunately, existing MT benchmarks are not
capable of exposing failures in multilingual LLMs. To disclose hallucination in
multilingual LLMs, we introduce a diagnostic framework with a taxonomy that
separates Instruction Detachment from Source Detachment. Guided by this
taxonomy, we create HalloMTBench, a multilingual, human-verified benchmark
across 11 English-to-X directions. We employed 4 frontier LLMs to generate
candidates and scrutinize these candidates with an ensemble of LLM judges, and
expert validation. In this way, we curate 5,435 high-quality instances. We have
evaluated 17 LLMs on HalloMTBench. Results reveal distinct ``hallucination
triggers'' -- unique failure patterns reflecting model scale, source length
sensitivity, linguistic biases, and Reinforcement-Learning (RL) amplified
language mixing. HalloMTBench offers a forward-looking testbed for diagnosing
LLM translation failures. HalloMTBench is available in

TL;DR: Global PIQA is a benchmark for commonsense reasoning across over 100 languages, highlighting LLMs' performance gaps in lower-resource languages and showcasing cultural diversity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLMs lack culturally-specific evaluation benchmarks for diverse languages and cultures, motivating the creation of one for inclusivity and assessment improvement.

Method: Global PIQA, a commonsense reasoning benchmark, was curated manually by 335 researchers worldwide, covering 116 language varieties and focusing on examples rich in cultural specificity.

Result: Top proprietary LLMs generally perform well but struggle with lower-resource languages, revealing a 37% accuracy gap. Open models perform worse overall.

Conclusion: Global PIQA demonstrates LLMs' limitations in culturally-specific contexts, underscoring the need for enhanced everyday knowledge capabilities across diverse languages and cultures.

Abstract: To date, there exist almost no culturally-specific evaluation benchmarks for
large language models (LLMs) that cover a large number of languages and
cultures. In this paper, we present Global PIQA, a participatory commonsense
reasoning benchmark for over 100 languages, constructed by hand by 335
researchers from 65 countries around the world. The 116 language varieties in
Global PIQA cover five continents, 14 language families, and 23 writing
systems. In the non-parallel split of Global PIQA, over 50% of examples
reference local foods, customs, traditions, or other culturally-specific
elements. We find that state-of-the-art LLMs perform well on Global PIQA in
aggregate, but they exhibit weaker performance in lower-resource languages (up
to a 37% accuracy gap, despite random chance at 50%). Open models generally
perform worse than proprietary models. Global PIQA highlights that in many
languages and cultures, everyday knowledge remains an area for improvement,
alongside more widely-discussed capabilities such as complex reasoning and
expert knowledge. Beyond its uses for LLM evaluation, we hope that Global PIQA
provides a glimpse into the wide diversity of cultures in which human language
is embedded.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The research focuses on the phonetic and morphological diversity of Bengali dialects to develop computational models, particularly Automatic Speech Recognition systems, enhancing language technologies for Bengali communities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Bengali dialects exhibit rich linguistic diversity, yet computational processing of these dialects is limited. This study aims to fill the gap while preserving dialectal richness and advancing inclusive language technologies.

Method: The study documents phonetic and morphological properties of Bengali dialects and explores the creation of region-specific Automatic Speech Recognition models.

Result: A dataset of Bengali dialects was created and made available for public use, facilitating tailored computational models for dialects.

Conclusion: Efforts to create ASR systems customized for Bengali dialects can preserve linguistic diversity and improve digital tools for Bengali speakers worldwide.

Abstract: The Bengali language, spoken extensively across South Asia and among
diasporic communities, exhibits considerable dialectal diversity shaped by
geography, culture, and history. Phonological and pronunciation-based
classifications broadly identify five principal dialect groups: Eastern
Bengali, Manbhumi, Rangpuri, Varendri, and Rarhi. Within Bangladesh, further
distinctions emerge through variation in vocabulary, syntax, and morphology, as
observed in regions such as Chittagong, Sylhet, Rangpur, Rajshahi, Noakhali,
and Barishal. Despite this linguistic richness, systematic research on the
computational processing of Bengali dialects remains limited. This study seeks
to document and analyze the phonetic and morphological properties of these
dialects while exploring the feasibility of building computational models
particularly Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) systems tailored to regional
varieties. Such efforts hold potential for applications in virtual assistants
and broader language technologies, contributing to both the preservation of
dialectal diversity and the advancement of inclusive digital tools for
Bengali-speaking communities. The dataset created for this study is released
for public use.

TL;DR: Squrve is a robust framework for Text-to-SQL that enhances integration between academic achievements and real-world applications, demonstrating improved performance via collaborative mechanisms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the challenge of deploying advanced Text-to-SQL techniques in practical applications, which is hindered by the absence of effective integration tools.

Method: Squrve introduces a universal execution paradigm and a multi-actor collaboration mechanism based on seven modular actor components to standardize and optimize Text-to-SQL workflows.

Result: Experiments reveal that Squrve's collaborative workflows outperform traditional individual methods on standard benchmarks.

Conclusion: Squrve bridges the gap between academic research and real-world Text-to-SQL applications, providing a modular framework that achieves superior results for complex queries.

Abstract: Text-to-SQL technology has evolved rapidly, with diverse academic methods
achieving impressive results. However, deploying these techniques in real-world
systems remains challenging due to limited integration tools. Despite these
advances, we introduce Squrve, a unified, modular, and extensive Text-to-SQL
framework designed to bring together research advances and real-world
applications. Squrve first establishes a universal execution paradigm that
standardizes invocation interfaces, then proposes a multi-actor collaboration
mechanism based on seven abstracted effective atomic actor components.
Experiments on widely adopted benchmarks demonstrate that the collaborative
workflows consistently outperform the original individual methods, thereby
opening up a new effective avenue for tackling complex real-world queries. The

TL;DR: The paper demonstrates that reinforcement learning (RL) increases performance over prompt-based methods for LLMs in solving complex tasks, particularly legal document search.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to enhance the capabilities of large language models (LLMs) in tackling complex multi-turn tasks by moving beyond prompt-based approaches to leverage reinforcement learning (RL).

Method: The authors train a 14-billion-parameter LLM using reinforcement learning on a legal document search benchmark and investigate how turn-restricted regimes during training and testing impact results.

Result: The RL-trained LLM achieved 85% accuracy, significantly outperforming frontier-class prompt-based models at 78%. It also proved more effective over extended multi-turn interactions.

Conclusion: The research highlights that reinforcement learning enables LLM agents to perform better on complex, multi-turn tasks, especially in settings where longer interaction horizons are possible.

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) agents can leverage multiple turns and tools to
solve complex tasks, with prompt-based approaches achieving strong performance.
This work demonstrates that Reinforcement Learning (RL) can push capabilities
significantly further by learning from experience. Through experiments on a
legal document search benchmark, we show that our RL-trained 14 Billion
parameter model outperforms frontier class models (85% vs 78% accuracy). In
addition, we explore turn-restricted regimes, during training and at test-time,
that show these agents achieve better results if allowed to operate over longer
multi-turn horizons.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes enhanced filtering methods for textual data that retain structurally significant content, yielding improvements in language model performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional line-level filtering techniques excessively discard valuable content, hindering the performance of NLP models.

Method: Introduces pattern-aware methods (PLD and PTF) that use sequential distribution across documents for effective filtering of text data.

Result: Evaluation on 1 billion parameter English and Korean language models showed improved benchmarks and accuracy in generative question-answering tasks.

Conclusion: Pattern-aware filtering retains critical content, resulting in consistent performance enhancements in downstream tasks for language models.

Abstract: While traditional line-level filtering techniques, such as line-level
deduplication and trailing-punctuation filters, are commonly used, these basic
methods can sometimes discard valuable content, negatively affecting downstream
performance. In this paper, we introduce two methods-pattern-aware line-level
deduplication (PLD) and pattern-aware trailing punctuation filtering (PTF)-by
enhancing the conventional filtering techniques. Our approach not only
considers line-level signals but also takes into account their sequential
distribution across documents, enabling us to retain structurally important
content that might otherwise be removed. We evaluate these proposed methods by
training small language models (1 B parameters) in both English and Korean. The
results demonstrate that our methods consistently improve performance on
multiple-choice benchmarks and significantly enhance generative
question-answering accuracy on both SQuAD v1 and KorQuAD v1.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To advance Korean NLP by creating a systematic benchmark for evaluating complex reasoning tasks in long Korean narratives.

Method: Developed Ko-MuSR, a comprehensive benchmark featuring Korean narratives, reasoning chains, and human-verified multiple-choice questions. Evaluated multilingual and Korean-specific models using innovative prompting strategies.

Result: Multilingual models outperform Korean-specific models even in Korean-language reasoning tasks. Advanced prompting techniques significantly improve accuracy, nearing human-level performance.

Conclusion: Ko-MuSR provides a strong framework for assessing long-context reasoning in Korean NLP and refining prompting strategies for better language model performance.

Abstract: We present Ko-MuSR, the first benchmark to comprehensively evaluate
multistep, soft reasoning in long Korean narratives while minimizing data
contamination. Built following MuSR, Ko-MuSR features fully Korean narratives,
reasoning chains, and multiple-choice questions verified by human annotators
for logical consistency and answerability. Evaluations of four large language
models -- two multilingual and two Korean-specialized -- show that multilingual
models outperform Korean-focused ones even in Korean reasoning tasks,
indicating cross-lingual generalization of reasoning ability. Carefully
designed prompting strategies, which combine few-shot examples, reasoning
traces, and task-specific hints, further boost accuracy, approaching
human-level performance. Ko-MuSR offers a solid foundation for advancing Korean
NLP by enabling systematic evaluation of long-context reasoning and prompting
strategies.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces MuSaG, the first German multimodal sarcasm detection dataset, integrating text, audio, and video annotations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in sarcasm detection across text, audio, and vision modalities, especially given its complexity in social media and popular culture.

Method: The authors created a dataset of 33 minutes of German TV annotations, benchmarking nine models and comparing against human annotations for sarcasm detection.

Result: Models performed best on text modality, while humans relied heavily on audio in conversational contexts, exposing gaps in current multimodal approaches.

Conclusion: MuSaG contributes to improving multimodal sarcasm detection and aligns human-model performance. The dataset is publicly available for future research.

Abstract: Sarcasm is a complex form of figurative language in which the intended
meaning contradicts the literal one. Its prevalence in social media and popular
culture poses persistent challenges for natural language understanding,
sentiment analysis, and content moderation. With the emergence of multimodal
large language models, sarcasm detection extends beyond text and requires
integrating cues from audio and vision. We present MuSaG, the first German
multimodal sarcasm detection dataset, consisting of 33 minutes of manually
selected and human-annotated statements from German television shows. Each
instance provides aligned text, audio, and video modalities, annotated
separately by humans, enabling evaluation in unimodal and multimodal settings.
We benchmark nine open-source and commercial models, spanning text, audio,
vision, and multimodal architectures, and compare their performance to human
annotations. Our results show that while humans rely heavily on audio in
conversational settings, models perform best on text. This highlights a gap in
current multimodal models and motivates the use of MuSaG for developing models
better suited to realistic scenarios. We release MuSaG publicly to support
future research on multimodal sarcasm detection and human-model alignment.

TL;DR: This paper investigates the role of external commonsense knowledge in NLG, creating a new benchmark (KITGI) and demonstrating the importance of relevant knowledge for coherence and coverage in generated outputs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve Natural Language Generation by integrating and evaluating the impact of external commonsense knowledge.

Method: The authors created the KITGI benchmark by extending the CommonGen dataset, utilizing the T5-Large model to study sentence generation with varying levels of external knowledge, and conducting a three-stage interpretability benchmark.

Result: Generation with full external knowledge achieved 91% correctness, while filtered knowledge reduced performance drastically to 6%, highlighting the importance of relevant knowledge for NLG effectiveness.

Conclusion: Relevant external knowledge is critical to achieving coherence and concept coverage in NLG tasks. Designing knowledge-enhanced interpretable systems and comprehensive evaluation frameworks is essential.

Abstract: This paper explores the influence of external knowledge integration in
Natural Language Generation (NLG), focusing on a commonsense generation task.
We extend the CommonGen dataset by creating KITGI, a benchmark that pairs input
concept sets with retrieved semantic relations from ConceptNet and includes
manually annotated outputs. Using the T5-Large model, we compare sentence
generation under two conditions: with full external knowledge and with filtered
knowledge where highly relevant relations were deliberately removed. Our
interpretability benchmark follows a three-stage method: (1) identifying and
removing key knowledge, (2) regenerating sentences, and (3) manually assessing
outputs for commonsense plausibility and concept coverage. Results show that
sentences generated with full knowledge achieved 91\% correctness across both
criteria, while filtering reduced performance drastically to 6\%. These
findings demonstrate that relevant external knowledge is critical for
maintaining both coherence and concept coverage in NLG. This work highlights
the importance of designing interpretable, knowledge-enhanced NLG systems and
calls for evaluation frameworks that capture the underlying reasoning beyond
surface-level metrics.

### [86] [Beyond Neural Incompatibility: Easing Cross-Scale Knowledge Transfer in Large Language Models through Latent Semantic Alignment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24208)
*Jian Gu,Aldeida Aleti,Chunyang Chen,Hongyu Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes a method leveraging latent semantic alignment to enable effective cross-scale knowledge transfer between large language models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing parametric knowledge transfer methods face limitations due to neural incompatibility (architectural and parametric differences) across large language models of different scales.

Method: The approach uses activations instead of layer parameters as the medium for layer-wise knowledge transfer, exploiting latent semantic alignment for effective cross-scale transfer.

Result: The method outperforms existing approaches in aligning LLM behaviors across varying scales, validated through evaluations across four benchmarks.

Conclusion: The approach showcases the importance of latent semantic alignment for LLM knowledge transfer, offering enhanced flexibility and applicability, and uncovering insights into easing cross-scale transfer.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) encode vast amounts of knowledge in their
massive parameters, which is accessible to locate, trace, and analyze. Despite
advances in neural interpretability, it is still not clear how to transfer
knowledge in a fine-grained manner, namely parametric knowledge transfer (PKT).
A key problem is enabling effective and efficient knowledge transfer across
LLMs of different scales, which is essential for achieving greater flexibility
and broader applicability in transferring knowledge between LLMs. Due to neural
incompatibility, referring to the architectural and parametric differences
between LLMs of varying scales, existing methods that directly reuse layer
parameters are severely limited. In this paper, we identify the semantic
alignment in latent space as the fundamental prerequisite for LLM cross-scale
knowledge transfer. Instead of directly using the layer parameters, our
approach takes activations as the medium of layer-wise knowledge transfer.
Leveraging the semantics in latent space, our approach is simple and
outperforms prior work, better aligning model behaviors across varying scales.
Evaluations on four benchmarks demonstrate the efficacy of our method. Further
analysis reveals the key factors easing cross-scale knowledge transfer and
provides insights into the nature of latent semantic alignment.

### [87] [HACK: Hallucinations Along Certainty and Knowledge Axes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24222)
*Adi Simhi,Jonathan Herzig,Itay Itzhak,Dana Arad,Zorik Gekhman,Roi Reichart,Fazl Barez,Gabriel Stanovsky,Idan Szpektor,Yonatan Belinkov*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper focuses on a new categorization of hallucinations in large language models (LLMs) based on two axes: knowledge and certainty, and proposes targeted mitigation strategies accordingly.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Hallucinations in LLMs hinder their reliable use, and current research fails to address their internal mechanisms, necessitating a deeper understanding to develop more effective mitigations.

Method: The authors developed a framework categorizing hallucinations by knowledge (lacking or present knowledge) and certainty (confidence in erroneous responses). They also validated their framework with a model-specific dataset, steering mitigation techniques, and a novel evaluation metric.

Result: The study differentiates hallucination types, provides evidence that models respond differently based on shared or individual parametric knowledge, and highlights the vulnerability of confident hallucinations despite internal knowledge.

Conclusion: Both knowledge and certainty must be considered in analyzing and mitigating hallucinations in LLMs, emphasizing the need for tailored mitigation strategies based on internal mechanisms.

Abstract: Hallucinations in LLMs present a critical barrier to their reliable usage.
Existing research usually categorizes hallucination by their external
properties rather than by the LLMs' underlying internal properties. This
external focus overlooks that hallucinations may require tailored mitigation
strategies based on their underlying mechanism. We propose a framework for
categorizing hallucinations along two axes: knowledge and certainty. Since
parametric knowledge and certainty may vary across models, our categorization
method involves a model-specific dataset construction process that
differentiates between those types of hallucinations. Along the knowledge axis,
we distinguish between hallucinations caused by a lack of knowledge and those
occurring despite the model having the knowledge of the correct response. To
validate our framework along the knowledge axis, we apply steering mitigation,
which relies on the existence of parametric knowledge to manipulate model
activations. This addresses the lack of existing methods to validate knowledge
categorization by showing a significant difference between the two
hallucination types. We further analyze the distinct knowledge and
hallucination patterns between models, showing that different hallucinations do
occur despite shared parametric knowledge. Turning to the certainty axis, we
identify a particularly concerning subset of hallucinations where models
hallucinate with certainty despite having the correct knowledge internally. We
introduce a new evaluation metric to measure the effectiveness of mitigation
methods on this subset, revealing that while some methods perform well on
average, they fail disproportionately on these critical cases. Our findings
highlight the importance of considering both knowledge and certainty in
hallucination analysis and call for targeted mitigation approaches that
consider the hallucination underlying factors.

*Teague McMillan,Gabriele Dominici,Martin Gjoreski,Marc Langheinrich*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper examines how inference and training-time choices impact explanation faithfulness in Large Language Models, especially in sensitive domains like healthcare.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the problem of unfaithful explanations produced by Large Language Models, particularly in high-stakes domains like healthcare where trust and safety are crucial.

Method: Three LLMs (GPT-4.1-mini, LLaMA 70B, LLaMA 8B) are evaluated using datasets BBQ (social bias) and MedQA (medical licensing questions). Factors like few-shot examples, prompting strategies, and training choices are manipulated.

Result: The study finds that the quality/quantity of few-shot examples, prompting design, and instruction-tuning impact explanation faithfulness significantly.

Conclusion: Insights are provided for improving the interpretability and trustworthiness of LLMs in high-stakes, sensitive domains such as healthcare.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often produce explanations that do not
faithfully reflect the factors driving their predictions. In healthcare
settings, such unfaithfulness is especially problematic: explanations that omit
salient clinical cues or mask spurious shortcuts can undermine clinician trust
and lead to unsafe decision support. We study how inference and training-time
choices shape explanation faithfulness, focusing on factors practitioners can
control at deployment. We evaluate three LLMs (GPT-4.1-mini, LLaMA 70B, LLaMA
8B) on two datasets-BBQ (social bias) and MedQA (medical licensing questions),
and manipulate the number and type of few-shot examples, prompting strategies,
and training procedure. Our results show: (i) both the quantity and quality of
few-shot examples significantly impact model faithfulness; (ii) faithfulness is
sensitive to prompting design; (iii) the instruction-tuning phase improves
measured faithfulness on MedQA. These findings offer insights into strategies
for enhancing the interpretability and trustworthiness of LLMs in sensitive
domains.

*Ahmad Ghannam,Naif Alharthi,Faris Alasmary,Kholood Al Tabash,Shouq Sadah,Lahouari Ghouti*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper addresses the Diacritic Restoration (DR) task for Arabic dialectal sentences using a multimodal model combining textual encoder (CATT) and speech encoder (OpenAI Whisper).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance the accuracy and context in diacritic placement in Arabic dialectal sentences, leveraging both textual and speech modalities.

Method: The authors used two integration strategies: Early-stage fusion of speech and text tokens after processing through linear projection and averaging audio frames, and cross-attention mechanisms between text and speech embeddings.

Result: The model achieved 0.25 WER and 0.9 CER on the development set, and 0.55 WER and 0.13 CER on the test set.

Conclusion: This multimodal approach combining textual and speech embeddings provides an effective solution for diacritical restoration in Arabic dialectal sentences, even without speech input.

Abstract: In this work, we tackle the Diacritic Restoration (DR) task for Arabic
dialectal sentences using a multimodal approach that combines both textual and
speech information. We propose a model that represents the text modality using
an encoder extracted from our own pre-trained model named CATT. The speech
component is handled by the encoder module of the OpenAI Whisper base model.
Our solution is designed following two integration strategies. The former
consists of fusing the speech tokens with the input at an early stage, where
the 1500 frames of the audio segment are averaged over 10 consecutive frames,
resulting in 150 speech tokens. To ensure embedding compatibility, these
averaged tokens are processed through a linear projection layer prior to
merging them with the text tokens. Contextual encoding is guaranteed by the
CATT encoder module. The latter strategy relies on cross-attention, where text
and speech embeddings are fused. The cross-attention output is then fed to the
CATT classification head for token-level diacritic prediction. To further
improve model robustness, we randomly deactivate the speech input during
training, allowing the model to perform well with or without speech. Our
experiments show that the proposed approach achieves a word error rate (WER) of
0.25 and a character error rate (CER) of 0.9 on the development set. On the
test set, our model achieved WER and CER scores of 0.55 and 0.13, respectively.

*Syed Zohaib Hassan,Pål Halvorsen,Miriam S. Johnson,Pierre Lison*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper evaluates five LLMs for generating child-like Norwegian dialogue and finds that most models produce text that is linguistically advanced for the target age groups.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of LLMs generating authentic and age-appropriate dialogue for children, specifically in low-resource languages like Norwegian.

Method: The authors conducted a comparative study of five LLMs, evaluated through blind assessments by eleven education professionals using real and generated child language samples, measuring authenticity and developmental appropriateness.

Result: GPT-4 and NorBloom-7b performed relatively well, though most models generated text that was more advanced than appropriate for the target age group. Evaluators had stronger accuracy in identifying language for younger children (5 years old).

Conclusion: There are significant challenges in developing LLM systems for low-resource languages and child-focused applications, which require better data and age-appropriate lexical resources.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs), predominantly trained on adult conversational
data, face significant challenges when generating authentic, child-like
dialogue for specialized applications. We present a comparative study
evaluating five different LLMs (GPT-4, RUTER-LLAMA-2-13b, GPTSW, NorMistral-7b,
and NorBloom-7b) to generate age-appropriate Norwegian conversations for
children aged 5 and 9 years. Through a blind evaluation by eleven education
professionals using both real child interview data and LLM-generated text
samples, we assessed authenticity and developmental appropriateness. Our
results show that evaluators achieved strong inter-rater reliability (ICC=0.75)
and demonstrated higher accuracy in age prediction for younger children
(5-year-olds) compared to older children (9-year-olds). While GPT-4 and
NorBloom-7b performed relatively well, most models generated language perceived
as more linguistically advanced than the target age groups. These findings
highlight critical data-related challenges in developing LLM systems for
specialized applications involving children, particularly in low-resource
languages where comprehensive age-appropriate lexical resources are scarce.

*Jack Merullo,Srihita Vatsavaya,Lucius Bushnaq,Owen Lewis*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper studies how memorization in transformer models can be disentangled using curvature-based decomposition, proposing a weight editing procedure to suppress memorized data while analyzing downstream task impacts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To better understand and manage memorization in transformer models, addressing challenges related to memorized data's impact on tasks and improving model generalization.

Method: The paper uses weight decomposition based on loss landscape curvature to analyze and edit weights, suppressing memorized data while retaining model performance. Extensive experiments analyze task effects.

Result: The proposed editing method suppresses memorized data effectively compared to BalancedSubnet, with particular impacts observed on tasks involving arithmetic and fact retrieval.

Conclusion: The study enhances understanding of memorization in transformers, showing its influence on task-specific mechanisms and providing practical techniques for suppression with implications for model reliability.

Abstract: We characterize how memorization is represented in transformer models and
show that it can be disentangled in the weights of both language models (LMs)
and vision transformers (ViTs) using a decomposition based on the loss
landscape curvature. This insight is based on prior theoretical and empirical
work showing that the curvature for memorized training points is much sharper
than non memorized, meaning ordering weight components from high to low
curvature can reveal a distinction without explicit labels. This motivates a
weight editing procedure that suppresses far more recitation of untargeted
memorized data more effectively than a recent unlearning method
(BalancedSubnet), while maintaining lower perplexity. Since the basis of
curvature has a natural interpretation for shared structure in model weights,
we analyze the editing procedure extensively on its effect on downstream tasks
in LMs, and find that fact retrieval and arithmetic are specifically and
consistently negatively affected, even though open book fact retrieval and
general logical reasoning is conserved. We posit these tasks rely heavily on
specialized directions in weight space rather than general purpose mechanisms,
regardless of whether those individual datapoints are memorized. We support
this by showing a correspondence between task data's activation strength with
low curvature components that we edit out, and the drop in task performance
after the edit. Our work enhances the understanding of memorization in neural
networks with practical applications towards removing it, and provides evidence
for idiosyncratic, narrowly-used structures involved in solving tasks like math
and fact retrieval.

*Ziqi Ma,Sao Mai Nguyen,Philippe Xu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores whether large language models (LLMs) can translate natural language instructions into symbolic representations used in hierarchical reinforcement learning and evaluates their performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand if LLMs can assist in generating internal symbolic representations from human natural language, aiding in tasks of planning and generalization critical in developmental learning agents.

Method: The authors use a structured evaluation framework to test LLMs (e.g., GPT, Claude) in translating natural language into symbolic representations in hierarchical reinforcement learning tasks involving the Ant Maze and Ant Fall environments.

Result: LLMs show some capability in translating natural language into symbolic representations, but their performance significantly depends on the complexity of the task and the granularity of symbolic partitions.

Conclusion: Current LLMs have limited capacity for robust alignment between natural language and internal symbolic representations, suggesting a need for more research to improve this alignment.

Abstract: Emergent symbolic representations are critical for enabling developmental
learning agents to plan and generalize across tasks. In this work, we
investigate whether large language models (LLMs) can translate human natural
language instructions into the internal symbolic representations that emerge
during hierarchical reinforcement learning. We apply a structured evaluation
framework to measure the translation performance of commonly seen LLMs -- GPT,
Claude, Deepseek and Grok -- across different internal symbolic partitions
generated by a hierarchical reinforcement learning algorithm in the Ant Maze
and Ant Fall environments. Our findings reveal that although LLMs demonstrate
some ability to translate natural language into a symbolic representation of
the environment dynamics, their performance is highly sensitive to partition
granularity and task complexity. The results expose limitations in current LLMs
capacity for representation alignment, highlighting the need for further
research on robust alignment between language and internal agent
representations.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces MERGE, a methodology for evaluating NLI models using minimally altered variants of original problems, revealing low model generalizability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current NLI benchmarks show a lack of robustness in language models and creating/manipulating benchmarks manually is resource-intensive.

Method: Automatically generates NLI problem variants by replacing open-class words while preserving reasoning and evaluates model predictions on these variants.

Result: NLI models perform 4-20% worse on these minimally altered variants, indicating limited generalizability.

Conclusion: MERGE reveals the fragility of NLI models to subtle changes, offering insights into their reasoning capabilities and generalization limits.

Abstract: In recent years, many generalization benchmarks have shown language models'
lack of robustness in natural language inference (NLI). However, manually
creating new benchmarks is costly, while automatically generating high-quality
ones, even by modifying existing benchmarks, is extremely difficult. In this
paper, we propose a methodology for automatically generating high-quality
variants of original NLI problems by replacing open-class words, while
crucially preserving their underlying reasoning. We dub our generalization test
as MERGE (Minimal Expression-Replacements GEneralization), which evaluates the
correctness of models' predictions across reasoning-preserving variants of the
original problem. Our results show that NLI models' perform 4-20% worse on
variants, suggesting low generalizability even on such minimally altered
problems. We also analyse how word class of the replacements, word probability,
and plausibility influence NLI models' performance.

*Shangyu Xing,Siyuan Wang,Chenyuan Yang,Xinyu Dai,Xiang Ren*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a new rollout strategy, LATR, to enhance trajectory diversity and improve policy learning in reinforcement learning for reasoning tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the bottleneck of limited trajectory diversity during group rollouts in reinforcement learning pipelines.

Method: Proposes Lookahead Tree-Based Rollouts (LATR) strategy: branch at high-uncertainty steps, simulate lookahead for branches, and prune homogeneous branches.

Result: LATR improves policy learning speed by 131% and final reasoning task accuracy by 4.2% compared to stochastic sampling.

Conclusion: Using LATR enhances trajectory diversity, accelerating policy learning and improving reasoning capabilities.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR), particularly with
algorithms like Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), has proven highly
effective in enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language models.
However, a critical bottleneck in current pipelines lies in the limited
diversity of sampled trajectories during group rollouts. Homogeneous
trajectories and their associated rewards would diminish the return signals for
policy updates, thereby hindering effective policy learning. This lack of
diversity stems primarily from token-level stochastic sampling, where local
variations are likely to collapse into near-identical reasoning paths. To
address this limitation, we propose Lookahead Tree-Based Rollouts (LATR), a
novel rollout strategy designed to explicitly promotes trajectory-level
diversity by enforcing branching into different candidate tokens likely to
yield distinct continuations. Specifically, LATR iteratively operates in three
stages: (1) branching at high-uncertainty generation steps, (2) performing
lookahead simulation for each new branch, and (3) pruning branches that
exhibits prolonged similarity during simulation. Compared with stochastic
Sampling, LATR accelerates policy learning by 131% on average and improves
final pass@1 performance by 4.2% on both GRPO and Dynamic sAmpling Policy
Optimization (DAPO) algorithms across different reasoning tasks. Our code and
data are publicly available at https://github.com/starreeze/latr.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces Critique-RL, a reinforcement learning approach for improving critiquing language models' performance without relying on stronger supervisors. It involves a two-player paradigm (actor and critic) with a two-stage optimization strategy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to improve complex reasoning tasks in large language models by developing better critiquing systems using reinforcement learning and avoiding reliance on stronger supervision.

Method: Critique-RL employs a two-player system where the actor refines responses based on feedback from the critic. It uses a two-stage optimization strategy: Stage I enhances the critic's discriminability with rule-based rewards, and Stage II improves helpfulness and maintains discriminability using indirect rewards and regularization.

Result: Critique-RL shows substantial performance improvements including a 9.02% gain on in-domain tasks and a 5.70% gain on out-of-domain tasks for a language model like Qwen2.5-7B.

Conclusion: Critique-RL is an effective approach to train critiquing language models, enhancing both helpfulness and discriminability, and demonstrates its potential to improve model reasoning capabilities across tasks.

Abstract: Training critiquing language models to assess and provide feedback on model
outputs is a promising way to improve LLMs for complex reasoning tasks.
However, existing approaches typically rely on stronger supervisors for
annotating critique data. To address this, we propose Critique-RL, an online RL
approach for developing critiquing language models without stronger
supervision. Our approach operates on a two-player paradigm: the actor
generates a response, the critic provides feedback, and the actor refines the
response accordingly. We first reveal that relying solely on indirect reward
signals from the actor's outputs for RL optimization often leads to
unsatisfactory critics: while their helpfulness (i.e., providing constructive
feedback) improves, the discriminability (i.e., determining whether a response
is high-quality or not) remains poor, resulting in marginal performance gains.
To overcome this, Critique-RL adopts a two-stage optimization strategy. In
stage I, it reinforces the discriminability of the critic with direct
rule-based reward signals; in stage II, it introduces indirect rewards based on
actor refinement to improve the critic's helpfulness, while maintaining its
discriminability via appropriate regularization. Extensive experiments across
various tasks and models show that Critique-RL delivers substantial performance
improvements. For example, it achieves a 9.02% gain on in-domain tasks and a
5.70% gain on out-of-domain tasks for Qwen2.5-7B, highlighting its potential.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper trains and evaluates LLMs by translating Modern Standard Arabic and dialects into multiple formats, extending an aligned QA dataset, showing performance gaps in Arabic-specific knowledge, and releasing the dataset for inclusive evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address performance challenges of LLMs on culturally grounded and dialect-specific content, specifically for Arabic language varieties.

Method: The method translates Modern Standard Arabic questions into English and Arabic dialects, converts them into open-ended formats, benchmarks LLMs in zero-shot and fine-tuned settings, and generates CoT rationales to improve reasoning.

Result: Experiments reveal underperformance on Arabic dialects and open-ended questions, though CoT rationales enhance judged correctness.

Conclusion: Persistent gaps in Arabic cultural knowledge remain; the public dataset can advance linguistically inclusive LLM evaluations.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used to answer everyday
questions, yet their performance on culturally grounded and dialectal content
remains uneven across languages. We propose a comprehensive method that (i)
translates Modern Standard Arabic (MSA) multiple-choice questions (MCQs) into
English and several Arabic dialects, (ii) converts them into open-ended
questions (OEQs), (iii) benchmarks a range of zero-shot and fine-tuned LLMs
under both MCQ and OEQ settings, and (iv) generates chain-of-thought (CoT)
rationales to fine-tune models for step-by-step reasoning. Using this method,
we extend an existing dataset in which QAs are parallelly aligned across
multiple language varieties, making it, to our knowledge, the first of its
kind. We conduct extensive experiments with both open and closed models. Our
findings show that (i) models underperform on Arabic dialects, revealing
persistent gaps in culturally grounded and dialect-specific knowledge; (ii)
Arabic-centric models perform well on MCQs but struggle with OEQs; and (iii)
CoT improves judged correctness while yielding mixed n-gram-based metrics. The
developed dataset will be publicly released to support further research on
culturally and linguistically inclusive evaluation.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LongWeave introduces Constraint-Verifier Evaluation (CoV-Eval) for assessing long-form generation capabilities of LLMs in realistic and verifiable scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the challenge of evaluating long, accurate, and realistic outputs generated by Large Language Models (LLMs). Existing benchmarks either lack real-world applicability or offer limited verifiability.

Method: The authors developed LongWeave, which uses Constraint-Verifier Evaluation (CoV-Eval) to design tasks combining realistic scenarios with objective constraints. Inputs and outputs are customizable for length, ensuring scalability.

Result: LongWeave assessed 23 LLMs, revealing that current state-of-the-art models struggle with producing accurate, complex, long-form outputs as task complexity and length grow.

Conclusion: Despite improvements in LLMs, long-form generation remains a challenging frontier; assessments like LongWeave emphasize the need for robust methods to evaluate real-world complexities and constraints.

Abstract: Generating long, informative, and factual outputs remains a major challenge
for Large Language Models (LLMs). Existing benchmarks for long-form generation
typically assess real-world queries with hard-to-verify metrics or use
synthetic setups that ease evaluation but overlook real-world intricacies. In
this paper, we introduce \textbf{LongWeave}, which balances real-world and
verifiable assessment with Constraint-Verifier Evaluation (CoV-Eval). CoV-Eval
constructs tasks by first defining verifiable targets within real-world
scenarios, then systematically generating corresponding queries, textual
materials, and constraints based on these targets. This ensures that tasks are
both realistic and objectively assessable, enabling rigorous assessment of
model capabilities in meeting complex real-world constraints. LongWeave
supports customizable input/output lengths (up to 64K/8K tokens) across seven
distinct tasks. Evaluation on 23 LLMs shows that even state-of-the-art models
encounter significant challenges in long-form generation as real-world
complexity and output length increase.

TL;DR: This paper investigates sentence embeddings' ability to preserve complexity levels for text simplification and proposes a small feed-forward neural network for this purpose.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to explore how sentence embeddings can be leveraged for text simplification while maintaining a smaller, more efficient model compared to resource-heavy approaches.

Method: A small feed-forward neural network is used to transform sentence embeddings from high-complexity to low-complexity levels, compared against Seq2Seq and LLM-based methods. It is tested on various datasets, including unseen languages and medical text simplification.

Result: The neural network approach showed encouraging results in preserving text complexity levels across different datasets and languages, even in a minimal learning setup.

Conclusion: Transforming sentence embeddings is an effective approach for text simplification, holding potential for developing lightweight models in natural language generation tasks.

Abstract: Sentence embeddings can be decoded to give approximations of the original
texts used to create them. We explore this effect in the context of text
simplification, demonstrating that reconstructed text embeddings preserve
complexity levels. We experiment with a small feed forward neural network to
effectively learn a transformation between sentence embeddings representing
high-complexity and low-complexity texts. We provide comparison to a Seq2Seq
and LLM-based approach, showing encouraging results in our much smaller
learning setting. Finally, we demonstrate the applicability of our
transformation to an unseen simplification dataset (MedEASI), as well as
datasets from languages outside the training data (ES,DE). We conclude that
learning transformations in sentence embedding space is a promising direction
for future research and has potential to unlock the ability to develop small,
but powerful models for text simplification and other natural language
generation tasks.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces COMPEFFDIST, a sentiment analysis distillation framework addressing challenges in instruction diversity and computational cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address limitations in knowledge distillation for sentiment analysis, including insufficient diversity in written instructions and high computational costs from large-scale data.

Method: COMPEFFDIST consists of attribute-based automatic instruction creation and difficulty-based data filtering to optimize sentiment analysis model training.

Result: The 3B student models achieved performance similar to teacher models 20 times their size, requiring only 10% of the data used by baseline methods.

Conclusion: COMPEFFDIST efficiently tackles key challenges in sentiment analysis modeling, offering a more resource-effective solution with comparable or superior performance.

Abstract: Recent efforts leverage knowledge distillation techniques to develop
lightweight and practical sentiment analysis models. These methods are grounded
in human-written instructions and large-scale user texts. Despite the promising
results, two key challenges remain: (1) manually written instructions are
limited in diversity and quantity, making them insufficient to ensure
comprehensive coverage of distilled knowledge; (2) large-scale user texts incur
high computational cost, hindering the practicality of these methods. To this
end, we introduce COMPEFFDIST, a comprehensive and efficient distillation
framework for sentiment analysis. Our framework consists of two key modules:
attribute-based automatic instruction construction and difficulty-based data
filtering, which correspondingly tackle the aforementioned challenges. Applying
our method across multiple model series (Llama-3, Qwen-3, and Gemma-3), we
enable 3B student models to match the performance of 20x larger teacher models
on most tasks. In addition, our approach greatly outperforms baseline methods
in data efficiency, attaining the same performance level with only 10% of the
data.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces SynthWorlds, a framework to separate reasoning complexity from factual knowledge in language models by creating parallel corpora with mirrored tasks for evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of evaluating reasoning abilities in language models without the interference of their parametric world knowledge.

Method: The authors designed SynthWorlds, utilizing two parallel worlds with identical structure (real-mapped and synthetic-mapped) and mirrored tasks for comparison of reasoning and factual recall performance.

Result: Experiments using different LM settings reveal a persistent advantage from memorized parametric knowledge, though mechanisms like knowledge acquisition and integration can lessen this gap.

Conclusion: SynthWorlds enables precise evaluation of language models' reasoning and memorization capabilities, offering opportunities for improvement in system design.

Abstract: Evaluating the reasoning ability of language models (LMs) is complicated by
their extensive parametric world knowledge, where benchmark performance often
reflects factual recall rather than genuine reasoning. Existing datasets and
approaches (e.g., temporal filtering, paraphrasing, adversarial substitution)
cannot cleanly separate the two. We present SynthWorlds, a framework that
disentangles task reasoning complexity from factual knowledge. In SynthWorlds,
we construct parallel corpora representing two worlds with identical
interconnected structure: a real-mapped world, where models may exploit
parametric knowledge, and a synthetic-mapped world, where such knowledge is
meaningless. On top of these corpora, we design two mirrored tasks as case
studies: multi-hop question answering and page navigation, which maintain equal
reasoning difficulty across worlds. Experiments in parametric-only (e.g.,
closed-book QA) and knowledge-augmented (e.g., retrieval-augmented) LM settings
reveal a persistent knowledge advantage gap, defined as the performance boost
models gain from memorized parametric world knowledge. Knowledge acquisition
and integration mechanisms reduce but do not eliminate this gap, highlighting
opportunities for system improvements. Fully automatic and scalable,
SynthWorlds provides a controlled environment for evaluating LMs in ways that
were previously challenging, enabling precise and testable comparisons of
reasoning and memorization.

Method: Developed LuxIT, a monolingual instruction tuning dataset, synthesized from native texts using DeepSeek-R1-0528, followed by quality assurance using LLMs.

Result: Fine-tuning smaller LLMs with LuxIT showed mixed outcomes when assessed on Luxembourgish language proficiency exams.

Conclusion: LuxIT contributes to Luxembourgish NLP development and highlights methodological replicability, but further research is needed to optimize its application.

Abstract: The effectiveness of instruction-tuned Large Language Models (LLMs) is often
limited in low-resource linguistic settings due to a lack of high-quality
training data. We introduce LuxIT, a novel, monolingual instruction tuning
dataset for Luxembourgish developed to mitigate this challenge. We synthesize
the dataset from a corpus of native Luxembourgish texts, utilizing
DeepSeek-R1-0528, chosen for its shown proficiency in Luxembourgish. Following
generation, we apply a quality assurance process, employing an LLM-as-a-judge
approach. To investigate the practical utility of the dataset, we fine-tune
several smaller-scale LLMs on LuxIT. Subsequent benchmarking against their base
models on Luxembourgish language proficiency examinations, however, yields
mixed results, with performance varying significantly across different models.
LuxIT represents a critical contribution to Luxembourgish natural language
processing and offers a replicable monolingual methodology, though our findings
highlight the need for further research to optimize its application.

*Abdullah Mushtaq,Rafay Naeem,Ezieddin Elmahjub,Ibrahim Ghaznavi,Shawqi Al-Maliki,Mohamed Abdallah,Ala Al-Fuqaha,Junaid Qadir*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper assesses the performance of three AI models—GPT-4o, Ansari AI, and Fanar—in providing Islamic guidance, highlighting accuracy strengths and areas requiring improvement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate AI models' ability to reliably produce faith-sensitive Islamic guidance and highlight the necessity for community-driven benchmarks.

Method: A dual-agent framework was used: quantitative analysis covered citation verification and six-dimensional scoring, while qualitative analysis involved five-dimensional comparison of response attributes.

Result: GPT-4o exhibited top scores in Islamic Accuracy (3.93) and Citation (3.38). Ansari AI followed closely with higher pairwise qualitative wins. Fanar trailed but contributes novel innovations for Islamic and Arabic contexts.

Conclusion: The models show promise yet lack consistent reliability in Islamic content generation. Community-driven benchmarks are essential for AI refinement in high-stakes domains like faith guidance, law, and medicine.

Abstract: Large language models are increasingly used for Islamic guidance, but risk
misquoting texts, misapplying jurisprudence, or producing culturally
inconsistent responses. We pilot an evaluation of GPT-4o, Ansari AI, and Fanar
on prompts from authentic Islamic blogs. Our dual-agent framework uses a
quantitative agent for citation verification and six-dimensional scoring (e.g.,
Structure, Islamic Consistency, Citations) and a qualitative agent for
five-dimensional side-by-side comparison (e.g., Tone, Depth, Originality).
GPT-4o scored highest in Islamic Accuracy (3.93) and Citation (3.38), Ansari AI
followed (3.68, 3.32), and Fanar lagged (2.76, 1.82). Despite relatively strong
performance, models still fall short in reliably producing accurate Islamic
content and citations -- a paramount requirement in faith-sensitive writing.
GPT-4o had the highest mean quantitative score (3.90/5), while Ansari AI led
qualitative pairwise wins (116/200). Fanar, though trailing, introduces
innovations for Islamic and Arabic contexts. This study underscores the need
for community-driven benchmarks centering Muslim perspectives, offering an
early step toward more reliable AI in Islamic knowledge and other high-stakes
domains such as medicine, law, and journalism.

*Marton Szep,Daniel Rueckert,Rüdiger von Eisenhart-Rothe,Florian Hinterwimmer*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper reviews methods for fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) under data-scarce scenarios, providing best practices and insights for efficient adaptation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenges of fine-tuning LLMs in low-resource settings, including specialized domains and constrained conditions, by providing a structured survey.

Method: The authors conduct a comprehensive survey on fine-tuning techniques, examining parameter-efficient methods, domain and cross-lingual adaptation strategies, and methods for preference alignment with limited data.

Result: The paper categorizes and discusses fine-tuning strategies, highlighting their trade-offs, selection criteria, and the challenges such as catastrophic forgetting and resource constraints.

Conclusion: The survey offers actionable recommendations for researchers and practitioners, assisting in effective fine-tuning of LLMs in resource-constrained scenarios.

Abstract: Fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) with limited data poses a practical
challenge in low-resource languages, specialized domains, and constrained
deployment settings. While pre-trained LLMs provide strong foundations,
effective adaptation under data scarcity requires focused and efficient
fine-tuning techniques. This paper presents a structured and practical survey
of recent methods for fine-tuning LLMs in data-scarce scenarios. We
systematically review parameter-efficient fine-tuning techniques that lower
training and deployment costs, domain and cross-lingual adaptation methods for
both encoder and decoder models, and model specialization strategies. We
further examine preference alignment approaches that guide model behavior using
limited human or synthetic feedback, emphasizing sample and compute efficiency.
Throughout, we highlight empirical trade-offs, selection criteria, and best
practices for choosing suitable techniques based on task constraints, including
model scaling, data scaling, and the mitigation of catastrophic forgetting. The
aim is to equip researchers and practitioners with actionable insights for
effectively fine-tuning LLMs when data and resources are limited.

### [104] [SPARTA: Evaluating Reasoning Segmentation Robustness through Black-Box Adversarial Paraphrasing in Text Autoencoder Latent Space](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24446)
*Viktoriia Zinkovich,Anton Antonov,Andrei Spiridonov,Denis Shepelev,Andrey Moskalenko,Daria Pugacheva,Elena Tutubalina,Andrey Kuznetsov,Vlad Shakhuro*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces an adversarial paraphrasing task targeting vision-language models in segmentation. It presents SPARTA, a semantic optimization method for generating effective paraphrases that reduce model performance while preserving query meaning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multimodal language models show vulnerability to textual changes even when the meaning is preserved in segmentation tasks. Addressing this can improve robustness in real-world diverse textual inputs.

Method: SPARTA is developed as a black-box optimization system using reinforcement learning to create adversarial paraphrases in a semantic latent space via a text autoencoder.

Result: SPARTA significantly improves adversarial success rates, outperforming prior methods in degrading segmentation performance on datasets ReasonSeg and LLMSeg-40k.

Conclusion: Multimodal models are shown to still be susceptible to semantic adversarial attacks, highlighting areas for robustness improvement. The public release of SPARTA and its benchmarks aids future work in this domain.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have shown impressive capabilities
in vision-language tasks such as reasoning segmentation, where models generate
segmentation masks based on textual queries. While prior work has primarily
focused on perturbing image inputs, semantically equivalent textual
paraphrases-crucial in real-world applications where users express the same
intent in varied ways-remain underexplored. To address this gap, we introduce a
novel adversarial paraphrasing task: generating grammatically correct
paraphrases that preserve the original query meaning while degrading
segmentation performance. To evaluate the quality of adversarial paraphrases,
we develop a comprehensive automatic evaluation protocol validated with human
studies. Furthermore, we introduce SPARTA-a black-box, sentence-level
optimization method that operates in the low-dimensional semantic latent space
of a text autoencoder, guided by reinforcement learning. SPARTA achieves
significantly higher success rates, outperforming prior methods by up to 2x on
both the ReasonSeg and LLMSeg-40k datasets. We use SPARTA and competitive
baselines to assess the robustness of advanced reasoning segmentation models.
We reveal that they remain vulnerable to adversarial paraphrasing-even under
strict semantic and grammatical constraints. All code and data will be released
publicly upon acceptance.

*Špela Vintar,Taja Kuzman Pungeršek,Mojca Brglez,Nikola Ljubešić*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper addresses the lack of benchmarks for evaluating large language models (LLMs) in non-English languages. It introduces a new taxonomy for categorizing multilingual benchmarks and suggests best practices for their improvement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the gap in benchmarking LLMs for non-English scenarios, given that current benchmarks primarily focus on English, leaving non-English language evaluation underexplored.

Method: The authors propose a new taxonomy specifically for categorizing benchmarks in multilingual or non-English settings. They also suggest a set of best practices and quality standards to guide benchmark development.

Result: The paper provides a structured taxonomy, best practices, and quality standards that aim to ensure better evaluation of non-English and multilingual LLMs.

Conclusion: To improve the development and assessment of LLMs in European languages, more emphasis should be placed on culturally sensitive evaluation methods and coordinated benchmark creation.

Abstract: While new benchmarks for large language models (LLMs) are being developed
continuously to catch up with the growing capabilities of new models and AI in
general, using and evaluating LLMs in non-English languages remains a
little-charted landscape. We give a concise overview of recent developments in
LLM benchmarking, and then propose a new taxonomy for the categorization of
benchmarks that is tailored to multilingual or non-English use scenarios. We
further propose a set of best practices and quality standards that could lead
to a more coordinated development of benchmarks for European languages. Among
other recommendations, we advocate for a higher language and culture
sensitivity of evaluation methods.

*Durga Prasad Maram,Dhruvin Gandhi,Zonghai Yao,Gayathri Akkinapalli,Franck Dernoncourt,Yu Wang,Ryan A. Rossi,Nesreen K. Ahmed*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: PerFine is a novel framework for personalized text generation, enhancing user-specific outputs through iterative revisions and profile-grounded feedback without requiring additional model training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in aligning generated text with a user's specific style, tone, and topical focus beyond traditional generation approaches.

Method: PerFine is a critique-refine framework that uses iterative feedback from a critic LLM grounded on user profiles, with a knockout strategy for retaining stronger drafts, and employs strategies like Best-of-N and Topic Extraction for better quality-efficiency balance.

Result: PerFine consistently improved personalization in text generation across three datasets, achieving GEval gains of 7-13%, steady improvement over multiple refinement iterations, and scalability with larger critic models.

Conclusion: Post-hoc, profile-aware feedback is a powerful and training-free approach for improving personalized text generation, demonstrating model-agnostic and scalable benefits.

Abstract: Personalized text generation requires models not only to produce coherent
text but also to align with a target user's style, tone, and topical focus.
Existing retrieval-augmented approaches such as LaMP and PGraphRAG enrich
profiles with user and neighbor histories, but they stop at generation and
often yield outputs that drift in tone, topic, or style. We present PerFine, a
unified, training-free critique-refine framework that enhances personalization
through iterative, profile-grounded feedback. In each iteration, an LLM
generator produces a draft conditioned on the retrieved profile, and a critic
LLM - also conditioned on the same profile - provides structured feedback on
tone, vocabulary, sentence structure, and topicality. The generator then
revises, while a novel knockout strategy retains the stronger draft across
iterations. We further study additional inference-time strategies such as
Best-of-N and Topic Extraction to balance quality and efficiency. Across Yelp,
Goodreads, and Amazon datasets, PerFine consistently improves personalization
over PGraphRAG, with GEval gains of +7-13%, steady improvements over 3-5
refinement iterations, and scalability with increasing critic size. These
results highlight that post-hoc, profile-aware feedback offers a powerful
paradigm for personalized LLM generation that is both training-free and
model-agnostic.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper reviews strategies to mitigate hallucinations in large language models through a taxonomy distinguishing between knowledge-based and logic-based hallucinations and examines Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and reasoning enhancement for better performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address and systematically analyze how hallucinations in large language models can be mitigated, particularly focusing on the synergy between Retrieval-Augmented Generation and reasoning enhancement.

Method: The study uses a taxonomy to differentiate between knowledge-based and logic-based hallucinations, examining real-world applications and benchmarks to assess the impact of RAG and reasoning enhancement.

Result: It presents a unified framework combining RAG and reasoning enhancement, showcasing their applications and evaluations in mitigating hallucinations effectively.

Conclusion: A systematic integration of RAG and reasoning enhancement can mitigate hallucinations, balancing creativity and reliability in large language models.

Abstract: Hallucination remains one of the key obstacles to the reliable deployment of
large language models (LLMs), particularly in real-world applications. Among
various mitigation strategies, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and
reasoning enhancement have emerged as two of the most effective and widely
adopted approaches, marking a shift from merely suppressing hallucinations to
balancing creativity and reliability. However, their synergistic potential and
underlying mechanisms for hallucination mitigation have not yet been
systematically examined. This survey adopts an application-oriented perspective
of capability enhancement to analyze how RAG, reasoning enhancement, and their
integration in Agentic Systems mitigate hallucinations. We propose a taxonomy
distinguishing knowledge-based and logic-based hallucinations, systematically
examine how RAG and reasoning address each, and present a unified framework
supported by real-world applications, evaluations, and benchmarks.

*Frederik Broy,Maike Züfle,Jan Niehues*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces "Reference Prediction from Talks" (RPT) task, where scientific talks are matched to relevant papers using a new dataset "Talk2Ref" and a proposed dual-encoder model.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Scientific talks are becoming prevalent for sharing research, yet lack tools to automatically link presented ideas to relevant academic literature, hindering access to useful references.

Method: The study utilizes Talk2Ref, a large dataset linking talks to cited papers, establishes baseline models with text embeddings, and designs a dual-encoder architecture adapted for long transcripts and domain-specific challenges.

Result: Fine-tuning models on Talk2Ref improves citation mapping performance, revealing both the problem's complexity and the utility of the dataset in understanding spoken science content.

Conclusion: Talk2Ref and the trained models show promise in advancing automated citation recommendation for scientific talks, encouraging further developments in this domain.

Abstract: Scientific talks are a growing medium for disseminating research, and
automatically identifying relevant literature that grounds or enriches a talk
would be highly valuable for researchers and students alike. We introduce
Reference Prediction from Talks (RPT), a new task that maps long, and
unstructured scientific presentations to relevant papers. To support research
on RPT, we present Talk2Ref, the first large-scale dataset of its kind,
containing 6,279 talks and 43,429 cited papers (26 per talk on average), where
relevance is approximated by the papers cited in the talk's corresponding
source publication. We establish strong baselines by evaluating
state-of-the-art text embedding models in zero-shot retrieval scenarios, and
propose a dual-encoder architecture trained on Talk2Ref. We further explore
strategies for handling long transcripts, as well as training for domain
adaptation. Our results show that fine-tuning on Talk2Ref significantly
improves citation prediction performance, demonstrating both the challenges of
the task and the effectiveness of our dataset for learning semantic
representations from spoken scientific content. The dataset and trained models
are released under an open license to foster future research on integrating
spoken scientific communication into citation recommendation systems.

*Katherine Abramski,Giulio Rossetti,Massimo Stella*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes a novel word association network method to evaluate implicit biases in Large Language Models (LLMs).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To tackle implicit social biases in LLMs, which remain challenging to detect and evaluate due to their implicit nature.

Method: Developed a prompt-based approach simulating semantic priming within LLM-generated word association networks, enabling bias evaluations and comparisons between humans and LLMs.

Result: Findings show both alignment and differences between LLM and human biases in gender, religion, ethnicity, sexual orientation, and political affiliation.

Conclusion: The methodology offers a scalable and generalizable framework, aiding the creation of transparent and socially responsible language technologies.

Abstract: As Large language models (LLMs) become increasingly integrated into our
lives, their inherent social biases remain a pressing concern. Detecting and
evaluating these biases can be challenging because they are often implicit
rather than explicit in nature, so developing evaluation methods that assess
the implicit knowledge representations of LLMs is essential. We present a novel
word association network methodology for evaluating implicit biases in LLMs
based on simulating semantic priming within LLM-generated word association
networks. Our prompt-based approach taps into the implicit relational
structures encoded in LLMs, providing both quantitative and qualitative
assessments of bias. Unlike most prompt-based evaluation methods, our method
enables direct comparisons between various LLMs and humans, providing a
valuable point of reference and offering new insights into the alignment of
LLMs with human cognition. To demonstrate the utility of our methodology, we
apply it to both humans and several widely used LLMs to investigate social
biases related to gender, religion, ethnicity, sexual orientation, and
political party. Our results reveal both convergences and divergences between
LLM and human biases, providing new perspectives on the potential risks of
using LLMs. Our methodology contributes to a systematic, scalable, and
generalizable framework for evaluating and comparing biases across multiple
LLMs and humans, advancing the goal of transparent and socially responsible
language technologies.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper focuses on enhancing confidence calibration in large language models (LLMs) using natural language critiques as a solution. It introduces two approaches: Self-Critique and CritiCal, with CritiCal demonstrating superior results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve confidence calibration in LLMs, especially for their safe deployment in high-stakes domains where verbalized confidence assessment is crucial.

Method: The proposed methods include 'Self-Critique', which enables models to evaluate and optimize their confidence, and 'CritiCal', a Critique Calibration training method using natural language critiques rather than numerical optimization.

Result: CritiCal outperforms Self-Critique and other baselines, even surpassing the teacher model GPT-4o in complex reasoning tasks. It showcases robust performance even in out-of-distribution scenarios.

Conclusion: Natural language critiques allow for accurate confidence assessments, enhancing reliability and calibration in LLMs, particularly using CritiCal, which significantly improves performance across tasks.

Abstract: Accurate confidence calibration in Large Language Models (LLMs) is critical
for safe use in high-stakes domains, where clear verbalized confidence enhances
user trust. Traditional methods that mimic reference confidence expressions
often fail to capture the reasoning needed for accurate confidence assessment.
We propose natural language critiques as a solution, ideally suited for
confidence calibration, as precise gold confidence labels are hard to obtain
and often require multiple generations. This paper studies how natural language
critiques can enhance verbalized confidence, addressing: (1) What to critique:
uncertainty (question-focused) or confidence (answer-specific)? Analysis shows
confidence suits multiple-choice tasks, while uncertainty excels in open-ended
scenarios. (2) How to critique: self-critique or critique calibration training?
We propose Self-Critique, enabling LLMs to critique and optimize their
confidence beyond mere accuracy, and CritiCal, a novel Critique Calibration
training method that leverages natural language critiques to improve confidence
calibration, moving beyond direct numerical optimization. Experiments show that
CritiCal significantly outperforms Self-Critique and other competitive
baselines, even surpassing its teacher model, GPT-4o, in complex reasoning
tasks. CritiCal also shows robust generalization in out-of-distribution
settings, advancing LLM's reliability.

*Eric G. C. Laporte*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper discusses a method for reducing part-of-speech ambiguity using context within a framework aiming for zero silence rate, implemented in the INTEX system.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation of the paper is to address the challenge of part-of-speech disambiguation in natural language processing, ensuring a zero silence rate and leveraging accurate local grammars.

Method: The paper introduces a method for lexical disambiguation adapted for zero silence rate in the INTEX system, highlighting the importance of verifying interactions between transducer paths and considering combined transducers' effects.

Result: The method ensures disambiguation with zero silence rate and requires thorough testing of local grammars due to unforeseen constructions or ambiguities.

Conclusion: Accurate local grammars and specification are crucial when targeting zero silence rate in lexical tagging systems, and interactions among disambiguation rules must be carefully assessed.

Abstract: Many words are ambiguous in terms of their part of speech (POS). However,
when a word appears in a text, this ambiguity is generally much reduced.
Disambiguating POS involves using context to reduce the number of POS
associated with words, and is one of the main challenges of lexical tagging.
The problem of labeling words by POS frequently arises in natural language
processing, for example for spelling correction, grammar or style checking,
expression recognition, text-to-speech conversion, text corpus analysis, etc.
Lexical tagging systems are thus useful as an initial component of many natural
language processing systems. A number of recent lexical tagging systems produce
multiple solutions when the text is lexically ambiguous or the uniquely correct
solution cannot be found. These contributions aim to guarantee a zero silence
rate: the correct tag(s) for a word must never be discarded. This objective is
unrealistic for systems that tag each word uniquely. This article concerns a
lexical disambiguation method adapted to the objective of a zero silence rate
and implemented in Silberztein's INTEX system (1993). We present here a formal
description of this method. We show that to verify a local disambiguation
grammar in this framework, it is not sufficient to consider the transducer
paths separately: one needs to verify their interactions. Similarly, if a
combination of multiple transducers is used, the result cannot be predicted by
considering them in isolation. Furthermore, when examining the initial labeling
of a text as produced by INTEX, ideas for disambiguation rules come
spontaneously, but grammatical intuitions may turn out to be inaccurate, often
due to an unforeseen construction or ambiguity. If a zero silence rate is
targeted, local grammars must be carefully tested. This is where a detailed
specification of what a grammar will do once applied to texts would be
necessary.

TL;DR: The paper analyzes 'bad' humor in English through the Bulwer-Lytton Fiction Contest corpus, identifying specific literary devices and examining performance issues in humor detection models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To better understand intentionally bad humor in English and analyze its diverse textual forms.

Method: Researchers curated and analyzed a novel humor corpus from the Bulwer-Lytton Fiction Contest, tested humor detection models, and evaluated patterns in literary devices. Additionally, they used LLMs to generate and analyze contest-style sentences.

Result: Standard humor detection models performed poorly on the 'bad' humor corpus. LLMs were found to exaggerate effects through frequent use of certain literary devices and novel adjective-noun bigrams in their generated sentences.

Conclusion: The study highlighted the complexity of 'bad' humor, emphasizing its rich blend of literary techniques. It demonstrated challenges for existing models and provided insights into LLM capabilities and exaggeration tendencies.

Abstract: Textual humor is enormously diverse and computational studies need to account
for this range, including intentionally bad humor. In this paper, we curate and
analyze a novel corpus of sentences from the Bulwer-Lytton Fiction Contest to
better understand "bad" humor in English. Standard humor detection models
perform poorly on our corpus, and an analysis of literary devices finds that
these sentences combine features common in existing humor datasets (e.g., puns,
irony) with metaphor, metafiction and simile. LLMs prompted to synthesize
contest-style sentences imitate the form but exaggerate the effect by
over-using certain literary devices, and including far more novel
adjective-noun bigrams than human writers. Data, code and analysis are
available at https://github.com/venkatasg/bulwer-lytton

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Introduces the Open Korean Historical Corpus, a dataset with 18 million documents over 1,300 years for analyzing major shifts in the Korean language across multiple scripts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of accessible historical corpora for exploring the evolution of the Korean language in NLP.

Method: The paper presents a curated dataset spanning 1,300 years with linguistic data, allowing quantitative analyses of the shifts in Korean language usage.

Result: Quantitative analyses showed Idu peaked in the 1860s, the rapid Hanja to Hangul shift began in 1890, and North Korea's lexical divergence affects tokenization efficiency.

Conclusion: This dataset provides a crucial resource for studying Korean linguistic history and can improve the pre-training of language models.

Abstract: The history of the Korean language is characterized by a discrepancy between
its spoken and written forms and a pivotal shift from Chinese characters to the
Hangul alphabet. However, this linguistic evolution has remained largely
unexplored in NLP due to a lack of accessible historical corpora. To address
this gap, we introduce the Open Korean Historical Corpus, a large-scale, openly
licensed dataset spanning 1,300 years and 6 languages, as well as
under-represented writing systems like Korean-style Sinitic (Idu) and
Hanja-Hangul mixed script. This corpus contains 18 million documents and 5
billion tokens from 19 sources, ranging from the 7th century to 2025. We
leverage this resource to quantitatively analyze major linguistic shifts: (1)
Idu usage peaked in the 1860s before declining sharply; (2) the transition from
Hanja to Hangul was a rapid transformation starting around 1890; and (3) North
Korea's lexical divergence causes modern tokenizers to produce up to 51 times
higher out-of-vocabulary rates. This work provides a foundational resource for
quantitative diachronic analysis by capturing the history of the Korean
language. Moreover, it can serve as a pre-training corpus for large language
models, potentially improving their understanding of Sino-Korean vocabulary in
modern Hangul as well as archaic writing systems.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: BEARD adapts Whisper's ASR encoder using self-supervised learning and knowledge distillation on unlabeled data to improve performance in specialized domains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance ASR performance in challenging and low-resource scenarios, such as non-native and noisy speech, where labeled data is scarce.

Method: BEARD utilizes self-supervised learning with the BEST-RQ objective, alongside knowledge distillation from a frozen teacher encoder, to adapt Whisper's encoder.

Result: Applying BEARD on the ATCO2 corpus achieved a 12% relative improvement compared to the fine-tuned ASR model using minimal labeled data.

Conclusion: BEARD effectively addresses domain adaptation in challenging ASR scenarios using unlabeled data, representing an innovative approach to improve encoder-decoder complementarity.

Abstract: Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) systems, despite large multilingual
training, struggle in out-of-domain and low-resource scenarios where labeled
data is scarce. We propose BEARD (BEST-RQ Encoder Adaptation with Re-training
and Distillation), a novel framework designed to adapt Whisper's encoder using
unlabeled data. Unlike traditional self-supervised learning methods, BEARD
uniquely combines a BEST-RQ objective with knowledge distillation from a frozen
teacher encoder, ensuring the encoder's complementarity with the pre-trained
decoder. Our experiments focus on the ATCO2 corpus from the challenging Air
Traffic Control (ATC) communications domain, characterized by non-native
speech, noise, and specialized phraseology. Using about 5,000 hours of
untranscribed speech for BEARD and 2 hours of transcribed speech for
fine-tuning, the proposed approach significantly outperforms previous baseline
and fine-tuned model, achieving a relative improvement of 12% compared to the
fine-tuned model. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to use a
self-supervised learning objective for domain adaptation of Whisper.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces ReplicationBench, a testing framework for assessing AI agents' ability to replicate research papers in astrophysics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To ensure the faithfulness and correctness of AI agents' work in novel scientific research tasks.

Method: Splitting research papers into tasks like experimental setups, derivations, and data analysis, co-developed with original authors, for AI agents to replicate.

Result: Current frontier AI agents perform poorly, with the best models scoring under 20% in faithfulness and correctness assessments.

Conclusion: ReplicationBench serves as a scalable, expert-validated framework to evaluate AI agents’ reliability in replicating scientific research, providing insights for broader scientific applications.

Abstract: Frontier AI agents show increasing promise as scientific research assistants,
and may eventually be useful for extended, open-ended research workflows.
However, in order to use agents for novel research, we must first assess the
underlying faithfulness and correctness of their work. To evaluate agents as
research assistants, we introduce ReplicationBench, an evaluation framework
that tests whether agents can replicate entire research papers drawn from the
astrophysics literature. Astrophysics, where research relies heavily on
archival data and computational study while requiring little real-world
experimentation, is a particularly useful testbed for AI agents in scientific
research. We split each paper into tasks which require agents to replicate the
paper's core contributions, including the experimental setup, derivations, data
analysis, and codebase. Each task is co-developed with the original paper
authors and targets a key scientific result, enabling objective evaluation of
both faithfulness (adherence to original methods) and correctness (technical
accuracy of results). ReplicationBench is extremely challenging for current
frontier language models: even the best-performing language models score under
20%. We analyze ReplicationBench trajectories in collaboration with domain
experts and find a rich, diverse set of failure modes for agents in scientific
research. ReplicationBench establishes the first benchmark of paper-scale,
expert-validated astrophysics research tasks, reveals insights about agent
performance generalizable to other domains of data-driven science, and provides
a scalable framework for measuring AI agents' reliability in scientific

### [116] [ReForm: Reflective Autoformalization with Prospective Bounded Sequence Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24592)
*Guoxin Chen,Jing Wu,Xinjie Chen,Wayne Xin Zhao,Ruihua Song,Chengxi Li,Kai Fan,Dayiheng Liu,Minpeng Liao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces ReForm, a method aiming to enhance autoformalization by including reflection and refinement loops. It shows significant improvement over existing baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address the limitations of current autoformalization methods which often fail to preserve the semantic integrity of natural language math problems during translation into formal statements.

Method: Proposes ReForm, a reflective autoformalization model that integrates semantic consistency evaluation to iteratively refine formal statements. It introduces Prospective Bounded Sequence Optimization (PBSO) for effective training.

Result: ReForm improves autoformalization performance by an average of 17.2 percentage points across benchmarks compared to baseline methods. It also introduces the ConsistencyCheck benchmark to evaluate and validate results.

Conclusion: Reflective mechanisms and semantic consistency assessments are vital for effective autoformalization, and the proposed ReForm method demonstrates significant improvements while highlighting inherent challenges in this field.

Abstract: Autoformalization, which translates natural language mathematics into
machine-verifiable formal statements, is critical for using formal mathematical
reasoning to solve math problems stated in natural language. While Large
Language Models can generate syntactically correct formal statements, they
often fail to preserve the original problem's semantic intent. This limitation
arises from the LLM approaches' treating autoformalization as a simplistic
translation task which lacks mechanisms for self-reflection and iterative
refinement that human experts naturally employ. To address these issues, we
propose ReForm, a Reflective Autoformalization method that tightly integrates
semantic consistency evaluation into the autoformalization process. This
enables the model to iteratively generate formal statements, assess its
semantic fidelity, and self-correct identified errors through progressive
refinement. To effectively train this reflective model, we introduce
Prospective Bounded Sequence Optimization (PBSO), which employs different
rewards at different sequence positions to ensure that the model develops both
accurate autoformalization and correct semantic validations, preventing
superficial critiques that would undermine the purpose of reflection. Extensive
experiments across four autoformalization benchmarks demonstrate that ReForm
achieves an average improvement of 17.2 percentage points over the strongest
baselines. To further ensure evaluation reliability, we introduce
ConsistencyCheck, a benchmark of 859 expert-annotated items that not only
validates LLMs as judges but also reveals that autoformalization is inherently
difficult: even human experts produce semantic errors in up to 38.5% of cases.

### [117] [Diffusion LLM with Native Variable Generation Lengths: Let [EOS] Lead the Way](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24605)
*Yicun Yang,Cong Wang,Shaobo Wang,Zichen Wen,Biqing Qi,Hanlin Xu,Linfeng Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces dLLM-Var, a diffusion-based large language model with native variable generation lengths, improving efficiency and flexibility in text generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current diffusion-based large language models lack flexibility and efficiency due to fixed generation lengths, limiting their practical application.

Method: The proposed dLLM-Var incorporates native variable generation lengths by training the model to accurately predict the [EOS] token. It allows block diffusion inference while enabling bi-directional attention and high parallelism.

Result: Experiments show a 30.1x speedup over traditional diffusion-based models and a 2.4x speedup compared to autoregressive models, with improved accuracy.

Conclusion: The method significantly advances the practical utility of diffusion-based language models by optimizing efficiency, flexibility, and accuracy for real-world use.

Abstract: Diffusion-based large language models (dLLMs) have exhibited substantial
potential for parallel text generation, which may enable more efficient
generation compared to autoregressive models. However, current dLLMs suffer
from fixed generation lengths, which indicates the generation lengths of dLLMs
have to be determined before decoding as a hyper-parameter, leading to issues
in efficiency and flexibility. To solve these problems, in this work, we
propose to train a diffusion LLM with native variable generation lengths,
abbreviated as dLLM-Var. Concretely, we aim to train a model to accurately
predict the [EOS] token in the generated text, which makes a dLLM be able to
natively infer in a block diffusion manner, while still maintaining the ability
of global bi-directional (full) attention and high parallelism. Experiments on
standard benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves a 30.1x speedup over
traditional dLLM inference paradigms and a 2.4x speedup relative to
autoregressive models such as Qwen and Llama. Our method achieves higher
accuracy and faster inference, elevating dLLMs beyond mere academic novelty and
supporting their practical use in real-world applications. Codes and models
have been released.

### [118] [Long-Context Modeling with Dynamic Hierarchical Sparse Attention for On-Device LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24606)
*Siheng Xiong,Joe Zou,Faramarz Fekri,Yae Jee Cho*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The quadratic cost of attention restricts scalability in long-context LLMs, particularly under resource constraints. DHSA dynamically predicts sparse attention online without retraining, balancing accuracy and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the inefficiencies and limitations in scalable long-context LLMs caused by quadratic attention costs, static sparse approaches and predefined templates which reduce adaptability and accuracy.

Method: Proposed Dynamic Hierarchical Sparse Attention (DHSA), which adaptively segments sequences, aggregates token embeddings using length-normalized aggregation, and calculates token-level interactions via chunk-level similarity scores to predict attention sparsity.

Result: The experiments on Gemma2 and LongBench show DHSA reduces prefill latency by 20-60%, peak memory usage by 35%, and maintains dense accuracy with 6-18% higher accuracy compared to block sparse attention baselines.

Conclusion: DHSA offers an efficient and adaptable solution for on-device long-context LLMs, improving scalability and overcoming limitations of existing sparse attention methods with dynamic and data-driven mechanisms.

Abstract: The quadratic cost of attention hinders the scalability of long-context LLMs,
especially in resource-constrained settings. Existing static sparse methods
such as sliding windows or global tokens utilizes the sparsity of attention to
reduce the cost of attention, but poorly adapts to the content-dependent
variations in attention due to their staticity. While previous work has
proposed several dynamic approaches to improve flexibility, they still depend
on predefined templates or heuristic mechanisms. Such strategies reduce
generality and prune tokens that remain contextually important, limiting their
accuracy across diverse tasks. To tackle these bottlenecks of existing methods
for long-context modeling, we introduce Dynamic Hierarchical Sparse Attention
(DHSA), a data-driven framework that dynamically predicts attention sparsity
online without retraining. Our proposed DHSA adaptively segments sequences into
variable-length chunks, then computes chunk representations by aggregating the
token embeddings within each chunk. To avoid the bias introduced by varying
chunk lengths, we apply length-normalized aggregation that scales the averaged
embeddings by the square root of the chunk size. Finally, DHSA upsamples the
chunk-level similarity scores to token level similarities to calculate
importance scores that determine which token-level interactions should be
preserved. Our experiments on Gemma2 with Needle-in-a-Haystack Test and
LongBench show that DHSA matches dense attention in accuracy, while reducing
prefill latency by 20-60% and peak memory usage by 35%. Compared to other
representative baselines such as block sparse attention, DHSA achieves
consistently higher accuracy (6-18% relative gains) with comparable or lower
cost, offering an efficient and adaptable solution for long-context on-device
LLMs.

### [119] [Zero-Shot Cross-Lingual Transfer using Prefix-Based Adaptation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24619)
*Snegha A,Sayambhu Sen,Piyush Singh Pasi,Abhishek Singhania,Preethi Jyothi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study investigates the effectiveness of prefix-based techniques for zero-shot multilingual transfer using Llama and Mistral. These methods outperform traditional LoRA approaches, even with fewer parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the challenges of adapting decoder-only LLMs to diverse tasks and languages, with an emphasis on zero-shot cross-lingual transfer.

Method: It conducts a comprehensive analysis of prefix-based methods and compares them against LoRA, focusing on performance across linguistic families, scripts, and model sizes from 1B to 24B.

Result: Prefix-based methods demonstrated superior performance compared to LoRA, with up to 6% improvement in the Belebele benchmark, using Llama 3.1 and Mistral models, despite requiring fewer learning parameters.

Conclusion: Prefix-based approaches provide an effective and scalable solution for zero-shot transfer in low-resource languages, outperforming traditional methods like LoRA.

Abstract: With the release of new large language models (LLMs) like Llama and Mistral,
zero-shot cross-lingual transfer has become increasingly feasible due to their
multilingual pretraining and strong generalization capabilities. However,
adapting these decoder-only LLMs to new tasks across languages remains
challenging. While parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PeFT) techniques like
Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) are widely used, prefix-based techniques such as
soft prompt tuning, prefix tuning, and Llama Adapter are less explored,
especially for zero-shot transfer in decoder-only models. We present a
comprehensive study of three prefix-based methods for zero-shot cross-lingual
transfer from English to 35+ high- and low-resource languages. Our analysis
further explores transfer across linguistic families and scripts, as well as
the impact of scaling model sizes from 1B to 24B. With Llama 3.1 8B, prefix
methods outperform LoRA-baselines by up to 6% on the Belebele benchmark.
Similar improvements were observed with Mistral v0.3 7B as well. Despite using
only 1.23M learning parameters with prefix tuning, we achieve consistent
improvements across diverse benchmarks. These findings highlight the potential
of prefix-based techniques as an effective and scalable alternative to LoRA,
particularly in low-resource multilingual settings.

### [120] [Relative Scaling Laws for LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24626)
*William Held,David Hall,Percy Liang,Diyi Yang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces relative scaling laws to track performance gaps between test distributions as models scale, revealing diverse trajectories and disparities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional scaling laws of language models focus on average performance across aggregates, obscuring disparities within heterogeneous subpopulations.

Method: 255 decoder-only Transformers were trained with matched compute budgets (IsoFLOP) within the range $10^{18}$–$10^{20}$ FLOPs and tested across diverse domains to analyze performance trajectories.

Result: Results reveal varied scaling trajectories, such as parity in academic domains, shifts in regional English dialects, and divergence in AI risk behaviors during pretraining.

Conclusion: Scaling improves overall performance but fails to equalize disparities. Released model checkpoints enable further study and better prioritization of robustness challenges.

Abstract: Scaling laws describe how language models improve with additional data,
parameters, and compute. While widely used, they are typically measured on
aggregate test sets. Aggregate evaluations yield clean trends but average over
heterogeneous subpopulations, obscuring performance disparities. We introduce
relative scaling laws, which track how performance gaps between test
distributions evolve with scale rather than focusing solely on absolute error.
Using 255 decoder-only Transformers trained under matched-compute (IsoFLOP)
budgets from $10^{18}$--$10^{20}$ FLOPs on standard pretraining datasets, we
find diverse trajectories: academic domains on MMLU converge toward parity;
regional English dialects shift depending on population size; and clusters of
AI risk behaviours split, with capability- and influence-related risks
increasing during pretraining while adversarial risks do not. These results
show that although scaling improves overall performance, it is not a universal
equalizer. To support further study, we release all model checkpoints from this
work to enable practitioners to measure relative alongside traditional scaling
laws, in order to better prioritize robustness challenges in light of the
bitter lesson.

### [121] ["Mm, Wat?" Detecting Other-initiated Repair Requests in Dialogue](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24628)
*Anh Ngo,Nicolas Rollet,Catherine Pelachaud,Chloe Clavel*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces a multimodal model for detecting repair initiation in Dutch dialogues using both linguistic and prosodic features, addressing breakdowns in conversational agents.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conversational agents often fail to recognize repair initiation from users, leading to breakdowns and disengagement. The research aims to improve mutual understanding and avoid communication failures.

Method: The study uses a multimodal approach that combines linguistic and prosodic features based on Conversation Analysis to identify repair initiation in dialogues. Pretrained text and audio embeddings are employed.

Result: Prosodic cues were found to enhance linguistic features, improving the detection of repair initiation. These multimodal features offered insights into their interaction.

Conclusion: Integrating prosodic cues with linguistic elements significantly enhances repair initiation detection in conversational models. Future work will explore visual cues, multilingual corpora, and robustness assessments.

Abstract: Maintaining mutual understanding is a key component in human-human
conversation to avoid conversation breakdowns, in which repair, particularly
Other-Initiated Repair (OIR, when one speaker signals trouble and prompts the
other to resolve), plays a vital role. However, Conversational Agents (CAs)
still fail to recognize user repair initiation, leading to breakdowns or
disengagement. This work proposes a multimodal model to automatically detect
repair initiation in Dutch dialogues by integrating linguistic and prosodic
features grounded in Conversation Analysis. The results show that prosodic cues
complement linguistic features and significantly improve the results of
pretrained text and audio embeddings, offering insights into how different
features interact. Future directions include incorporating visual cues,
exploring multilingual and cross-context corpora to assess the robustness and
generalizability.

*Ziyou Hu,Zhengliang Shi,Minghang Zhu,Haitao Li,Teng Sun,Pengjie Ren,Suzan Verberne,Zhaochun Ren*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: OpenRM is a new tool-augmented reward model designed to evaluate correctness in long-form, knowledge-intensive tasks, using external tools to gather evidence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing reward models struggle with evaluating correctness in tasks requiring external evidence, limiting their effectiveness in discriminating subtle quality differences.

Method: The authors introduce OpenRM, trained with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) on over 27K pairwise synthesized examples. The training aligns both intermediate tool usage and final outcome accuracy to improve evidence-based evaluation.

Result: OpenRM surpasses existing reward models in performance across three newly-collected datasets and two benchmarks, demonstrating improved judgment strategies.

Conclusion: OpenRM can enhance long-form language model alignment through tool-augmented reward modeling, providing more accurate evaluation for knowledge-intensive tasks.

Abstract: Reward models (RMs) have become essential for aligning large language models
(LLMs), serving as scalable proxies for human evaluation in both training and
inference. However, existing RMs struggle on knowledge-intensive and long-form
tasks, where evaluating correctness requires grounding beyond the model's
internal knowledge. This limitation hinders them from reliably discriminating
subtle quality differences, especially when external evidence is necessary. To
address this, we introduce OpenRM, a tool-augmented long-form reward model that
systematically judges open-ended responses by invoking external tools to gather
relevant evidence. We train OpenRM with Group Relative Policy Optimization
(GRPO) on over 27K synthesized pairwise examples generated through a
controllable data synthesis framework. The training objective jointly
supervises intermediate tool usage and final outcome accuracy, incentivizing
our reward model to learn effective evidence-based judgment strategies.
Extensive experiments on three newly-collected datasets and two widely-used
benchmarks demonstrate that OpenRM substantially outperforms existing reward
modeling approaches. As a further step, we integrate OpenRM into both
inference-time response selection and training-time data selection. This yields
consistent gains in downstream LLM alignment tasks, highlighting the potential
of tool-augmented reward models for scaling reliable long-form evaluation.

### [123] [Optimizing Retrieval for RAG via Reinforced Contrastive Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24652)
*Jiawei Zhou,Lei Chen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes R3, a novel retrieval framework optimized for retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) using a trial-and-feedback reinforcement learning approach.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The shift of information retrieval's role from human-centric to AI-centric retrieval systems makes relevance difficult to define in RAG contexts.

Method: R3 employs reinforced contrastive learning, dynamically optimizing relevance by leveraging interaction feedback from the RAG environment and eliminating the need for pre-annotated supervision.

Result: R3 improves RAG performance by 5.2% compared to original retrievers, surpassing state-of-the-art models by 4.9%, and achieves similar performance to advanced LLM-based systems while being computationally efficient.

Conclusion: R3 is an efficient and effective solution for retrieval in RAG environments, demonstrating significant improvements in performance without requiring extensive computational resources.

Abstract: As retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) becomes increasingly widespread, the
role of information retrieval (IR) is shifting from retrieving information for
human users to retrieving contextual knowledge for artificial intelligence (AI)
systems, where relevance becomes difficult to define or annotate beforehand. To
address this challenge, we propose R3, a Retrieval framework optimized for RAG
through trialand-feedback Reinforced contrastive learning. Unlike prior
approaches that rely on annotated or synthetic data for supervised fine-tuning,
R3 enables the retriever to dynamically explore and optimize relevance within
the RAG environment. During training, the retrieved results interact with the
environment to produce contrastive signals that automatically guide the
retriever's self-improvement. Extensive experiments across diverse tasks
demonstrate that R3 improves RAG performance by 5.2% over the original
retriever and surpasses state-of-the-art retrievers by 4.9%, while achieving
comparable results to LLM-augmented retrieval and RAG systems built on
post-trained or instruction-tuned LLMs. It is both efficient and practical,
requiring only 4 GPUs and completing training within a single day.

*Pengcheng Qiu,Chaoyi Wu,Junwei Liu,Qiaoyu Zheng,Yusheng Liao,Haowen Wang,Yun Yue,Qianrui Fan,Shuai Zhen,Jian Wang,Jinjie Gu,Yanfeng Wang,Ya Zhang,Weidi Xie*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper presents a framework for training large language models (LLMs) as diagnostic agents using reinforcement learning, emphasizing adaptive, multi-turn processes and outperforming state-of-the-art models in diagnostic accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to enhance diagnostic decision-making in clinical processes by leveraging interactive reinforcement learning to train LLMs in multi-turn diagnostic environments rather than traditional static case summaries.

Method: The method involves creating DiagGym, a simulated environment modeled on electronic health records, and training DiagAgent using reinforcement learning for diagnostic tasks, complemented by DiagBench for benchmarking performance.

Result: DiagAgent significantly improves diagnostic accuracy and examination recommendations compared to existing models, achieving up to 15.12% higher diagnostic accuracy and a 44.03% improved hit ratio in certain evaluations.

Conclusion: Interactive clinical environments for training LLMs provide dynamic and clinically relevant abilities that passive training methods cannot achieve, bridging the gap in diagnostic accuracy and recommendation efficiency.

Abstract: In this paper, we present a framework for training large language models
(LLMs) as diagnostic agents with reinforcement learning, enabling them to
manage multi-turn diagnostic processes, adaptively select examinations, and
commit to final diagnoses. Unlike instruction-tuned models trained on static
case summaries, our method acquires diagnostic strategies through interactive
exploration and outcome-based feedback. Our contributions are fourfold: (i) We
present DiagGym, a diagnostics world model trained with electronic health
records that emits examination outcomes conditioned on patient history and
recommended examination, serving as a virtual clinical environment for
realistic diagnosis training and evaluation; (ii) We train DiagAgent via
end-to-end, multi-turn reinforcement learning to learn diagnostic policies that
optimize both information yield and diagnostic accuracy; (iii) We introduce
DiagBench, a diagnostic benchmark comprising 750 cases with physician-validated
examination recommendations and 99 cases annotated with 973 physician-written
rubrics on diagnosis process; (iv) we demonstrate superior performance across
diverse diagnostic settings. DiagAgent significantly outperforms 10
state-of-the-art LLMs, including DeepSeek-v3 and GPT-4o, as well as two
prompt-engineered agents. In single-turn settings, DiagAgent achieves 9.34%
higher diagnostic accuracy and 44.03% improvement in examination recommendation
hit ratio. In end-to-end settings, it delivers 15.12% increase in diagnostic
accuracy and 23.09% boost in examination recommendation F1 score. In
rubric-based evaluation, it surpasses the next-best model, Claude-sonnet-4, by
7.1% in weighted rubric score. These findings indicate that learning policies
in interactive clinical environments confers dynamic and clinically meaningful
diagnostic management abilities unattainable through passive training alone.

*Parker Riley,Daniel Deutsch,Mara Finkelstein,Colten DiIanni,Juraj Juraska,Markus Freitag*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces MQM re-annotation for improved human evaluation of machine translation systems, ensuring better quality annotations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The quality of machine translation models continually improves, demanding more precise evaluation methods to reduce noise and capture true quality gains.

Method: The paper experiments with a two-stage evaluation paradigm where annotators review and edit previously collected MQM annotations, aiming to identify missed errors and refine annotation accuracy.

Result: Results showed that re-annotation improves annotation quality, mainly by detecting previously missed errors, with annotator behavior aligning to the intended goals.

Conclusion: Using MQM re-annotation enhances evaluation effectiveness by increasing annotation quality, ensuring the accurate assessment of translation model improvements.

Abstract: Human evaluation of machine translation is in an arms race with translation
model quality: as our models get better, our evaluation methods need to be
improved to ensure that quality gains are not lost in evaluation noise. To this
end, we experiment with a two-stage version of the current state-of-the-art
translation evaluation paradigm (MQM), which we call MQM re-annotation. In this
setup, an MQM annotator reviews and edits a set of pre-existing MQM
annotations, that may have come from themselves, another human annotator, or an
automatic MQM annotation system. We demonstrate that rater behavior in
re-annotation aligns with our goals, and that re-annotation results in
higher-quality annotations, mostly due to finding errors that were missed
during the first pass.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces InteractComp, a benchmark to evaluate search agents' ability to recognize ambiguous queries and resolve them via interaction, revealing significant underperformance and stagnation in interaction capabilities despite advancements in search performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Search agents assume queries are complete, but in reality, users often provide ambiguous, incomplete queries needing iterative clarification. Existing methods and benchmarks lack mechanisms to handle such scenarios.

Method: The study introduces InteractComp, consisting of 210 expert-crafted ambiguous queries across 9 domains, designed to evaluate agents' interactive capabilities using forced interaction strategies and comprehensive analysis.

Result: Only 13.73% accuracy was achieved in recognizing and resolving query ambiguity by the best-performing model, despite its 71.50% accuracy with complete information. Forced interaction improved outcomes dramatically, highlighting latent potential in agents.

Conclusion: Interactions in search agents are a critical blind spot that has stagnated, highlighting the urgency of enhancing interactive competences through tools like InteractComp for better information retrieval in ambiguous contexts.

Abstract: Language agents have demonstrated remarkable potential in web search and
information retrieval. However, these search agents assume user queries are
complete and unambiguous, an assumption that diverges from reality where users
begin with incomplete queries requiring clarification through interaction. Yet
most agents lack interactive mechanisms during the search process, and existing
benchmarks cannot assess this capability. To address this gap, we introduce
InteractComp, a benchmark designed to evaluate whether search agents can
recognize query ambiguity and actively interact to resolve it during search.
Following the principle of easy to verify, interact to disambiguate, we
construct 210 expert-curated questions across 9 domains through a
target-distractor methodology that creates genuine ambiguity resolvable only
through interaction. Evaluation of 17 models reveals striking failure: the best
model achieves only 13.73% accuracy despite 71.50% with complete context,
exposing systematic overconfidence rather than reasoning deficits. Forced
interaction produces dramatic gains, demonstrating latent capability current
strategies fail to engage. Longitudinal analysis shows interaction capabilities
stagnated over 15 months while search performance improved seven-fold,
revealing a critical blind spot. This stagnation, coupled with the immediate
feedback inherent to search tasks, makes InteractComp a valuable resource for
both evaluating and training interaction capabilities in search agents. The
code is available at https://github.com/FoundationAgents/InteractComp.

TL;DR: Prompt-Based Role Playing (PBRP) in large language models primarily modifies linguistic style, without improving reasoning abilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Investigate whether role prompts in medical AI induce distinct cognitive processes or merely alter linguistic style.

Method: Developed RPNA framework to analyze neuron activity changes, tested using medical QA datasets and analytical techniques like neuron ablation and representation analysis.

Result: Role prompts primarily affect stylistic features, not reasoning pathways. No distinct cognitive differentiation across roles in LLMs was observed.

Conclusion: Current PBRP methods are ineffective in replicating real-world medical practice's cognitive complexity, pointing to the need for more advanced models simulating genuine cognitive processes.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have gained significant traction in medical
decision support systems, particularly in the
  context of medical question answering and role-playing simulations. A common
practice, Prompt-Based Role Playing (PBRP),
  instructs models to adopt different clinical roles (e.g., medical students,
residents, attending physicians) to simulate varied
  professional behaviors. However, the impact of such role prompts on model
reasoning capabilities remains unclear. This
  study introduces the RP-Neuron-Activated Evaluation Framework(RPNA) to
evaluate whether role prompts induce distinct,
  role-specific cognitive processes in LLMs or merely modify linguistic style.
We test this framework on three medical QA
  datasets, employing neuron ablation and representation analysis techniques to
assess changes in reasoning pathways. Our
  results demonstrate that role prompts do not significantly enhance the
medical reasoning abilities of LLMs. Instead, they
  primarily affect surface-level linguistic features, with no evidence of
distinct reasoning pathways or cognitive differentiation
  across clinical roles. Despite superficial stylistic changes, the core
decision-making mechanisms of LLMs remain uniform
  across roles, indicating that current PBRP methods fail to replicate the
cognitive complexity found in real-world medical
  practice. This highlights the limitations of role-playing in medical AI and
emphasizes the need for models that simulate genuine
  cognitive processes rather than linguistic imitation.We have released the
related code in the following repository:https:

TL;DR: SPICE uses adversarial dynamics between two roles in a single model to automatically generate reasoning tasks for continuous adaptation via reinforcement learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable self-improving systems that leverage environmental interaction for sustained adaptation and improvement.

Method: A reinforcement learning framework where a model acts as both Challenger (creating tasks from a corpus) and Reasoner (solving tasks), utilizing adversarial dynamics and corpus grounding for curriculum development.

Result: SPICE demonstrates improved performance in mathematical (+8.9%) and general reasoning (+9.8%) benchmarks across various model families.

Conclusion: Document grounding in SPICE is crucial for generating increasingly complex reasoning tasks and achieving ongoing self-improvement.

Abstract: Self-improving systems require environmental interaction for continuous
adaptation. We introduce SPICE (Self-Play In Corpus Environments), a
reinforcement learning framework where a single model acts in two roles: a
Challenger that mines documents from a large corpus to generate diverse
reasoning tasks, and a Reasoner that solves them. Through adversarial dynamics,
the Challenger creates an automatic curriculum at the frontier of the
Reasoner's capability, while corpus grounding provides the rich,
near-inexhaustible external signal necessary for sustained improvement. Unlike
existing ungrounded self-play methods that offer more limited benefits, SPICE
achieves consistent gains across mathematical (+8.9%) and general reasoning
(+9.8%) benchmarks on multiple model families. Our analysis reveals how
document grounding is a key ingredient in SPICE to continuously generate its
own increasingly challenging goals and achieve them, enabling sustained
self-improvement.

TL;DR: The paper introduces E-GRPO, a new training framework for search agents, improving learning from "near-miss" errors using entity-aware rewards, achieving better performance and efficiency compared to the baseline method.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address the limitation of current training methods for search agents in effectively leveraging informative errors ("near-misses") to improve learning and accuracy.

Method: The authors proposed Entity-aware Group Relative Policy Optimization (E-GRPO), a framework incorporating a dense reward function based on entity match rate to provide valuable learning signals from incorrect reasoning samples.

Result: E-GRPO outperforms the GRPO baseline in accuracy and efficiency through experiments on question-answering and research benchmarks, while reducing unnecessary computational steps.

Conclusion: E-GRPO is a superior and sample-efficient learning framework for search agents, demonstrating better accuracy and reasoning capabilities compared to previous approaches.

Abstract: LLM-based search agents are increasingly trained on entity-centric synthetic
data to solve complex, knowledge-intensive tasks. However, prevailing training
methods like Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) discard this rich entity
information, relying instead on sparse, outcome-based rewards. This critical
limitation renders them unable to distinguish informative "near-miss"
samples-those with substantially correct reasoning but a flawed final
answer-from complete failures, thus discarding valuable learning signals. We
address this by leveraging the very entities discarded during training. Our
empirical analysis reveals a strong positive correlation between the number of
ground-truth entities identified during an agent's reasoning process and final
answer accuracy. Building on this insight, we introduce Entity-aware Group
Relative Policy Optimization (E-GRPO), a novel framework that formulates a
dense entity-aware reward function. E-GRPO assigns partial rewards to incorrect
samples proportional to their entity match rate, enabling the model to
effectively learn from these "near-misses". Experiments on diverse
question-answering (QA) and deep research benchmarks show that E-GRPO
consistently and significantly outperforms the GRPO baseline. Furthermore, our
analysis reveals that E-GRPO not only achieves superior accuracy but also
induces more efficient reasoning policies that require fewer tool calls,
demonstrating a more effective and sample-efficient approach to aligning search
agents.

*Xuanzhong Chen,Zile Qiao,Guoxin Chen,Liangcai Su,Zhen Zhang,Xinyu Wang,Pengjun Xie,Fei Huang,Jingren Zhou,Yong Jiang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a ZPD-inspired data synthesis approach to train LLMs on frontier tasks, leveraging the AgentFrontier Engine and establishing high-performance benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to enable advanced reasoning in large language models (LLMs) by training them on tasks they can learn with guidance, as defined by the Zone of Proximal Development (ZPD).

Method: The paper presents the AgentFrontier Engine, which automates data synthesis within the LLM’s ZPD, supporting pre-training with knowledge-intensive data and post-training on complex tasks. It also introduces the ZPD Exam as a dynamic benchmark for task evaluation.

Result: By training with synthesized data using the AgentFrontier Engine, the AgentFrontier-30B-A3B model achieves state-of-the-art results on benchmarks like Humanity's Last Exam, surpassing some proprietary LLMs.

Conclusion: This ZPD-guided approach to data synthesis effectively enables scalable improvements in LLM capabilities and reasoning tasks, proving its potential in creating more advanced agents.

Abstract: Training large language model agents on tasks at the frontier of their
capabilities is key to unlocking advanced reasoning. We introduce a data
synthesis approach inspired by the educational theory of the Zone of Proximal
Development (ZPD), which defines this frontier as tasks an LLM cannot solve
alone but can master with guidance. To operationalize this, we present the
AgentFrontier Engine, an automated pipeline that synthesizes high-quality,
multidisciplinary data situated precisely within the LLM's ZPD. This engine
supports both continued pre-training with knowledge-intensive data and targeted
post-training on complex reasoning tasks. From the same framework, we derive
the ZPD Exam, a dynamic and automated benchmark designed to evaluate agent
capabilities on these frontier tasks. We train AgentFrontier-30B-A3B model on
our synthesized data, which achieves state-of-the-art results on demanding
benchmarks like Humanity's Last Exam, even surpassing some leading proprietary
agents. Our work demonstrates that a ZPD-guided approach to data synthesis
offers a scalable and effective path toward building more capable LLM agents.

*Zhengwei Tao,Haiyang Shen,Baixuan Li,Wenbiao Yin,Jialong Wu,Kuan Li,Zhongwang Zhang,Huifeng Yin,Rui Ye,Liwen Zhang,Xinyu Wang,Pengjun Xie,Jingren Zhou,Yong Jiang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces WebLeaper, an efficient search framework for improving information-seeking capabilities of LLM-based agents by targeting search efficiency and accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLM-based agents for information-seeking tasks suffer from low search efficiency due to sparse target entities in training tasks.

Method: WebLeaper uses tree-structured reasoning, synthesizes target-rich IS tasks, and curates accurate and efficient training trajectories.

Result: Experiments on five IS benchmarks prove WebLeaper's consistent improvements in both effectiveness and efficiency over baselines.

Conclusion: WebLeaper enhances search efficiency and effectiveness for LLM-based agents, addressing key shortcomings in existing systems.

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM)-based agents have emerged as a transformative
approach for open-ended problem solving, with information seeking (IS) being a
core capability that enables autonomous reasoning and decision-making. While
prior research has largely focused on improving retrieval depth, we observe
that current IS agents often suffer from low search efficiency, which in turn
constrains overall performance. A key factor underlying this inefficiency is
the sparsity of target entities in training tasks, which limits opportunities
for agents to learn and generalize efficient search behaviors. To address these
challenges, we propose WebLeaper, a framework for constructing high-coverage IS
tasks and generating efficient solution trajectories. We formulate IS as a
tree-structured reasoning problem, enabling a substantially larger set of
target entities to be embedded within a constrained context. Leveraging curated
Wikipedia tables, we propose three variants for synthesizing IS tasks, Basic,
Union, and Reverse-Union, to systematically increase both IS efficiency and
efficacy. Finally, we curate training trajectories by retaining only those that
are simultaneously accurate and efficient, ensuring that the model is optimized
for both correctness and search performance. Extensive experiments on both
basic and comprehensive settings, conducted on five IS benchmarks, BrowserComp,
GAIA, xbench-DeepSearch, WideSearch, and Seal-0, demonstrate that our method
consistently achieves improvements in both effectiveness and efficiency over
strong baselines.

*Baixuan Li,Dingchu Zhang,Jialong Wu,Wenbiao Yin,Zhengwei Tao,Yida Zhao,Liwen Zhang,Haiyang Shen,Runnan Fang,Pengjun Xie,Jingren Zhou,Yong Jiang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ParallelMuse enhances exploration efficiency and synthesis of coherent answers in deep information-seeking agents using functionality-specified partial rollout and compressed reasoning aggregation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improve the efficiency and integration of parallel thinking in deep information-seeking agents, addressing inefficiencies and limitations within conventional methods.

Method: The study introduces ParallelMuse, a two-stage paradigm comprising Functionality-Specified Partial Rollout for exploring efficiently and Compressed Reasoning Aggregation for synthesizing coherent answers by compressing redundant reasoning information.

Result: Experiments with multiple open-source agents and benchmarks demonstrated up to 62% performance improvement and a reduction of exploratory token consumption by 10-30%.

Conclusion: ParallelMuse provides a systematic approach for enhanced reasoning and exploration efficiency in problem-solving agents, advancing their capabilities through strategic rollout and answer aggregation.

Abstract: Parallel thinking expands exploration breadth, complementing the deep
exploration of information-seeking (IS) agents to further enhance
problem-solving capability. However, conventional parallel thinking faces two
key challenges in this setting: inefficiency from repeatedly rolling out from
scratch, and difficulty in integrating long-horizon reasoning trajectories
during answer generation, as limited context capacity prevents full
consideration of the reasoning process. To address these issues, we propose
ParallelMuse, a two-stage paradigm designed for deep IS agents. The first
stage, Functionality-Specified Partial Rollout, partitions generated sequences
into functional regions and performs uncertainty-guided path reuse and
branching to enhance exploration efficiency. The second stage, Compressed
Reasoning Aggregation, exploits reasoning redundancy to losslessly compress
information relevant to answer derivation and synthesize a coherent final
answer. Experiments across multiple open-source agents and benchmarks
demonstrate up to 62% performance improvement with a 10--30% reduction in
exploratory token consumption.

### [133] [AgentFold: Long-Horizon Web Agents with Proactive Context Management](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24699)
*Rui Ye,Zhongwang Zhang,Kuan Li,Huifeng Yin,Zhengwei Tao,Yida Zhao,Liangcai Su,Liwen Zhang,Zile Qiao,Xinyu Wang,Pengjun Xie,Fei Huang,Siheng Chen,Jingren Zhou,Yong Jiang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: AgentFold is a novel context management method improving long-horizon task performance for web agents.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLM-based web agents suffer from ineffective context management, limiting their performance on long-horizon tasks.

Method: AgentFold introduces a dynamic 'folding' operation to actively manage historical context at multiple scales, inspired by human cognitive processes.

Result: AgentFold achieved notable benchmark results, outperforming larger open-source and proprietary models.

Conclusion: Proactive and scalable context management by AgentFold demonstrates its efficiency and competitiveness in web agent applications.

Abstract: LLM-based web agents show immense promise for information seeking, yet their
effectiveness on long-horizon tasks is hindered by a fundamental trade-off in
context management. Prevailing ReAct-based agents suffer from context
saturation as they accumulate noisy, raw histories, while methods that fixedly
summarize the full history at each step risk the irreversible loss of critical
details. Addressing these, we introduce AgentFold, a novel agent paradigm
centered on proactive context management, inspired by the human cognitive
process of retrospective consolidation. AgentFold treats its context as a
dynamic cognitive workspace to be actively sculpted, rather than a passive log
to be filled. At each step, it learns to execute a `folding' operation, which
manages its historical trajectory at multiple scales: it can perform granular
condensations to preserve vital, fine-grained details, or deep consolidations
to abstract away entire multi-step sub-tasks. The results on prominent
benchmarks are striking: with simple supervised fine-tuning (without continual
pre-training or RL), our AgentFold-30B-A3B agent achieves 36.2% on BrowseComp
and 47.3% on BrowseComp-ZH. Notably, this performance not only surpasses or
matches open-source models of a dramatically larger scale, such as the
DeepSeek-V3.1-671B-A37B, but also surpasses leading proprietary agents like
OpenAI's o4-mini.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces the agent data protocol (ADP) to unify fragmented AI agent training datasets into a standardized format, improving training efficiency and performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Researchers face challenges in training AI agents due to fragmented data formats and interfaces, hindering scalable and efficient supervision.

Method: ADP, a representation language, was created to unify diverse agent training datasets, enabling streamlined conversion into training-ready formats for multiple frameworks.

Result: Experiments showed ~20% performance improvement over base models and near-state-of-the-art results in coding, browsing, tool use, and research benchmarks.

Conclusion: ADP facilitates standardized, scalable, and reproducible training for AI agents, aiming to lower barriers for broader research and development.

Abstract: Public research results on large-scale supervised finetuning of AI agents
remain relatively rare, since the collection of agent training data presents
unique challenges. In this work, we argue that the bottleneck is not a lack of
underlying data sources, but that a large variety of data is fragmented across
heterogeneous formats, tools, and interfaces. To this end, we introduce the
agent data protocol (ADP), a light-weight representation language that serves
as an "interlingua" between agent datasets in diverse formats and unified agent
training pipelines downstream. The design of ADP is expressive enough to
capture a large variety of tasks, including API/tool use, browsing, coding,
software engineering, and general agentic workflows, while remaining simple to
parse and train on without engineering at a per-dataset level. In experiments,
we unified a broad collection of 13 existing agent training datasets into ADP
format, and converted the standardized ADP data into training-ready formats for
multiple agent frameworks. We performed SFT on these data, and demonstrated an
average performance gain of ~20% over corresponding base models, and delivers
state-of-the-art or near-SOTA performance on standard coding, browsing, tool
use, and research benchmarks, without domain-specific tuning. All code and data
are released publicly, in the hope that ADP could help lower the barrier to
standardized, scalable, and reproducible agent training.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces two new models, MetricX-25 and GemSpanEval, for tasks in translation evaluation, leveraging advancements in architecture and training techniques based on the Gemma 3 model.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to improve translation evaluation methods by addressing quality score prediction and error span detection tasks with more accurate and effective models.

Method: MetricX-25 adapts the Gemma 3 model to an encoder-only architecture with a regression head, while GemSpanEval, a decoder-only model, generates error spans along with context details and categorization.

Result: MetricX-25 demonstrates significant improvements in predicting MQM and ESA quality scores compared to its predecessor, while GemSpanEval competes strongly in error span detection against a robust baseline.

Conclusion: Both models provide advancements in translation evaluation tasks, with MetricX-25 improving quality prediction, and GemSpanEval enhancing error span detection through a generative approach.

Abstract: In this paper, we present our submissions to the unified WMT25 Translation
Evaluation Shared Task. For the Quality Score Prediction subtask, we create a
new generation of MetricX with improvements in the input format and the
training protocol, while for the Error Span Detection subtask we develop a new
model, GemSpanEval, trained to predict error spans along with their severities
and categories. Both systems are based on the state-of-the-art multilingual
open-weights model Gemma 3, fine-tuned on publicly available WMT data. We
demonstrate that MetricX-25, adapting Gemma 3 to an encoder-only architecture
with a regression head on top, can be trained to effectively predict both MQM
and ESA quality scores, and significantly outperforms its predecessor. Our
decoder-only GemSpanEval model, on the other hand, we show to be competitive in
error span detection with xCOMET, a strong encoder-only sequence-tagging
baseline. With error span detection formulated as a generative task, we
instruct the model to also output the context for each predicted error span,
thus ensuring that error spans are identified unambiguously.

*Aryan Mathur,Asaduddin Ahmed,Pushti Amit Vasoya,Simeon Kandan Sonar,Yasir Z,Madesh Kuppusamy*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper presents an explainable image authenticity detection system using AI combining visual and linguistic analysis for enhanced accuracy and interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The growing challenge of verifying visual authenticity in AI-generated images necessitates efficient, interpretable detection methods that address artifact localization and explainability.

Method: A lightweight convolutional classifier ('Faster-Than-Lies') was combined with a Vision-Language Model (Qwen2-VL-7B) for image authenticity detection, artifact interpretation, and localization in 32x32 images.

Result: The model achieved 96.5% accuracy on the extended CiFAKE dataset with adversarial perturbations and maintained a fast inference time of 175ms, enabling usability in local or edge deployments.

Conclusion: The proposed system demonstrates the effective integration of visual and linguistic reasoning for explainable detections in low-resolution imagery, with practical applications in various domains such as forensics and industrial inspection.

Abstract: The increasing realism of AI-generated imagery poses challenges for verifying
visual authenticity. We present an explainable image authenticity detection
system that combines a lightweight convolutional classifier
("Faster-Than-Lies") with a Vision-Language Model (Qwen2-VL-7B) to classify,
localize, and explain artifacts in 32x32 images. Our model achieves 96.5%
accuracy on the extended CiFAKE dataset augmented with adversarial
perturbations and maintains an inference time of 175ms on 8-core CPUs, enabling
deployment on local or edge devices. Using autoencoder-based reconstruction
error maps, we generate artifact localization heatmaps, which enhance
interpretability for both humans and the VLM. We further categorize 70 visual
artifact types into eight semantic groups and demonstrate explainable text
generation for each detected anomaly. This work highlights the feasibility of
combining visual and linguistic reasoning for interpretable authenticity
detection in low-resolution imagery and outlines potential cross-domain
applications in forensics, industrial inspection, and social media moderation.

*Md Tanvir Hossain,Akif Islam,Mohd Ruhul Ameen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CountFormer enhances class-agnostic object counting with a transformer framework and DINOv2-based visual encoding, achieving close-to-state-of-the-art performance, especially for complex scenes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current counting models often fail with complex shapes, symmetry, or overlapping objects, unlike humans who rely on structural relationships.

Method: CountFormer substitutes the CounTR's visual encoder with DINOv2 for consistent features, adds positional embedding fusion, and decodes with a lightweight convolutional decoder.

Result: The model performs comparably to state-of-the-art methods on FSC-147, excelling in intricate and densely packed arrangements.

Conclusion: By leveraging DINOv2, CountFormer showcases potential in mimicking human spatial perception, pushing closer to general object counting approaches without reliance on exemplars.

Abstract: Humans can effortlessly count diverse objects by perceiving visual repetition
and structural relationships rather than relying on class identity. However,
most existing counting models fail to replicate this ability; they often
miscount when objects exhibit complex shapes, internal symmetry, or overlapping
components. In this work, we introduce CountFormer, a transformer-based
framework that learns to recognize repetition and structural coherence for
class-agnostic object counting. Built upon the CounTR architecture, our model
replaces its visual encoder with the self-supervised foundation model DINOv2,
which produces richer and spatially consistent feature representations. We
further incorporate positional embedding fusion to preserve geometric
relationships before decoding these features into density maps through a
lightweight convolutional decoder. Evaluated on the FSC-147 dataset, our model
achieves performance comparable to current state-of-the-art methods while
demonstrating superior accuracy on structurally intricate or densely packed
scenes. Our findings indicate that integrating foundation models such as DINOv2
enables counting systems to approach human-like structural perception,
advancing toward a truly general and exemplar-free counting paradigm.

### [139] [Does Object Binding Naturally Emerge in Large Pretrained Vision Transformers?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24709)
*Yihao Li,Saeed Salehi,Lyle Ungar,Konrad P. Kording*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper investigates whether object binding capabilities emerge naturally in pre-trained Vision Transformers (ViTs), finding evidence in self-supervised models but weaker signals in ImageNet-supervised models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand if and how Vision Transformers (ViTs) naturally develop the ability to group parts of an object into a coherent representation during pre-training.

Method: The authors hypothesize that ViTs encode the ability to identify whether two patches belong to the same object (termed IsSameObject). They use a similarity probe to decode this property from patch embeddings across ViT layers.

Result: Self-supervised ViTs demonstrated strong object-binding capabilities (over 90% decoding accuracy), while ImageNet-supervised models showed significantly weaker performance. This ability was found to guide attention and support downstream tasks.

Conclusion: Object-binding abilities emerge naturally in self-supervised ViTs as part of their pretraining objectives, challenging assumptions that ViTs lack this capability and connecting emergent symbolic knowledge with connectionist systems.

Abstract: Object binding, the brain's ability to bind the many features that
collectively represent an object into a coherent whole, is central to human
cognition. It groups low-level perceptual features into high-level object
representations, stores those objects efficiently and compositionally in
memory, and supports human reasoning about individual object instances. While
prior work often imposes object-centric attention (e.g., Slot Attention)
explicitly to probe these benefits, it remains unclear whether this ability
naturally emerges in pre-trained Vision Transformers (ViTs). Intuitively, they
could: recognizing which patches belong to the same object should be useful for
downstream prediction and thus guide attention. Motivated by the quadratic
nature of self-attention, we hypothesize that ViTs represent whether two
patches belong to the same object, a property we term IsSameObject. We decode
IsSameObject from patch embeddings across ViT layers using a similarity probe,
which reaches over 90% accuracy. Crucially, this object-binding capability
emerges reliably in self-supervised ViTs (DINO, MAE, CLIP), but markedly weaker
in ImageNet-supervised models, suggesting that binding is not a trivial
architectural artifact, but an ability acquired through specific pretraining
objectives. We further discover that IsSameObject is encoded in a
low-dimensional subspace on top of object features, and that this signal
actively guides attention. Ablating IsSameObject from model activations
degrades downstream performance and works against the learning objective,
implying that emergent object binding naturally serves the pretraining
objective. Our findings challenge the view that ViTs lack object binding and
highlight how symbolic knowledge of "which parts belong together" emerges
naturally in a connectionist system.

TL;DR: This paper proposes a novel methodological framework using fixed cameras and deep learning for monitoring floating debris in rivers, emphasizing the identification of suitable models and geometric object size estimation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The proliferation of floating anthropogenic debris in rivers is harming biodiversity, water quality, navigation, and recreation, highlighting the need for effective monitoring systems.

Method: The study integrates deep learning models for continuous debris monitoring, identifies optimal models based on accuracy and inference speed, incorporates geometric modeling for size estimation, and addresses biases like data leakage.

Result: The research demonstrated robust debris monitoring using deep learning models, emphasized the importance of dataset constitution protocols, and successfully implemented metric object estimation through projective geometry with regression corrections.

Conclusion: This framework establishes the feasibility of creating robust, automated, and cost-effective monitoring systems for urban aquatic environments using fixed cameras and advanced computational methods.

Abstract: The proliferation of floating anthropogenic debris in rivers has emerged as a
pressing environmental concern, exerting a detrimental influence on
biodiversity, water quality, and human activities such as navigation and
recreation. The present study proposes a novel methodological framework for the
monitoring the aforementioned waste, utilising fixed, in-situ cameras. This
study provides two key contributions: (i) the continuous quantification and
monitoring of floating debris using deep learning and (ii) the identification
of the most suitable deep learning model in terms of accuracy and inference
speed under complex environmental conditions. These models are tested in a
range of environmental conditions and learning configurations, including
experiments on biases related to data leakage. Furthermore, a geometric model
is implemented to estimate the actual size of detected objects from a 2D image.
This model takes advantage of both intrinsic and extrinsic characteristics of
the camera. The findings of this study underscore the significance of the
dataset constitution protocol, particularly with respect to the integration of
negative images and the consideration of temporal leakage. In conclusion, the
feasibility of metric object estimation using projective geometry coupled with
regression corrections is demonstrated. This approach paves the way for the
development of robust, low-cost, automated monitoring systems for urban aquatic
environments.

*Forouzan Fallah,Wenwen Li,Chia-Yu Hsu,Hyunho Lee,Yezhou Yang*

TL;DR: RareFlow is a super-resolution framework for remote sensing imagery that handles out-of-distribution conditions by preserving geometrical fidelity and incorporating textual prompts, ensuring high-quality, physically accurate synthesis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing super-resolution methods for remote sensing imagery fail under out-of-distribution (OOD) conditions, producing visually plausible but physically inaccurate results, particularly when processing rare geomorphic features captured by diverse sensors.

Method: RareFlow employs a dual-conditioning architecture with Gated ControlNet for geometric fidelity and textual prompts for semantic guidance, alongside a multifaceted loss function enforcing spectral and radiometric consistency. Additionally, it quantifies predictive uncertainty using stochastic forward passes.

Result: RareFlow demonstrates qualitative and quantitative superiority over state-of-the-art baselines in generating high-fidelity imagery. It reduces FID by almost 40% and receives high ratings in blind evaluations by geophysical experts, approaching ground truth fidelity.

Conclusion: RareFlow provides a robust framework for generating high-quality remote sensing imagery, ensuring physical accuracy and robustness under domain shifts, thereby addressing challenges in scientific domains with scarce data.

Abstract: Super-resolution (SR) for remote sensing imagery often fails under
out-of-distribution (OOD) conditions, such as rare geomorphic features captured
by diverse sensors, producing visually plausible but physically inaccurate
results. We present RareFlow, a physics-aware SR framework designed for OOD
robustness. RareFlow's core is a dual-conditioning architecture. A Gated
ControlNet preserves fine-grained geometric fidelity from the low-resolution
input, while textual prompts provide semantic guidance for synthesizing complex
features. To ensure physically sound outputs, we introduce a multifaceted loss
function that enforces both spectral and radiometric consistency with sensor
properties. Furthermore, the framework quantifies its own predictive
uncertainty by employing a stochastic forward pass approach; the resulting
output variance directly identifies unfamiliar inputs, mitigating feature
hallucination. We validate RareFlow on a new, curated benchmark of multi-sensor
satellite imagery. In blind evaluations, geophysical experts rated our model's
outputs as approaching the fidelity of ground truth imagery, significantly
outperforming state-of-the-art baselines. This qualitative superiority is
corroborated by quantitative gains in perceptual metrics, including a nearly
40\% reduction in FID. RareFlow provides a robust framework for high-fidelity
synthesis in data-scarce scientific domains and offers a new paradigm for
controlled generation under severe domain shift.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a training-free method for generating large, coherent 3D scenes from text by leveraging existing text-to-3D diffusion models as modular tile generators.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Text-driven 3D scene generation faces challenges such as limited scope to single objects, dependency on domain-specific training, or lack of full 360-degree viewability.

Method: Reformulating scene generation as a multi-tile denoising process where overlapping 3D regions are independently generated and blended via weighted averaging.

Result: The approach enables scalable and coherent synthesis of large 3D scenes, supports local semantic control, and avoids scene-level datasets or additional training.

Conclusion: This method establishes a powerful foundation for general-purpose, language-driven 3D scene generation with flexible editing and efficient generation.

Abstract: Text-driven 3D scene generation holds promise for a wide range of
applications, from virtual prototyping to AR/VR and simulation. However,
existing methods are often constrained to single-object generation, require
domain-specific training, or lack support for full 360-degree viewability. In
this work, we present a training-free approach to 3D scene synthesis by
repurposing general-purpose text-to-3D object diffusion models as modular tile
generators. We reformulate scene generation as a multi-tile denoising problem,
where overlapping 3D regions are independently generated and seamlessly blended
via weighted averaging. This enables scalable synthesis of large, coherent
scenes while preserving local semantic control. Our method eliminates the need
for scene-level datasets or retraining, relies on minimal heuristics, and
inherits the generalization capabilities of object-level priors. We demonstrate
that our approach supports diverse scene layouts, efficient generation, and
flexible editing, establishing a simple yet powerful foundation for
general-purpose, language-driven 3D scene construction.

### [143] [Improving Visual Discriminability of CLIP for Training-Free Open-Vocabulary Semantic Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23894)
*Jinxin Zhou,Jiachen Jiang,Zhihui Zhu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces LHT-CLIP, a novel training-free framework for semantic segmentation using CLIP models, enhancing visual discriminability without extra training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the challenge of extending CLIP models to semantic segmentation, as their image-level pre-training objectives do not align well with pixel-level understanding required for dense prediction.

Method: LHT-CLIP systematically exploits CLIP's visual discriminability via three techniques: semantic-spatial reweighting, selective head enhancement, and abnormal token replacement, without requiring additional training or auxiliary networks.

Result: LHT-CLIP achieves state-of-the-art semantic segmentation performance across 8 benchmarks, showcasing improved adaptation and effective segmentation capabilities.

Conclusion: The proposed LHT-CLIP framework effectively enhances visual discriminability in CLIP models, demonstrating practicality and performance for real-world semantic segmentation deployment.

Abstract: Extending CLIP models to semantic segmentation remains challenging due to the
misalignment between their image-level pre-training objectives and the
pixel-level visual understanding required for dense prediction. While prior
efforts have achieved encouraging results by reorganizing the final layer and
features, they often inherit the global alignment bias of preceding layers,
leading to suboptimal segmentation performance. In this work, we propose
LHT-CLIP, a novel training-free framework that systematically exploits the
visual discriminability of CLIP across layer, head, and token levels. Through
comprehensive analysis, we reveal three key insights: (i) the final layers
primarily strengthen image-text alignment with sacrifice of visual
discriminability (e.g., last 3 layers in ViT-B/16 and 8 layers in ViT-L/14),
partly due to the emergence of anomalous tokens; (ii) a subset of attention
heads (e.g., 10 out of 144 in ViT-B/16) display consistently strong visual
discriminability across datasets; (iii) abnormal tokens display sparse and
consistent activation pattern compared to normal tokens. Based on these
findings, we propose three complementary techniques: semantic-spatial
reweighting, selective head enhancement, and abnormal token replacement to
effectively restore visual discriminability and improve segmentation
performance without any additional training, auxiliary pre-trained networks, or
extensive hyperparameter tuning. Extensive experiments on 8 common semantic
segmentation benchmarks demonstrate that LHT-CLIP achieves state-of-the-art
performance across diverse scenarios, highlighting its effectiveness and
practicality for real-world deployment.

*Eddison Pham,Prisha Priyadarshini,Adrian Maliackel,Kanishk Bandi,Cristian Meo,Kevin Zhu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DynaStride is a method to generate coherent, scene-level captions for instructional videos without needing manual scene segmentation, showing improvements over existing models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enhance instructional video captions to aid procedural learning by improving coherence and multimodal reasoning.

Method: DynaStride uses adaptive frame sampling, multimodal windowing, and a dynamic stride algorithm for balancing temporal context and redundancy, integrated with a multimodal chain-of-thought process.

Result: Empirical evaluations show DynaStride outperforms strong baselines in caption quality as measured by BLEU, METEOR, BERTScore, and CLIPScore.

Conclusion: DynaStride shows promise in improving AI-generated educational video captions by enhancing coherence and informativeness.

Abstract: Scene-level captioning in instructional videos can enhance learning by
requiring an understanding of both visual cues and temporal structure. By
aligning visual cues with textual guidance, this understanding supports
procedural learning and multimodal reasoning, providing a richer context for
skill acquisition. However, captions that fail to capture this structure may
lack coherence and quality, which can create confusion and undermine the
video's educational intent. To address this gap, we introduce DynaStride, a
pipeline to generate coherent, scene-level captions without requiring manual
scene segmentation. Using the YouCookII dataset's scene annotations, DynaStride
performs adaptive frame sampling and multimodal windowing to capture key
transitions within each scene. It then employs a multimodal chain-of-thought
process to produce multiple action-object pairs, which are refined and fused
using a dynamic stride window selection algorithm that adaptively balances
temporal context and redundancy. The final scene-level caption integrates
visual semantics and temporal reasoning in a single instructional caption.
Empirical evaluations against strong baselines, including VLLaMA3 and GPT-4o,
demonstrate consistent gains on both N-gram-based metrics (BLEU, METEOR) and
semantic similarity measures (BERTScore, CLIPScore). Qualitative analyses
further show that DynaStride produces captions that are more temporally
coherent and informative, suggesting a promising direction for improving
AI-powered instructional content generation.

*Emily Kim,Julieta Martinez,Timur Bagautdinov,Jessica Hodgins*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TurboPortrait3D is a method for synthesizing novel views of human portraits with improved quality and consistency, using diffusion models for refinement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for portrait generation often struggle with detail, identity preservation, and visual artifacts, while diffusion models generate high-quality images but lack 3D consistency.

Method: The method combines an image-to-avatar pipeline with a single-step diffusion model to refine noisy renders in a multi-view consistent way, supported by a new training strategy using synthetic and real image data.

Result: Experiments show that TurboPortrait3D outperforms current state-of-the-art methods for portrait synthesis both qualitatively and quantitatively.

Conclusion: TurboPortrait3D achieves high-quality, consistent portrait synthesis efficiently, addressing limitations of previous approaches and utilizing innovative training techniques.

Abstract: We introduce TurboPortrait3D: a method for low-latency novel-view synthesis
of human portraits. Our approach builds on the observation that existing
image-to-3D models for portrait generation, while capable of producing
renderable 3D representations, are prone to visual artifacts, often lack of
detail, and tend to fail at fully preserving the identity of the subject. On
the other hand, image diffusion models excel at generating high-quality images,
but besides being computationally expensive, are not grounded in 3D and thus
are not directly capable of producing multi-view consistent outputs. In this
work, we demonstrate that image-space diffusion models can be used to
significantly enhance the quality of existing image-to-avatar methods, while
maintaining 3D-awareness and running with low-latency. Our method takes a
single frontal image of a subject as input, and applies a feedforward
image-to-avatar generation pipeline to obtain an initial 3D representation and
corresponding noisy renders. These noisy renders are then fed to a single-step
diffusion model which is conditioned on input image(s), and is specifically
trained to refine the renders in a multi-view consistent way. Moreover, we
introduce a novel effective training strategy that includes pre-training on a
large corpus of synthetic multi-view data, followed by fine-tuning on
high-quality real images. We demonstrate that our approach both qualitatively
and quantitatively outperforms current state-of-the-art for portrait novel-view
synthesis, while being efficient in time.

*Xirui Jin,Renbiao Jin,Boying Li,Danping Zou,Wenxian Yu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces PlanarGS, an enhanced framework of 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), optimized specifically for reconstructing indoor scenes dominated by large low-texture regions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in reconstructing indoor scenes with ambiguous geometry and high-fidelity surfaces due to limitations of photometric losses in 3DGS.

Method: PlanarGS applies Language-Prompted Planar Priors (LP3) using pretrained segmentation models with cross-view fusion and geometric priors. It introduces two new optimization terms: planar prior supervision and geometric prior supervision for improved 3D reconstruction.

Result: The framework demonstrates superior performance in reconstructing detailed 3D surfaces across benchmark indoor environments, surpassing state-of-the-art techniques.

Conclusion: PlanarGS successfully tackles 3DGS's shortcomings in indoor environments, providing precise and high-quality 3D reconstructions, backed by thorough experimental validation.

Abstract: Three-dimensional Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has recently emerged as an
efficient representation for novel-view synthesis, achieving impressive visual
quality. However, in scenes dominated by large and low-texture regions, common
in indoor environments, the photometric loss used to optimize 3DGS yields
ambiguous geometry and fails to recover high-fidelity 3D surfaces. To overcome
this limitation, we introduce PlanarGS, a 3DGS-based framework tailored for
indoor scene reconstruction. Specifically, we design a pipeline for
Language-Prompted Planar Priors (LP3) that employs a pretrained vision-language
segmentation model and refines its region proposals via cross-view fusion and
inspection with geometric priors. 3D Gaussians in our framework are optimized
with two additional terms: a planar prior supervision term that enforces planar
consistency, and a geometric prior supervision term that steers the Gaussians
toward the depth and normal cues. We have conducted extensive experiments on
standard indoor benchmarks. The results show that PlanarGS reconstructs
accurate and detailed 3D surfaces, consistently outperforming state-of-the-art
methods by a large margin. Project page: https://planargs.github.io

*Diana Aldana,João Paulo Lima,Daniel Csillag,Daniel Perazzo,Haoan Feng,Luiz Velho,Tiago Novello*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces AIRe, an adaptive training method for implicit neural representations, reducing redundancy and improving signal modeling while balancing model size and reconstruction quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Selecting appropriate input frequencies and architectures while avoiding parameter redundancy in implicit neural representations often relies on heuristics and heavy hyperparameter optimization.

Method: AIRe employs an adaptive training scheme including targeted weight decay for neuron pruning and input frequency densification based on signal underfitting to optimize the network architecture during training.

Result: Experiments demonstrate that AIRe reduces model size while maintaining or improving the quality of reconstruction for images and signed distance fields (SDFs).

Conclusion: AIRe achieves an improved balance between network size and reconstruction quality, providing a more efficient method for implicit neural representations, with plans to publicly release code and pretrained models.

Abstract: Encoding input coordinates with sinusoidal functions into multilayer
perceptrons (MLPs) has proven effective for implicit neural representations
(INRs) of low-dimensional signals, enabling the modeling of high-frequency
details. However, selecting appropriate input frequencies and architectures
while managing parameter redundancy remains an open challenge, often addressed
through heuristics and heavy hyperparameter optimization schemes. In this
paper, we introduce AIRe ($\textbf{A}$daptive $\textbf{I}$mplicit neural
$\textbf{Re}$presentation), an adaptive training scheme that refines the INR
architecture over the course of optimization. Our method uses a neuron pruning
mechanism to avoid redundancy and input frequency densification to improve
representation capacity, leading to an improved trade-off between network size
and reconstruction quality. For pruning, we first identify less-contributory
neurons and apply a targeted weight decay to transfer their information to the
remaining neurons, followed by structured pruning. Next, the densification
stage adds input frequencies to spectrum regions where the signal underfits,
expanding the representational basis. Through experiments on images and SDFs,
we show that AIRe reduces model size while preserving, or even improving,
reconstruction quality. Code and pretrained models will be released for public
use.

*Alejandro Escontrela,Shrinu Kushagra,Sjoerd van Steenkiste,Yulia Rubanova,Aleksander Holynski,Kelsey Allen,Kevin Murphy,Thomas Kipf*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Neural Universal Scene Descriptor (Neural USD) for precise object editing in generative modeling, inspired by the USD standard from computer graphics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current generative methods struggle with precise, iterative editing of objects within a generated scene, as changes to conditioning signals often result in unintended global alterations.

Method: The authors develop Neural USD, a framework that represents scenes and objects hierarchically for per-object control, and include a fine-tuning approach to disentangle control signals.

Result: The framework is shown to support iterative and incremental scene editing while maintaining control over specific object attributes like appearance, geometry, and pose.

Conclusion: Neural USD addresses challenges in controllable generative modeling by providing enhanced object-specific editing capabilities, advancing workflows for precise and structured scene manipulation.

Abstract: Amazing progress has been made in controllable generative modeling,
especially over the last few years. However, some challenges remain. One of
them is precise and iterative object editing. In many of the current methods,
trying to edit the generated image (for example, changing the color of a
particular object in the scene or changing the background while keeping other
elements unchanged) by changing the conditioning signals often leads to
unintended global changes in the scene. In this work, we take the first steps
to address the above challenges. Taking inspiration from the Universal Scene
Descriptor (USD) standard developed in the computer graphics community, we
introduce the "Neural Universal Scene Descriptor" or Neural USD. In this
framework, we represent scenes and objects in a structured, hierarchical
manner. This accommodates diverse signals, minimizes model-specific
constraints, and enables per-object control over appearance, geometry, and
pose. We further apply a fine-tuning approach which ensures that the above
control signals are disentangled from one another. We evaluate several design
considerations for our framework, demonstrating how Neural USD enables
iterative and incremental workflows. More information at:

*Peiyang Xu,Minzhou Pan,Zhaorun Chen,Shuang Yang,Chaowei Xiao,Bo Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SafeVision, a novel image guardrail system, tackles traditional limitations by integrating human-like reasoning, a customized loss function, and dynamic policy alignment to enhance safety against digital threats, outperforming benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the increasing need for efficient safeguards against unsafe digital content as traditional models falter due to rigidity and lack of adaptability to new threats.

Method: SafeVision employs human-like semantic reasoning, an innovative data collection framework, policy-oriented training, customized loss functions, and QA strategies for dynamic safety assessments without retraining.

Result: Experiments show SafeVision's superior performance, outperforming GPT-4o by 8.6% on VisionHarm-T and 15.5% on VisionHarm-C, and achieving over 16x speed improvement.

Conclusion: SafeVision establishes a robust, transparent, and adaptive system that sets new benchmarks in explaining and mitigating unsafe digital content effectively.

Abstract: With the rapid proliferation of digital media, the need for efficient and
transparent safeguards against unsafe content is more critical than ever.
Traditional image guardrail models, constrained by predefined categories, often
misclassify content due to their pure feature-based learning without semantic
reasoning. Moreover, these models struggle to adapt to emerging threats,
requiring costly retraining for new threats. To address these limitations, we
introduce SafeVision, a novel image guardrail that integrates human-like
reasoning to enhance adaptability and transparency. Our approach incorporates
an effective data collection and generation framework, a policy-following
training pipeline, and a customized loss function. We also propose a diverse QA
generation and training strategy to enhance learning effectiveness. SafeVision
dynamically aligns with evolving safety policies at inference time, eliminating
the need for retraining while ensuring precise risk assessments and
explanations. Recognizing the limitations of existing unsafe image benchmarks,
which either lack granularity or cover limited risks, we introduce VisionHarm,
a high-quality dataset comprising two subsets: VisionHarm Third-party
(VisionHarm-T) and VisionHarm Comprehensive(VisionHarm-C), spanning diverse
harmful categories. Through extensive experiments, we show that SafeVision
achieves state-of-the-art performance on different benchmarks. SafeVision
outperforms GPT-4o by 8.6% on VisionHarm-T and by 15.5% on VisionHarm-C, while
being over 16x faster. SafeVision sets a comprehensive, policy-following, and
explainable image guardrail with dynamic adaptation to emerging threats.

*Andriy Myronenko,Dong Yang,Baris Turkbey,Mariam Aboian,Sena Azamat,Esra Akcicek,Hongxu Yin,Pavlo Molchanov,Marc Edgar,Yufan He,Pengfei Guo,Yucheng Tang,Daguang Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a framework enhancing medical image analysis via Chain-of-Thought reasoning for improved interpretability and auditability in chest X-ray interpretation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The lack of transparent reasoning in vision-language models for medical image analysis hinders their adoption by clinicians who rely on stepwise, reasoning-driven workflows.

Method: The model combines visual encoding with a two-stage training: reasoning-oriented supervised fine-tuning (SFT), followed by reinforcement learning (RL) aimed at improving reasoning quality and interpretability.

Result: The approach achieves competitive accuracy in multi-label classification and improves interpretability. Expert radiologists found reasoning traces beneficial for confidence, auditing, and time-saving in diagnostic workflows.

Conclusion: The framework advances explainable AI by providing reasoning-driven interpretations supporting clinical trustworthiness in chest X-ray and broader medical imaging applications.

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have shown strong promise for medical image
analysis, but most remain opaque, offering predictions without the transparent,
stepwise reasoning clinicians rely on. We present a framework that brings
chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning to chest X-ray interpretation. Inspired by
reasoning-first training paradigms, our approach is designed to learn how
experts reason, not just what they conclude, by aligning intermediate steps
with observable image evidence and radiology workflow. Beyond accuracy, the
explicit reasoning traces support clinical auditability: they reveal why a
conclusion was reached, which alternatives were considered, and where
uncertainty remains, enabling quality assurance, error analysis, and safer
human-AI collaboration.
  Our model couples high-fidelity visual encoding with a two-stage training
recipe: a reasoning-style supervised fine-tuning (SFT) followed by
reinforcement learning (RL) that uses verifiable rewards over a list of X-ray
abnormalities. The model outputs reasoning that mirrors radiologists systematic
thought process, uncertainty, and differential diagnosis. In
out-of-distribution evaluation, the approach achieves competitive multi-label
classification while improving interpretability. In a reader study with expert
radiologists, full reasoning traces increased confidence, supported error
auditing, and reduced time to finalize reports. We release code and the model
NV-Reason-CXR-3B to support community progress toward trustworthy, explainable
AI in chest radiography and other medical imaging tasks where reasoning quality
is as critical as prediction quality.

Motivation: To address the inefficiency and quality degradation in existing methods for arbitrary-scale super-resolution using recurrent neural networks.

Method: Proposes a novel approach to jointly predict multiple Fourier components, reducing dependence on independent prediction.

Result: Improved quality and efficiency in arbitrary-scale super-resolution tasks compared to prior methods.

Conclusion: Joint prediction of multiple components effectively enhances performance, balancing costs and quality in super-resolution.

Abstract: Cost-and-Quality (CQ) controllability in arbitrary-scale super-resolution is
crucial. Existing methods predict Fourier components one by one using a
recurrent neural network. However, this approach leads to performance
degradation and inefficiency due to independent prediction. This paper proposes
predicting multiple components jointly to improve both quality and efficiency.

TL;DR: The paper introduces TeleEgo, a benchmark for evaluating egocentric AI assistants in realistic streaming scenarios with multi-modal data and long-term memory.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks for egocentric AI assistants fail to evaluate abilities such as real-time responsiveness or long-term memory in realistic multi-modal streaming scenarios.

Method: TeleEgo is a benchmark based on 14+ hours of synchronized egocentric video, audio, and text data per participant across diverse activities. It includes diagnostic tasks across Memory, Understanding, and Cross-Memory Reasoning, with human-verified QA items and new metrics like Real-Time Accuracy and Memory Persistence Time.

Result: The benchmark introduces a comprehensive framework to test egocentric AI assistants using realistic, omni-modal streaming data and robust evaluation metrics.

Conclusion: TeleEgo is a step forward in providing a realistic and rigorous evaluation environment for the development of practical egocentric AI assistants.

Abstract: Egocentric AI assistants in real-world settings must process multi-modal
inputs (video, audio, text), respond in real time, and retain evolving
long-term memory. However, existing benchmarks typically evaluate these
abilities in isolation, lack realistic streaming scenarios, or support only
short-term tasks. We introduce \textbf{TeleEgo}, a long-duration, streaming,
omni-modal benchmark for evaluating egocentric AI assistants in realistic daily
contexts. The dataset features over 14 hours per participant of synchronized
egocentric video, audio, and text across four domains: work \& study, lifestyle
\& routines, social activities, and outings \& culture. All data is aligned on
a unified global timeline and includes high-quality visual narrations and
speech transcripts, curated through human refinement.TeleEgo defines 12
diagnostic subtasks across three core capabilities: Memory (recalling past
events), Understanding (interpreting the current moment), and Cross-Memory
Reasoning (linking distant events). It contains 3,291 human-verified QA items
spanning multiple question formats (single-choice, binary, multi-choice, and
open-ended), evaluated strictly in a streaming setting. We propose two key
metrics -- Real-Time Accuracy and Memory Persistence Time -- to jointly assess
correctness, temporal responsiveness, and long-term retention. TeleEgo provides
a realistic and comprehensive evaluation to advance the development of
practical AI assistants.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of robustness in deep learning models for DR detection, caused by distributional variations from different imaging devices, demographics, and conditions.

Method: The proposed method, AdvBlur, incorporates adversarial blurred images into the dataset and utilizes a dual-loss function framework to enhance domain generalization and reduce performance drop in unseen datasets.

Result: The method shows competitive performance compared to existing domain generalization approaches, as validated through comprehensive cross-dataset evaluations and ablation studies.

Conclusion: AdvBlur enhances robustness in DR detection models, effectively addressing domain generalization challenges and ensuring high performance across unseen datasets.

Abstract: Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is a leading cause of vision loss worldwide, yet
early and accurate detection can significantly improve treatment outcomes.
While numerous Deep learning (DL) models have been developed to predict DR from
fundus images, many face challenges in maintaining robustness due to
distributional variations caused by differences in acquisition devices,
demographic disparities, and imaging conditions. This paper addresses this
critical limitation by proposing a novel DR classification approach, a method
called AdvBlur. Our method integrates adversarial blurred images into the
dataset and employs a dual-loss function framework to address domain
generalization. This approach effectively mitigates the impact of unseen
distributional variations, as evidenced by comprehensive evaluations across
multiple datasets. Additionally, we conduct extensive experiments to explore
the effects of factors such as camera type, low-quality images, and dataset
size. Furthermore, we perform ablation studies on blurred images and the loss
function to ensure the validity of our choices. The experimental results
demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method, achieving competitive
performance compared to state-of-the-art domain generalization DR models on
unseen external datasets.

Result: An ensemble of top deep learning algorithms performed better than individual models, with 3D U-Net dominating and post-processing steps being crucial.

Conclusion: SEG.A challenge sets a new benchmark and serves as a resource for improving clinical translation of AVT analysis tools.

Abstract: The automated analysis of the aortic vessel tree (AVT) from computed

development has been impeded by a lack of shared, high-quality data. We
launched the SEG.A. challenge to catalyze progress in this field by introducing
a large, publicly available, multi-institutional dataset for AVT segmentation.
The challenge benchmarked automated algorithms on a hidden test set, with
subsequent optional tasks in surface meshing for computational simulations. Our
findings reveal a clear convergence on deep learning methodologies, with 3D
U-Net architectures dominating the top submissions. A key result was that an
ensemble of the highest-ranking algorithms significantly outperformed
individual models, highlighting the benefits of model fusion. Performance was
strongly linked to algorithmic design, particularly the use of customized

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing foundation models excel in specialized domains, but Mars science lags due to the lack of standardized benchmarks for systematic evaluation.

Method: Mars-Bench provides 20 datasets for tasks like classification, segmentation, and object detection, using pre-trained models on Earth and Mars-related imagery.

Result: Baseline evaluations suggest Mars-specific foundation models outperform general-domain ones, encouraging domain-adapted pre-training.

Conclusion: Mars-Bench supports the advancement of machine learning models for Mars science with standardized data and evaluations, enabling comparative progress.

Abstract: Foundation models have enabled rapid progress across many specialized domains
by leveraging large-scale pre-training on unlabeled data, demonstrating strong
generalization to a variety of downstream tasks. While such models have gained
significant attention in fields like Earth Observation, their application to
Mars science remains limited. A key enabler of progress in other domains has
been the availability of standardized benchmarks that support systematic
evaluation. In contrast, Mars science lacks such benchmarks and standardized
evaluation frameworks, which have limited progress toward developing foundation
models for Martian tasks. To address this gap, we introduce Mars-Bench, the
first benchmark designed to systematically evaluate models across a broad range
of Mars-related tasks using both orbital and surface imagery. Mars-Bench
comprises 20 datasets spanning classification, segmentation, and object
detection, focused on key geologic features such as craters, cones, boulders,
and frost. We provide standardized, ready-to-use datasets and baseline
evaluations using models pre-trained on natural images, Earth satellite data,
and state-of-the-art vision-language models. Results from all analyses suggest
that Mars-specific foundation models may offer advantages over general-domain
counterparts, motivating further exploration of domain-adapted pre-training.
Mars-Bench aims to establish a standardized foundation for developing and
comparing machine learning models for Mars science. Our data, models, and code

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address vulnerabilities in text-to-image models caused by adversarial prompts and overcome limitations of current red-teaming methods that require white-box access and generate easily filterable gibberish prompts.

Method: The proposed method, APT, uses a black-box framework leveraging large language models (LLMs) to create adversarial suffixes for prompts. It includes alternating optimization-finetuning and a dual-evasion strategy focusing on generating readable adversarial prompts resistant to perplexity-based and blacklist word filters.

Result: APT successfully generates human-readable, filter-resistant adversarial prompts capable of bypassing safety filters. It achieves superior zero-shot transferability, effectively exposing vulnerabilities in unseen prompts and commercial APIs like Leonardo.Ai.

Conclusion: APT provides an advanced and efficient method for red-teaming T2I models by generating human-readable adversarial prompts, bypassing existing filters, and showcasing T2I model vulnerabilities even in commercial systems.

Abstract: Despite rapid advancements in text-to-image (T2I) models, their safety
mechanisms are vulnerable to adversarial prompts, which maliciously generate
unsafe images. Current red-teaming methods for proactively assessing such
vulnerabilities usually require white-box access to T2I models, and rely on
inefficient per-prompt optimization, as well as inevitably generate
semantically meaningless prompts easily blocked by filters. In this paper, we
propose APT (AutoPrompT), a black-box framework that leverages large language
models (LLMs) to automatically generate human-readable adversarial suffixes for
benign prompts. We first introduce an alternating optimization-finetuning
pipeline between adversarial suffix optimization and fine-tuning the LLM
utilizing the optimized suffix. Furthermore, we integrates a dual-evasion
strategy in optimization phase, enabling the bypass of both perplexity-based
filter and blacklist word filter: (1) we constrain the LLM generating
human-readable prompts through an auxiliary LLM perplexity scoring, which
starkly contrasts with prior token-level gibberish, and (2) we also introduce
banned-token penalties to suppress the explicit generation of banned-tokens in
blacklist. Extensive experiments demonstrate the excellent red-teaming
performance of our human-readable, filter-resistant adversarial prompts, as
well as superior zero-shot transferability which enables instant adaptation to
unseen prompts and exposes critical vulnerabilities even in commercial APIs
(e.g., Leonardo.Ai.).

Motivation: To overcome the vanishing gradient problem which hinders training very deep CNNs.

Method: Residual Networks (ResNet) with skip connections to facilitate gradient flow and improve training stability.

Conclusion: ResNet significantly improves performance, stability, and scalability in training deep networks compared to traditional CNNs.

Abstract: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) has revolutionized computer vision, but

accuracy compared to 84.1% for a traditional deep CNN of similar depth, while

*Shufan Shen,Junshu Sun,Shuhui Wang,Qingming Huang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces SNELLA, a one-stage PEFT method optimizing memory usage and performance for pre-trained vision models with sparse updates and adaptive sparsity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional sparse tuning in parameter-efficient fine-tuning suffers from high memory usage and limited performance due to two-stage paradigms.

Method: SNELLA uses a sparse matrix approach combined with low-rank learnable matrices and a non-linear kernel function to increase rank, paired with adaptive sparsity allocation for better task-relevant weight identification.

Result: SNELLA demonstrated superior performance across various tasks, achieving SOTA results with lower memory usage. It improved top-1 accuracy by 1.8% and reduced memory by up to 39.9%.

Conclusion: SNELLA effectively addresses memory and performance limitations in PEFT, offering a scalable solution for various pre-trained models and downstream tasks.

Abstract: Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) aims to adapt pre-trained vision
models to downstream tasks. Among PEFT paradigms, sparse tuning achieves
remarkable performance by adjusting only the weights most relevant to
downstream tasks, rather than densely tuning the entire weight matrix. Current
methods follow a two-stage paradigm. First, it locates task-relevant weights by
gradient information, which overlooks the parameter adjustments during
fine-tuning and limits the performance. Second, it updates only the located
weights by applying a sparse mask to the gradient of the weight matrix, which
results in high memory usage due to the storage of all weight matrices in the
optimizer. In this paper, we propose a one-stage method named SNELLA to
overcome the above limitations. For memory usage, SNELLA selectively updates
the weight matrix by adding it to another sparse matrix that is merged by two
low-rank learnable matrices. We extend the low-rank decomposition by
introducing nonlinear kernel functions, thereby increasing the rank of the
resulting merged matrix to prevent the interdependency among weight updates,
enabling better adaptation to downstream tasks. For locating task-relevant
weights, we propose an adaptive bi-level sparsity allocation mechanism that
encourages weights to compete across and inside layers based on their
importance scores in an end-to-end manner. Extensive experiments are conducted
on classification, segmentation, and generation tasks using different
pre-trained vision models. The results show that SNELLA achieves SOTA
performance with low memory usage. Notably, SNELLA obtains 1.8% (91.9% v.s.
90.1%) higher Top-1 accuracy on the FGVC benchmark compared to SPT-LoRA.
Compared to previous methods, SNELLA achieves a memory reduction of 31.1%-39.9%
across models with parameter scales from 86M to 632M. Our source codes are

### [159] [Enhancing CLIP Robustness via Cross-Modality Alignment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24038)
*Xingyu Zhu,Beier Zhu,Shuo Wang,Kesen Zhao,Hanwang Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Vision-language models like CLIP are strong at zero-shot classification but are susceptible to adversarial attacks. COLA, a framework using optimal transport, improves cross-modality alignment to address this issue.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper highlights the vulnerability of vision-language models like CLIP to adversarial perturbations and identifies a critical feature misalignment between text and image representations in these models.

Method: The COLA framework restores global and local feature alignment under adversarial conditions using subspace projection and optimal transport across augmented views. It filters non-semantic distortions and refines cross-modality alignment.

Result: COLA improved adversarial robustness across benchmarks, achieving a 6.7% increase in accuracy on ImageNet variants under adversarial attacks while retaining high accuracy on clean samples.

Conclusion: This training-free and adaptable approach successfully mitigates the feature misalignment issue, enhancing the performance and stability of existing VLMs against adversarial perturbations.

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) such as CLIP demonstrate strong generalization
in zero-shot classification but remain highly vulnerable to adversarial
perturbations. Existing methods primarily focus on adversarial fine-tuning or
prompt optimization; they often overlook the gaps in CLIP's encoded features,
which is shown as the text and image features lie far apart from each other.
This misalignment is significantly amplified under adversarial perturbations,
leading to severe degradation in classification performance. To address this
problem, we propose Cross-modality Alignment, dubbed COLA, an optimal
transport-based framework that explicitly addresses adversarial misalignment by
restoring both global image-text alignment and local structural consistency in
the feature space. (1) COLA first projects adversarial image embeddings onto a
subspace spanned by class text features, effectively filtering out non-semantic
distortions while preserving discriminative information. (2) It then models
images and texts as discrete distributions over multiple augmented views and
refines their alignment via OT, with the subspace projection seamlessly
integrated into the cost computation. This design ensures stable cross-modal
alignment even under adversarial conditions. COLA is training-free and
compatible with existing fine-tuned models. Extensive evaluations across 14
zero-shot classification benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of COLA,
especially with an average improvement of 6.7% on ImageNet and its variants
under PGD adversarial attacks, while maintaining high accuracy on clean
samples.

*William Yang,Xindi Wu,Zhiwei Deng,Esin Tureci,Olga Russakovsky*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces BOB (BeyondOBjects), a fine-tuning strategy that enhances text-to-image models for generating synthetic data for low-shot fine-grained classification tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges in generating effective synthetic training data for fine-grained classification using text-to-image models, while resolving issues of overfitting and reduced diversity.

Method: The authors propose BOB, a strategy that extracts class-agnostic attributes (e.g., background, pose) from few real examples, explicitly conditions T2I model fine-tuning on these attributes, and marginalizes them out during generation to maintain diversity and accuracy.

Result: Experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art results, with BOB improving classification performance significantly (e.g., +7.4% on Aircraft dataset over prior methods). It outperforms alternative methods in 18 out of 24 experimental setups.

Conclusion: BOB effectively mitigates overfitting, preserves generative priors, and achieves improved performance in low-shot fine-grained classification tasks using synthetic data.

Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) models are increasingly used for synthetic dataset
generation, but generating effective synthetic training data for classification
remains challenging. Fine-tuning a T2I model with a few real examples can help
improve the quality of synthetic training data; however, it may also cause
overfitting and reduce diversity in the generated samples. We propose a
fine-tuning strategy BOB (BeyondOBjects) to mitigate these concerns for
fine-grained classification. Given a small set of real examples, we first
extract class-agnostic attributes such as scene background and object pose. We
then explicitly condition on these attributes during fine-tuning of the T2I
model and marginalize them out during generation. This design mitigates
overfitting, preserves the T2I model's generative prior, reduces estimation
errors, and further minimizes unintended inter-class associations. Extensive
experiments across multiple T2I models, backbones, and datasets show that our
method achieves state-of-the-art performance in low-shot fine-grained
classification when augmented with synthetic data. Concretely, BOB outperforms
DataDream by 7.4% on the Aircraft dataset (from 50.0% to 57.4% when fine-tuning
a CLIP classifier with five real images augmented with 100 synthetic images).
In three of the four benchmarks, fine-tuning downstream models with 5 real
images augmented with BOB achieves better performance than fine-tuning with 10
real images. Collectively, BOB outperforms prior art in 18 of 24 experimental
settings, with 2+% accuracy improvements in 14 of these settings.

*Agus Gunawan,Samuel Teodoro,Yun Chen,Soo Ye Kim,Jihyong Oh,Munchurl Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: OmniText is a training-free framework for general Text Image Manipulation (TIM) tasks, addressing text removal, style control, and duplicated letters generation issues. It achieves superior performance and introduces a benchmark dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome limitations in current text inpainting techniques: inability to remove text, lack of style control, and duplicated letter generation.

Method: Investigates cross- and self-attention mechanisms for text removal and style control. Introduces novel loss functions in latent optimization for improved accuracy and customization. Presents OmniText-Bench dataset to benchmark TIM tasks.

Result: OmniText outperforms other inpainting approaches, achieving state-of-the-art TIM performance and comparable results to specialist methods.

Conclusion: OmniText demonstrates its utility as the first generalist method for diverse TIM tasks, offering robust text removal, improved style control, and high accuracy in text inpainting applications.

Abstract: Recent advancements in diffusion-based text synthesis have demonstrated
significant performance in inserting and editing text within images via
inpainting. However, despite the potential of text inpainting methods, three
key limitations hinder their applicability to broader Text Image Manipulation
(TIM) tasks: (i) the inability to remove text, (ii) the lack of control over
the style of rendered text, and (iii) a tendency to generate duplicated
letters. To address these challenges, we propose OmniText, a training-free
generalist capable of performing a wide range of TIM tasks. Specifically, we
investigate two key properties of cross- and self-attention mechanisms to
enable text removal and to provide control over both text styles and content.
Our findings reveal that text removal can be achieved by applying
self-attention inversion, which mitigates the model's tendency to focus on
surrounding text, thus reducing text hallucinations. Additionally, we
redistribute cross-attention, as increasing the probability of certain text
tokens reduces text hallucination. For controllable inpainting, we introduce
novel loss functions in a latent optimization framework: a cross-attention
content loss to improve text rendering accuracy and a self-attention style loss
to facilitate style customization. Furthermore, we present OmniText-Bench, a
benchmark dataset for evaluating diverse TIM tasks. It includes input images,
target text with masks, and style references, covering diverse applications
such as text removal, rescaling, repositioning, and insertion and editing with
various styles. Our OmniText framework is the first generalist method capable
of performing diverse TIM tasks. It achieves state-of-the-art performance
across multiple tasks and metrics compared to other text inpainting methods and
is comparable with specialist methods.

### [162] [Enhancing Pre-trained Representation Classifiability can Boost its Interpretability](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24105)
*Shufan Shen,Zhaobo Qi,Junshu Sun,Qingming Huang,Qi Tian,Shuhui Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces the Inherent Interpretability Score (IIS) to evaluate the interpretability of pre-trained visual representations, revealing a positive correlation between interpretability and classifiability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the unclear relationship between representation interpretability and classifiability in pre-trained visual models and propose a reliable evaluation metric.

Method: The paper quantifies interpretability through the correlation of representation with interpretable semantics and develops the IIS to measure information loss and interpretability.

Result: The study reveals a positive correlation between representational interpretability and classifiability, demonstrating that higher classifiability results in more interpretable semantics captured.

Conclusion: Improving interpretability and classifiability can be unified in pre-trained vision models, enabling fine-tuning to enhance both metrics. This facilitates better informed predictions with minimal accuracy loss.

Abstract: The visual representation of a pre-trained model prioritizes the
classifiability on downstream tasks, while the widespread applications for
pre-trained visual models have posed new requirements for representation
interpretability. However, it remains unclear whether the pre-trained
representations can achieve high interpretability and classifiability
simultaneously. To answer this question, we quantify the representation
interpretability by leveraging its correlation with the ratio of interpretable
semantics within the representations. Given the pre-trained representations,
only the interpretable semantics can be captured by interpretations, whereas
the uninterpretable part leads to information loss. Based on this fact, we
propose the Inherent Interpretability Score (IIS) that evaluates the
information loss, measures the ratio of interpretable semantics, and quantifies
the representation interpretability. In the evaluation of the representation
interpretability with different classifiability, we surprisingly discover that
the interpretability and classifiability are positively correlated, i.e.,
representations with higher classifiability provide more interpretable
semantics that can be captured in the interpretations. This observation further
supports two benefits to the pre-trained representations. First, the
classifiability of representations can be further improved by fine-tuning with
interpretability maximization. Second, with the classifiability improvement for
the representations, we obtain predictions based on their interpretations with
less accuracy degradation. The discovered positive correlation and
corresponding applications show that practitioners can unify the improvements
in interpretability and classifiability for pre-trained vision models. Codes

*Fengming Yu,Haiwei Pan,Kejia Zhang,Jian Guan,Haiying Jiang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Unified Heterogeneous Knowledge Distillation (UHKD) introduces a framework to improve knowledge transfer between teacher and student models with different architectures, using frequency-domain intermediate features.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenges posed by architectural differences in knowledge distillation scenarios, particularly the semantic discrepancies in intermediate feature representations.

Method: Employ Fourier transform for global feature capture, utilize a Feature Transformation Module for compact teacher representations, and a Feature Alignment Module for aligning student features in the frequency domain, combined with a joint loss function.

Result: Experiments on CIFAR-100 and ImageNet-1K showcase 5.59% and 0.83% performance improvements compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: UHKD demonstrates effective handling of heterogeneous feature representations, enabling enhanced distillation and utilization of visual knowledge in diverse architectures.

Abstract: Knowledge distillation (KD) is an effective model compression technique that
transfers knowledge from a high-performance teacher to a lightweight student,
reducing cost while maintaining accuracy. In visual applications, where
large-scale image models are widely used, KD enables efficient deployment.
However, architectural diversity introduces semantic discrepancies that hinder
the use of intermediate representations. Most existing KD methods are designed
for homogeneous models and degrade in heterogeneous scenarios, especially when
intermediate features are involved. Prior studies mainly focus on the logits
space, making limited use of the semantic information in intermediate layers.
To address this limitation, Unified Heterogeneous Knowledge Distillation (UHKD)
is proposed as a framework that leverages intermediate features in the
frequency domain for cross-architecture transfer. Fourier transform is applied
to capture global feature information, alleviating representational
discrepancies between heterogeneous teacher-student pairs. A Feature
Transformation Module (FTM) produces compact frequency-domain representations
of teacher features, while a learnable Feature Alignment Module (FAM) projects
student features and aligns them via multi-level matching. Training is guided
by a joint objective combining mean squared error on intermediate features with
Kullback-Leibler divergence on logits. Experiments on CIFAR-100 and ImageNet-1K
demonstrate gains of 5.59% and 0.83% over the latest method, highlighting UHKD
as an effective approach for unifying heterogeneous representations and
enabling efficient utilization of visual knowledge

Motivation: Existing dog motion datasets suffer from limited scale, lack of multi-view options, and absence of real 3D data.

Method: The authors propose a three-stage optimization pipeline to refine motion recovery using SMAL model fitting.

Result: DogMo includes 1.2k motion sequences from 10 dogs, enabling systematic evaluation across several benchmark settings.

Conclusion: By addressing major limitations in dog motion recovery datasets, DogMo advances research potential in motion recovery and animal behavior modeling.

Abstract: We present DogMo, a large-scale multi-view RGB-D video dataset capturing
diverse canine movements for the task of motion recovery from images. DogMo
comprises 1.2k motion sequences collected from 10 unique dogs, offering rich
variation in both motion and breed. It addresses key limitations of existing
dog motion datasets, including the lack of multi-view and real 3D data, as well
as limited scale and diversity. Leveraging DogMo, we establish four motion
recovery benchmark settings that support systematic evaluation across monocular
and multi-view, RGB and RGB-D inputs. To facilitate accurate motion recovery,
we further introduce a three-stage, instance-specific optimization pipeline
that fits the SMAL model to the motion sequences. Our method progressively
refines body shape and pose through coarse alignment, dense correspondence
supervision, and temporal regularization. Our dataset and method provide a
principled foundation for advancing research in dog motion recovery and open up
new directions at the intersection of computer vision, computer graphics, and
animal behavior modeling.

*Jiajian Xie,Hubery Yin,Chen Li,Zhou Zhao,Shengyu Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Error-aware Trend Consistency (ETC) framework to accelerate diffusion models' sampling process while preserving generative quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current diffusion models deliver high generative quality but suffer from slow iterative sampling. Existing acceleration methods fail to account for denoising trends and model-specific errors, leading to inconsistent results.

Method: ETC employs a trend predictor that projects historical denoising patterns for consistent acceleration and introduces an error tolerance search mechanism to stabilize trajectories during multi-step reuse.

Result: Experiments reveal that ETC achieves 2.65x acceleration compared to FLUX with minimal quality loss (-0.074 SSIM score).

Conclusion: ETC successfully addresses sampling inefficiencies by maintaining consistency and quality during accelerated generation, pushing diffusion models closer to practical applicability.

Abstract: Diffusion models have achieved remarkable generative quality but remain
bottlenecked by costly iterative sampling. Recent training-free methods
accelerate diffusion process by reusing model outputs. However, these methods
ignore denoising trends and lack error control for model-specific tolerance,
leading to trajectory deviations under multi-step reuse and exacerbating
inconsistencies in the generated results. To address these issues, we introduce
Error-aware Trend Consistency (ETC), a framework that (1) introduces a
consistent trend predictor that leverages the smooth continuity of diffusion
trajectories, projecting historical denoising patterns into stable future
directions and progressively distributing them across multiple approximation
steps to achieve acceleration without deviating; (2) proposes a model-specific
error tolerance search mechanism that derives corrective thresholds by
identifying transition points from volatile semantic planning to stable quality
refinement. Experiments show that ETC achieves a 2.65x acceleration over FLUX
with negligible (-0.074 SSIM score) degradation of consistency.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current text-to-image models exhibit challenges with compositional fidelity, such as rendering accurate object counts, attributes, and spatial relations.

Method: Utilizes large language models (LLMs) for generating layouts based on prompts and employs object-centric VLMs to iteratively refine and rank image candidates for prompt alignment.

Result: The proposed framework improves scene alignment to input prompts, surpassing the fidelity of existing text-to-image models.

Conclusion: Explicit layout-grounding paired with self-refinement enhances compositionality and prompt adherence in text-to-image generation, achieving better performance without additional training.

Abstract: Despite their impressive realism, modern text-to-image models still struggle
with compositionality, often failing to render accurate object counts,
attributes, and spatial relations. To address this challenge, we present a
training-free framework that combines an object-centric approach with
self-refinement to improve layout faithfulness while preserving aesthetic
quality. Specifically, we leverage large language models (LLMs) to synthesize
explicit layouts from input prompts, and we inject these layouts into the image
generation process, where a object-centric vision-language model (VLM) judge
reranks multiple candidates to select the most prompt-aligned outcome
iteratively. By unifying explicit layout-grounding with self-refine-based
inference-time scaling, our framework achieves stronger scene alignment with
prompts compared to recent text-to-image models. The code are available at

Motivation: Evaluate and improve Vision-Language Models on safety-critical aspects of autonomous driving tasks, including perception, prediction, planning, and corruption detection.

Method: Developed a systematic framework with four components: Mixture-of-Prompts router, task-specific prompts, visual assembly module, and inference parameter optimization, implemented on the Qwen2.5-VL-72B model.

Result: Achieved 70.87% accuracy on clean data and 72.85% on corrupted data in the RoboSense Challenge, highlighting improved VLM performance for autonomous driving.

Abstract: This technical report presents our solution for the RoboSense Challenge at
IROS 2025, which evaluates Vision-Language Models (VLMs) on autonomous driving
scene understanding across perception, prediction, planning, and corruption
detection tasks. We propose a systematic framework built on four core
components. First, a Mixture-of-Prompts router classifies questions and
dispatches them to task-specific expert prompts, eliminating interference
across diverse question types. Second, task-specific prompts embed explicit
coordinate systems, spatial reasoning rules, role-playing,
Chain-of-Thought/Tree-of-Thought reasoning, and few-shot examples tailored to
each task. Third, a visual assembly module composes multi-view images with
object crops, magenta markers, and adaptive historical frames based on question
requirements. Fourth, we configure model inference parameters (temperature,
top-p, message roles) per task to optimize output quality. Implemented on
Qwen2.5-VL-72B, our approach achieves 70.87% average accuracy on Phase-1 (clean
data) and 72.85% on Phase-2 (corrupted data), demonstrating that structured
prompting and spatial grounding substantially enhance VLM performance on

TL;DR: The paper introduces UAP-SAM2, the first framework for crafting universal adversarial attacks targeting SAM's successor, SAM2, in video segmentation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate the unexplored robustness of SAM2 and determine whether adversarial attacks on SAM can be effectively applied to SAM2.

Method: The authors address challenges in attacking SAM2 through a new framework: UAP-SAM2, which uses a target-scanning strategy and dual semantic deviation. These techniques optimize adversarial attacks by reducing prompt dependency and disrupting semantic consistency across video frames.

Result: Extensive experiments show UAP-SAM2 achieves substantial performance improvements over state-of-the-art adversarial attacks across various datasets and segmentation tasks.

Conclusion: UAP-SAM2 enhances attack transferability and effectiveness for SAM2, solving architectural attack challenges for video segmentation foundation models.

Abstract: Recent studies reveal the vulnerability of the image segmentation foundation
model SAM to adversarial examples. Its successor, SAM2, has attracted
significant attention due to its strong generalization capability in video
segmentation. However, its robustness remains unexplored, and it is unclear
whether existing attacks on SAM can be directly transferred to SAM2. In this
paper, we first analyze the performance gap of existing attacks between SAM and
SAM2 and highlight two key challenges arising from their architectural
differences: directional guidance from the prompt and semantic entanglement
across consecutive frames. To address these issues, we propose UAP-SAM2, the
first cross-prompt universal adversarial attack against SAM2 driven by dual
semantic deviation. For cross-prompt transferability, we begin by designing a
target-scanning strategy that divides each frame into k regions, each randomly
assigned a prompt, to reduce prompt dependency during optimization. For
effectiveness, we design a dual semantic deviation framework that optimizes a
UAP by distorting the semantics within the current frame and disrupting the
semantic consistency across consecutive frames. Extensive experiments on six
datasets across two segmentation tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of the
proposed method for SAM2. The comparative results show that UAP-SAM2
significantly outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) attacks by a large margin.

Conclusion: CLFSeg ensures improved medical diagnostic performance with computational efficiency, making it a promising tool for real-world applications in polyp and cardiac segmentation.

Abstract: Accurate polyp and cardiac segmentation for early detection and treatment is
essential for the diagnosis and treatment planning of cancer-like diseases.
Traditional convolutional neural network (CNN) based models have represented

which affects the segmentation performance. To solve these problems, this paper
introduces CLFSeg, an encoder-decoder based framework that aggregates the

boundary regions, ensuring computing efficiency. In order to handle class
imbalance problem while focusing on the areas of interest with tiny and
boundary regions, binary cross-entropy (BCE) with dice loss is incorporated.
Our proposed model exhibits exceptional performance on four publicly available
datasets, including CVC-ColonDB, CVC-ClinicDB, EtisLaribPolypDB, and ACDC.
Extensive experiments and visual studies show CLFSeg surpasses the existing
SOTA performance and focuses on relevant regions of interest in anatomical
structures. The proposed CLFSeg improves performance while ensuring computing
efficiency, which makes it a potential solution for real-world medical
diagnostic scenarios. Project page is available at

TL;DR: This paper introduces MC-SJD, a lossless and training-free decoding framework for faster autoregressive (AR) visual generation, significantly accelerating image and video generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation stems from the slow inference speed of per-token generation in AR modeling, which limits its practical use in visual generation despite its recent popularity.

Method: The method involves MC-SJD, a framework extending Speculative Jacobi Decoding (SJD) using a coupling-based, information-theoretic approach that maximizes sampling consistency across iterations to increase token stability.

Result: MC-SJD achieves up to a ~4.2x acceleration in image generation and ~13.3x acceleration in video generation compared to standard AR decoding, without compromising output quality.

Conclusion: MC-SJD represents a major advancement in AR visual generation by significantly boosting decoding speed with minimal algorithmic modification, making AR methods more practical for adoption.

Abstract: While autoregressive (AR) modeling has recently emerged as a new paradigm in
visual generation, its practical adoption is severely constrained by the slow
inference speed of per-token generation, which often requires thousands of
steps to produce a single sample. To address this challenge, we propose MC-SJD,
a training-free, lossless parallel decoding framework designed to accelerate AR
visual generation by extending the recently introduced Speculative Jacobi
Decoding (SJD). Although SJD shows strong potential for accelerating AR
generation, we demonstrate that token instability across iterations
significantly reduces the acceptance rate, a limitation that primarily arises
from the independent sampling process used during draft token generation. To
overcome this, we introduce MC-SJD, an information-theoretic approach based on
coupling, which substantially accelerates standard SJD by maximizing the
probability of sampling identical draft tokens across consecutive iterations,
all while preserving its lossless property. Remarkably, this method requires
only a single-line modification to the existing algorithm, yet achieves
substantial performance gains, delivering up to a ~4.2x acceleration in image
generation and ~13.3x acceleration in video generation compared to standard AR
decoding, without any degradation in output quality.

### [172] [Beyond Inference Intervention: Identity-Decoupled Diffusion for Face Anonymization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24213)
*Haoxin Yang,Yihong Lin,Jingdan Kang,Xuemiao Xu,Yue Li,Cheng Xu,Shengfeng He*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces ID²Face, a novel framework for face anonymization that focuses on pre-training techniques to disentangle identity and non-identity attributes, improving visual quality and utility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address shortcomings in current face anonymization methods that rely on inference-time interventions, which often degrade visual quality and entangle identity with non-identity information.

Method: This framework employs a conditional diffusion model coupled with an identity-masked learning scheme, utilizing an Identity Variational Autoencoder and novel latent alignment methods to disentangle identity attributes.

Result: Experiments reveal that ID²Face achieves superior visual quality, better suppression of identity leakage, and enhanced utility over existing anonymization methods.

Conclusion: The proposed ID²Face effectively disentangles identity and non-identity attributes, offering a more natural and controllable anonymization approach with enhanced outcomes in various evaluative metrics.

Abstract: Face anonymization aims to conceal identity information while preserving
non-identity attributes. Mainstream diffusion models rely on inference-time
interventions such as negative guidance or energy-based optimization, which are
applied post-training to suppress identity features. These interventions often
introduce distribution shifts and entangle identity with non-identity
attributes, degrading visual fidelity and data utility. To address this, we
propose \textbf{ID\textsuperscript{2}Face}, a training-centric anonymization
framework that removes the need for inference-time optimization. The rationale
of our method is to learn a structured latent space where identity and
non-identity information are explicitly disentangled, enabling direct and
controllable anonymization at inference. To this end, we design a conditional
diffusion model with an identity-masked learning scheme. An Identity-Decoupled
Latent Recomposer uses an Identity Variational Autoencoder to model identity
features, while non-identity attributes are extracted from same-identity pairs
and aligned through bidirectional latent alignment. An Identity-Guided Latent
Harmonizer then fuses these representations via soft-gating conditioned on
noisy feature prediction. The model is trained with a recomposition-based
reconstruction loss to enforce disentanglement. At inference, anonymization is
achieved by sampling a random identity vector from the learned identity space.
To further suppress identity leakage, we introduce an Orthogonal Identity
Mapping strategy that enforces orthogonality between sampled and source
identity vectors. Experiments demonstrate that ID\textsuperscript{2}Face
outperforms existing methods in visual quality, identity suppression, and
utility preservation.

### [173] [SCOPE: Saliency-Coverage Oriented Token Pruning for Efficient Multimodel LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24214)
*Jinhong Deng,Wen Li,Joey Tianyi Zhou,Yang He*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces a novel visual token pruning strategy designed to improve computational efficiency in Multimodal Large Language Models by jointly modeling token saliency and coverage.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multimodal Large Language Models suffer from computational overhead due to processing redundant visual tokens, and current pruning methods fail to ensure semantic completeness.

Method: The proposed method, SCOPE, utilizes a token-coverage gain combined with saliency scores to iteratively select tokens ensuring better semantic preservation.

Result: Extensive experiments show that SCOPE outperforms previous methods across various vision-language benchmarks using LLaVA-1.5 and LLaVA-Next models.

Conclusion: Integrating saliency and coverage in visual token pruning significantly enhances semantic completeness and efficiency in multimodal language models.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) typically process a large number of
visual tokens, leading to considerable computational overhead, even though many
of these tokens are redundant. Existing visual token pruning methods primarily
focus on selecting the most salient tokens based on attention scores, resulting
in the semantic incompleteness of the selected tokens. In this paper, we
propose a novel visual token pruning strategy, called
\textbf{S}aliency-\textbf{C}overage \textbf{O}riented token \textbf{P}runing
for \textbf{E}fficient MLLMs (SCOPE), to jointly model both the saliency and
coverage of the selected visual tokens to better preserve semantic
completeness. Specifically, we introduce a set-coverage for a given set of
selected tokens, computed based on the token relationships. We then define a
token-coverage gain for each unselected token, quantifying how much additional
coverage would be obtained by including it. By integrating the saliency score
into the token-coverage gain, we propose our SCOPE score and iteratively select
the token with the highest SCOPE score. We conduct extensive experiments on
multiple vision-language understanding benchmarks using the LLaVA-1.5 and
LLaVA-Next models. Experimental results demonstrate that our method
consistently outperforms prior approaches. Our code is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The study introduces an event-based microsaccade dataset, simulation setup, and classification models achieving around 90% accuracy in recognizing microsaccades using spiking neural networks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of traditional microsaccade studies, which are costly, not scalable, and lack temporal resolution, by leveraging event-based sensing.

Method: Using Blender to simulate microsaccade scenarios, converting them into event streams with v2e, and evaluating classification accuracy using spiking neural network models (Spiking-VGG variants).

Result: The proposed dataset and Spiking-VGG models achieve approximately 90% accuracy in classifying microsaccades based on angular displacement irrespective of event count or duration.

Conclusion: The findings establish the effectiveness of spiking neural networks for fine motion recognition and set a new benchmark for event-based vision research with publicly available resources.

Abstract: Microsaccades are small, involuntary eye movements vital for visual
perception and neural processing. Traditional microsaccade studies typically
use eye trackers or frame-based analysis, which, while precise, are costly and
limited in scalability and temporal resolution. Event-based sensing offers a
high-speed, low-latency alternative by capturing fine-grained spatiotemporal
changes efficiently. This work introduces a pioneering event-based microsaccade
dataset to support research on small eye movement dynamics in cognitive
computing. Using Blender, we render high-fidelity eye movement scenarios and
simulate microsaccades with angular displacements from 0.5 to 2.0 degrees,
divided into seven distinct classes. These are converted to event streams using
v2e, preserving the natural temporal dynamics of microsaccades, with durations
ranging from 0.25 ms to 2.25 ms. We evaluate the dataset using Spiking-VGG11,
Spiking-VGG13, and Spiking-VGG16, and propose Spiking-VGG16Flow, an
optical-flow-enhanced variant implemented in SpikingJelly. The models achieve
around 90 percent average accuracy, successfully classifying microsaccades by
angular displacement, independent of event count or duration. These results
demonstrate the potential of spiking neural networks for fine motion
recognition and establish a benchmark for event-based vision research. The
dataset, code, and trained models will be publicly available at

*Qing Zhao,Weijian Deng,Pengxu Wei,ZiYi Dong,Hannan Lu,Xiangyang Ji,Liang Lin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Integrating image restoration directly into object detection via Lipschitz-regularized framework addresses functional mismatch and improves detection stability, optimization smoothness, and accuracy in adverse conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper seeks to address the instability caused by the mismatch between image restoration and object detection networks in adverse conditions such as haze and low light.

Method: The proposed solution, Lipschitz-regularized object detection (LROD), focuses on harmonizing the Lipschitz continuity across restoration and detection networks during training. This is implemented as Lipschitz-regularized YOLO (LR-YOLO).

Result: Experiments show that LR-YOLO improves detection robustness and optimization smoothness on haze and low-light benchmarks.

Conclusion: The integration of image restoration into object detection via Lipschitz continuity proves effective in addressing functional mismatch, leading to enhanced detection performance under adverse conditions.

Abstract: To improve detection robustness in adverse conditions (e.g., haze and low
light), image restoration is commonly applied as a pre-processing step to
enhance image quality for the detector. However, the functional mismatch
between restoration and detection networks can introduce instability and hinder
effective integration -- an issue that remains underexplored. We revisit this
limitation through the lens of Lipschitz continuity, analyzing the functional
differences between restoration and detection networks in both the input space
and the parameter space. Our analysis shows that restoration networks perform
smooth, continuous transformations, while object detectors operate with
discontinuous decision boundaries, making them highly sensitive to minor
perturbations. This mismatch introduces instability in traditional cascade
frameworks, where even imperceptible noise from restoration is amplified during
detection, disrupting gradient flow and hindering optimization. To address
this, we propose Lipschitz-regularized object detection (LROD), a simple yet
effective framework that integrates image restoration directly into the
detector's feature learning, harmonizing the Lipschitz continuity of both tasks
during training. We implement this framework as Lipschitz-regularized YOLO
(LR-YOLO), extending seamlessly to existing YOLO detectors. Extensive
experiments on haze and low-light benchmarks demonstrate that LR-YOLO
consistently improves detection stability, optimization smoothness, and overall
accuracy.

*Zhaotong Yang,Yi Chen,Yanying Li,Shengfeng He,Yangyang Xu,Junyu Dong,Jian Yang,Yong Du*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This study introduces DeshadowMamba, a shadow removal model leveraging Mamba-based sequence modeling with enhancements like CrossGate modulation and ColorShift regularization to achieve state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing attention-based shadow removal models often mix irrelevant illumination cues, causing distorted structures and inconsistent colors. The paper aims to tackle these shortcomings.

Method: The model uses Mamba for efficient global context propagation, integrated with CrossGate modulation to prioritize shadow-aware information. Additionally, ColorShift regularization suppresses color contamination using contrastive learning.

Result: DeshadowMamba achieves superior visual and quantitative results on public benchmarks for shadow removal.

Conclusion: The proposed methods effectively adapt sequence modeling towards structural and chromatic integrity, establishing high-quality shadow removal outcomes.

Abstract: Recent deep models for image shadow removal often rely on attention-based
architectures to capture long-range dependencies. However, their fixed
attention patterns tend to mix illumination cues from irrelevant regions,
leading to distorted structures and inconsistent colors. In this work, we
revisit shadow removal from a sequence modeling perspective and explore the use
of Mamba, a selective state space model that propagates global context through
directional state transitions. These transitions yield an efficient global
receptive field while preserving positional continuity. Despite its potential,
directly applying Mamba to image data is suboptimal, since it lacks awareness
of shadow-non-shadow semantics and remains susceptible to color interference
from nearby regions. To address these limitations, we propose CrossGate, a
directional modulation mechanism that injects shadow-aware similarity into
Mamba's input gate, allowing selective integration of relevant context along
transition axes. To further ensure appearance fidelity, we introduce ColorShift
regularization, a contrastive learning objective driven by global color
statistics. By synthesizing structured informative negatives, it guides the
model to suppress color contamination and achieve robust color restoration.
Together, these components adapt sequence modeling to the structural integrity
and chromatic consistency required for shadow removal. Extensive experiments on
public benchmarks demonstrate that DeshadowMamba achieves state-of-the-art
visual quality and strong quantitative performance.

TL;DR: The paper introduces GenTrack, a hybrid multi-object tracking (MOT) method incorporating stochastic and deterministic approaches, particle swarm optimization, and social interaction enhancements for superior tracking performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to improve tracking accuracy and identity consistency in scenarios with unknown, changing target numbers, noisy detector inputs, and occlusion issues.

Method: GenTrack employs hybrid tracking methods blending stochastic and deterministic approaches, leveraging particle swarm optimization (PSO) with proposed fitness measures, incorporating social interactions among targets, and introducing a comprehensive observation model for efficient updates.

Result: Experimental results demonstrate GenTrack's superior performance compared to state-of-the-art trackers on benchmarks and real-world scenarios. Additionally, fair comparisons with integrated baselines confirm its efficacy.

Conclusion: GenTrack achieves robust multi-object tracking with reduced ID switches and track losses, particularly during challenging situations. Open-source implementations are shared, suggesting significant advancements and avenues for future improvements.

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel multi-object tracking (MOT) method, dubbed
GenTrack, whose main contributions include: a hybrid tracking approach
employing both stochastic and deterministic manners to robustly handle unknown
and time-varying numbers of targets, particularly in maintaining target
identity (ID) consistency and managing nonlinear dynamics, leveraging particle
swarm optimization (PSO) with some proposed fitness measures to guide
stochastic particles toward their target distribution modes, enabling effective
tracking even with weak and noisy object detectors, integration of social
interactions among targets to enhance PSO-guided particles as well as improve
continuous updates of both strong (matched) and weak (unmatched) tracks,
thereby reducing ID switches and track loss, especially during occlusions, a
GenTrack-based redefined visual MOT baseline incorporating a comprehensive
state and observation model based on space consistency, appearance, detection
confidence, track penalties, and social scores for systematic and efficient
target updates, and the first-ever publicly available source-code reference

*Jiyu Guo,Shuo Yang,Yiming Huang,Yancheng Long,Xiaobo Xia,Xiu Su,Bo Zhao,Zeke Xie,Liqiang Nie*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UtilGen improves data augmentation for computer vision tasks by focusing on generating task-specific, high-utility synthetic data rather than just optimizing for visual attributes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most data augmentation approaches prioritize visual fidelity and diversity but neglect task-specific requirements, which are crucial for varying downstream task needs.

Method: UtilGen uses a weight allocation network to evaluate task-specific utility of synthetic samples and employs a dual-level optimization strategy to tailor generative models and individual data instance generation.

Result: UtilGen achieved an average accuracy improvement of 3.87% across eight benchmark datasets compared to previous state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: The utility-centric approach of UtilGen outperforms visual-centric methods, producing more impactful and relevant synthetic data for computer vision tasks.

Abstract: Data augmentation using generative models has emerged as a powerful paradigm
for enhancing performance in computer vision tasks. However, most existing
augmentation approaches primarily focus on optimizing intrinsic data attributes
-- such as fidelity and diversity -- to generate visually high-quality
synthetic data, while often neglecting task-specific requirements. Yet, it is
essential for data generators to account for the needs of downstream tasks, as
training data requirements can vary significantly across different tasks and
network architectures. To address these limitations, we propose UtilGen, a
novel utility-centric data augmentation framework that adaptively optimizes the
data generation process to produce task-specific, high-utility training data
via downstream task feedback. Specifically, we first introduce a weight
allocation network to evaluate the task-specific utility of each synthetic
sample. Guided by these evaluations, UtilGen iteratively refines the data
generation process using a dual-level optimization strategy to maximize the
synthetic data utility: (1) model-level optimization tailors the generative
model to the downstream task, and (2) instance-level optimization adjusts
generation policies -- such as prompt embeddings and initial noise -- at each
generation round. Extensive experiments on eight benchmark datasets of varying
complexity and granularity demonstrate that UtilGen consistently achieves
superior performance, with an average accuracy improvement of 3.87% over
previous SOTA. Further analysis of data influence and distribution reveals that
UtilGen produces more impactful and task-relevant synthetic data, validating
the effectiveness of the paradigm shift from visual characteristics-centric to
task utility-centric data augmentation.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a new visual multi-object tracking method combining stochastic and deterministic mechanisms for consistent tracking under challenging conditions, proving highly effective against state-of-the-art models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in multi-object tracking caused by nonlinear dynamics, unknown and time-varying target numbers, and ensuring identifier consistency during occlusions and interactions.

Method: The method integrates stochastic particle filtering (with PSO) and deterministic association to maintain identifier consistency. It proposes novel metrics for fitness assessment and a cost matrix for tracking, along with smooth state update mechanisms and velocity trend-seeding.

Result: Experimental results demonstrate superior performance of the proposed method compared to state-of-the-art trackers under diverse conditions.

Conclusion: The proposed method ensures robust and identity-consistent multi-object tracking for varying scenarios, showcasing its versatility and effectiveness across applications.

Abstract: This paper proposes a visual multi-object tracking method that jointly
employs stochastic and deterministic mechanisms to ensure identifier
consistency for unknown and time-varying target numbers under nonlinear
dynamics. A stochastic particle filter addresses nonlinear dynamics and
non-Gaussian noise, with support from particle swarm optimization (PSO) to
guide particles toward state distribution modes and mitigate divergence through
proposed fitness measures incorporating motion consistency, appearance
similarity, and social-interaction cues with neighboring targets. Deterministic
association further enforces identifier consistency via a proposed cost matrix
incorporating spatial consistency between particles and current detections,
detection confidences, and track penalties. Subsequently, a novel scheme is
proposed for the smooth updating of target states while preserving their
identities, particularly for weak tracks during interactions with other targets
and prolonged occlusions. Moreover, velocity regression over past states
provides trend-seed velocities, enhancing particle sampling and state updates.
The proposed tracker is designed to operate flexibly for both pre-recorded
videos and camera live streams, where future frames are unavailable.

TL;DR: This paper introduces a training-free one-shot synthetic image source attribution method based on image resynthesis, and introduces a benchmark dataset to test the method's effectiveness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The attribution of synthetic images to their sources becomes particularly challenging in scenarios with limited data, requiring innovative few-shot or zero-shot methods.

Method: Propose a training-free one-shot method based on analyzing resynthesized images from various candidate models via a generated prompt and feature space comparison. A novel dataset is also presented.

Result: The proposed resynthesis method demonstrated better performance compared to state-of-the-art few-shot approaches and baselines in scenarios where limited training samples were available.

Conclusion: The resynthesis approach is effective for few-shot synthetic image attribution, and the introduced dataset provides a valuable benchmark to evaluate future attribution methods.

Abstract: Synthetic image source attribution is a challenging task, especially in data
scarcity conditions requiring few-shot or zero-shot classification
capabilities. We present a new training-free one-shot attribution method based
on image resynthesis. A prompt describing the image under analysis is
generated, then it is used to resynthesize the image with all the candidate
sources. The image is attributed to the model which produced the resynthesis
closest to the original image in a proper feature space. We also introduce a
new dataset for synthetic image attribution consisting of face images from
commercial and open-source text-to-image generators. The dataset provides a
challenging attribution framework, useful for developing new attribution models
and testing their capabilities on different generative architectures. The
dataset structure allows to test approaches based on resynthesis and to compare
them to few-shot methods. Results from state-of-the-art few-shot approaches and
other baselines show that the proposed resynthesis method outperforms existing
techniques when only a few samples are available for training or fine-tuning.
The experiments also demonstrate that the new dataset is a challenging one and
represents a valuable benchmark for developing and evaluating future few-shot
and zero-shot methods.

TL;DR: This paper introduces ViPER, a framework to enhance Vision-Language Models (VLMs) for fine-grained visual perception using a self-bootstrapping, iterative process.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The limited fine-grained visual perception of existing VLMs restricts their performance in real-world applications and requires better training methods that do not compromise general capabilities.

Method: ViPER combines a two-stage task formulation that structures visual learning progressively and integrates reinforcement learning with self-critiquing and self-prediction for iterative self-improvement.

Result: Using ViPER, the Qwen-Viper models achieve significant performance boosts, with gains averaging 1.7% across benchmarks and up to 6.0% improvement in fine-grained perception tasks.

Conclusion: ViPER not only improves VLM perceptual capabilities and generalizability but also highlights the reciprocal relationship between data generation and understanding, paving the way for more autonomous VLMs.

Abstract: The limited capacity for fine-grained visual perception presents a critical
bottleneck for Vision-Language Models (VLMs) in real-world applications.
Addressing this is challenging due to the scarcity of high-quality data and the
limitations of existing methods: supervised fine-tuning (SFT) often compromises
general capabilities, while reinforcement fine-tuning (RFT) prioritizes textual
reasoning over visual perception. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel
two-stage task that structures visual perception learning as a coarse-to-fine
progressive process. Based on this task formulation, we develop ViPER, a
self-bootstrapping framework specifically designed to enable iterative
evolution through self-critiquing and self-prediction. By synergistically
integrating image-level and instance-level reconstruction with a two-stage
reinforcement learning strategy, ViPER establishes a closed-loop training
paradigm, where internally synthesized data directly fuel the enhancement of
perceptual ability. Applied to the Qwen2.5-VL family, ViPER produces the
Qwen-Viper series. With an average gain of 1.7% on seven comprehensive
benchmarks spanning various tasks and up to 6.0% on fine-grained perception,
Qwen-Viper consistently demonstrates superior performance across different
vision-language scenarios while maintaining generalizability. Beyond enabling
self-improvement in perceptual capabilities, ViPER provides concrete evidence
for the reciprocal relationship between generation and understanding, a
breakthrough to developing more autonomous and capable VLMs.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper investigates prompt learning techniques to address domain adaptation challenges for few-shot remote sensing scene classification, demonstrating its effectiveness over existing baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The scarcity of labeled data and high annotation costs in remote sensing hinder the effectiveness of deep learning models, especially due to domain gaps in vision-language methods like CLIP.

Method: The paper systematically evaluates multiple prompt learning approaches (e.g., Context Optimization, Conditional Context Optimization, Multi-modal Prompt Learning, and Self-Regulating Constraints) as adaptation strategies for remote sensing tasks.

Result: Prompt learning consistently outperforms baseline methods (zero-shot CLIP and linear probes) across multiple benchmark datasets in few-shot scenarios, with the Self-Regulating Constraints method showing the most robust cross-domain performance.

Conclusion: Prompt learning is highlighted as a scalable, efficient adaptation strategy that bridges domain gaps in remote sensing, paving the way for future advancements in this field.

Abstract: Remote sensing applications increasingly rely on deep learning for scene
classification. However, their performance is often constrained by the scarcity
of labeled data and the high cost of annotation across diverse geographic and
sensor domains. While recent vision-language models like CLIP have shown
promise by learning transferable representations at scale by aligning visual
and textual modalities, their direct application to remote sensing remains
suboptimal due to significant domain gaps and the need for task-specific
semantic adaptation. To address this critical challenge, we systematically
explore prompt learning as a lightweight and efficient adaptation strategy for
few-shot remote sensing image scene classification. We evaluate several
representative methods, including Context Optimization, Conditional Context
Optimization, Multi-modal Prompt Learning, and Prompting with Self-Regulating
Constraints. These approaches reflect complementary design philosophies: from
static context optimization to conditional prompts for enhanced generalization,
multi-modal prompts for joint vision-language adaptation, and semantically
regularized prompts for stable learning without forgetting. We benchmark these
prompt-learning methods against two standard baselines: zero-shot CLIP with
hand-crafted prompts and a linear probe trained on frozen CLIP features.
Through extensive experiments on multiple benchmark remote sensing datasets,
including cross-dataset generalization tests, we demonstrate that prompt
learning consistently outperforms both baselines in few-shot scenarios.
Notably, Prompting with Self-Regulating Constraints achieves the most robust
cross-domain performance. Our findings underscore prompt learning as a scalable
and efficient solution for bridging the domain gap in satellite and aerial
imagery, providing a strong foundation for future research in this field.

Conclusion: The method effectively improves segmentation accuracy with limited supervision and presents a significant advancement in semi-supervised segmentation approaches.

Abstract: Teacher-student frameworks have emerged as a leading approach in
semi-supervised medical image segmentation, demonstrating strong performance
across various tasks. However, the learning effects are still limited by the
strong correlation and unreliable knowledge transfer process between teacher
and student networks. To overcome this limitation, we introduce a novel
switching Dual-Student architecture that strategically selects the most
reliable student at each iteration to enhance dual-student collaboration and
prevent error reinforcement. We also introduce a strategy of Loss-Aware
Exponential Moving Average to dynamically ensure that the teacher absorbs
meaningful information from students, improving the quality of pseudo-labels.
Our plug-and-play framework is extensively evaluated on 3D medical image

TL;DR: The paper introduces W2-Net, enhancing Referring Expression Counting (REC) by improving subclass-level discrimination and addressing challenges with annotation points.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improve subclass-level object counting by overcoming limitations of current models that focus on general class-level features and neglect visual regions relevant to distinguishing attributes.

Method: Proposes W2-Net framework with dual-query mechanism (what-to-count and where-to-see) and Subclass Separable Matching (SSM) strategy to improve feature extraction from attribute-specific visual regions and enhance inter-subclass separability.

Result: W2-Net achieves significant improvement on the REC-8K dataset, reducing counting error and boosting localization F1 score compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: W2-Net effectively addresses challenges in REC, enhancing performance in counting and localization tasks through innovative query mechanisms and matching strategies.

Abstract: Referring Expression Counting (REC) extends class-level object counting to
the fine-grained subclass-level, aiming to enumerate objects matching a textual
expression that specifies both the class and distinguishing attribute. A
fundamental challenge, however, has been overlooked: annotation points are
typically placed on class-representative locations (e.g., heads), forcing
models to focus on class-level features while neglecting attribute information
from other visual regions (e.g., legs for "walking"). To address this, we
propose W2-Net, a novel framework that explicitly decouples the problem into
"what to count" and "where to see" via a dual-query mechanism. Specifically,
alongside the standard what-to-count (w2c) queries that localize the object, we
introduce dedicated where-to-see (w2s) queries. The w2s queries are guided to
seek and extract features from attribute-specific visual regions, enabling
precise subclass discrimination. Furthermore, we introduce Subclass Separable
Matching (SSM), a novel matching strategy that incorporates a repulsive force
to enhance inter-subclass separability during label assignment. W2-Net
significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art on the REC-8K dataset, reducing
counting error by 22.5% (validation) and 18.0% (test), and improving
localization F1 by 7% and 8%, respectively. Code will be available.

The framework is available as Python scripts and a standalone executable.

Result: StrokeSeg achieved equivalent segmentation performance to the original PyTorch pipeline on a dataset of 300 stroke subjects, with less than a 0.1% Dice difference.

Conclusion: StrokeSeg demonstrates that state-of-the-art research models can be converted into portable and clinically practical tools without performance compromise.

Abstract: Deep learning frameworks such as nnU-Net achieve state-of-the-art performance
in brain lesion segmentation but remain difficult to deploy clinically due to
heavy dependencies and monolithic design. We introduce \textit{StrokeSeg}, a
modular and lightweight framework that translates research-grade stroke lesion
segmentation models into deployable applications. Preprocessing, inference, and
postprocessing are decoupled: preprocessing relies on the Anima toolbox with
BIDS-compliant outputs, and inference uses ONNX Runtime with \texttt{Float16}
quantisation, reducing model size by about 50\%. \textit{StrokeSeg} provides
both graphical and command-line interfaces and is distributed as Python scripts
and as a standalone Windows executable. On a held-out set of 300 sub-acute and
chronic stroke subjects, segmentation performance was equivalent to the
original PyTorch pipeline (Dice difference $<10^{-3}$), demonstrating that
high-performing research pipelines can be transformed into portable, clinically
usable tools.

### [186] [A Luminance-Aware Multi-Scale Network for Polarization Image Fusion with a Multi-Scene Dataset](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24379)
*Zhuangfan Huang,Xiaosong Li,Gao Wang,Tao Ye,Haishu Tan,Huafeng Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes a luminance-aware multi-scale network (MLSN) for fusing polarization images (S0 and DOLP) to improve complex luminance environment processing and texture feature analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of contrast differences in polarization images and improve adaptability to complex lighting conditions during image fusion for applications such as camouflage recognition and defect detection.

Method: The proposed MLSN integrates a multi-scale spatial weight matrix, global-local feature fusion, and a Brightness-Enhancement module. Moreover, a new dataset MSP with diverse polarized images under complex lighting conditions is introduced.

Result: The proposed method (MLSN) outperformed state-of-the-art techniques across various datasets in both subjective and objective evaluations, with significant performance improvements in evaluation metrics such as MS-SSIM and SD.

Conclusion: MLSN effectively balances global and local features, accounts for complex luminance variations, and outperforms existing methods in polarization image fusion, offering promising potential for practical applications. The MSP dataset also enriches the field with high-quality diverse data.

Abstract: Polarization image fusion combines S0 and DOLP images to reveal surface
roughness and material properties through complementary texture features, which
has important applications in camouflage recognition, tissue pathology
analysis, surface defect detection and other fields. To intergrate
coL-Splementary information from different polarized images in complex
luminance environment, we propose a luminance-aware multi-scale network (MLSN).
In the encoder stage, we propose a multi-scale spatial weight matrix through a
brightness-branch , which dynamically weighted inject the luminance into the
feature maps, solving the problem of inherent contrast difference in polarized
images. The global-local feature fusion mechanism is designed at the bottleneck
layer to perform windowed self-attention computation, to balance the global
context and local details through residual linking in the feature dimension
restructuring stage. In the decoder stage, to further improve the adaptability
to complex lighting, we propose a Brightness-Enhancement module, establishing
the mapping relationship between luminance distribution and texture features,
realizing the nonlinear luminance correction of the fusion result. We also
present MSP, an 1000 pairs of polarized images that covers 17 types of indoor
and outdoor complex lighting scenes. MSP provides four-direction polarization
raw maps, solving the scarcity of high-quality datasets in polarization image
fusion. Extensive experiment on MSP, PIF and GAND datasets verify that the
proposed MLSN outperms the state-of-the-art methods in subjective and objective
evaluations, and the MS-SSIM and SD metircs are higher than the average values
of other methods by 8.57%, 60.64%, 10.26%, 63.53%, 22.21%, and 54.31%,
respectively. The source code and dataset is avalable at

*Herman Bergström,Zhongqi Yue,Fredrik D. Johansson*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper studies how radiology reports can enhance medical image classification during pre-training and fine-tuning stages, showing the potential benefits and limitations depending on task and label-text association.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Radiology reports contain expert annotations that could enhance machine learning models for medical image classification, but using them requires significant manual effort; thus, exploring efficient ways to integrate these reports is crucial.

Method: The authors systematically study the impact of using radiology reports during pre-training and fine-tuning stages across various diagnostic and prognostic tasks, analyzing performance under different conditions.

Result: The study found that leveraging radiology reports during pre-training improves tasks where labels align well to text but can hinder tasks with weak label-text alignment. Fine-tuning with reports consistently enhances classification performance, sometimes outweighing pre-training benefits.

Conclusion: Radiology reports are effective when used strategically for training medical image classifiers. Pre-training benefits depend on label-text association, while fine-tuning yields consistent improvements. The paper offers actionable insights and identifies research gaps.

Abstract: Medical images used to train machine learning models are often accompanied by
radiology reports containing rich expert annotations. However, relying on these
reports as inputs for clinical prediction requires the timely manual work of a
trained radiologist. This raises a natural question: when can radiology reports
be leveraged during training to improve image-only classification? Prior works
are limited to evaluating pre-trained image representations by fine-tuning them
to predict diagnostic labels, often extracted from reports, ignoring tasks with
labels that are weakly associated with the text. To address this gap, we
conduct a systematic study of how radiology reports can be used during both
pre-training and fine-tuning, across diagnostic and prognostic tasks (e.g.,
12-month readmission), and under varying training set sizes. Our findings
reveal that: (1) Leveraging reports during pre-training is beneficial for
downstream classification tasks where the label is well-represented in the
text; however, pre-training through explicit image-text alignment can be
detrimental in settings where it's not; (2) Fine-tuning with reports can lead
to significant improvements and even have a larger impact than the pre-training
method in certain settings. These results provide actionable insights into when
and how to leverage privileged text data to train medical image classifiers
while highlighting gaps in current research.

*Youwan Mahé,Elise Bannier,Stéphanie Leplaideur,Elisa Fromont,Francesca Galassi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Post-stroke MRI reveals structural changes linked to recovery and outcome. REFLECT, a generative model, detects abnormalities unsupervised, showing improved accuracy when trained on healthy controls.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To better capture structural abnormalities in post-stroke patients using unsupervised methods, addressing limitations of supervised segmentation for recovery and outcome biomarkers.

Method: Evaluation of REFLECT, an unsupervised flow-based generative model, trained on both lesion-free post-stroke MRI data and healthy controls, assessed via anomaly mapping and its sensitivity.

Result: REFLECT trained on healthy controls demonstrated better performance in both lesion segmentation (Dice = 0.37 vs 0.27) and sensitivity to non-lesional abnormalities (FROC = 0.62 vs 0.43).

Conclusion: Training REFLECT on healthy data improves its ability to detect a broader range of structural abnormalities, highlighting its potential for post-stroke detection and recovery analysis.

Abstract: Post-stroke MRI not only delineates focal lesions but also reveals secondary
structural changes, such as atrophy and ventricular enlargement. These
abnormalities, increasingly recognised as imaging biomarkers of recovery and
outcome, remain poorly captured by supervised segmentation methods. We evaluate
REFLECT, a flow-based generative model, for unsupervised detection of both
focal and non-lesional abnormalities in post-stroke patients. Using dual-expert
central-slice annotations on ATLAS data, performance was assessed at the object
level with Free-Response ROC analysis for anomaly maps. Two models were trained
on lesion-free slices from stroke patients (ATLAS) and on healthy controls
(IXI) to test the effect of training data. On ATLAS test subjects, the
IXI-trained model achieved higher lesion segmentation (Dice = 0.37 vs 0.27) and
improved sensitivity to non-lesional abnormalities (FROC = 0.62 vs 0.43).
Training on fully healthy anatomy improves the modelling of normal variability,
enabling broader and more reliable detection of structural abnormalities.

*Ali Ahmad Faour,Nabil Amacha,Ali J. Ghandour*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The study proposes a sensor-free method integrating satellite imagery, water segmentation, and machine learning for estimating reservoir volume without relying on ground sensors, achieving high accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reliable monitoring of the Qaraaoun Reservoir's storage volume is challenging due to frequent sensor malfunctions and limited maintenance capacity.

Method: The approach uses Sentinel-2 and Landsat satellite images, a new water segmentation index, and a machine learning model (Support Vector Regression) trained on curated data including bathymetric survey-based volume calculations.

Result: The method achieves over 95% accuracy in shoreline segmentation, and reservoir volume estimation errors are below 1.5%, with coefficients of determination exceeding 0.98.

Conclusion: The methodology provides a practical, cost-effective, and replicable solution for continuous reservoir monitoring, useful for studying climate change and environmental patterns.

Abstract: The sustainable management of the Qaraaoun Reservoir, the largest surface
water body in Lebanon located in the Bekaa Plain, depends on reliable
monitoring of its storage volume despite frequent sensor malfunctions and
limited maintenance capacity. This study introduces a sensor-free approach that
integrates open-source satellite imagery, advanced water-extent segmentation,
and machine learning to estimate the reservoir surface area and volume in near
real time. Sentinel-2 and Landsat images are processed, where surface water is
delineated using a newly proposed water segmentation index. A machine learning
model based on Support Vector Regression (SVR) is trained on a curated dataset
that includes water surface area, water level, and water volume calculations
using a reservoir bathymetry survey. The model is then able to estimate
reservoir volume relying solely on surface area extracted from satellite
imagery, without the need for ground measurements. Water segmentation using the
proposed index aligns with ground truth for more than 95 percent of the
shoreline. Hyperparameter tuning with GridSearchCV yields an optimized SVR
performance with error under 1.5 percent of full reservoir capacity and
coefficients of determination exceeding 0.98. These results demonstrate the
robustness and cost-effectiveness of the method, offering a practical solution
for continuous, sensor-independent monitoring of reservoir storage. The
proposed methodology can be replicated for other water bodies, and the
resulting 50 years of time-series data is valuable for research on climate
change and environmental patterns.

*Reem Hammoud,Abdul karim Gizzini,Ali J. Ghandour*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes a specific evaluation framework for Explainable AI methods in semantic segmentation, addressing spatial and contextual complexities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for transparency and trust in AI, particularly in safety-critical domains, and the lack of tailored evaluation strategies for semantic segmentation in XAI.

Method: A systematic evaluation framework using pixel-level strategies and targeted metrics to analyze XAI methods in semantic segmentation.

Result: Simulations using CAM-based XAI demonstrate the framework's efficiency, robustness, and reliability.

Conclusion: The proposed methodology advances semantic segmentation models by enhancing their transparency, accountability, and trust.

Abstract: Ensuring transparency and trust in artificial intelligence (AI) models is
essential, particularly as they are increasingly applied in safety-critical and
high-stakes domains. Explainable AI (XAI) has emerged as a promising approach
to address this challenge, yet the rigorous evaluation of XAI methods remains
crucial for optimizing the trade-offs between model complexity, predictive
performance, and interpretability. While extensive progress has been achieved
in evaluating XAI techniques for classification tasks, evaluation strategies
tailored to semantic segmentation remain relatively underexplored. This work
introduces a comprehensive and systematic evaluation framework specifically
designed for assessing XAI in semantic segmentation, explicitly accounting for
both spatial and contextual task complexities. The framework employs
pixel-level evaluation strategies and carefully designed metrics to provide
fine-grained interpretability insights. Simulation results using recently
adapted class activation mapping (CAM)-based XAI schemes demonstrate the
efficiency, robustness, and reliability of the proposed methodology. These
findings contribute to advancing transparent, trustworthy, and accountable
semantic segmentation models.

### [191] [Deeply-Conditioned Image Compression via Self-Generated Priors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24437)
*Zhineng Zhao,Zhihai He,Zikun Zhou,Siwei Ma,Yaowei Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces a functional decomposition framework, DCIC-sgp, to enhance image compression, addressing geometric deformation issues at low bitrates with improved rate-distortion performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current learned image compression methods struggle with modeling complex correlation structures in images, specifically the entanglement of global structures and local textures, leading to severe geometric deformation at low bitrates.

Method: The approach, named DCIC-sgp, encodes a self-generated prior to represent the image's structural backbone, which conditions the entire compression pipeline. This method disentangles global structures and residual information through hierarchical conditioning.

Result: Experiments reveal that DCIC-sgp reduces geometric deformation artifacts and achieves significant BD-rate reductions of 14.4%, 15.7%, and 15.1% on Kodak, CLIC, and Tecnick datasets, outperforming current codecs.

Conclusion: The hierarchical, dependency-driven framework of DCIC-sgp successfully mitigates low-bitrate distortions while achieving strong quantitative and visual compression performance.

Abstract: Learned image compression (LIC) has shown great promise for achieving high
rate-distortion performance. However, current LIC methods are often limited in
their capability to model the complex correlation structures inherent in
natural images, particularly the entanglement of invariant global structures
with transient local textures within a single monolithic representation. This
limitation precipitates severe geometric deformation at low bitrates. To
address this, we introduce a framework predicated on functional decomposition,
which we term Deeply-Conditioned Image Compression via self-generated priors
(DCIC-sgp). Our central idea is to first encode a potent, self-generated prior
to encapsulate the image's structural backbone. This prior is subsequently
utilized not as mere side-information, but to holistically modulate the entire
compression pipeline. This deep conditioning, most critically of the analysis
transform, liberates it to dedicate its representational capacity to the
residual, high-entropy details. This hierarchical, dependency-driven approach
achieves an effective disentanglement of information streams. Our extensive
experiments validate this assertion; visual analysis demonstrates that our
method substantially mitigates the geometric deformation artifacts that plague
conventional codecs at low bitrates. Quantitatively, our framework establishes
highly competitive performance, achieving significant BD-rate reductions of
14.4%, 15.7%, and 15.1% against the VVC test model VTM-12.1 on the Kodak, CLIC,
and Tecnick datasets.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper explores Video Diffusion Models (VDMs) as a method for improving visual domain adaptability, showing that VDMs achieve better data efficiency compared to pretrained language models across various tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address challenges of compositional understanding, sample efficiency, and general-purpose problem-solving in the visual domain, where large-scale pretraining has been less effective compared to the language domain.

Method: The authors use pretrained Video Diffusion Models combined with lightweight adapters to test task adaptability on benchmarks including ARC-AGI, ConceptARC, visual games, route planning, and cellular automata.

Result: VDMs demonstrate higher data efficiency than pretrained language models across the mentioned benchmarks.

Conclusion: Pretraining on spatiotemporal data via VDMs provides inductive biases that enhance adaptability and progress toward creating visual foundation models.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated that large-scale pretraining
enables systems to adapt rapidly to new problems with little supervision in the
language domain. This success, however, has not translated as effectively to
the visual domain, where models, including LLMs, continue to struggle with
compositional understanding, sample efficiency, and general-purpose
problem-solving. We investigate Video Diffusion Models (VDMs) as a promising
direction for bridging this gap. Pretraining on spatiotemporal data endows
these models with strong inductive biases for structure and dynamics, which we
hypothesize can support broad task adaptability. To test this, we design a
controlled evaluation in which both a pretrained LLM and a pretrained VDM are
equipped with lightweight adapters and presented with tasks in their natural
modalities. Across benchmarks including ARC-AGI, ConceptARC, visual games,
route planning, and cellular automata, VDMs demonstrate higher data efficiency
than their language counterparts. Taken together, our results indicate that
video pretraining offers inductive biases that support progress toward visual
foundation models.

*Charles Javerliat,Pierre Raimbaud,Guillaume Lavoué*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Kineo offers a calibration-free solution for accurate and efficient markerless motion capture from unsynchronized consumer-grade cameras, outperforming prior methods. It handles metric scale calibration and enhances 3D reconstruction reliability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Markerless multiview motion capture is constrained by calibration requirements, hindering accessibility for non-experts and difficult real-world applications.

Method: Kineo uses off-the-shelf 2D keypoint detectors for automatic calibration, global optimization for robust results, and introduces metrics for 3D reconstruction reliability.

Result: Kineo significantly improves camera calibration accuracy (translation error reduced by 83-85%; angular error reduced by 86-92%), and increases 3D reconstruction accuracy (W-MPJPE reduced by 83-91%). It is efficient, processing longer sequences faster than their duration.

Conclusion: Kineo sets a new benchmark for calibration-free motion capture by improving accuracy and efficiency, and its open-source release encourages adoption in diverse applications.

Abstract: Markerless multiview motion capture is often constrained by the need for
precise camera calibration, limiting accessibility for non-experts and
in-the-wild captures. Existing calibration-free approaches mitigate this
requirement but suffer from high computational cost and reduced reconstruction
accuracy.
  We present Kineo, a fully automatic, calibration-free pipeline for markerless
motion capture from videos captured by unsynchronized, uncalibrated,
consumer-grade RGB cameras. Kineo leverages 2D keypoints from off-the-shelf
detectors to simultaneously calibrate cameras, including Brown-Conrady
distortion coefficients, and reconstruct 3D keypoints and dense scene point
maps at metric scale. A confidence-driven spatio-temporal keypoint sampling
strategy, combined with graph-based global optimization, ensures robust
calibration at a fixed computational cost independent of sequence length. We
further introduce a pairwise reprojection consensus score to quantify 3D
reconstruction reliability for downstream tasks.
  Evaluations on EgoHumans and Human3.6M demonstrate substantial improvements
over prior calibration-free methods. Compared to previous state-of-the-art
approaches, Kineo reduces camera translation error by approximately 83-85%,
camera angular error by 86-92%, and world mean-per-joint error (W-MPJPE) by
83-91%.
  Kineo is also efficient in real-world scenarios, processing multi-view
sequences faster than their duration in specific configuration (e.g., 36min to
process 1h20min of footage). The full pipeline and evaluation code are openly
released to promote reproducibility and practical adoption at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces Decoupled MeanFlow, a method to enable faster high-quality image generation using pretrained flow models converted into flow maps, achieving exceptional efficiency and performance on ImageNet.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional denoising generative models require numerous steps due to discretization error, and training flow maps typically involve changes incompatible with pretrained flow models.

Method: The paper proposes Decoupled MeanFlow, a decoding strategy that repurposes pretrained flow models into flow map models by conditioning diffusion transformers' final blocks on subsequent timesteps, combined with enhanced training techniques.

Result: On ImageNet 256x256 and 512x512, the method attains 1-step FID scores of 2.16 and 2.12, and with 4 steps reaches FID scores of 1.51 and 1.68, achieving over 100x faster inference and surpassing previous techniques significantly.

Conclusion: Decoupled MeanFlow offers an efficient alternative to traditional flow map training, using pretrained flow models for faster and effective high-quality sample generation, reducing inference time while maintaining competitive FID scores.

Abstract: Denoising generative models, such as diffusion and flow-based models, produce
high-quality samples but require many denoising steps due to discretization
error. Flow maps, which estimate the average velocity between timesteps,
mitigate this error and enable faster sampling. However, their training
typically demands architectural changes that limit compatibility with
pretrained flow models. We introduce Decoupled MeanFlow, a simple decoding
strategy that converts flow models into flow map models without architectural
modifications. Our method conditions the final blocks of diffusion transformers
on the subsequent timestep, allowing pretrained flow models to be directly
repurposed as flow maps. Combined with enhanced training techniques, this
design enables high-quality generation in as few as 1 to 4 steps. Notably, we
find that training flow models and subsequently converting them is more
efficient and effective than training flow maps from scratch. On ImageNet
256x256 and 512x512, our models attain 1-step FID of 2.16 and 2.12,
respectively, surpassing prior art by a large margin. Furthermore, we achieve
FID of 1.51 and 1.68 when increasing the steps to 4, which nearly matches the
performance of flow models while delivering over 100x faster inference.

TL;DR: DisK-NeuralRTI introduces Knowledge Distillation to improve the computational efficiency of Reflectance Transformation Imaging (RTI) methods by optimizing NeuralRTI without compromising accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the computational inefficiency of NeuralRTI during interactive relighting at full resolution, which limits its usability in large images on hardware with limited resources.

Method: The method incorporates Knowledge Distillation to optimize NeuralRTI by training a simpler, smaller network that retains the quality of complex reflectance field representation while significantly reducing the rendering costs.

Result: This approach reduces computational cost while maintaining high-quality reflectance approximations, enabling feasible interactive relighting at full resolutions.

Conclusion: DisK-NeuralRTI balances computational efficiency and rendering quality in RTI, solving NeuralRTI's drawbacks and offering practical solutions for large-scale applications.

Abstract: Reflectance Transformation Imaging (RTI) is very popular for its ability to
visually analyze surfaces by enhancing surface details through interactive
relighting, starting from only a few tens of photographs taken with a fixed
camera and variable illumination. Traditional methods like Polynomial Texture
Maps (PTM) and Hemispherical Harmonics (HSH) are compact and fast, but struggle
to accurately capture complex reflectance fields using few per-pixel
coefficients and fixed bases, leading to artifacts, especially in highly
reflective or shadowed areas. The NeuralRTI approach, which exploits a neural
autoencoder to learn a compact function that better approximates the local
reflectance as a function of light directions, has been shown to produce
superior quality at comparable storage cost. However, as it performs
interactive relighting with custom decoder networks with many parameters, the
rendering step is computationally expensive and not feasible at full resolution
for large images on limited hardware. Earlier attempts to reduce costs by
directly training smaller networks have failed to produce valid results. For
this reason, we propose to reduce its computational cost through a novel
solution based on Knowledge Distillation (DisK-NeuralRTI). ...

TL;DR: The paper introduces Latent Sketchpad, a framework enabling multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to perform visual planning and imagination through internal visual representation and generative reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multimodal large language models excel in visual understanding but struggle with complex visual planning and imagination. Inspired by humans using sketching for visual thinking, the authors aim to enhance MLLMs' capability for richer reasoning.

Method: The framework integrates visual generation into the MLLM's autoregressive reasoning process using two components: a Context-Aware Vision Head for generating visual representations and a pretrained Sketch Decoder for rendering interpretable sketch images.

Result: Latent Sketchpad improves reasoning performance in MLLMs, demonstrating success across models like Gemma3 and Qwen2.5-VL on the MazePlanning dataset with comparable or superior outcomes.

Conclusion: Latent Sketchpad enhances MLLMs by introducing visual thinking to complement textual reasoning, paving the way for more versatile human-computer interaction and applications.

Abstract: While Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) excel at visual understanding,
they often struggle in complex scenarios that require visual planning and
imagination. Inspired by how humans use sketching as a form of visual thinking
to develop and communicate ideas, we introduce Latent Sketchpad, a framework
that equips MLLMs with an internal visual scratchpad. The internal visual
representations of MLLMs have traditionally been confined to perceptual
understanding. We repurpose them to support generative visual thought without
compromising reasoning ability. Building on frontier MLLMs, our approach
integrates visual generation directly into their native autoregressive
reasoning process. It allows the model to interleave textual reasoning with the
generation of visual latents. These latents guide the internal thought process
and can be translated into sketch images for interpretability. To realize this,
we introduce two components: a Context-Aware Vision Head autoregressively
produces visual representations, and a pretrained Sketch Decoder renders these
into human-interpretable images. We evaluate the framework on our new dataset
MazePlanning. Experiments across various MLLMs show that Latent Sketchpad
delivers comparable or even superior reasoning performance to their backbone.
It further generalizes across distinct frontier MLLMs, including Gemma3 and
Qwen2.5-VL. By extending model's textual reasoning to visual thinking, our
framework opens new opportunities for richer human-computer interaction and
broader applications. More details and resources are available on our project

*Hongrui Jia,Jitong Liao,Xi Zhang,Haiyang Xu,Tianbao Xie,Chaoya Jiang,Ming Yan,Si Liu,Wei Ye,Fei Huang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces OSWorld-MCP, a benchmark for evaluating computational agents' tools usage, GUI interaction, and decision-making abilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fair evaluation of multimodal agents' tool invocation capabilities has been overlooked compared to GUI interaction evaluations.

Method: Development of 158 validated tools through an automated code-generation pipeline, manual validation, and testing on multimodal agents.

Result: MCP tools improved task success rates significantly, but current tool invocation rates remain low, showing significant room for improvement.

Conclusion: OSWorld-MCP benchmark advances understanding and sets the standard for assessing multimodal agents in complex tool-assisted environments.

Abstract: With advances in decision-making and reasoning capabilities, multimodal
agents show strong potential in computer application scenarios. Past
evaluations have mainly assessed GUI interaction skills, while tool invocation
abilities, such as those enabled by the Model Context Protocol (MCP), have been
largely overlooked. Comparing agents with integrated tool invocation to those
evaluated only on GUI interaction is inherently unfair. We present OSWorld-MCP,
the first comprehensive and fair benchmark for assessing computer-use agents'
tool invocation, GUI operation, and decision-making abilities in a real-world
environment. We design a novel automated code-generation pipeline to create
tools and combine them with a curated selection from existing tools. Rigorous
manual validation yields 158 high-quality tools (covering 7 common
applications), each verified for correct functionality, practical
applicability, and versatility. Extensive evaluations of state-of-the-art
multimodal agents on OSWorld-MCP show that MCP tools generally improve task
success rates (e.g., from 8.3% to 20.4% for OpenAI o3 at 15 steps, from 40.1%

### [199] [Physics-Inspired Gaussian Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks for X-ray Scatter Correction in Cone-Beam CT](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24579)
*Xu Jiang,Huiying Pan,Ligen Shi,Jianing Sun,Wenfeng Xu,Xing Zhao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces a deep learning method to correct scatter artifact issues in Cone-beam CT imaging using physically inspired features.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Cone-beam CT provides high-resolution imaging but suffers from scatter artifacts that reduce tissue contrast and impair diagnostic accuracy.

Method: The proposed method uses Gaussian Radial Basis Functions within Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks to model scatter distribution and provide corrections based on physical principles.

Result: Both synthetic and real-scan experiments validate that the model effectively corrects scatter artifacts and outperforms existing methods based on quantitative metrics.

Conclusion: The model improves scatter correction for CBCT, enhancing diagnostic accuracy and addressing an important problem in medical imaging.

Abstract: Cone-beam CT (CBCT) employs a flat-panel detector to achieve
three-dimensional imaging with high spatial resolution. However, CBCT is
susceptible to scatter during data acquisition, which introduces CT value bias
and reduced tissue contrast in the reconstructed images, ultimately degrading
diagnostic accuracy. To address this issue, we propose a deep learning-based
scatter artifact correction method inspired by physical prior knowledge.
Leveraging the fact that the observed point scatter probability density
distribution exhibits rotational symmetry in the projection domain. The method
uses Gaussian Radial Basis Functions (RBF) to model the point scatter function
and embeds it into the Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KAN) layer, which provides
efficient nonlinear mapping capabilities for learning high-dimensional scatter
features. By incorporating the physical characteristics of the scattered photon
distribution together with the complex function mapping capacity of KAN, the
model improves its ability to accurately represent scatter. The effectiveness
of the method is validated through both synthetic and real-scan experiments.
Experimental results show that the model can effectively correct the scatter
artifacts in the reconstructed images and is superior to the current methods in
terms of quantitative metrics.

### [200] [A Dual-Branch CNN for Robust Detection of AI-Generated Facial Forgeries](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24640)
*Xin Zhang,Yuqi Song,Fei Zuo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper addresses the rising threat of AI-generated facial image forgery by presenting a dual-branch CNN that combines spatial and frequency domain cues for face forgery detection, outperforming human accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to combat the increasing use of generative AI for malicious purposes, such as misinformation and identity fraud, by developing robust face forgery detection methods to maintain AI security, media integrity, and public trust.

Method: A novel dual-branch convolutional neural network is proposed, with one branch capturing semantic (RGB) information and another focusing on high-frequency artifacts. These features are fused using a channel attention module. A unified loss function, FSC Loss, is introduced to optimize the network.

Result: The model achieves strong performance across various face forgery categories in the DiFF benchmark, surpassing average human accuracy.

Conclusion: The proposed method is effective for detecting forged facial images and can play a significant role in protecting against visual forgery attacks in AI ecosystems.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of generative AI has enabled the creation of highly
realistic forged facial images, posing significant threats to AI security,
digital media integrity, and public trust. Face forgery techniques, ranging
from face swapping and attribute editing to powerful diffusion-based image
synthesis, are increasingly being used for malicious purposes such as
misinformation, identity fraud, and defamation. This growing challenge
underscores the urgent need for robust and generalizable face forgery detection
methods as a critical component of AI security infrastructure. In this work, we
propose a novel dual-branch convolutional neural network for face forgery
detection that leverages complementary cues from both spatial and frequency
domains. The RGB branch captures semantic information, while the frequency
branch focuses on high-frequency artifacts that are difficult for generative
models to suppress. A channel attention module is introduced to adaptively fuse
these heterogeneous features, highlighting the most informative channels for
forgery discrimination. To guide the network's learning process, we design a
unified loss function, FSC Loss, that combines focal loss, supervised
contrastive loss, and a frequency center margin loss to enhance class
separability and robustness. We evaluate our model on the DiFF benchmark, which
includes forged images generated from four representative methods:
text-to-image, image-to-image, face swap, and face edit. Our method achieves
strong performance across all categories and outperforms average human
accuracy. These results demonstrate the model's effectiveness and its potential
contribution to safeguarding AI ecosystems against visual forgery attacks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces PathoGaze1.0, a behavioral dataset capturing pathologists' diagnostic workflows using eye-tracking and mouse interactions to enhance cancer diagnosis interpretation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The field of pathology suffers from diagnostic inaccuracies and lacks robust behavioral data to explain errors and inconsistencies in interpreting whole-slide images (WSIs).

Method: The researchers developed PathoGaze1.0, collecting behavioral data including eye-tracking, mouse interaction, stimulus tracking, viewport navigation, and diagnostic decisions from 19 pathologists interpreting 397 WSIs.

Result: The dataset captures over 18.69 hours of behavioral data, including 171,909 fixations, 263,320 saccades, and 1,867,362 mouse interactions, emphasizing ecological validity.

Conclusion: The dataset provides a resource for improving pathologist training and developing AI systems to augment human diagnostic performance.

Abstract: Interpretation of giga-pixel whole-slide images (WSIs) is an important but
difficult task for pathologists. Their diagnostic accuracy is estimated to
average around 70%. Adding a second pathologist does not substantially improve
decision consistency. The field lacks adequate behavioral data to explain
diagnostic errors and inconsistencies. To fill in this gap, we present
PathoGaze1.0, a comprehensive behavioral dataset capturing the dynamic visual
search and decision-making processes of the full diagnostic workflow during
cancer diagnosis. The dataset comprises 18.69 hours of eye-tracking, mouse
interaction, stimulus tracking, viewport navigation, and diagnostic decision
data (EMSVD) collected from 19 pathologists interpreting 397 WSIs. The data
collection process emphasizes ecological validity through an
application-grounded testbed, called PTAH. In total, we recorded 171,909
fixations, 263,320 saccades, and 1,867,362 mouse interaction events. In
addition, such data could also be used to improve the training of both
pathologists and AI systems that might support human experts. All experiments

### [202] [Group Relative Attention Guidance for Image Editing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24657)
*Xuanpu Zhang,Xuesong Niu,Ruidong Chen,Dan Song,Jianhao Zeng,Penghui Du,Haoxiang Cao,Kai Wu,An-an Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces Group Relative Attention Guidance (GRAG) to improve image editing control in Diffusion-in-Transformer (DiT) models by reweighting token deltas.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current image editing methods using DiT models lack effective control over editing intensity, limiting customization.

Method: They explore the MM-Attention mechanism in the DiT model and introduce GRAG, which adjusts token deltas to achieve fine-grained control over editing intensity.

Result: Experiments demonstrate that GRAG enhances image editing quality and provides smoother, more precise control compared to Classifier-Free Guidance.

Conclusion: GRAG is an efficient and easily integrated method that improves customization and control in image editing within DiT models.

Abstract: Recently, image editing based on Diffusion-in-Transformer models has
undergone rapid development. However, existing editing methods often lack
effective control over the degree of editing, limiting their ability to achieve
more customized results. To address this limitation, we investigate the
MM-Attention mechanism within the DiT model and observe that the Query and Key
tokens share a bias vector that is only layer-dependent. We interpret this bias
as representing the model's inherent editing behavior, while the delta between
each token and its corresponding bias encodes the content-specific editing
signals. Based on this insight, we propose Group Relative Attention Guidance, a
simple yet effective method that reweights the delta values of different tokens
to modulate the focus of the model on the input image relative to the editing
instruction, enabling continuous and fine-grained control over editing
intensity without any tuning. Extensive experiments conducted on existing image
editing frameworks demonstrate that GRAG can be integrated with as few as four
lines of code, consistently enhancing editing quality. Moreover, compared to
the commonly used Classifier-Free Guidance, GRAG achieves smoother and more
precise control over the degree of editing. Our code will be released at
https://github.com/little-misfit/GRAG-Image-Editing.

### [203] [SAGE: Structure-Aware Generative Video Transitions between Diverse Clips](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24667)
*Mia Kan,Yilin Liu,Niloy Mitra*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces SAGE, a zero-shot method for synthesizing high-quality video transitions, outperforming classical and generative methods with structural guidance and generative synthesis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for video transitions struggle with large temporal gaps or significant semantic differences between clips, leading to imperfections like artifacts or lack of coherence.

Method: SAGE employs artistic workflows for structural guidance using line maps and motion flow, combined with generative synthesis to create semantically consistent and visually coherent transitions without requiring fine-tuning.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate that SAGE outperforms both traditional and generative methods in both quantitative metrics and user studies for transitioning diverse clips.

Conclusion: SAGE offers a novel solution for content-aware and visually coherent video transitions, effectively addressing challenges of large temporal and semantic differences in clips.

Abstract: Video transitions aim to synthesize intermediate frames between two clips,
but naive approaches such as linear blending introduce artifacts that limit
professional use or break temporal coherence. Traditional techniques
(cross-fades, morphing, frame interpolation) and recent generative inbetweening
methods can produce high-quality plausible intermediates, but they struggle
with bridging diverse clips involving large temporal gaps or significant
semantic differences, leaving a gap for content-aware and visually coherent
transitions. We address this challenge by drawing on artistic workflows,
distilling strategies such as aligning silhouettes and interpolating salient
features to preserve structure and perceptual continuity. Building on this, we
propose SAGE (Structure-Aware Generative vidEo transitions) as a zeroshot
approach that combines structural guidance, provided via line maps and motion
flow, with generative synthesis, enabling smooth, semantically consistent
transitions without fine-tuning. Extensive experiments and comparison with
current alternatives, namely [FILM, TVG, DiffMorpher, VACE, GI], demonstrate
that SAGE outperforms both classical and generative baselines on quantitative
metrics and user studies for producing transitions between diverse clips. Code
to be released on acceptance.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The study introduces MIC-BEV, a Transformer-based BEV framework for infrastructure-based multi-camera 3D object detection, supported by the new synthetic dataset M2I and achieving robust, state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges faced by existing camera-based detection models in multi-camera infrastructure setups, diverse configurations, sensor degradation, and complex road layouts.

Method: MIC-BEV employs a Transformer-based BEV perception framework with a graph-enhanced fusion module that integrates multi-view image features using geometric and visual cues. The study also provides the synthetic dataset M2I for diverse training conditions.

Result: MIC-BEV achieves state-of-the-art performance in 3D object detection across both synthetic (M2I) and real-world datasets (RoScenes), maintaining robustness even in extreme weather and sensor degradation.

Conclusion: MIC-BEV shows strong potential for real-world deployment in intelligent transportation systems, overcoming challenges and achieving robust and high-performing infrastructure-based perception.

Abstract: Infrastructure-based perception plays a crucial role in intelligent
transportation systems, offering global situational awareness and enabling
cooperative autonomy. However, existing camera-based detection models often
underperform in such scenarios due to challenges such as multi-view
infrastructure setup, diverse camera configurations, degraded visual inputs,
and various road layouts. We introduce MIC-BEV, a Transformer-based
bird's-eye-view (BEV) perception framework for infrastructure-based
multi-camera 3D object detection. MIC-BEV flexibly supports a variable number
of cameras with heterogeneous intrinsic and extrinsic parameters and
demonstrates strong robustness under sensor degradation. The proposed
graph-enhanced fusion module in MIC-BEV integrates multi-view image features
into the BEV space by exploiting geometric relationships between cameras and
BEV cells alongside latent visual cues. To support training and evaluation, we
introduce M2I, a synthetic dataset for infrastructure-based object detection,
featuring diverse camera configurations, road layouts, and environmental
conditions. Extensive experiments on both M2I and the real-world dataset
RoScenes demonstrate that MIC-BEV achieves state-of-the-art performance in 3D
object detection. It also remains robust under challenging conditions,
including extreme weather and sensor degradation. These results highlight the
potential of MIC-BEV for real-world deployment. The dataset and source code are

### [205] [Routing Matters in MoE: Scaling Diffusion Transformers with Explicit Routing Guidance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24711)
*Yujie Wei,Shiwei Zhang,Hangjie Yuan,Yujin Han,Zhekai Chen,Jiayu Wang,Difan Zou,Xihui Liu,Yingya Zhang,Yu Liu,Hongming Shan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces ProMoE, a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) framework for Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) in vision tasks, achieving state-of-the-art results through specialized routing techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current attempts to apply Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) in vision tasks have not yielded significant gains due to differences between language and visual tokens, such as spatial redundancy and functional heterogeneity in the latter.

Method: ProMoE uses a two-step routing mechanism: conditional routing partitions image tokens by their roles, and prototypical routing refines these assignments by leveraging learnable prototypes for enhanced semantic-based allocation. It introduces a routing contrastive loss to boost expert coherence and diversity.

Result: ProMoE outperforms existing approaches on the ImageNet benchmark using both Rectified Flow and DDPM training objectives.

Conclusion: This study highlights the importance of explicit routing guidance and semantic alignment in applying Mixture-of-Experts frameworks to vision tasks. ProMoE demonstrates significant performance improvements and sets a new standard for MoE in visual domains.

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) has emerged as a powerful paradigm for scaling model
capacity while preserving computational efficiency. Despite its notable success
in large language models (LLMs), existing attempts to apply MoE to Diffusion
Transformers (DiTs) have yielded limited gains. We attribute this gap to
fundamental differences between language and visual tokens. Language tokens are
semantically dense with pronounced inter-token variation, while visual tokens
exhibit spatial redundancy and functional heterogeneity, hindering expert
specialization in vision MoE. To this end, we present ProMoE, an MoE framework
featuring a two-step router with explicit routing guidance that promotes expert
specialization. Specifically, this guidance encourages the router to partition
image tokens into conditional and unconditional sets via conditional routing
according to their functional roles, and refine the assignments of conditional
image tokens through prototypical routing with learnable prototypes based on
semantic content. Moreover, the similarity-based expert allocation in latent
space enabled by prototypical routing offers a natural mechanism for
incorporating explicit semantic guidance, and we validate that such guidance is
crucial for vision MoE. Building on this, we propose a routing contrastive loss
that explicitly enhances the prototypical routing process, promoting
intra-expert coherence and inter-expert diversity. Extensive experiments on
ImageNet benchmark demonstrate that ProMoE surpasses state-of-the-art methods
under both Rectified Flow and DDPM training objectives. Code and models will be
made publicly available.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces URSA, a framework that advances discrete video generation by addressing error accumulation and long-context inconsistency issues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve discrete video generation methods and make them competitive with continuous approaches by solving problems like error accumulation and inconsistency.

Method: URSA uses iterative global refinement of discrete spatiotemporal tokens with designs such as Linearized Metric Path and Resolution-dependent Timestep Shifting, along with asynchronous temporal fine-tuning strategies.

Result: Experiments show URSA significantly outperforms current discrete methods and matches the performance of state-of-the-art continuous methods for video and image generation.

Conclusion: URSA proves that discrete video generation methods can be highly efficient and competent by integrating novel designs, fostering scalable high-resolution and long-duration generation.

Abstract: Continuous-space video generation has advanced rapidly, while discrete
approaches lag behind due to error accumulation and long-context inconsistency.
In this work, we revisit discrete generative modeling and present Uniform
discRete diffuSion with metric pAth (URSA), a simple yet powerful framework
that bridges the gap with continuous approaches for the scalable video
generation. At its core, URSA formulates the video generation task as an
iterative global refinement of discrete spatiotemporal tokens. It integrates
two key designs: a Linearized Metric Path and a Resolution-dependent Timestep
Shifting mechanism. These designs enable URSA to scale efficiently to
high-resolution image synthesis and long-duration video generation, while
requiring significantly fewer inference steps. Additionally, we introduce an
asynchronous temporal fine-tuning strategy that unifies versatile tasks within
a single model, including interpolation and image-to-video generation.
Extensive experiments on challenging video and image generation benchmarks
demonstrate that URSA consistently outperforms existing discrete methods and
achieves performance comparable to state-of-the-art continuous diffusion
methods. Code and models are available at https://github.com/baaivision/URSA

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Generative View Stitching (GVS), a new sampling method for camera-guided video generation that is collision-free and achieves long-range coherence by conditioning on both past and future.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve camera-guided video generation by enabling future conditioning and addressing instability caused by autoregressive techniques.

Method: The paper proposes GVS as a sampling algorithm compatible with video models trained using Diffusion Forcing. It incorporates Omni Guidance for temporal consistency by considering past and future conditions.

Result: GVS allows collision-free, stable, and consistent camera-guided video generation, performing well across predefined camera paths, including complex trajectories like the Impossible Staircase.

Conclusion: GVS enables stable camera-guided video generation with long-range coherence and temporal consistency, leveraging existing video diffusion models effectively.

Abstract: Autoregressive video diffusion models are capable of long rollouts that are
stable and consistent with history, but they are unable to guide the current
generation with conditioning from the future. In camera-guided video generation
with a predefined camera trajectory, this limitation leads to collisions with
the generated scene, after which autoregression quickly collapses. To address
this, we propose Generative View Stitching (GVS), which samples the entire
sequence in parallel such that the generated scene is faithful to every part of
the predefined camera trajectory. Our main contribution is a sampling algorithm
that extends prior work on diffusion stitching for robot planning to video
generation. While such stitching methods usually require a specially trained
model, GVS is compatible with any off-the-shelf video model trained with
Diffusion Forcing, a prevalent sequence diffusion framework that we show
already provides the affordances necessary for stitching. We then introduce
Omni Guidance, a technique that enhances the temporal consistency in stitching
by conditioning on both the past and future, and that enables our proposed
loop-closing mechanism for delivering long-range coherence. Overall, GVS
achieves camera-guided video generation that is stable, collision-free,
frame-to-frame consistent, and closes loops for a variety of predefined camera
paths, including Oscar Reutersv\"ard's Impossible Staircase. Results are best

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address inefficiencies and potential improvements in resource allocation within SAP's cloud platform, as this is crucial for optimizing performance in distributed environments.

Method: The research analyzed fine-grained telemetry data over a 30-day period from 1,800 hypervisors and 48,000 VMs to identify inefficiencies in workload management, such as resource contention and imbalances.

Result: The study uncovered suboptimal scheduling conditions such as high CPU contention, imbalanced resource utilization, and overprovisioned resources in the infrastructure.

Conclusion: The authors propose requirements and guidance for new scheduling and placement algorithms, aiming to optimize resource allocation in large-scale cloud infrastructures. They also released their dataset for future research.

Abstract: Allocating resources in a distributed environment is a fundamental challenge.
In this paper, we analyze the scheduling and placement of virtual machines
(VMs) in the cloud platform of SAP, the world's largest enterprise resource
planning software vendor. Based on data from roughly 1,800 hypervisors and
48,000 VMs within a 30-day observation period, we highlight potential
improvements for workload management. The data was measured through
observability tooling that tracks resource usage and performance metrics across
the entire infrastructure. In contrast to existing datasets, ours uniquely
offers fine-grained time-series telemetry data of fully virtualized
enterprise-level workloads from both long-running and memory-intensive SAP
S/4HANA and diverse, general-purpose applications. Our key findings include
several suboptimal scheduling situations, such as CPU resource contention
exceeding 40%, CPU ready times of up to 220 seconds, significantly imbalanced
compute hosts with a maximum CPU~utilization on intra-building block hosts of
up to 99%, and overprovisioned CPU and memory resources resulting into over 80%
of VMs using less than 70% of the provided resources. Bolstered by these
findings, we derive requirements for the design and implementation of novel
placement and scheduling algorithms and provide guidance to optimize resource
allocations. We make the full dataset used in this study publicly available to
enable data-driven evaluations of scheduling approaches for large-scale cloud
infrastructures in future research.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a high-performance compressible reacting flow solver optimized for multi-GPU setups to address challenges in high-speed chemically active flows' simulations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing GPU-based compressible combustion solvers struggle with memory management, load balancing, and localized chemical reaction handling. Overcoming these challenges is critical for efficient simulation of chemically active flows.

Method: The solver uses the AMReX framework and optimizes for multi-GPU functionality. It tackles GPU performance issues through column-major storage, bulk-sparse integration for chemical kinetics, and adaptive mesh refinement load distribution.

Result: The proposed solver achieves 2-5x performance improvements over previous implementations, demonstrates near-ideal weak scaling on up to 96 NVIDIA H100 GPUs, and significantly enhances GPU memory and computation efficiency.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates effective optimization of compressible reacting flow solvers for GPUs, leading to substantial performance gains in simulation of complex combustion processes.

Abstract: High-speed chemically active flows present significant computational
challenges due to their disparate space and time scales, where stiff chemistry
often dominates simulation time. While modern supercomputing scientific codes
achieve exascale performance by leveraging graphics processing units (GPUs),
existing GPU-based compressible combustion solvers face critical limitations in
memory management, load balancing, and handling the highly localized nature of
chemical reactions. To this end, we present a high-performance compressible
reacting flow solver built on the AMReX framework and optimized for multi-GPU
settings. Our approach addresses three GPU performance bottlenecks: memory
access patterns through column-major storage optimization, computational
workload variability via a bulk-sparse integration strategy for chemical
kinetics, and multi-GPU load distribution for adaptive mesh refinement
applications. The solver adapts existing matrix-based chemical kinetics
formulations to multigrid contexts. Using representative combustion
applications including hydrogen-air detonations and jet in supersonic crossflow
configurations, we demonstrate $2-5\times$ performance improvements over
initial GPU implementations with near-ideal weak scaling across $1-96$ NVIDIA
H100 GPUs. Roofline analysis reveals substantial improvements in arithmetic
intensity for both convection ($\sim 10 \times$) and chemistry ($\sim 4
\times$) routines, confirming efficient utilization of GPU memory bandwidth and
computational resources.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Concurrent systems are inherently complex, and understanding and designing them can be challenging. MPST offers an approach to define valid interaction patterns, yet its diverse variations create obstacles for understanding and teaching.

Method: The authors created CoMPSeT, an open-source browser-based tool, that animates, combines, and compares features of MPST through concrete examples.

Result: CoMPSeT allows users to better comprehend MPST features, aids in comparing their semantics, and provides insights for researchers and teachers.

Conclusion: CoMPSeT enhances the accessibility and educational utility of MPST by offering a practical platform to visualize, combine, and understand their diverse features.

Abstract: Concurrent systems are often complex and difficult to design. Choreographic
languages, such as Multiparty Session Types (MPST), allow the description of
global protocols of interactions by capturing valid patterns of interactions
between participants. Many variations of MPST exist, each one with its rather
specific features and idiosyncrasies. Here we propose a tool (CoMPSeT) that
provides clearer insights over different features in existing MPST. We select a
representative set of MPST examples and provide mechanisms to combine different
features and to animate and compare the semantics of concrete examples. CoMPSeT
is open-source, compiled into JavaScript, and can be directly executed from any
browser, becoming useful both for researchers who want to better understand the

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address challenges in automatically forecasting and detecting anomalies in large volumes of time series data while ensuring interpretability.

Method: A modular framework combining ARIMA model enhancements for components like trend, seasonality, and anomalies, integrated into Google Cloud's BigQuery for scalability.

Result: ARIMA_PLUS outperformed existing statistical and neural network models on industry datasets while achieving scalability of forecasting 100 million time series in 1.5 hours.

Conclusion: The framework strikes a balance between high accuracy, scalability, and interpretability, making it suitable for real-world industry applications.

Abstract: Time series forecasting and anomaly detection are common tasks for
practitioners in industries such as retail, manufacturing, advertising and
energy. Two unique challenges stand out: (1) efficiently and accurately
forecasting time series or detecting anomalies in large volumes automatically;
and (2) ensuring interpretability of results to effectively incorporate
business insights. We present ARIMA_PLUS, a novel framework to overcome these
two challenges by a unique combination of (a) accurate and interpretable time
series models and (b) scalable and fully managed system infrastructure. The
model has a sequential and modular structure to handle different components of
the time series, including holiday effects, seasonality, trend, and anomalies,
which enables high interpretability of the results. Novel enhancements are made
to each module, and a unified framework is established to address both
forecasting and anomaly detection tasks simultaneously. In terms of accuracy,
its comprehensive benchmark on the 42 public datasets in the Monash forecasting
repository shows superior performance over not only well-established
statistical alternatives (such as ETS, ARIMA, TBATS, Prophet) but also newer
neural network models (such as DeepAR, N-BEATS, PatchTST, TimeMixer). In terms
of infrastructure, it is directly built into the query engine of BigQuery in
Google Cloud. It uses a simple SQL interface and automates tedious
technicalities such as data cleaning and model selection. It automatically
scales with managed cloud computational and storage resources, making it
possible to forecast 100 million time series using only 1.5 hours with a
throughput of more than 18000 time series per second. In terms of
interpretability, we present several case studies to demonstrate time series
insights it generates and customizability it offers.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for a highly efficient and accurate transductive graph learning algorithm that addresses both homophilic and heterophilic graphs.

Abstract: We present a novel algorithm, \hdgc, that marries graph convolution with
binding and bundling operations in hyperdimensional computing for transductive
graph learning. For prediction accuracy \hdgc outperforms major and popular
graph neural network implementations as well as state-of-the-art
hyperdimensional computing implementations for a collection of homophilic

methodologies we have tested, on the same target GPU platform, \hdgc is on
average 9561.0 and 144.5 times faster than \gcnii, a graph neural network
implementation and HDGL, a hyperdimensional computing implementation,
respectively. As the majority of the learning operates on binary vectors, we
expect outstanding energy performance of \hdgc on neuromorphic and emerging
process-in-memory devices.

### [214] [Chain of Execution Supervision Promotes General Reasoning in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23629)
*Nuo Chen,Zehua Li,Keqin Bao,Junyang Lin,Dayiheng Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces TracePile, a dataset designed to improve reasoning in LLMs through code-based step-by-step rationales called Chain of Execution (CoE). Tested on four models and multiple benchmarks, it shows significant improvements in reasoning tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improving the reasoning ability of large language models by leveraging code due to its logical structure. However, training on raw code is often suboptimal due to implicit reasoning entangled with syntactic noise.

Method: The creation of TracePile, a dataset transforming code execution into explicit step-by-step reasoning (CoE). It spans diverse domains and includes enriched tasks like variable-tracing questions and code rewritings. Three training setups—pretraining, instruction tuning, and fine-tuning—are tested.

Result: Experiments on LLaMA 3, LLaMA 3.1, Qwen-2.5, and Qwen-2.5 Coder show consistent improvements in benchmarks spanning math, code, logic, and algorithms. Notably, TracePile enhanced LLaMA 3.1-8B performance by 7.1% across nine math datasets.

Conclusion: TracePile effectively enhances reasoning capabilities of large language models by converting code execution into explicit rationales. The dataset demonstrates clear benefits in reasoning tasks across various domains.

Abstract: Building robust and general reasoning ability is a central goal in the
development of large language models (LLMs). Recent efforts increasingly turn
to code as a rich training source, given its inherent logical structure and
diverse reasoning paradigms such as divide-and-conquer, topological ordering,
and enumeration. However, reasoning in code is often expressed implicitly and
entangled with syntactic or implementation noise, making direct training on raw
code suboptimal.To address this, we introduce TracePile, a large-scale corpus
of 2.6 million samples that transforms code execution into explicit,
step-by-step chain-of-thought-style rationales, which we call Chain of
Execution (CoE). The corpus spans domains including mathematics, classical
algorithms and algorithmic competition, and is enriched with variable-tracing
questions and code rewritings to enhance logical granularity and code
diversity. We evaluate TracePile using three training setups:
continue-pretraining, instruction tuning after pretraining, and two-stage
finetuning. Experiments across four base models (LLaMA 3, LLaMA 3.1, Qwen-2.5,
and Qwen-2.5 Coder) and 20 benchmarks covering math, code, logic, and
algorithms demonstrate consistent improvements. Notably, TracePile boosts
LLaMA3.1-8B by 7.1\% on average across nine math datasets and delivers clear
gains on LiveCodeBench, CRUX, and MMLU under two-stage fine-tuning.

### [215] [An Enhanced Dual Transformer Contrastive Network for Multimodal Sentiment Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23617)
*Phuong Q. Dao,Mark Roantree,Vuong M. Ngo*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes new transformer-based models, BERT-ViT-EF and its extension DTCN, for improving multimodal sentiment analysis using text and images. It demonstrates enhanced accuracy and F1 scores on benchmark datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve the understanding of human emotions in multimodal sentiment analysis by jointly analyzing text and images, realizing a richer and more accurate interpretation than unimodal approaches.

Method: The authors introduce a model (BERT-ViT-EF) combining BERT for text and ViT for images using an early fusion strategy. They further extend this with DTCN, adding a Transformer encoder for deeper textual context and utilizing contrastive learning for robust multimodal feature alignment.

Result: DTCN achieves state-of-the-art results on sentiment analysis benchmarks with 78.4% accuracy and 78.3% F1 on TumEmo, and competitive performance on MVSA-Single with 76.6% accuracy and 75.9% F1.

Conclusion: Early fusion and deeper contextual modeling in transformer-based multimodal sentiment analysis enhance both accuracy and robustness, as evidenced by empirical results.

Abstract: Multimodal Sentiment Analysis (MSA) seeks to understand human emotions by
jointly analyzing data from multiple modalities typically text and images
offering a richer and more accurate interpretation than unimodal approaches. In
this paper, we first propose BERT-ViT-EF, a novel model that combines powerful
Transformer-based encoders BERT for textual input and ViT for visual input
through an early fusion strategy. This approach facilitates deeper cross-modal
interactions and more effective joint representation learning. To further
enhance the model's capability, we propose an extension called the Dual
Transformer Contrastive Network (DTCN), which builds upon BERT-ViT-EF. DTCN
incorporates an additional Transformer encoder layer after BERT to refine
textual context (before fusion) and employs contrastive learning to align text
and image representations, fostering robust multimodal feature learning.
Empirical results on two widely used MSA benchmarks MVSA-Single and TumEmo
demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. DTCN achieves best accuracy
(78.4%) and F1-score (78.3%) on TumEmo, and delivers competitive performance on
MVSA-Single, with 76.6% accuracy and 75.9% F1-score. These improvements
highlight the benefits of early fusion and deeper contextual modeling in
Transformer-based multimodal sentiment analysis.

### [216] [Speeding Up MACE: Low-Precision Tricks for Equivarient Force Fields](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23621)
*Alexandre Benoit*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores optimizing machine-learning force fields (MACE) on GPUs using reduced-precision arithmetic and optimized kernels to improve speed without compromising accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High computational cost of accurate molecular dynamics simulations motivates finding faster and cheaper methods while preserving physical fidelity.

Method: The authors analyze computational bottlenecks, compare GPU backends (e3nn vs. NVIDIA cuEquivariance), and evaluate reduced-precision settings for molecular dynamics simulations and training.

Result: cuEquivariance backend improves inference latency by 3x, and mixed FP16/BF16 linear layers yield an additional 4x speedup while maintaining accuracy in simulations. Mixed precision training shows degraded force RMSE.

Conclusion: Mixed-precision settings and cuEquivariance enable faster simulations with negligible accuracy loss in downstream MD. Training should remain in FP32 to avoid performance degradation. Further improvements are expected with advanced GPU architectures and optimized kernels.

Abstract: Machine-learning force fields can deliver accurate molecular dynamics (MD) at
high computational cost. For SO(3)-equivariant models such as MACE, there is
little systematic evidence on whether reduced-precision arithmetic and
GPU-optimized kernels can cut this cost without harming physical fidelity. This
thesis aims to make MACE cheaper and faster while preserving accuracy by
identifying computational bottlenecks and evaluating low-precision execution
policies. We profile MACE end-to-end and per block, compare the e3nn and NVIDIA
cuEquivariance backends, and assess FP64/FP32/BF16/FP16 settings (with FP32
accumulation) for inference, short NVT and long NPT water simulations, and toy
training runs under reproducible, steady-state timing. cuEquivariance reduces
inference latency by about $3\times$. Casting only linear layers to BF16/FP16
within an FP32 model yields roughly 4x additional speedups, while energies and
thermodynamic observables in NVT/NPT MD remain within run-to-run variability.
Half-precision weights during training degrade force RMSE. Mixing e3nn and cuEq
modules without explicit adapters causes representation mismatches. Fused
equivariant kernels and mixed-precision inference can substantially accelerate
state-of-the-art force fields with negligible impact on downstream MD. A
practical policy is to use cuEquivariance with FP32 by default and enable
BF16/FP16 for linear layers (keeping FP32 accumulations) for maximum
throughput, while training remains in FP32. Further gains are expected on
Ampere/Hopper GPUs (TF32/BF16) and from kernel-level FP16/BF16 paths and
pipeline fusion.

### [217] [Adversarially-Aware Architecture Design for Robust Medical AI Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23622)
*Alyssa Gerhart,Balaji Iyangar*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Adversarial attacks in AI healthcare systems endanger patient safety, notably via misclassifications in dermatological models. Partial defenses reduce risks but require better integration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the vulnerabilities of AI systems in healthcare exposed to adversarial attacks, which can lead to misdiagnoses and harm patient safety, especially in underserved groups.

Method: Empirical experimentation on a dermatological dataset, threat modeling, experimental benchmarking, and model evaluation of defenses such as adversarial training and distillation.

Result: Adversarial attacks significantly reduce classification accuracy; defenses mitigate attack success rates but impact the model's performance on clean data.

Conclusion: Healthcare AI should integrate technical, ethical, and policy measures to improve resilience and equitability while balancing defenses and clean data performance.

Abstract: Adversarial attacks pose a severe risk to AI systems used in healthcare,
capable of misleading models into dangerous misclassifications that can delay
treatments or cause misdiagnoses. These attacks, often imperceptible to human
perception, threaten patient safety, particularly in underserved populations.
Our study explores these vulnerabilities through empirical experimentation on a
dermatological dataset, where adversarial methods significantly reduce
classification accuracy. Through detailed threat modeling, experimental
benchmarking, and model evaluation, we demonstrate both the severity of the
threat and the partial success of defenses like adversarial training and
distillation. Our results show that while defenses reduce attack success rates,
they must be balanced against model performance on clean data. We conclude with
a call for integrated technical, ethical, and policy-based approaches to build
more resilient, equitable AI in healthcare.

### [218] [DiNo and RanBu: Lightweight Predictions from Shallow Random Forests](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23624)
*Tiago Mendonça dos Santos,Rafael Izbicki,Luís Gustavo Esteves*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes two shallow-forest methods to enhance inference efficiency in Random Forest models for tabular data. These methods significantly reduce latency and memory usage while maintaining accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Random Forests are widely utilized for tabular prediction tasks but struggle with high inference latency and memory demands, making them unsuitable for latency-sensitive and resource-constrained environments.

Method: The authors introduce DiNo and RanBu—methods that convert depth-limited Random Forest trees into efficient predictors by leveraging cophenetic distances and kernel smoothing, respectively. These approaches require no additional tree growth and minimal parameter tuning.

Result: Across diverse datasets, RanBu outperforms full-depth Random Forests in noisy environments with up to a 95% reduction in computational time. DiNo achieves optimal accuracy-cost trade-off in low-noise settings.

Conclusion: Both methods enhance the efficiency of Random Forest ensembles while maintaining accuracy, making them suitable for resource-constrained environments. Extensions to other domains remain a future research opportunity.

Abstract: Random Forest ensembles are a strong baseline for tabular prediction tasks,
but their reliance on hundreds of deep trees often results in high inference
latency and memory demands, limiting deployment in latency-sensitive or
resource-constrained environments. We introduce DiNo (Distance with Nodes) and
RanBu (Random Bushes), two shallow-forest methods that convert a small set of
depth-limited trees into efficient, distance-weighted predictors. DiNo measures
cophenetic distances via the most recent common ancestor of observation pairs,
while RanBu applies kernel smoothing to Breiman's classical proximity measure.
Both approaches operate entirely after forest training: no additional trees are
grown, and tuning of the single bandwidth parameter $h$ requires only
lightweight matrix-vector operations. Across three synthetic benchmarks and 25
public datasets, RanBu matches or exceeds the accuracy of full-depth random
forests-particularly in high-noise settings-while reducing training plus
inference time by up to 95\%. DiNo achieves the best bias-variance trade-off in
low-noise regimes at a modest computational cost. Both methods extend directly
to quantile regression, maintaining accuracy with substantial speed gains. The
implementation is available as an open-source R/C++ package at
https://github.com/tiagomendonca/dirf. We focus on structured tabular random
samples (i.i.d.), leaving extensions to other modalities for future work.

### [219] [From Detection to Discovery: A Closed-Loop Approach for Simultaneous and Continuous Medical Knowledge Expansion and Depression Detection on Social Media](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23626)
*Shuang Geng,Wenli Zhang,Jiaheng Xie,Rui Wang,Sudha Ram*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper develops a Closed-Loop LLM-Knowledge Graph framework to enhance depression detection accuracy while expanding medical knowledge using social media user-generated content.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve depression prediction using social media while simultaneously enriching medical knowledge through predictive analytics.

Method: A Closed-Loop LLM-Knowledge Graph framework where LLM detects depression and extracts entities while knowledge graphs refine predictions, continuously evolving knowledge under expert supervision.

Result: The framework improves predictive accuracy and contributes to medical understanding by identifying new symptoms, relationships, and social triggers not covered in existing literature.

Conclusion: This approach advances predictive analytics by enabling mutual reinforcement of prediction and learning, providing a dynamic system adaptable to other risk monitoring contexts.

Abstract: Social media user-generated content (UGC) provides real-time, self-reported
indicators of mental health conditions such as depression, offering a valuable
source for predictive analytics. While prior studies integrate medical
knowledge to improve prediction accuracy, they overlook the opportunity to
simultaneously expand such knowledge through predictive processes. We develop a
Closed-Loop Large Language Model (LLM)-Knowledge Graph framework that
integrates prediction and knowledge expansion in an iterative learning cycle.
In the knowledge-aware depression detection phase, the LLM jointly performs
depression detection and entity extraction, while the knowledge graph
represents and weights these entities to refine prediction performance. In the
knowledge refinement and expansion phase, new entities, relationships, and
entity types extracted by the LLM are incorporated into the knowledge graph
under expert supervision, enabling continual knowledge evolution. Using
large-scale UGC, the framework enhances both predictive accuracy and medical
understanding. Expert evaluations confirmed the discovery of clinically
meaningful symptoms, comorbidities, and social triggers complementary to
existing literature. We conceptualize and operationalize
prediction-through-learning and learning-through-prediction as mutually
reinforcing processes, advancing both methodological and theoretical
understanding in predictive analytics. The framework demonstrates the
co-evolution of computational models and domain knowledge, offering a
foundation for adaptive, data-driven knowledge systems applicable to other
dynamic risk monitoring contexts.

### [220] [Differential Privacy: Gradient Leakage Attacks in Federated Learning Environments](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23931)
*Miguel Fernandez-de-Retana,Unai Zulaika,Rubén Sánchez-Corcuera,Aitor Almeida*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The study explores how Differential Privacy mechanisms can mitigate Gradient Leakage Attacks in Federated Learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address vulnerabilities in Federated Learning due to Gradient Leakage Attacks, which compromise data security.

Method: Investigated DP mechanisms (DP-SGD and PDP-SGD), assessing performance of computer vision models on privacy-defense trade-offs.

Result: DP-SGD effectively reduces leakage risks but impacts model utility; PDP-SGD achieves classification performance but fails to prevent reconstruction attacks.

Conclusion: Evaluation of privacy mechanisms is essential in FL, as theoretical guarantees alone cannot ensure security against data leakage.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) allows for the training of Machine Learning models in
a collaborative manner without the need to share sensitive data. However, it
remains vulnerable to Gradient Leakage Attacks (GLAs), which can reveal private
information from the shared model updates. In this work, we investigate the
effectiveness of Differential Privacy (DP) mechanisms - specifically, DP-SGD
and a variant based on explicit regularization (PDP-SGD) - as defenses against
GLAs. To this end, we evaluate the performance of several computer vision
models trained under varying privacy levels on a simple classification task,
and then analyze the quality of private data reconstructions obtained from the
intercepted gradients in a simulated FL environment. Our results demonstrate
that DP-SGD significantly mitigates the risk of gradient leakage attacks,
albeit with a moderate trade-off in model utility. In contrast, PDP-SGD
maintains strong classification performance but proves ineffective as a
practical defense against reconstruction attacks. These findings highlight the
importance of empirically evaluating privacy mechanisms beyond their
theoretical guarantees, particularly in distributed learning scenarios where
information leakage may represent an unassumable critical threat to data
security and privacy.

### [221] [NUM2EVENT: Interpretable Event Reasoning from Numerical time-series](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23630)
*Ninghui Feng,Yiyan Qi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a method for improving large language models (LLMs) in reasoning over numerical time-series data by decoding latent events and providing explanations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs exhibit limitations in understanding numerical time-series data and lack methods to uncover latent events and explain the reasoning behind numerical changes.

Method: The authors propose a reasoning-aware framework that combines an agent-guided event extractor (AGE), a marked multivariate Hawkes-based synthetic generator (EveDTS), and a time-series encoder with a structured decoder in a two-stage fine-tuning pipeline.

Result: The proposed method outperforms existing LLM baselines in event-level precision and recall in experiments conducted on multi-domain datasets.

Conclusion: The framework proposed bridges the gap between quantitative reasoning and semantic understanding, enabling LLMs to infer structured events and reasoning directly from numerical data.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated impressive multimodal
reasoning capabilities, yet their understanding of purely numerical time-series
signals remains limited. Existing approaches mainly focus on forecasting or
trend description, without uncovering the latent events that drive numerical
changes or explaining the reasoning process behind them. In this work, we
introduce the task of number-to-event reasoning and decoding, which aims to
infer interpretable structured events from numerical inputs, even when current
text is unavailable. To address the data scarcity and semantic alignment
challenges, we propose a reasoning-aware framework that integrates an
agent-guided event extractor (AGE), a marked multivariate Hawkes-based
synthetic generator (EveDTS), and a two-stage fine-tuning pipeline combining a
time-series encoder with a structured decoder. Our model explicitly reasons
over numerical changes, generates intermediate explanations, and outputs
structured event hypotheses. Experiments on multi-domain datasets show that our
method substantially outperforms strong LLM baselines in event-level precision
and recall. These results suggest a new direction for bridging quantitative
reasoning and semantic understanding, enabling LLMs to explain and predict
events directly from numerical dynamics.

### [222] [Beyond Pairwise: Empowering LLM Alignment With Ranked Choice Modeling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23631)
*Yuxuan Tang,Yifan Feng*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Ranked Choice Preference Optimization (RCPO), a new framework for optimizing large language model alignment using richer human feedback like rankings rather than pairwise comparisons.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current alignment techniques in large language models rely heavily on pairwise preferences, which limits the feedback richness and potentially undermines optimization efficacy.

Method: The authors propose RCPO, a unified framework that incorporates ranked choice modeling via maximum likelihood estimation, supporting both utility-based and rank-based models. They implement Multinomial Logit and Mallows-RMJ choice models in this approach.

Result: Experimental results on Llama-3-8B-Instruct and Gemma-2-9B-it models across benchmarks (AlpacaEval 2 and Arena-Hard) demonstrate RCPO's consistent superiority over existing pairwise feedback methods.

Conclusion: RCPO provides a flexible and effective method for leveraging ranked preference data in LLMs, offering a stronger foundation for future alignment techniques through choice modeling.

Abstract: Alignment of large language models (LLMs) has predominantly relied on
pairwise preference optimization, where annotators select the better of two
responses to a prompt. While simple, this approach overlooks the opportunity to
learn from richer forms of human feedback, such as multiwise comparisons and
top-$k$ rankings. We propose Ranked Choice Preference Optimization (RCPO), a
unified framework that bridges preference optimization with (ranked) choice
modeling via maximum likelihood estimation. The framework is flexible,
supporting both utility-based and rank-based choice models. It subsumes several
existing pairwise methods (e.g., DPO, SimPO), while providing principled
training objectives for richer feedback formats. We instantiate this framework
with two representative ranked choice models (Multinomial Logit and
Mallows-RMJ). Empirical studies on Llama-3-8B-Instruct and Gemma-2-9B-it across
AlpacaEval 2 and Arena-Hard benchmarks show that RCPO consistently outperforms
competitive baselines. RCPO shows how directly leveraging ranked preference
data, combined with the right choice models, yields more effective alignment.
It offers a versatile and extensible foundation for incorporating (ranked)
choice modeling into LLM training.

*Alexander Bakarsky,Dimitar I. Dimitrov,Maximilian Baader,Martin Vechev*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Federated learning faces challenges from privacy attacks like gradient inversion. The paper introduces SPEAR++, improving upon SPEAR via dictionary learning techniques to enhance practicality for larger batch sizes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address privacy concerns in federated learning, specifically targeting the theoretical and practical limitations of current gradient inversion attacks.

Method: SPEAR++ leverages dictionary learning techniques to improve the efficiency of SPEAR for gradient inversion in federated learning setups, focusing on linear layers with ReLU activations.

Result: SPEAR++ maintains robustness to DP noise and FedAvg aggregation while increasing applicability to batch sizes 10 times larger compared to SPEAR.

Conclusion: SPEAR++ offers a more practical and scalable solution for gradient inversion attacks in federated learning without compromising robustness or desirable theoretical properties.

Abstract: Federated Learning has seen an increased deployment in real-world scenarios
recently, as it enables the distributed training of machine learning models
without explicit data sharing between individual clients. Yet, the introduction
of the so-called gradient inversion attacks has fundamentally challenged its
privacy-preserving properties. Unfortunately, as these attacks mostly rely on
direct data optimization without any formal guarantees, the vulnerability of
real-world systems remains in dispute and requires tedious testing for each new
federated deployment. To overcome these issues, recently the SPEAR attack was
introduced, which is based on a theoretical analysis of the gradients of linear
layers with ReLU activations. While SPEAR is an important theoretical
breakthrough, the attack's practicality was severely limited by its exponential
runtime in the batch size b. In this work, we fill this gap by applying
State-of-the-Art techniques from Sparsely-Used Dictionary Learning to make the
problem of gradient inversion on linear layers with ReLU activations tractable.
Our experiments demonstrate that our new attack, SPEAR++, retains all desirable
properties of SPEAR, such as robustness to DP noise and FedAvg aggregation,
while being applicable to 10x bigger batch sizes.

*Guozhong Li,Muhannad Alhumaidi,Spiros Skiadopoulos,Panos Kalnis*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LLMCOMP proposes a novel lossy compression approach using large language models for scientific datasets and achieves superior compression ratios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High-resolution scientific simulations generate vast datasets, making efficient and error-bounded compression frameworks essential.

Method: LLMCOMP involves quantizing 3D fields into tokens, arranging via Z-order curves, sampling for efficiency, and training an autoregressive transformer with spatial-temporal embeddings.

Result: Experiments demonstrate LLMCOMP achieves up to 30% higher compression ratios compared to leading methods, maintaining strict error bounds.

Conclusion: LLM-based compression showcases promising capability as a general-purpose solution for handling scientific spatiotemporal data efficiently.

Abstract: The rapid growth of high-resolution scientific simulations and observation
systems is generating massive spatiotemporal datasets, making efficient,
error-bounded compression increasingly important. Meanwhile, decoder-only large
language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in modeling
complex sequential data. In this paper, we propose LLMCOMP, a novel lossy
compression paradigm that leverages decoder-only large LLMs to model scientific
data. LLMCOMP first quantizes 3D fields into discrete tokens, arranges them via
Z-order curves to preserve locality, and applies coverage-guided sampling to
enhance training efficiency. An autoregressive transformer is then trained with
spatial-temporal embeddings to model token transitions. During compression, the
model performs top-k prediction, storing only rank indices and fallback
corrections to ensure strict error bounds. Experiments on multiple reanalysis
datasets show that LLMCOMP consistently outperforms state-of-the-art
compressors, achieving up to 30% higher compression ratios under strict error
bounds. These results highlight the potential of LLMs as general-purpose
compressors for high-fidelity scientific data.

### [225] [Generalized Linear Bandits with Limited Adaptivity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06831)
*Ayush Sawarni,Nirjhar Das,Siddharth Barman,Gaurav Sinha*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces two algorithms for addressing limited adaptivity in generalized linear contextual bandit problems while achieving competitive regret bounds.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenge of updating policies in generalized linear contextual bandit problems under limited adaptivity settings.

Method: The paper prescribes two algorithms. 'B-GLinCB' schedules a fixed number of policy updates upfront and works in stochastic feature settings, while 'RS-GLinCB' adaptively performs updates under adversarial feature conditions.

Result: It achieves competitive regret bounds: $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{T})$ for both algorithms, with minimal query requirements and eliminating dependence on a key non-linearity parameter $\kappa$.

Conclusion: These algorithms demonstrate novel approaches for handling limited adaptivity constraints in contextual bandit problems and provide independent insights for generalized linear reward models.

Abstract: We study the generalized linear contextual bandit problem within the
constraints of limited adaptivity. In this paper, we present two algorithms,
$\texttt{B-GLinCB}$ and $\texttt{RS-GLinCB}$, that address, respectively, two
prevalent limited adaptivity settings. Given a budget $M$ on the number of
policy updates, in the first setting, the algorithm needs to decide upfront $M$
rounds at which it will update its policy, while in the second setting it can
adaptively perform $M$ policy updates during its course. For the first setting,
we design an algorithm $\texttt{B-GLinCB}$, that incurs $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{T})$
regret when $M = \Omega( \log{\log T} )$ and the arm feature vectors are
generated stochastically. For the second setting, we design an algorithm
$\texttt{RS-GLinCB}$ that updates its policy $\tilde{O}(\log^2 T)$ times and
achieves a regret of $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{T})$ even when the arm feature vectors
are adversarially generated. Notably, in these bounds, we manage to eliminate
the dependence on a key instance dependent parameter $\kappa$, that captures
non-linearity of the underlying reward model. Our novel approach for removing
this dependence for generalized linear contextual bandits might be of
independent interest.

*Xun Su,Hiroyuki Kasai*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Pretrained diffusion models are enhanced to solve inverse problems by incorporating a new noise combination method.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses a challenge in incorporating observation information into pretrained diffusion models, balancing between over-disruption of the generative process and insufficient emphasis on constraints from inverse problems.

Method: The authors propose Noise Combination Sampling, synthesizing an optimal noise vector to embed conditional information naturally without step-wise hyperparameter tuning during the denoising process.

Result: The method yields superior performance, particularly in cases of smaller generation steps, with negligible computational overhead, improving robustness and stability.

Conclusion: Noise Combination Sampling successfully optimizes diffusion models for inverse problems, overcoming limitations in prior approaches and enhancing performance, especially in terms of stability and computational efficiency.

Abstract: Pretrained diffusion models have demonstrated strong capabilities in
zero-shot inverse problem solving by incorporating observation information into
the generation process of the diffusion models. However, this presents an
inherent dilemma: excessive integration can disrupt the generative process,
while insufficient integration fails to emphasize the constraints imposed by
the inverse problem. To address this, we propose \emph{Noise Combination
Sampling}, a novel method that synthesizes an optimal noise vector from a noise
subspace to approximate the measurement score, replacing the noise term in the
standard Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models process. This enables
conditional information to be naturally embedded into the generation process
without reliance on step-wise hyperparameter tuning. Our method can be applied
to a wide range of inverse problem solvers, including image compression, and,
particularly when the number of generation steps $T$ is small, achieves
superior performance with negligible computational overhead, significantly
improving robustness and stability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to enhance human preference learning frameworks by utilizing response time data, which is currently underexploited, to improve reward models for generative AI systems.

Method: The authors utilize the Evidence Accumulation Drift Diffusion model and design novel Neyman-orthogonal loss functions to incorporate response time alongside binary preference data.

Result: The approach shifts error rate scaling from exponential to polynomial in linear functions and ensures convergence in non-parametric reward models, proving significant improvements in sample efficiency.

Conclusion: Incorporating response times leads to better reward model learning frameworks, validated both theoretically and experimentally with improved efficiency, accuracy, and realism.

Abstract: This paper investigates the integration of response time data into human
preference learning frameworks for more effective reward model elicitation.
While binary preference data has become fundamental in fine-tuning foundation
models, generative AI systems, and other large-scale models, the valuable
temporal information inherent in user decision-making remains largely
unexploited. We propose novel methodologies to incorporate response time
information alongside binary choice data, leveraging the Evidence Accumulation
Drift Diffusion (EZ) model, under which response time is informative of the
preference strength. We develop Neyman-orthogonal loss functions that achieve
oracle convergence rates for reward model learning, matching the theoretical
optimal rates that would be attained if the expected response times for each
query were known a priori. Our theoretical analysis demonstrates that for
linear reward functions, conventional preference learning suffers from error
rates that scale exponentially with reward magnitude. In contrast, our response
time-augmented approach reduces this to polynomial scaling, representing a
significant improvement in sample efficiency. We extend these guarantees to
non-parametric reward function spaces, establishing convergence properties for
more complex, realistic reward models. Our extensive experiments validate our
theoretical findings in the context of preference learning over images.

### [228] [Monotone and Separable Set Functions: Characterizations and Neural Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23634)
*Soutrik Sarangi,Yonatan Sverdlov,Nadav Dym,Abir De*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Explores Monotone and Separating (MAS) set functions to preserve set order, provides theoretical results and introduces a novel weak MAS model for practical applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address set containment problems and design vector representations that preserve the natural partial order of sets, S⊆T → F(S)≤F(T).

Method: Proposed and analyzed MAS functions, established dimension bounds, introduced a weak MAS model for infinite ground sets, and validated experimentally.

Result: MAS functions were theoretically investigated along with the weak MAS model, showing its benefits in performance compared to non-monotone-biased models.

Conclusion: MAS functions are useful for designing universal models with monotone approximation properties, and the weak MAS model offers practical stability and performance advantages in set containment tasks.

Abstract: Motivated by applications for set containment problems, we consider the
following fundamental problem: can we design set-to-vector functions so that
the natural partial order on sets is preserved, namely $S\subseteq T \text{ if
and only if } F(S)\leq F(T) $. We call functions satisfying this property
Monotone and Separating (MAS) set functions. % We establish lower and upper
bounds for the vector dimension necessary to obtain MAS functions, as a
function of the cardinality of the multisets and the underlying ground set. In
the important case of an infinite ground set, we show that MAS functions do not
exist, but provide a model called our which provably enjoys a relaxed MAS
property we name "weakly MAS" and is stable in the sense of Holder continuity.
We also show that MAS functions can be used to construct universal models that
are monotone by construction and can approximate all monotone set functions.
Experimentally, we consider a variety of set containment tasks. The experiments
show the benefit of using our our model, in comparison with standard set models
which do not incorporate set containment as an inductive bias. Our code is
available in https://github.com/yonatansverdlov/Monotone-Embedding.

### [229] [Local Performance vs. Out-of-Distribution Generalization: An Empirical Analysis of Personalized Federated Learning in Heterogeneous Data Environments](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24503)
*Mortesa Hussaini,Jan Theiß,Anthony Stein*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper evaluates Federated Learning (FL) approaches under heterogeneous data and proposes an enhanced method called Federated Learning with Individualized Updates (FLIU).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the suboptimal aggregation of local updates in Federated Learning due to heterogeneous data distributions and improve generalization capabilities.

Method: Introduce FLIU, a modified FedAvg algorithm with an individualization step and adaptive personalization factor, and evaluate it under diverse data distribution scenarios.

Result: FLIU demonstrated improved robustness and generalization over standard approaches (FedAvg) on datasets like MNIST and CIFAR-10.

Conclusion: FLIU enhances the balance between local model performance and generalization in Federated Learning under different data heterogeneities.

Abstract: In the context of Federated Learning with heterogeneous data environments,
local models tend to converge to their own local model optima during local
training steps, deviating from the overall data distributions. Aggregation of
these local updates, e.g., with FedAvg, often does not align with the global
model optimum (client drift), resulting in an update that is suboptimal for
most clients. Personalized Federated Learning approaches address this challenge
by exclusively focusing on the average local performances of clients' models on
their own data distribution. Generalization to out-of-distribution samples,
which is a substantial benefit of FedAvg and represents a significant component
of robustness, appears to be inadequately incorporated into the assessment and
evaluation processes. This study involves a thorough evaluation of Federated
Learning approaches, encompassing both their local performance and their
generalization capabilities. Therefore, we examine different stages within a
single communication round to enable a more nuanced understanding of the
considered metrics. Furthermore, we propose and incorporate a modified approach
of FedAvg, designated as Federated Learning with Individualized Updates (FLIU),
extending the algorithm by a straightforward individualization step with an
adaptive personalization factor. We evaluate and compare the approaches
empirically using MNIST and CIFAR-10 under various distributional conditions,
including benchmark IID and pathological non-IID, as well as additional novel
test environments with Dirichlet distribution specifically developed to stress
the algorithms on complex data heterogeneity.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The study evaluates Skeptical Learning (SKEL) in real-world scenarios with actual users to improve annotation quality while balancing user effort.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Digital personal assistants rely on high-quality annotations to function effectively, but user-provided or inferred annotations can be noisy, requiring improved methods to ensure data accuracy.

Method: Researchers utilized the SKEL technique, integrating input refinement from end-users, and tested the method using the iLog mobile application among university students over a four-week period.

Result: The study found challenges in achieving a balance between user effort and data quality, demonstrating benefits like reduced annotation effort and improved data accuracy through SKEL.

Conclusion: Incorporating user feedback in SKEL enhances data quality and reduces annotation workload, showing promise for real-world application in personal assistants.

Abstract: Any digital personal assistant, whether used to support task performance,
answer questions, or manage work and daily life, including fitness schedules,
requires high-quality annotations to function properly. However, user
annotations, whether actively produced or inferred from context (e.g., data
from smartphone sensors), are often subject to errors and noise. Previous
research on Skeptical Learning (SKEL) addressed the issue of noisy labels by
comparing offline active annotations with passive data, allowing for an
evaluation of annotation accuracy. However, this evaluation did not include
confirmation from end-users, the best judges of their own context. In this
study, we evaluate SKEL's performance in real-world conditions with actual
users who can refine the input labels based on their current perspectives and
needs. The study involves university students using the iLog mobile application
on their devices over a period of four weeks. The results highlight the
challenges of finding the right balance between user effort and data quality,
as well as the potential benefits of using SKEL, which include reduced
annotation effort and improved quality of collected data.

Motivation: Flight delays in air traffic management highlight inefficiencies affecting network performance, necessitating accurate prediction techniques.

Method: The paper uses a language model-based multimodal approach that integrates trajectory data and aeronautical text information, enabling enhanced delay prediction through cross-modality adaptation.

Result: The experimental results demonstrate sub-minute prediction accuracy while leveraging contextual information related to delay sources.

Conclusion: The proposed approach combines linguistic and trajectory data effectively, proving scalability and practicality for real-time flight delay prediction updates in real-world operations.

Abstract: Flight delay prediction has become a key focus in air traffic management, as
delays highlight inefficiencies that impact overall network performance. This
paper presents a lightweight large language model-based multimodal flight delay
prediction, formulated from the perspective of air traffic controllers
monitoring aircraft delay after entering the terminal area. The approach
integrates trajectory representations with textual aeronautical information,
including flight information, weather reports, and aerodrome notices, by
adapting trajectory data into the language modality to capture airspace
conditions. Experimental results show that the model consistently achieves
sub-minute prediction error by effectively leveraging contextual information
related to the sources of delay. The framework demonstrates that linguistic
understanding, when combined with cross-modality adaptation of trajectory
information, enhances delay prediction. Moreover, the approach shows
practicality and scalability for real-world operations, supporting real-time
updates that refine predictions upon receiving new operational information.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation stems from the inefficiency of current language-based methods for premise selection, which overlook the interconnected relationships in formal libraries.

Method: The authors developed a method integrating dense text embeddings with graph neural networks applied to a heterogeneous dependency graph capturing state--premise and premise--premise relations.

Result: Their approach achieved an over 25% improvement compared to the ReProver baseline on the LeanDojo Benchmark across standard retrieval metrics.

Conclusion: Integrating relational information via graph structures enhances the effectiveness of premise selection in theorem proving systems.

Abstract: Premise selection is a key bottleneck for scaling theorem proving in large
formal libraries. Yet existing language-based methods often treat premises in
isolation, ignoring the web of dependencies that connects them. We present a
graph-augmented approach that combines dense text embeddings of Lean
formalizations with graph neural networks over a heterogeneous dependency graph
capturing both state--premise and premise--premise relations. On the LeanDojo
Benchmark, our method outperforms the ReProver language-based baseline by over
25% across standard retrieval metrics. These results demonstrate the power of
relational information for more effective premise selection.

*Ignavier Ng,Patrick Blöbaum,Siddharth Bhandari,Kun Zhang,Shiva Kasiviswanathan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes a method to reduce biases in reward models by identifying non-spurious variables using theoretical and practical techniques, improving alignment with human preferences.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the issue of spurious correlations in reward models used for aligning large language models with human preferences, such as biases involving response length, discrimination, and conceptual bias.

Method: A principled framework is introduced, involving a data formulation that distinguishes between spurious and non-spurious latent variables. Variational inference is applied to extract non-spurious variables, which are then used in a method for training the reward models.

Result: The proposed method reduces issues from spurious correlations and achieves stronger performance on both synthetic and real-world datasets.

Conclusion: This work provides a promising approach to creating more robust and unbiased reward models, leading to better alignment of language models with intended human preferences.

Abstract: Recent alignment techniques, such as reinforcement learning from human
feedback, have been widely adopted to align large language models with human
preferences by learning and leveraging reward models. In practice, these models
often exploit spurious correlations, involving, e.g., response length,
discrimination, sycophancy, and conceptual bias, which is a problem that has
received increasing attention. In this work, we propose a principled framework
that mitigates these biases in reward models while preserving the underlying
factors that reflect intended preferences. We first provide a formulation of
the data-generating process, assuming that the observed data (e.g., text) is
generated from both spurious and non-spurious latent variables. We show that,
interestingly, these non-spurious latent variables can be theoretically
identified from data, regardless of whether a surrogate for the spurious latent
variables is available. This further inspires a practical method that uses
variational inference to recover these variables and leverages them to train
reward models. Experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate
that our method effectively mitigates spurious correlation issues and yields
more robust reward models.

TL;DR: MuMo is a multimodal molecular representation framework designed to overcome 3D conformer instability and modality collapse, achieving significant performance improvements over baseline methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multimodal molecular models are hindered by challenges such as 3D conformer unreliability and modality collapse, limiting their robustness and generalization in molecular representation tasks.

Method: MuMo introduces a Structured Fusion Pipeline (SFP) to integrate 2D topology and 3D geometry into stable structural priors and a Progressive Injection (PI) mechanism to asymmetrically infuse these priors into sequence streams for enhanced cross-modal enrichment.

Result: MuMo outperformed baselines across 29 benchmark tasks, achieving an average improvement of 2.7%, ranking first on 22 tasks, and demonstrating a significant 27% improvement on the LD50 task.

Conclusion: MuMo effectively enhances molecular representation by addressing 3D conformer instability and modality collapse through structured multimodal fusion strategies, supported by robust experimental validation.

Abstract: Multimodal molecular models often suffer from 3D conformer unreliability and
modality collapse, limiting their robustness and generalization. We propose
MuMo, a structured multimodal fusion framework that addresses these challenges
in molecular representation through two key strategies. To reduce the
instability of conformer-dependent fusion, we design a Structured Fusion
Pipeline (SFP) that combines 2D topology and 3D geometry into a unified and
stable structural prior. To mitigate modality collapse caused by naive fusion,
we introduce a Progressive Injection (PI) mechanism that asymmetrically
integrates this prior into the sequence stream, preserving modality-specific
modeling while enabling cross-modal enrichment. Built on a state space
backbone, MuMo supports long-range dependency modeling and robust information
propagation. Across 29 benchmark tasks from Therapeutics Data Commons (TDC) and
MoleculeNet, MuMo achieves an average improvement of 2.7% over the
best-performing baseline on each task, ranking first on 22 of them, including a
27% improvement on the LD50 task. These results validate its robustness to 3D
conformer noise and the effectiveness of multimodal fusion in molecular
representation. The code is available at: github.com/selmiss/MuMo.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces "Chimera," a hybrid system combining LLMs, symbolic constraints, and causal reasoning, and demonstrates its effectiveness in mitigating risks in high-stakes decision-making environments compared to LLM-only approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large Language Models exhibit risks and brittleness when deployed autonomously in high-stakes scenarios, leading to unpredictable and catastrophic outcomes.

Method: The authors propose Chimera, a neuro-symbolic-causal architecture blending LLM strategy, symbolic constraints with formal verification, and a causal inference module. It is tested in a simulated e-commerce environment to evaluate reliability and performance.

Result: Chimera outperformed baseline systems in profitability and brand trust. It achieved consistent returns up to $2.2M and reduced risks while ensuring prompt-agnostic robustness with zero constraint violations across all testing scenarios.

Conclusion: Architectural design is crucial to ensure reliability and robustness of autonomous agents, surpassing reliance on prompt engineering. Consequently, Chimera demonstrates the potential of integrated neuro-symbolic systems for safer decision-making in high-stake domains.

Abstract: Large language models show promise as autonomous decision-making agents, yet
their deployment in high-stakes domains remains fraught with risk. Without
architectural safeguards, LLM agents exhibit catastrophic brittleness:
identical capabilities produce wildly different outcomes depending solely on
prompt framing. We present Chimera, a neuro-symbolic-causal architecture that
integrates three complementary components - an LLM strategist, a formally
verified symbolic constraint engine, and a causal inference module for
counterfactual reasoning. We benchmark Chimera against baseline architectures
(LLM-only, LLM with symbolic constraints) across 52-week simulations in a
realistic e-commerce environment featuring price elasticity, trust dynamics,
and seasonal demand. Under organizational biases toward either volume or margin
optimization, LLM-only agents fail catastrophically (total loss of \$99K in
volume scenarios) or destroy brand trust (-48.6% in margin scenarios). Adding
symbolic constraints prevents disasters but achieves only 43-87% of Chimera's
profit. Chimera consistently delivers the highest returns (\$1.52M and \$1.96M
respectively, some cases +\$2.2M) while improving brand trust (+1.8% and
+10.8%, some cases +20.86%), demonstrating prompt-agnostic robustness. Our TLA+
formal verification proves zero constraint violations across all scenarios.
These results establish that architectural design not prompt engineering
determines the reliability of autonomous agents in production environments. We
provide open-source implementations and interactive demonstrations for
reproducibility.

*Sumanta Roy,Bahador Bahmani,Ioannis G. Kevrekidis,Michael D. Shields*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Introduces a physics-informed operator learning approach utilizing the Resolution Independent Neural Operator (RINO) to handle challenges in unevenly distributed multi-resolution data without relying on training datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the dependence of operator learning frameworks on high-fidelity and large training datasets, which are often challenging to obtain, especially when datasets have multi-resolution and uneven discretization.

Method: The study extends the RINO framework to a fully data-free setup by projecting arbitrarily discretized input functions into a latent embedding space using pre-trained basis functions. A multi-layer perceptron (MLP) is then utilized to approximate the operator alongside spatiotemporal coordinates. The PDE constraints are enforced using a finite difference solver.

Result: Validated on multiple numerical examples with datasets of varying resolutions, showing successful learning and performance improvements for coarse and fine discretizations.

Conclusion: The proposed method successfully overcomes challenges associated with multi-resolution datasets and data scarcity in operator learning, demonstrating its utility for real-world engineering applications.

Abstract: The predictive accuracy of operator learning frameworks depends on the
quality and quantity of available training data (input-output function pairs),
often requiring substantial amounts of high-fidelity data, which can be
challenging to obtain in some real-world engineering applications. These
datasets may be unevenly discretized from one realization to another, with the
grid resolution varying across samples. In this study, we introduce a
physics-informed operator learning approach by extending the Resolution
Independent Neural Operator (RINO) framework to a fully data-free setup,
addressing both challenges simultaneously. Here, the arbitrarily (but
sufficiently finely) discretized input functions are projected onto a latent
embedding space (i.e., a vector space of finite dimensions), using pre-trained
basis functions. The operator associated with the underlying partial
differential equations (PDEs) is then approximated by a simple multi-layer
perceptron (MLP), which takes as input a latent code along with spatiotemporal
coordinates to produce the solution in the physical space. The PDEs are
enforced via a finite difference solver in the physical space. The validation
and performance of the proposed method are benchmarked on several numerical
examples with multi-resolution data, where input functions are sampled at
varying resolutions, including both coarse and fine discretizations.

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Spatially Aware Linear Transformer (SAL-T), a more resource-efficient model for high-energy particle collision analysis, achieving results comparable to full-attention transformers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformers are powerful for analyzing high-energy particle collisions but are computationally expensive due to quadratic complexity, posing challenges in high-data-throughput environments like CERN's LHC.

Method: The proposed SAL-T model enhances the linformer architecture by incorporating spatially aware partitioning of particles based on their kinematic features and using convolutional layers to capture local physical correlations.

Result: SAL-T outperforms standard linformer models in jet classification tasks, achieves comparable results to full-attention transformers, and demonstrates its effectiveness on a generic point cloud dataset (ModelNet10) with lower resource demands and latency.

Conclusion: SAL-T addresses both efficiency and accuracy challenges in high-energy physics and other domains, offering a viable alternative to traditional transformer models for resource-constrained environments.

Abstract: Transformers are very effective in capturing both global and local
correlations within high-energy particle collisions, but they present
deployment challenges in high-data-throughput environments, such as the CERN
LHC. The quadratic complexity of transformer models demands substantial
resources and increases latency during inference. In order to address these
issues, we introduce the Spatially Aware Linear Transformer (SAL-T), a
physics-inspired enhancement of the linformer architecture that maintains
linear attention. Our method incorporates spatially aware partitioning of
particles based on kinematic features, thereby computing attention between
regions of physical significance. Additionally, we employ convolutional layers
to capture local correlations, informed by insights from jet physics. In
addition to outperforming the standard linformer in jet classification tasks,
SAL-T also achieves classification results comparable to full-attention
transformers, while using considerably fewer resources with lower latency
during inference. Experiments on a generic point cloud classification dataset
(ModelNet10) further confirm this trend. Our code is available at

TL;DR: The paper introduces metrics to measure the monitorability of AI's reasoning chains, focusing on legibility and coverage. These metrics aim to ensure safety and transparency for AI systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to ensure AI systems remain monitorable through their reasoning processes, addressing the risk that changes in training practices or architecture may reduce transparency.

Method: The authors propose and implement metrics, legibility and coverage, with a prompted autorater to assess existing AI Chain-of-Thought (CoT) explanations.

Result: Metrics were tested on synthetic CoT degradations and applied to frontier AI models, demonstrating high monitorability of their reasoning processes.

Conclusion: The metrics provide a useful tool for developers to evaluate design impacts on AI transparency, complementing stress-tests for robustness against evasive behaviors.

Abstract: While Chain-of-Thought (CoT) monitoring offers a unique opportunity for AI
safety, this opportunity could be lost through shifts in training practices or
model architecture. To help preserve monitorability, we propose a pragmatic way
to measure two components of it: legibility (whether the reasoning can be
followed by a human) and coverage (whether the CoT contains all the reasoning
needed for a human to also produce the final output). We implement these
metrics with an autorater prompt that enables any capable LLM to compute the
legibility and coverage of existing CoTs. After sanity-checking our prompted
autorater with synthetic CoT degradations, we apply it to several frontier
models on challenging benchmarks, finding that they exhibit high
monitorability. We present these metrics, including our complete autorater
prompt, as a tool for developers to track how design decisions impact
monitorability. While the exact prompt we share is still a preliminary version
under ongoing development, we are sharing it now in the hopes that others in
the community will find it useful. Our method helps measure the default
monitorability of CoT - it should be seen as a complement, not a replacement,
for the adversarial stress-testing needed to test robustness against
deliberately evasive models.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LRQK reduces GPU memory costs in LLMs during long-context inference, ensuring memory efficiency with minimal accuracy loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address GPU memory limitations posed by long-context inference in LLMs and improve efficiency without sacrificing numerical precision or retention quality.

Method: Introducing Low Rank Query and Key attention (LRQK), which decomposes query and key matrices during the prefill stage and uses mixed GPU-CPU caching to optimize attention computation.

Result: LRQK matches or surpasses existing sparse-attention methods while significantly reducing memory usage and maintaining accuracy in benchmarks like RULER and LongBench.

Conclusion: LRQK is an effective solution for efficient long-context inference in LLMs, combining computational speed, memory reduction, and accuracy preservation.

Abstract: As the length of input text grows, the key-value (KV) cache in LLMs imposes
prohibitive GPU memory costs and limits long-context inference on resource
constrained devices. Existing approaches, such as KV quantization and pruning,
reduce memory usage but suffer from numerical precision loss or suboptimal
retention of key-value pairs. We introduce Low Rank Query and Key attention
(LRQK), a two-stage framework that jointly decomposes the full-precision query
and key matrices into compact rank-\(r\) factors during the prefill stage, and
then uses these low-dimensional projections to compute proxy attention scores
in \(\mathcal{O}(lr)\) time at each decode step. By selecting only the
top-\(k\) tokens and a small fixed set of recent tokens, LRQK employs a mixed
GPU-CPU cache with a hit-and-miss mechanism that transfers only missing
full-precision KV pairs, thereby preserving exact attention outputs while
reducing CPU-GPU data movement. Extensive experiments on the RULER and
LongBench benchmarks with LLaMA-3-8B and Qwen2.5-7B demonstrate that LRQK
matches or surpasses leading sparse-attention methods in long context settings,
while delivering significant memory savings with minimal loss in accuracy. Our
code is available at https://github.com/tenghuilee/LRQK.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes CLP, a new layer pruning framework for large language models that significantly improves computational efficiency and model performance retention compared to previous techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Layer pruning methods disrupt model information flow due to ignorance of inter-layer dependencies and reliance on hand-crafted metrics, making optimization on resource-constrained devices challenging.

Method: The proposed CLP framework includes a differentiable concave gate algorithm for identifying optimal layer segments and a cutoff endpoint tuning strategy to restore performance through fine-tuning adjacent layers.

Result: CLP outperforms existing methods in preserving performance, achieving 95.34% retention on LLaMA3-70B at 20% pruning, while also allowing integration with quantization for further compression.

Conclusion: CLP addresses inefficiencies in layer pruning for LLMs, offering a more performance-effective and computationally resourceful approach suitable for edge devices.

Abstract: Although large language models (LLMs) have achieved revolutionary
breakthroughs in many fields, their large model size and high computational
cost pose significant challenges for practical deployment on
resource-constrained edge devices. To this end, layer pruning has been proposed
to reduce the computational overhead by directly removing redundant layers.
However, existing layer pruning methods typically rely on hand-crafted metrics
to evaluate and remove individual layers, while ignoring the dependencies
between layers. This can disrupt the model's information flow and severely
degrade performance. To address these issues, we propose CLP, a novel
continuous layer pruning framework that introduces two key innovations: a
differentiable concave gate algorithm that automatically identifies the best
continuous layer segments for pruning via gradient-based optimization; and a
cutoff endpoint tuning strategy that effectively restores model performance by
fine-tuning only the layers adjacent to the pruned segments. Extensive
experiments across multiple model architectures (including LLaMA2, LLaMA3 and
Qwen) and sizes (from $7$B to $70$B parameters) show that CLP significantly
outperforms existing state-of-the-art baselines. For example, at a pruning rate
of $20\%$, CLP achieves an average performance retention of $95.34\%$ on
LLaMA3-70B, outperforming baselines by $4.29\%$-$30.52\%$. Furthermore, CLP can
be seamlessly combined with quantization to further compress the model with
only a slight performance loss.

### [243] [Optimal Arm Elimination Algorithms for Combinatorial Bandits](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23992)
*Yuxiao Wen,Yanjun Han,Zhengyuan Zhou*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel elimination scheme for combinatorial bandits to overcome challenges in adapting arm elimination methods, improving exploration efficacy and achieving near-optimal regret.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Combinatorial bandits face challenges in exploiting multiple arms per round for applications like recommendation systems and assortment optimization, pushing the need for efficient arm elimination strategies.

Method: A partition-based arm elimination scheme categorizing arms into confirmed, active, and eliminated sets, paired with explicit exploration mechanisms.

Result: The algorithm achieves near-optimal regret in combinatorial multi-armed bandit and combinatorial linear contextual bandit scenarios, overcoming UCB-based limitations.

Conclusion: Explicit exploration mechanisms in combinatorial bandits greatly improve performance and address shortcomings of existing arm elimination methods, fulfilling lower bounds in regret optimization.

Abstract: Combinatorial bandits extend the classical bandit framework to settings where
the learner selects multiple arms in each round, motivated by applications such
as online recommendation and assortment optimization. While extensions of upper
confidence bound (UCB) algorithms arise naturally in this context, adapting arm
elimination methods has proved more challenging. We introduce a novel
elimination scheme that partitions arms into three categories (confirmed,
active, and eliminated), and incorporates explicit exploration to update these
sets. We demonstrate the efficacy of our algorithm in two settings: the
combinatorial multi-armed bandit with general graph feedback, and the
combinatorial linear contextual bandit. In both cases, our approach achieves
near-optimal regret, whereas UCB-based methods can provably fail due to
insufficient explicit exploration. Matching lower bounds are also provided.

### [244] [Error Adjustment Based on Spatiotemporal Correlation Fusion for Traffic Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23656)
*Fuqiang Liu,Weiping Ding,Luis Miranda-Moreno,Lijun Sun*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel framework (SAEA) to improve traffic forecasting by correcting for spatiotemporally autocorrelated errors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors identify a limitation in existing DNN-based traffic forecasting models, where autocorrelated errors from spatiotemporal data are overlooked, thereby hindering their performance.

Method: The proposed method, Spatiotemporally Autocorrelated Error Adjustment (SAEA), uses a spatiotemporal vector autoregressive process to model prediction errors. It embeds this model into a new cost function and incorporates spatial regularization based on road network structures.

Result: The effectiveness of the SAEA framework is demonstrated through experiments on various traffic datasets, showing performance improvements across multiple traffic forecasting models.

Conclusion: The study concludes that addressing autocorrelated errors in traffic forecasts through the novel SAEA framework leads to significant enhancements in model performance, with potential general applications in spatiotemporal data modeling.

Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) play a significant role in an increasing body of
research on traffic forecasting due to their effectively capturing
spatiotemporal patterns embedded in traffic data. A general assumption of
training the said forecasting models via mean squared error estimation is that
the errors across time steps and spatial positions are uncorrelated. However,
this assumption does not really hold because of the autocorrelation caused by
both the temporality and spatiality of traffic data. This gap limits the
performance of DNN-based forecasting models and is overlooked by current
studies. To fill up this gap, this paper proposes Spatiotemporally
Autocorrelated Error Adjustment (SAEA), a novel and general framework designed
to systematically adjust autocorrelated prediction errors in traffic
forecasting. Unlike existing approaches that assume prediction errors follow a
random Gaussian noise distribution, SAEA models these errors as a
spatiotemporal vector autoregressive (VAR) process to capture their intrinsic
dependencies. First, it explicitly captures both spatial and temporal error
correlations by a coefficient matrix, which is then embedded into a newly
formulated cost function. Second, a structurally sparse regularization is
introduced to incorporate prior spatial information, ensuring that the learned
coefficient matrix aligns with the inherent road network structure. Finally, an
inference process with test-time error adjustment is designed to dynamically
refine predictions, mitigating the impact of autocorrelated errors in real-time
forecasting. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is verified on
different traffic datasets. Results across a wide range of traffic forecasting
models show that our method enhances performance in almost all cases.

*Saklain Niam,Tashfiqur Rahman,Md. Amjad Patwary,Mukarram Hossain*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The study proposes a machine learning framework for predicting germination rate enhancements in seeds exposed to cold plasma. Extra Trees model showed the highest performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To optimize eco-friendly seed germination enhancement using cold plasma and address unpredictable outcomes due to complex interactions.

Method: Developed machine learning models (ET, GB, XGB, hybrid) to predict germination uplift, identifying key factors affecting germination.

Result: Extra Trees model exhibited the highest accuracy (R² = 0.919), with maximum germination observed under specific plasma conditions (7–15 kV, 200–500s exposure, discharge power ≥100W).

Conclusion: This study successfully integrates machine learning to improve predictability and decision-making in cold plasma seed germination, advancing precision agriculture.

Abstract: Cold plasma (CP) is an eco-friendly method to enhance seed germination, yet
outcomes remain difficult to predict due to complex seed--plasma--environment
interactions. This study introduces the first machine learning framework to
forecast germination uplift in soybean, barley, sunflower, radish, and tomato
under dielectric barrier discharge (DBD) plasma. Among the models tested (GB,
XGB, ET, and hybrids), Extra Trees (ET) performed best (R\textsuperscript{2} =
0.919; RMSE = 3.21; MAE = 2.62), improving to R\textsuperscript{2} = 0.925
after feature reduction. Engineering analysis revealed a hormetic response:
negligible effects at $<$7 kV or $<$200 s, maximum germination at 7--15 kV for
200--500 s, and reduced germination beyond 20 kV or prolonged exposures.
Discharge power was also a dominant factor, with germination rate maximizing at
$\geq$100 W with low exposure time. Species and cultivar-level predictions
showed radish (MAE = 1.46) and soybean (MAE = 2.05) were modeled with high
consistency, while sunflower remained slightly higher variable (MAE = 3.80).
Among cultivars, Williams (MAE = 1.23) and Sari (1.33) were well predicted,
while Arian (2.86) and Ny\'{\i}rs\'{e}gi fekete (3.74) were comparatively
poorly captured. This framework was also embedded into MLflow, providing a
decision-support tool for optimizing CP seed germination in precision
agriculture.

### [246] [Perception Learning: A Formal Separation of Sensory Representation Learning from Decision Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24356)
*Suman Sanyal*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces Perception Learning (PeL), a paradigm separating sensory data optimization from decision-making processes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To optimize sensory interfaces with task-agnostic signals, enhancing stability and informativeness in representations without relying on downstream tasks.

Method: PeL utilizes objective representation-invariant metrics to evaluate and optimize perceptual properties independently from decision models.

Result: PeL ensures perceptual properties like stability, informativeness, and controlled geometry, demonstrating orthogonality to Bayes task-risk gradients.

Conclusion: PeL offers a framework for evaluating and certifying perceptual quality, ensuring optimization decoupled from specific tasks.

Abstract: We introduce Perception Learning (PeL), a paradigm that optimizes an agent's
sensory interface $f_\phi:\mathcal{X}\to\mathcal{Z}$ using task-agnostic
signals, decoupled from downstream decision learning
$g_\theta:\mathcal{Z}\to\mathcal{Y}$. PeL directly targets label-free
perceptual properties, such as stability to nuisances, informativeness without
collapse, and controlled geometry, assessed via objective
representation-invariant metrics. We formalize the separation of perception and
decision, define perceptual properties independent of objectives or
reparameterizations, and prove that PeL updates preserving sufficient
invariants are orthogonal to Bayes task-risk gradients. Additionally, we
provide a suite of task-agnostic evaluation metrics to certify perceptual
quality.

*Vaibhav Jindal,Hejian Sang,Chun-Mao Lai,Yanning Chen,Zhipeng Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces ELBO-KTO, a novel approach for aligning diffusion language models (dLLMs) to human preferences without pairwise preference data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a need for effective methods to align dLLMs, which are alternative generators to autoregressive models, to human preferences due to challenges in sequence log-likelihood and costly pairwise data collection.

Method: ELBO-KTO combines ELBO surrogate for diffusion log-likelihoods with a prospect-based preference optimization technique called Kahneman Tversky Optimization (KTO). Methods for variance reduction further stabilize training.

Result: Using the approach, LLaDA-8B-Instruct achieves high adjusted win rates (65.9% and 62.3%) and comparable or better performance in multiple downstream tasks like GSM8K and MMLU.

Conclusion: Unpaired preference optimization, enabled by ELBO-KTO, offers a capable alternative to pairwise alignment in diffusion LLMs.

Abstract: Diffusion language models (dLLMs) are an emerging alternative to
autoregressive (AR) generators, but aligning them to human preferences is
challenging because sequence log-likelihoods are intractable and pairwise
preference data are costly to collect. We introduce ELBO-KTO, which combines an
ELBO surrogate for diffusion log-likelihoods with a prospect-theoretic,
unpaired preference objective (Kahneman Tversky Optimization, KTO). We analyze
the bias and variance induced by the ELBO substitution and employ
variance-reduction practices that stabilize gradients during training. Applied
to LLaDA-8B-Instruct, ELBO-KTO yields \textbf{65.9\%} and \textbf{62.3\%}
adjusted win rates on kto-mix-14k and UltraFeedback-Binary, respectively,
versus the base model under an automatic LLM judge. Across downstream tasks,
including GSM8K, MMLU, and additional reasoning/knowledge benchmarks, ELBO-KTO
trained on UltraFeedback-Binary performs on par with or better than the base
model under identical decoding. This establishes unpaired preference
optimization as a viable alternative to pairwise alignment in diffusion LLMs.

TL;DR: The paper explores a hybrid modeling approach combining ResNet-50 and Quantum Support Vector Machines (QSVM) for potato disease classification, achieving superior performance over traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current image classification tasks, such as potato disease detection, often struggle with high-dimensional datasets that cause inefficiencies. Advanced computational approaches like quantum computing offer a promising solution.

Method: This study uses ResNet-50 for feature extraction, dimensionality reduction via Principal Component Analysis (PCA), and Quantum Support Vector Machines with quantum feature maps to classify potato diseases.

Result: The Z-feature map-based Quantum Support Vector Machine model achieved an accuracy of 99.23%, outperforming classical machine learning models, such as Support Vector Machine and Random Forest.

Conclusion: Integrating quantum computing into classical machine learning models enhances image classification accuracy, with a potential application in agricultural disease detection.

Abstract: Recently, there has been growing attention on combining quantum machine
learning (QML) with classical deep learning approaches, as computational
techniques are key to improving the performance of image classification tasks.
This study presents a hybrid approach that uses ResNet-50 (Residual Network)
for feature extraction and Quantum Support Vector Machines (QSVM) for
classification in the context of potato disease detection. Classical machine
learning as well as deep learning models often struggle with high-dimensional
and complex datasets, necessitating advanced techniques like quantum computing
to improve classification efficiency. In our research, we use ResNet-50 to
extract deep feature representations from RGB images of potato diseases. These
features are then subjected to dimensionality reduction using Principal
Component Analysis (PCA). The resulting features are processed through QSVM
models which apply various quantum feature maps such as ZZ, Z, and Pauli-X to
transform classical data into quantum states. To assess the model performance,
we compared it with classical machine learning algorithms such as Support
Vector Machine (SVM) and Random Forest (RF) using five-fold stratified
cross-validation for comprehensive evaluation. The experimental results
demonstrate that the Z-feature map-based QSVM outperforms classical models,
achieving an accuracy of 99.23 percent, surpassing both SVM and RF models. This
research highlights the advantages of integrating quantum computing into image
classification and provides a potential disease detection solution through
hybrid quantum-classical modeling.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper presents a quantum-classical hybrid neural network model for pneumonia detection, showing improved accuracy and efficiency compared to classical CNNs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address challenges in pneumonia detection using CNNs, such as high computational cost, limited feature extraction, and inefficiencies with smaller datasets.

Method: A Quanvolutional Neural Network (QNN) is proposed, integrating quantum computing to extract enhanced features from image patches, which are then classified by a classical neural network.

Result: The QNN achieves a validation accuracy of 83.33%, outperforming a classical CNN's accuracy of 73.33%.

Conclusion: QNNs hold promise for efficient and accurate medical image analysis in diagnostic systems, particularly with limited labeled data.

Abstract: Pneumonia poses a significant global health challenge, demanding accurate and
timely diagnosis. While deep learning, particularly Convolutional Neural
Networks (CNNs), has shown promise in medical image analysis for pneumonia
detection, CNNs often suffer from high computational costs, limitations in
feature representation, and challenges in generalizing from smaller datasets.
To address these limitations, we explore the application of Quanvolutional
Neural Networks (QNNs), leveraging quantum computing for enhanced feature
extraction. This paper introduces a novel hybrid quantum-classical model for
pneumonia detection using the PneumoniaMNIST dataset. Our approach utilizes a
quanvolutional layer with a parameterized quantum circuit (PQC) to process 2x2
image patches, employing rotational Y-gates for data encoding and entangling
layers to generate non-classical feature representations. These
quantum-extracted features are then fed into a classical neural network for
classification. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed QNN achieves
a higher validation accuracy of 83.33 percent compared to a comparable
classical CNN which achieves 73.33 percent. This enhanced convergence and
sample efficiency highlight the potential of QNNs for medical image analysis,
particularly in scenarios with limited labeled data. This research lays the
foundation for integrating quantum computing into deep-learning-driven medical
diagnostic systems, offering a computationally efficient alternative to
traditional approaches.

*Padmanabhan Jagannathan Prajesh,Kaliaperumal Ragunath,Miriam Gordon,Bruce Rathgeber,Suresh Neethirajan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper presents the Spatiotemporal Vision Transformer with Wavelets (ST-ViWT) to accurately map and reconstruct CO2 fields from OCO-2 satellite data over agricultural landscapes, achieving high accuracy metrics and uncertainty quantification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation of this research is to accurately map CO2 concentrations (XCO2) over agricultural landscapes for better emission mitigation strategies, specifically focusing on data gaps and uncertainties in high-density poultry regions.

Method: The authors proposed the Spatiotemporal Vision Transformer with Wavelets (ST-ViWT), which uses wavelet time-frequency representations combined with transformer attention. It integrates inputs like meteorology, vegetation indices, topography, and land cover to produce seamless CO2 fields.

Result: The model achieved high accuracy with an R2 of 0.984 and RMSE of 0.468 ppm on OCO-2 data, filled 92.3% of gaps with predictions within ±1 ppm, and demonstrated strong generalization on independent validation (e.g., TCCON). It captured seasonal variability and relationships between poultry density and higher CO2 levels.

Conclusion: The ST-ViWT provides scalable and transparent solutions for satellite-driven carbon mapping and hotspot prioritization. It allows integration with emission inventories and precision agriculture platforms for improved mitigation strategies.

Abstract: Accurate mapping of column-averaged CO2 (XCO2) over agricultural landscapes
is essential for guiding emission mitigation strategies. We present a
Spatiotemporal Vision Transformer with Wavelets (ST-ViWT) framework that
reconstructs continuous, uncertainty-quantified XCO2 fields from OCO-2 across
southern Canada, emphasizing poultry-intensive regions. The model fuses wavelet
time-frequency representations with transformer attention over meteorology,
vegetation indices, topography, and land cover. On 2024 OCO-2 data, ST-ViWT
attains R2 = 0.984 and RMSE = 0.468 ppm; 92.3 percent of gap-filled predictions
lie within +/-1 ppm. Independent validation with TCCON shows robust
generalization (bias = -0.14 ppm; r = 0.928), including faithful reproduction
of the late-summer drawdown. Spatial analysis across 14 poultry regions reveals
a moderate positive association between facility density and XCO2 (r = 0.43);
high-density areas exhibit larger seasonal amplitudes (9.57 ppm) and enhanced
summer variability. Compared with conventional interpolation and standard
machine-learning baselines, ST-ViWT yields seamless 0.25 degree CO2 surfaces
with explicit uncertainties, enabling year-round coverage despite sparse
observations. The approach supports integration of satellite constraints with
national inventories and precision livestock platforms to benchmark emissions,
refine region-specific factors, and verify interventions. Importantly,
transformer-based Earth observation enables scalable, transparent, spatially
explicit carbon accounting, hotspot prioritization, and policy-relevant
mitigation assessment.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a framework to systematically extract ordered eigenfunctions from contextual kernels, validating its utility in improving feature selection on image datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current representation learning methods fail to recover exact spectral decompositions needed for understanding feature importance and ordering.

Method: A modular framework combining low-rank approximation and Rayleigh quotient optimization to extract identifiable eigenfunctions from contextual kernels.

Result: Validated on synthetic kernels and real-world image datasets, the framework's eigenvalues serve as importance scores for adaptive feature selection with efficiency-accuracy tradeoffs.

Conclusion: The proposed approach clearly advances feature extraction methods by enabling spectral decomposition for adaptive-dimensional representations.

Abstract: Recent advances in representation learning reveal that widely used
objectives, such as contrastive and non-contrastive, implicitly perform
spectral decomposition of a contextual kernel, induced by the relationship
between inputs and their contexts. Yet, these methods recover only the linear
span of top eigenfunctions of the kernel, whereas exact spectral decomposition
is essential for understanding feature ordering and importance. In this work,
we propose a general framework to extract ordered and identifiable
eigenfunctions, based on modular building blocks designed to satisfy key
desiderata, including compatibility with the contextual kernel and scalability
to modern settings. We then show how two main methodological paradigms,
low-rank approximation and Rayleigh quotient optimization, align with this
framework for eigenfunction extraction. Finally, we validate our approach on
synthetic kernels and demonstrate on real-world image datasets that the
recovered eigenvalues act as effective importance scores for feature selection,
enabling principled efficiency-accuracy tradeoffs via adaptive-dimensional
representations.

TL;DR: TEMPEST leverages compressed file formats for efficient representation learning using transformers, significantly reducing token count and improving computational efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Despite the efficiency of compressed file formats for storage and transmission, their potential in representation learning has not been thoroughly explored.

Method: TEMPEST uses the byte-stream structure of compressed files to design a tokenization and encoding strategy, enabling transformers to directly learn semantic representations without full decoding.

Result: TEMPEST reduces computational and memory requirements while achieving competitive accuracy across diverse datasets and modalities.

Conclusion: Using compressed data streams for representation learning provides a computationally efficient approach that maintains high semantic classification accuracy.

Abstract: Compressed file formats are the corner stone of efficient data storage and
transmission, yet their potential for representation learning remains largely
underexplored. We introduce TEMPEST (TransformErs froM comPressed
rEpreSenTations), a method that exploits the inherent byte-stream structure of
compressed files to design an effective tokenization and encoding strategy. By
leveraging this compact encoding, a standard transformer can directly learn
semantic representations from compressed data streams, bypassing the need for
raw byte-level processing or full media decoding. Our proposal substantially
reduces the number of tokens required for semantic classification, thereby
lowering both computational complexity and memory usage. Through extensive
experiments across diverse datasets, coding schemes, and modalities, we show
that TEMPEST achieves accuracy competitive wit the state-of-the-art while
delivering efficiency gains in memory and compute.

*Di Wu,Chengshuai Shi,Jing Yang,Cong Shen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper addresses gaps in theoretical understanding of RLHF, particularly focusing on performance guarantees for general preference models instead of reward-based Bradley-Terry models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve the theoretical foundation of RLHF, especially for general preference models, which have shown practical relevance but pose significant challenges compared to canonical RL.

Method: Greedy sampling algorithms leveraging the structural properties of the KL-regularized target, without relying on optimistic or pessimistic estimates as in prior research.

Result: Achieved major, order-wise performance improvements for general preference models, and demonstrated the sufficiency of direct empirical estimates under RLHF.

Conclusion: Greedy sampling showed surprising efficacy for RLHF, providing deeper insights into optimal policy structures and enriching the theoretical understanding of the methodology.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) has emerged as a key
technique for post-training large language models. Despite its empirical
success, the theoretical understanding of RLHF is still limited, as learning
the KL-regularized target with only preference feedback poses additional
challenges compared with canonical RL. Existing works mostly study the
reward-based Bradley-Terry (BT) preference model, and extend classical designs
utilizing optimism or pessimism. This work, instead, considers the general
preference model (whose practical relevance has been observed recently) and
obtains performance guarantees with major, order-wise improvements over
existing ones. Surprisingly, these results are derived from algorithms that
directly use the empirical estimates (i.e., greedy sampling), as opposed to
constructing optimistic or pessimistic estimates in previous works. This
insight has a deep root in the unique structural property of the optimal policy
class under the KL-regularized target, and we further specialize it to the BT
model, highlighting the surprising sufficiency of greedy sampling in RLHF.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Structural topology optimization (TO) often faces computational challenges due to complex physics and constraints. This paper introduces OAT, a deep-learning framework that efficiently predicts optimal topologies across various conditions, achieving significant compliance reduction and fast computation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The aim is to overcome computational intensity and limitations in existing deep-learning approaches for topology optimization, which restrict their application scope.

Method: OAT (Optimize Any Topology) employs an autoencoder, an implicit neural-field decoder, and a conditional latent-diffusion model trained on the OpenTO dataset, which contains 2.2 million structures. It focuses on generality and efficiency across diverse configurations and resolutions.

Result: OAT demonstrates a reduction of mean compliance by up to 90%, outperforms prior models, and ensures sub-1-second inference across resolutions and aspect ratios. It shows robust performance in public benchmarks and unseen tests.

Conclusion: OAT represents a significant advancement as a fast and versatile framework for topology optimization, addressing prior limitations and promoting further research through its large dataset and open-source tools.

Abstract: Structural topology optimization (TO) is central to engineering design but
remains computationally intensive due to complex physics and hard constraints.
Existing deep-learning methods are limited to fixed square grids, a few
hand-coded boundary conditions, and post-hoc optimization, preventing general
deployment. We introduce Optimize Any Topology (OAT), a foundation-model
framework that directly predicts minimum-compliance layouts for arbitrary
aspect ratios, resolutions, volume fractions, loads, and fixtures. OAT combines
a resolution- and shape-agnostic autoencoder with an implicit neural-field
decoder and a conditional latent-diffusion model trained on OpenTO, a new
corpus of 2.2 million optimized structures covering 2 million unique
boundary-condition configurations. On four public benchmarks and two
challenging unseen tests, OAT lowers mean compliance up to 90% relative to the
best prior models and delivers sub-1 second inference on a single GPU across
resolutions from 64 x 64 to 256 x 256 and aspect ratios as high as 10:1. These
results establish OAT as a general, fast, and resolution-free framework for
physics-aware topology optimization and provide a large-scale dataset to spur
further research in generative modeling for inverse design. Code & data can be

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper presents a hybrid framework combining STL decomposition with LSTM, ARIMA, and XGBoost for enhanced traffic flow forecasting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current single-model approaches struggle to accurately forecast traffic flow due to its complex, nonlinear, and multiscale temporal patterns.

Method: The proposed framework uses STL to decompose traffic data into trend, seasonal, and residual components, which are then modeled by LSTM, ARIMA, and XGBoost respectively, with predictions integrated multiplicatively.

Result: The hybrid framework outperformed standalone models (LSTM, ARIMA, XGBoost) on New York City traffic data across metrics like MAE, RMSE, and R-squared.

Conclusion: This decomposition-driven hybrid framework improves traffic flow prediction accuracy and robustness by isolating temporal features and leveraging specialized models.

Abstract: Accurate traffic flow forecasting is essential for intelligent transportation
systems and urban traffic management. However, single model approaches often
fail to capture the complex, nonlinear, and multi scale temporal patterns in
traffic flow data. This study proposes a decomposition driven hybrid framework
that integrates Seasonal Trend decomposition using Loess (STL) with three
complementary predictive models. STL first decomposes the original time series
into trend, seasonal, and residual components. Then, a Long Short Term Memory
(LSTM) network models long term trends, an Autoregressive Integrated Moving
Average (ARIMA) model captures seasonal periodicity, and an Extreme Gradient
Boosting (XGBoost) algorithm predicts nonlinear residual fluctuations. The
final forecast is obtained through multiplicative integration of the sub model
predictions. Using 998 traffic flow records from a New York City intersection
between November and December 2015, results show that the LSTM ARIMA XGBoost
hybrid model significantly outperforms standalone models including LSTM, ARIMA,
and XGBoost across MAE, RMSE, and R squared metrics. The decomposition strategy
effectively isolates temporal characteristics, allowing each model to
specialize, thereby improving prediction accuracy, interpretability, and
robustness.

TL;DR: This paper analyzes the mechanistic differences between Mixture of Experts (MoE) models and dense networks, introducing metrics for superposition and proposing a new definition of expert specialization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to better understand the mechanics of MoE models and address the interpretability challenges compared to dense networks.

Method: The authors examine feature sparsity, importance, and network sparsity, developing metrics to measure superposition across MoE experts and propose a new definition of expert specialization based on monosemantic feature representation.

Result: Their investigation shows that network sparsity leads to greater monosemanticity and coherent organization of feature combinations without compromising model performance.

Conclusion: Network sparsity enhances interpretability in MoEs without sacrificing capability, challenging the belief that these aspects are at odds.

Abstract: Mixture of Experts (MoE) models have become central to scaling large language
models, yet their mechanistic differences from dense networks remain poorly
understood. Previous work has explored how dense models use
\textit{superposition} to represent more features than dimensions, and how
superposition is a function of feature sparsity and feature importance. MoE
models cannot be explained mechanistically through the same lens. We find that
neither feature sparsity nor feature importance cause discontinuous phase
changes, and that network sparsity (the ratio of active to total experts)
better characterizes MoEs. We develop new metrics for measuring superposition
across experts. Our findings demonstrate that models with greater network
sparsity exhibit greater \emph{monosemanticity}. We propose a new definition of
expert specialization based on monosemantic feature representation rather than
load balancing, showing that experts naturally organize around coherent feature
combinations when initialized appropriately. These results suggest that network
sparsity in MoEs may enable more interpretable models without sacrificing
performance, challenging the common assumption that interpretability and
capability are fundamentally at odds.

*Xiangfei Qiu,Xingjian Wu,Hanyin Cheng,Xvyuan Liu,Chenjuan Guo,Jilin Hu,Bin Yang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces DBLoss, a decomposition-based loss function that improves time series forecasting by separately addressing trends and seasonality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing loss functions like MSE often fail to capture seasonality or trend in time series forecasting despite decomposition modules in forward propagation.

Method: The authors propose DBLoss, which decomposes time series data into seasonal and trend components using exponential moving averages, calculates separate losses for each, and weights them for better prediction.

Result: The DBLoss function significantly enhances the performance of state-of-the-art forecasting models across various real-world datasets.

Conclusion: DBLoss offers a novel and effective approach to improving time series forecasting and advances the understanding of designing loss functions for this domain.

Abstract: Time series forecasting holds significant value in various domains such as
economics, traffic, energy, and AIOps, as accurate predictions facilitate
informed decision-making. However, the existing Mean Squared Error (MSE) loss
function sometimes fails to accurately capture the seasonality or trend within
the forecasting horizon, even when decomposition modules are used in the
forward propagation to model the trend and seasonality separately. To address
these challenges, we propose a simple yet effective Decomposition-Based Loss
function called DBLoss. This method uses exponential moving averages to
decompose the time series into seasonal and trend components within the
forecasting horizon, and then calculates the loss for each of these components
separately, followed by weighting them. As a general loss function, DBLoss can
be combined with any deep learning forecasting model. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that DBLoss significantly improves the performance of
state-of-the-art models across diverse real-world datasets and provides a new

*Carl Hvarfner,David Eriksson,Eytan Bakshy,Max Balandat*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces a novel acquisition strategy, Hyperparameter-Informed Predictive Exploration (HIPE), for Bayesian Optimization in few-shot settings, improving predictive accuracy and optimization performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enhancing Bayesian Optimization, especially in few-shot settings, by addressing limitations in initialization strategies that neglect predictive uncertainty reduction and efficient hyperparameter learning.

Method: The paper develops HIPE, grounded in information-theoretic principles, and derives a closed-form expression for its functionality in the Gaussian Process framework, comparing its performance with standard initialization strategies.

Result: HIPE demonstrates superior predictive accuracy, better hyperparameter identification, and improved optimization performance compared to conventional methods in various experiments.

Conclusion: By balancing predictive uncertainty reduction with hyperparameter learning, HIPE offers a robust solution for enhancing Bayesian Optimization in practical applications, especially with large-batch, few-shot scenarios.

Abstract: Bayesian Optimization is a widely used method for optimizing expensive
black-box functions, relying on probabilistic surrogate models such as Gaussian
Processes. The quality of the surrogate model is crucial for good optimization
performance, especially in the few-shot setting where only a small number of
batches of points can be evaluated. In this setting, the initialization plays a
critical role in shaping the surrogate's predictive quality and guiding
subsequent optimization. Despite this, practitioners typically rely on
(quasi-)random designs to cover the input space. However, such approaches
neglect two key factors: (a) space-filling designs may not be desirable to
reduce predictive uncertainty, and (b) efficient hyperparameter learning during
initialization is essential for high-quality prediction, which may conflict
with space-filling designs. To address these limitations, we propose
Hyperparameter-Informed Predictive Exploration (HIPE), a novel acquisition
strategy that balances predictive uncertainty reduction with hyperparameter
learning using information-theoretic principles. We derive a closed-form
expression for HIPE in the Gaussian Process setting and demonstrate its
effectiveness through extensive experiments in active learning and few-shot BO.
Our results show that HIPE outperforms standard initialization strategies in
terms of predictive accuracy, hyperparameter identification, and subsequent
optimization performance, particularly in large-batch, few-shot settings
relevant to many real-world Bayesian Optimization applications.

### [259] [Parallel BiLSTM-Transformer networks for forecasting chaotic dynamics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23685)
*Junwen Ma,Mingyu Ge,Yisen Wang,Yong Zhang,Weicheng Fu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces a hybrid model combining Transformer and BiLSTM networks to enhance prediction accuracy for chaotic systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The research addresses the difficulty of accurately predicting chaotic systems, which is caused by their extreme sensitivity to initial conditions and complex dynamics. Existing models struggle to capture both global and local features simultaneously.

Method: The study proposes a dual-branch predictive model combining Transformer and BiLSTM networks. The Transformer captures long-range dependencies, while the BiLSTM focuses on local temporal features. A feature-fusion layer integrates outputs from both branches to enhance prediction accuracy.

Result: The model is evaluated using the Lorenz system for two tasks: autonomous evolution prediction and unmeasured variable inference. Results demonstrate superior accuracy and robustness of the hybrid framework compared to single-branch architectures.

Conclusion: The proposed hybrid framework effectively enhances the prediction of chaotic systems, outperforming traditional models by capturing both local features and global dependencies.

Abstract: The nonlinear nature of chaotic systems results in extreme sensitivity to
initial conditions and highly intricate dynamical behaviors, posing fundamental
challenges for accurately predicting their evolution. To overcome the
limitation that conventional approaches fail to capture both local features and
global dependencies in chaotic time series simultaneously, this study proposes
a parallel predictive framework integrating Transformer and Bidirectional Long
Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM) networks. The hybrid model employs a dual-branch
architecture, where the Transformer branch mainly captures long-range
dependencies while the BiLSTM branch focuses on extracting local temporal
features. The complementary representations from the two branches are fused in
a dedicated feature-fusion layer to enhance predictive accuracy. As
illustrating examples, the model's performance is systematically evaluated on
two representative tasks in the Lorenz system. The first is autonomous
evolution prediction, in which the model recursively extrapolates system
trajectories from the time-delay embeddings of the state vector to evaluate
long-term tracking accuracy and stability. The second is inference of
unmeasured variable, where the model reconstructs the unobserved states from
the time-delay embeddings of partial observations to assess its
state-completion capability. The results consistently indicate that the
proposed hybrid framework outperforms both single-branch architectures across
tasks, demonstrating its robustness and effectiveness in chaotic system
prediction.

*Anisha Saha,Varsha Suresh,Timothy Hospedales,Vera Demberg*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper addresses sarcasm detection in multimodal models using MUStReason, a benchmark to evaluate both performance and reasoning, and introduces PragCoT, a framework steering models toward pragmatic intent.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Detecting sarcasm is a complex task requiring multimodal cues and pragmatic reasoning, yet current VideoLMs struggle with effectively handling this challenge.

Method: The authors introduce MUStReason, a benchmark with annotations of modality-specific cues and reasoning steps, alongside PragCoT, a framework to guide VideoLMs towards inferring implied intentions.

Result: Using MUStReason, the paper evaluates VideoLM sarcasm detection performance and demonstrates improved reasoning capabilities through the PragCoT framework.

Conclusion: PragCoT and MUStReason provide critical advancements in enabling VideoLMs to handle complex sarcasm detection tasks by emphasizing pragmatic interpretation over literal meaning.

Abstract: Sarcasm is a specific type of irony which involves discerning what is said
from what is meant. Detecting sarcasm depends not only on the literal content
of an utterance but also on non-verbal cues such as speaker's tonality, facial
expressions and conversational context. However, current multimodal models
struggle with complex tasks like sarcasm detection, which require identifying
relevant cues across modalities and pragmatically reasoning over them to infer
the speaker's intention. To explore these limitations in VideoLMs, we introduce
MUStReason, a diagnostic benchmark enriched with annotations of
modality-specific relevant cues and underlying reasoning steps to identify
sarcastic intent. In addition to benchmarking sarcasm classification
performance in VideoLMs, using MUStReason we quantitatively and qualitatively
evaluate the generated reasoning by disentangling the problem into perception
and reasoning, we propose PragCoT, a framework that steers VideoLMs to focus on
implied intentions over literal meaning, a property core to detecting sarcasm.

TL;DR: The paper introduces DEPS, an algorithm to learn parameterized skills and a meta-policy from expert demonstrations, achieving improved generalization and outperforming existing baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The goal is to address the challenge of learning meaningful, temporally extended, and adaptable parameterized skills that can generalize to unseen tasks from expert demonstrations.

Method: The method combines temporal variational inference and information-theoretic regularization to prevent degeneracy and learn parameterized skills and meta-policies jointly.

Result: DEPS demonstrates significant generalization improvements to new tasks and outperforms existing baselines on LIBERO and MetaWorld benchmarks while discovering interpretable skills.

Conclusion: The study concludes that DEPS offers an effective way to learn interpretable parameterized skills that are adaptable and generalizable from expert demonstrations, advancing the field of multitask learning.

Abstract: We present DEPS, an end-to-end algorithm for discovering parameterized skills
from expert demonstrations. Our method learns parameterized skill policies
jointly with a meta-policy that selects the appropriate discrete skill and
continuous parameters at each timestep. Using a combination of temporal
variational inference and information-theoretic regularization methods, we
address the challenge of degeneracy common in latent variable models, ensuring
that the learned skills are temporally extended, semantically meaningful, and
adaptable. We empirically show that learning parameterized skills from
multitask expert demonstrations significantly improves generalization to unseen
tasks. Our method outperforms multitask as well as skill learning baselines on
both LIBERO and MetaWorld benchmarks. We also demonstrate that DEPS discovers
interpretable parameterized skills, such as an object grasping skill whose
continuous arguments define the grasp location.

*Nicki Barari,Edward Kim,Christopher MacLellan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper investigates catastrophic forgetting in continual learning, introducing Cobweb/4V and CobwebNN models, emphasizing adaptive restructuring, sparse updates, and information-theoretic learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation behind this research is to address the challenge of catastrophic forgetting in continual learning systems, aiming to ensure models can integrate new knowledge without losing previously learned information.

Method: The study tests three hypotheses concerning mechanisms that prevent forgetting, including adaptive structural reorganization, sparse updates, and information-theoretic learning. The evaluation is conducted using datasets like MNIST, Fashion-MNIST, MedMNIST, and CIFAR-10, comparing Cobweb/4V and neural baselines like CobwebNN.

Result: The experiments confirmed that adaptive restructuring enhances learning plasticity, sparse updates reduce interference, and the information-theoretic approach preserves past knowledge without revisiting old data.

Conclusion: The findings highlight the potential of concept-based, information-theoretic approaches, like Cobweb/4V and CobwebNN, for creating stable and adaptive continual learning systems.

Abstract: Catastrophic forgetting remains a central challenge in continual learning,
where models are required to integrate new knowledge over time without losing
what they have previously learned. In prior work, we introduced Cobweb/4V, a
hierarchical concept formation model that exhibited robustness to catastrophic
forgetting in visual domains. Motivated by this robustness, we examine three
hypotheses regarding the factors that contribute to such stability: (1)
adaptive structural reorganization enhances knowledge retention, (2) sparse and
selective updates reduce interference, and (3) information-theoretic learning
based on sufficiency statistics provides advantages over gradient-based
backpropagation. To test these hypotheses, we compare Cobweb/4V with neural
baselines, including CobwebNN, a neural implementation of the Cobweb framework
introduced in this work. Experiments on datasets of varying complexity (MNIST,
Fashion-MNIST, MedMNIST, and CIFAR-10) show that adaptive restructuring
enhances learning plasticity, sparse updates help mitigate interference, and
the information-theoretic learning process preserves prior knowledge without
revisiting past data. Together, these findings provide insight into mechanisms
that can mitigate catastrophic forgetting and highlight the potential of
concept-based, information-theoretic approaches for building stable and
adaptive continual learning systems.

*Joohwan Ko,Aristofanis Rontogiannis,Yih-En Andrew Ban,Axel Elaldi,Nicholas Franklin*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Relaxed Sequence Sampling (RSS) enhances protein design by combining structural objectives and evolutionary sequence data, achieving higher diversity and designability compared to traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing protein design approaches lack diversity and fail to account for sequence-space constraints, limiting designability. A novel approach is needed to address these issues.

Method: RSS introduces a Markov chain Monte Carlo framework that combines AlphaFold2 structural objectives and ESM2 sequence data, operating through a logit space exploration and protein language model-guided jumps.

Result: RSS demonstrates increased designable structures (5×) and structural diversity (2-3×) compared to relaxed sequence optimization (RSO) under equal computational conditions.

Conclusion: RSS offers an efficient and principled method for enhancing protein design by integrating structural and evolutionary information, paving the way for broader exploration of protein design landscapes.

Abstract: Protein design using structure prediction models such as AlphaFold2 has shown
remarkable success, but existing approaches like relaxed sequence optimization
(RSO) rely on single-path gradient descent and ignore sequence-space
constraints, limiting diversity and designability. We introduce Relaxed
Sequence Sampling (RSS), a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) framework that
integrates structural and evolutionary information for protein design. RSS
operates in continuous logit space, combining gradient-guided exploration with
protein language model-informed jumps. Its energy function couples
AlphaFold2-derived structural objectives with ESM2-derived sequence priors,
balancing accuracy and biological plausibility. In an in silico protein binder
design task, RSS produces 5$\times$ more designable structures and 2-3$\times$
greater structural diversity than RSO baselines, at equal computational cost.
These results highlight RSS as a principled approach for efficiently exploring
the protein design landscape.

*Jun Liu,Tao Zhou,Jiarui Li,Xiaohui Zhong,Peng Zhang,Jie Feng,Lei Chen,Hao Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FuXi-ENS introduces an AI-based ensemble forecasting method for tropical cyclones, showing advantages over traditional ECMWF-ENS in track accuracy and capturing physical phenomena.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improve computational efficiency and predictive accuracy in tropical cyclone forecasts by addressing atmospheric nonlinearity with AI-based methods.

Method: FuXi-ENS generates ensemble forecasts using learnable perturbations and compares them with ECMWF-ENS across global tropical cyclones in 2018.

Result: FuXi-ENS shows superior track accuracy, tighter concentration of moisture and turbulent energy, and improvements in capturing large-scale circulation compared to ECMWF-ENS.

Conclusion: Learnable perturbations enhance TC forecasting capabilities and pave the way for AI-driven improvements in extreme weather predictions with societal importance.

Abstract: Tropical cyclones (TCs) are highly destructive and inherently uncertain
weather systems. Ensemble forecasting helps quantify these uncertainties, yet
traditional systems are constrained by high computational costs and limited
capability to fully represent atmospheric nonlinearity. FuXi-ENS introduces a
learnable perturbation scheme for ensemble generation, representing a novel
AI-based forecasting paradigm. Here, we systematically compare FuXi-ENS with
ECMWF-ENS using all 90 global TCs in 2018, examining their performance in
TC-related physical variables, track and intensity forecasts, and the
associated dynamical and thermodynamical fields. FuXi-ENS demonstrates clear
advantages in predicting TC-related physical variables, and achieves more
accurate track forecasts with reduced ensemble spread, though it still
underestimates intensity relative to observations. Further dynamical and
thermodynamical analyses reveal that FuXi-ENS better captures large-scale
circulation, with moisture turbulent energy more tightly concentrated around
the TC warm core, whereas ECMWF-ENS exhibits a more dispersed distribution.
These findings highlight the potential of learnable perturbations to improve TC
forecasting skill and provide valuable insights for advancing AI-based ensemble
prediction of extreme weather events that have significant societal impacts.

*Nathan Paek,Yongyi Zang,Qihui Yang,Randal Leistikow*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper addresses interpreting audio generative models by mapping latent representations to acoustic concepts using sparse autoencoders (SAEs). The approach is validated across different models and facilitates analysis and manipulation of musical properties.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Audio generation faces unique challenges because of the dense data nature leading to compression that can obscure semantic meaning, and limited feature characterization capabilities.

Method: The authors use sparse autoencoders trained on audio autoencoder latents and create linear mappings from SAE features to acoustic properties like pitch, amplitude, and timbre.

Result: The approach successfully enables controllable manipulation and analysis of the audio generation process, showing how acoustic properties develop during synthesis. This is validated on models handling both continuous and discrete latent spaces.

Conclusion: The framework demonstrates interpretability in audio generation and offers potential extension to visual generative model analysis, advancing understanding of latent spaces and emergent properties.

Abstract: While sparse autoencoders (SAEs) successfully extract interpretable features
from language models, applying them to audio generation faces unique
challenges: audio's dense nature requires compression that obscures semantic
meaning, and automatic feature characterization remains limited. We propose a
framework for interpreting audio generative models by mapping their latent
representations to human-interpretable acoustic concepts. We train SAEs on
audio autoencoder latents, then learn linear mappings from SAE features to
discretized acoustic properties (pitch, amplitude, and timbre). This enables
both controllable manipulation and analysis of the AI music generation process,
revealing how acoustic properties emerge during synthesis. We validate our
approach on continuous (DiffRhythm-VAE) and discrete (EnCodec, WavTokenizer)
audio latent spaces, and analyze DiffRhythm, a state-of-the-art text-to-music
model, to demonstrate how pitch, timbre, and loudness evolve throughout
generation. While our work is only done on audio modality, our framework can be
extended to interpretable analysis of visual latent space generation models.

### [267] [How do simple rotations affect the implicit bias of Adam?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23804)
*Adela DePavia,Vasileios Charisopoulos,Rebecca Willett*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The abstract discusses how Adam can lose its advantage in learning non-linear decision boundaries due to sensitivity to feature space rotations, and proposes an orthogonal transformation method to address this issue.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the generalization effects of Adam and similar adaptive gradient methods compared to gradient descent, particularly in binary classification.

Method: Analyzing Adam's sensitivity to feature space rotations and introducing a reparameterization through orthogonal transformations.

Result: Small rotations in data distribution can impair Adam's ability to achieve richer decision boundaries, but the proposed reparameterization restores this capability.

Conclusion: The reparameterization method mitigates Adam's sensitivity to data rotations and helps it retain its richness bias for optimal nonlinear decision boundaries.

Abstract: Adaptive gradient methods such as Adam and Adagrad are widely used in machine
learning, yet their effect on the generalization of learned models -- relative
to methods like gradient descent -- remains poorly understood. Prior work on
binary classification suggests that Adam exhibits a ``richness bias,'' which
can help it learn nonlinear decision boundaries closer to the Bayes-optimal
decision boundary relative to gradient descent. However, the coordinate-wise
preconditioning scheme employed by Adam renders the overall method sensitive to
orthogonal transformations of feature space. We show that this sensitivity can
manifest as a reversal of Adam's competitive advantage: even small rotations of
the underlying data distribution can make Adam forfeit its richness bias and
converge to a linear decision boundary that is farther from the Bayes-optimal
decision boundary than the one learned by gradient descent. To alleviate this
issue, we show that a recently proposed reparameterization method -- which
applies an orthogonal transformation to the optimization objective -- endows
any first-order method with equivariance to data rotations, and we empirically
demonstrate its ability to restore Adam's bias towards rich decision
boundaries.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces COMBRL, a reinforcement learning algorithm designed for continuous-time systems that uses probabilistic models like Gaussian processes to achieve scalable and sample-efficient learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional reinforcement learning focuses on discrete-time dynamics, while real-world systems are typically continuous, necessitating improved approaches for such settings.

Method: It utilizes probabilistic models (Gaussian processes and Bayesian neural networks) to learn a model of the system's dynamics and maximizes a weighted sum of extrinsic rewards and epistemic uncertainty to guide learning.

Result: COMBRL achieves sublinear regret in reward-driven scenarios, provides bounds for unsupervised RL settings, and outperforms baselines in sample efficiency and scalability across various RL tasks.

Conclusion: COMBRL significantly advances continuous-time RL by integrating uncertainty awareness, making it more scalable and efficient compared to existing methods.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning algorithms are typically designed for discrete-time
dynamics, even though the underlying real-world control systems are often
continuous in time. In this paper, we study the problem of continuous-time
reinforcement learning, where the unknown system dynamics are represented using
nonlinear ordinary differential equations (ODEs). We leverage probabilistic
models, such as Gaussian processes and Bayesian neural networks, to learn an
uncertainty-aware model of the underlying ODE. Our algorithm, COMBRL, greedily
maximizes a weighted sum of the extrinsic reward and model epistemic
uncertainty. This yields a scalable and sample-efficient approach to
continuous-time model-based RL. We show that COMBRL achieves sublinear regret
in the reward-driven setting, and in the unsupervised RL setting (i.e., without
extrinsic rewards), we provide a sample complexity bound. In our experiments,
we evaluate COMBRL in both standard and unsupervised RL settings and
demonstrate that it scales better, is more sample-efficient than prior methods,
and outperforms baselines across several deep RL tasks.

*Pedro Cortes dos Santos,Matheus Becali Rocha,Renato A Krohling*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces an enhanced fault detection framework for industrial processes using SHAP explanations and causal analysis within the Tennessee Eastman Process benchmark.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional fault detection systems struggle to interpret complex industrial data, leading to poor results, despite advanced machine learning methods.

Method: The framework utilizes SHAP for interpreting machine learning predictions and integrates causal analysis with Directed Acyclic Graphs to uncover fault mechanisms.

Result: Key process features driving fault predictions are identified, aligning SHAP insights with causal structures, highlighting critical systems like cooling and separation as pivotal to fault development.

Conclusion: The approach improves detection accuracy and offers actionable insights, combining predictive power with causal understanding for smarter fault detection in complex industrial environments.

Abstract: Industrial processes generate complex data that challenge fault detection
systems, often yielding opaque or underwhelming results despite advanced
machine learning techniques. This study tackles such difficulties using the
Tennessee Eastman Process, a well-established benchmark known for its intricate
dynamics, to develop an innovative fault detection framework. Initial attempts
with standard models revealed limitations in both performance and
interpretability, prompting a shift toward a more tractable approach. By
employing SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations), we transform the problem into a
more manageable and transparent form, pinpointing the most critical process
features driving fault predictions. This reduction in complexity unlocks the
ability to apply causal analysis through Directed Acyclic Graphs, generated by
multiple algorithms, to uncover the underlying mechanisms of fault propagation.
The resulting causal structures align strikingly with SHAP findings,
consistently highlighting key process elements-like cooling and separation
systems-as pivotal to fault development. Together, these methods not only
enhance detection accuracy but also provide operators with clear, actionable
insights into fault origins, a synergy that, to our knowledge, has not been
previously explored in this context. This dual approach bridges predictive
power with causal understanding, offering a robust tool for monitoring complex
manufacturing environments and paving the way for smarter, more interpretable
fault detection in industrial systems.

*Yilang Zhang,Xiaodong Yang,Yiwei Cai,Georgios B. Giannakis*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper addresses the inefficiencies of task-specific fine-tuning for large language models by proposing a method to progressively accumulate high-rank updates from low-rank increments, enhancing performance and speeding convergence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The bottleneck of computational costs for task-specific fine-tuning of large language models needs solutions that balance efficiency and effectiveness.

Method: It introduces a method to progressively construct high-rank weight updates from sequential low-rank matrices, with an optimal low-rank matrix analytically determined by scaling the columns of the original low-rank matrix.

Result: The method demonstrates faster convergence and improved performance compared to LoRA variants on tasks such as language understanding, reasoning, and problem solving, tested on models up to 12 billion parameters.

Conclusion: Progressively constructing high-rank updates overcomes restrictions of low-rank adaptation, ensuring fine-tuning efficiency and performance improvements as large language models scale.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) continue to scale in size, the computational
overhead has become a major bottleneck for task-specific fine-tuning. While
low-rank adaptation (LoRA) effectively curtails this cost by confining the
weight updates to a low-dimensional subspace, such a restriction can hinder
effectiveness and slow convergence. This contribution deals with these
limitations by accumulating progressively a high-rank weight update from
consecutive low-rank increments. Specifically, the per update optimal low-rank
matrix is identified to minimize the loss function and closely approximate full
fine-tuning. To endow efficient and seamless optimization without restarting,
this optimal choice is formed by appropriately scaling the columns of the
original low-rank matrix. Rigorous performance guarantees reveal that the
optimal scaling can be found analytically. Extensive numerical tests with
popular LLMs scaling up to 12 billion parameters demonstrate a consistent
performance gain and fast convergence relative to state-of-the-art LoRA
variants on diverse tasks including natural language understanding, commonsense
reasoning, and mathematical problem solving.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces a physics-integrated latent diffusion model for upscaling atmospheric data with added PDE-based physical consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance the accuracy and physical plausibility of high-resolution atmospheric data through the downscaling of 2-m temperature fields using diffusion models.

Method: A latent diffusion model incorporating a residual framework against a UNet and a partial differential equation (PDE) loss term, computed via finite-difference approximation in pixel space.

Result: The addition of a PDE loss regularizes the model further and improves the physical realism of the high-resolution outputs.

Conclusion: Fine-tuning with physics-informed loss improves quality and physical plausibility, and the model framework accessible on GitHub promotes future research applications.

Abstract: This work presents a physics-conditioned latent diffusion model tailored for
dynamical downscaling of atmospheric data, with a focus on reconstructing
high-resolution 2-m temperature fields. Building upon a pre-existing diffusion
architecture and employing a residual formulation against a reference UNet, we
integrate a partial differential equation (PDE) loss term into the model's
training objective. The PDE loss is computed in the full resolution (pixel)
space by decoding the latent representation and is designed to enforce physical
consistency through a finite-difference approximation of an effective
advection-diffusion balance. Empirical observations indicate that conventional
diffusion training already yields low PDE residuals, and we investigate how
fine-tuning with this additional loss further regularizes the model and
enhances the physical plausibility of the generated fields. The entirety of our
codebase is available on Github, for future reference and development.

### [272] [GIFT: Group-relative Implicit Fine Tuning Integrates GRPO with DPO and UNA](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23868)
*Zhichao Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: GIFT is a new reinforcement learning method for Large Language Models (LLMs) that improves training efficiency and aligns models better by minimizing discrepancies between implicit and explicit reward models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation for this paper was to develop a reinforcement learning framework for LLMs that retains exploration capability and enhances alignment and reasoning performance without the instability and inefficiencies of previous methods.

Method: GIFT combines three concepts: online multi-response generation (from GRPO), implicit reward formulation (from DPO), and implicit-explicit reward alignment principle (from UNA). It transforms the reward maximization problem into a convex optimization task using joint normalization and Mean Squared Error (MSE) loss.

Result: GIFT demonstrated superior reasoning and alignment on mathematical benchmarks and showed faster convergence, reduced hyperparameter tuning, and less overfitting compared to GRPO.

Conclusion: GIFT presents an efficient and stable alternative for aligning LLMs by simplifying the reward optimization process while improving computational efficiency and model generalization.

Abstract: I propose \textbf{G}roup-relative \textbf{I}mplicit \textbf{F}ine
\textbf{T}uning (GIFT), a novel reinforcement learning framework for aligning
LLMs. Instead of directly maximizing cumulative rewards like PPO or GRPO, GIFT
minimizes the discrepancy between implicit and explicit reward models. It
combines three key ideas: (1) the online multi-response generation and
normalization of GRPO, (2) the implicit reward formulation of DPO, and (3) the
implicit-explicit reward alignment principle of UNA. By jointly normalizing the
implicit and explicit rewards, GIFT eliminates an otherwise intractable term
that prevents effective use of implicit rewards. This normalization transforms
the complex reward maximization objective into a simple mean squared error
(MSE) loss between the normalized reward functions, converting a non-convex
optimization problem into a convex, stable, and analytically differentiable
formulation. Unlike offline methods such as DPO and UNA, GIFT remains on-policy
and thus retains exploration capability. Compared to GRPO, it requires fewer
hyperparameters, converges faster, and generalizes better with significantly
reduced training overfitting. Empirically, GIFT achieves superior reasoning and
alignment performance on mathematical benchmarks while remaining
computationally efficient.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper presents a graph-based feature selection method for analyzing electric bus maintenance data and employs AI models to predict vehicle alarms, improving maintenance strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges in predictive maintenance for electric buses caused by complex systems and the inadequacy of traditional maintenance methods.

Method: A hybrid graph-based feature selection tool combining statistical methods (e.g., Pearson correlation, ANOVA) with optimization algorithms (InfoMap, Leiden, etc.) was used. Machine learning models like SVM, Random Forest, and XGBoost were optimized and made interpretable using LIME.

Result: The system successfully predicted vehicle alarms, improved feature interpretability, and enabled proactive maintenance strategies.

Conclusion: The proposed method advances predictive maintenance for electric buses through enhanced anomaly detection and proactive strategies, supporting Industry 4.0 goals.

Abstract: Predictive maintenance (PdM) is crucial for optimizing efficiency and
minimizing downtime of electric buses. While these vehicles provide
environmental benefits, they pose challenges for PdM due to complex electric
transmission and battery systems. Traditional maintenance, often based on
scheduled inspections, struggles to capture anomalies in multi-dimensional
real-time CAN Bus data. This study employs a graph-based feature selection
method to analyze relationships among CAN Bus parameters of electric buses and
investigates the prediction performance of targeted alarms using artificial
intelligence techniques. The raw data collected over two years underwent
extensive preprocessing to ensure data quality and consistency. A hybrid
graph-based feature selection tool was developed by combining statistical
filtering (Pearson correlation, Cramer's V, ANOVA F-test) with
optimization-based community detection algorithms (InfoMap, Leiden, Louvain,
Fast Greedy). Machine learning models, including SVM, Random Forest, and
XGBoost, were optimized through grid and random search with data balancing via

### [274] [RS-ORT: A Reduced-Space Branch-and-Bound Algorithm for Optimal Regression Trees](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23901)
*Cristobal Heredia,Pedro Chumpitaz-Flores,Kaixun Hua*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes a new method for training optimal regression trees using a specialized branch-and-bound algorithm, effective on both binary and continuous features, and scalable for datasets with up to 2 million samples.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing mixed-integer programming (MIP) approaches for regression tasks struggle with continuous features and large-scale datasets, often leading to suboptimal results or computational inefficiencies.

Method: The authors recast regression-tree training as a two-stage optimization problem and propose RS-ORT, a branch-and-bound algorithm focusing on tree-structural variables while introducing bound-tightening techniques and enabling parallel execution.

Result: RS-ORT achieves guaranteed training performance with a simpler tree structure and better generalization on datasets containing up to 2 million samples within 4 hours, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: The proposed RS-ORT method enhances the scalability, efficiency, and generalization ability of regression-tree training, making it feasible to handle large-scale datasets with both binary and continuous features while achieving global optimality.

Abstract: Mixed-integer programming (MIP) has emerged as a powerful framework for
learning optimal decision trees. Yet, existing MIP approaches for regression
tasks are either limited to purely binary features or become computationally
intractable when continuous, large-scale data are involved. Naively binarizing
continuous features sacrifices global optimality and often yields needlessly
deep trees. We recast the optimal regression-tree training as a two-stage
optimization problem and propose Reduced-Space Optimal Regression Trees
(RS-ORT) - a specialized branch-and-bound (BB) algorithm that branches
exclusively on tree-structural variables. This design guarantees the
algorithm's convergence and its independence from the number of training
samples. Leveraging the model's structure, we introduce several bound
tightening techniques - closed-form leaf prediction, empirical threshold
discretization, and exact depth-1 subtree parsing - that combine with
decomposable upper and lower bounding strategies to accelerate the training.
The BB node-wise decomposition enables trivial parallel execution, further
alleviating the computational intractability even for million-size datasets.
Based on the empirical studies on several regression benchmarks containing both
binary and continuous features, RS-ORT also delivers superior training and
testing performance than state-of-the-art methods. Notably, on datasets with up
to 2,000,000 samples with continuous features, RS-ORT can obtain guaranteed
training performance with a simpler tree structure and a better generalization
ability in four hours.

*Wasim Ahmad,Maha Shadaydeh,Joachim Denzler*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces gCDMI, a method for discovering causal relationships across variable groups using deep learning, focusing on complex and nonlinear multivariate time series.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods often overlook group-level causal interactions, focusing only on pairwise relationships. This paper aims to address this gap to better understand systems like brain networks or climate ecosystems.

Method: gCDMI uses deep learning for structural modeling, applies group-level interventions, and performs model invariance testing to infer causal links.

Result: The method performs better in detecting group-level causal relationships in simulations and real-world datasets, such as those from neuroscience and climate science.

Conclusion: Group-level interventions using deep learning models with invariance testing provide an effective way to uncover complex causal structures, benefiting various domains.

Abstract: Causal discovery uncovers complex relationships between variables, enhancing
predictions, decision-making, and insights into real-world systems, especially
in nonlinear multivariate time series. However, most existing methods primarily
focus on pairwise cause-effect relationships, overlooking interactions among
groups of variables, i.e., subsystems and their collective causal influence. In
this study, we introduce gCDMI, a novel multi-group causal discovery method
that leverages group-level interventions on trained deep neural networks and
employs model invariance testing to infer causal relationships. Our approach
involves three key steps. First, we use deep learning to jointly model the
structural relationships among groups of all time series. Second, we apply
group-wise interventions to the trained model. Finally, we conduct model
invariance testing to determine the presence of causal links among variable
groups. We evaluate our method on simulated datasets, demonstrating its
superior performance in identifying group-level causal relationships compared
to existing methods. Additionally, we validate our approach on real-world
datasets, including brain networks and climate ecosystems. Our results
highlight that applying group-level interventions to deep learning models,
combined with invariance testing, can effectively reveal complex causal
structures, offering valuable insights for domains such as neuroscience and
climate science.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper investigates the redundancy of Query weights in attention mechanisms of LLMs, reducing parameters while maintaining performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To optimize large language models by theoretically and empirically investigating the redundancy in attention mechanism components.

Method: The authors prove under simplifying assumptions that Query weights are redundant, followed by validation using GPT-3 small architectures trained from scratch.

Result: The reduced GPT-3 small model achieved comparable validation loss to standard baselines, reducing model parameters by over 8%.

Conclusion: The findings highlight potential improvements in LLM efficiency and emphasize exploring Query weight redundancy at scale.

Abstract: The Query, Key, Value weight triplet is a building block of current attention
mechanisms in state-of-the-art LLMs. We theoretically investigate whether this
triplet can be reduced, proving under simplifying assumptions that the Query
weights are redundant, thereby reducing the number of non-embedding/lm-head
parameters by over 8%. We validate the theory on full-complexity GPT-3 small
architectures (with layer normalization, skip connections, and weight decay)
trained from scratch, demonstrating that the reduced model achieves comparable
validation loss to standard baselines. These findings motivate the
investigation of the Query weight redundancy at scale.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper extends the geometric interpretation of Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) from the discounted-reward case to the average-reward case, delivering a unified analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To unify the analysis of MDPs for both average-reward and discounted-reward cases, which are traditionally examined separately.

Method: The authors utilize a geometric interpretation framework of MDPs to analyze the average-reward case and demonstrate its applicability by connecting it to the discounted-reward case.

Result: They prove that under a unique and ergodic optimal policy, the Value Iteration algorithm achieves geometric convergence for the average-reward case, extending previous results from the discounted-reward case.

Conclusion: The unification of the two reward scenarios in MDP analysis via geometric interpretation provides a consistent theoretical foundation and demonstrates the broader applicability of existing results.

Abstract: The theoretical analysis of Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) is commonly
split into two cases - the average-reward case and the discounted-reward case -
which, while sharing similarities, are typically analyzed separately. In this
work, we extend a recently introduced geometric interpretation of MDPs for the
discounted-reward case to the average-reward case, thereby unifying both. This
allows us to extend a major result known for the discounted-reward case to the
average-reward case: under a unique and ergodic optimal policy, the Value
Iteration algorithm achieves a geometric convergence rate.

*Ningfeng Yang,Tor M. Aamodt*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces FOGZO, a method for training quantized neural networks combining the advantages of STE and ZO gradients, offering better performance and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Quantized neural networks are challenging to train due to gradient computation difficulties. Existing methods like STE and ZO gradients have trade-offs in bias and computational cost.

Method: The proposed method, FOGZO, balances STE's biased gradients with the unbiased but computationally expensive ZO gradients to improve efficiency and model performance in quantized networks.

Result: FOGZO provides consistent improvements in training accuracy and computational efficiency across various models, including DeiT, ResNet, and LLaMA.

Conclusion: FOGZO offers a significant improvement in training quantized neural networks by reducing training time and improving accuracy, demonstrating its potential in efficient model training.

Abstract: We study the problem of training neural networks with quantized parameters.
Learning low-precision quantized parameters by enabling computation of
gradients via the Straight-Through Estimator (STE) can be challenging. While
the STE enables back-propagation, which is a first-order method, recent works
have explored the use of zeroth-order (ZO) gradient descent for fine-tuning. We
note that the STE provides high-quality biased gradients, and ZO gradients are
unbiased but can be expensive. We thus propose First-Order-Guided Zeroth-Order
Gradient Descent (FOGZO) that reduces STE bias while reducing computations
relative to ZO methods. Empirically, we show FOGZO improves the tradeoff
between quality and training time in Quantization-Aware Pre-Training.
Specifically, versus STE at the same number of iterations, we show a 1-8\%
accuracy improvement for DeiT Tiny/Small, 1-2\% accuracy improvement on ResNet
18/50, and 1-22 perplexity point improvement for LLaMA models with up to 0.3
billion parameters. For the same loss, FOGZO yields a 796$\times$ reduction in
computation versus n-SPSA for a 2-layer MLP on MNIST. Code is available at

*Junho Choi,Teng-Yuan Chang,Namjung Kim,Youngjoon Hong*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a data-free neural operator for solving Navier-Stokes equations robustly and efficiently for real-time ensemble forecasting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High-dimensional flow models like Navier-Stokes equations are computationally expensive for real-time applications, and existing neural operator methods require large datasets and struggle with generalization to 3D flows.

Method: The researchers developed a physics-informed neural operator architecture that works without paired solution data, taking initial and boundary conditions, and forcing functions to enable accurate and efficient simulation.

Result: The proposed neural operator achieves high accuracy and efficiency in both 2D benchmarks and 3D test cases, surpassing prior neural operator methods, and delivering robust solutions for large ensemble forecasting.

Conclusion: By combining physics-based design principles with the scalability of machine learning, this approach enables high-fidelity, data-free PDE simulations for scientific applications.

Abstract: Ensemble simulations of high-dimensional flow models (e.g., Navier Stokes
type PDEs) are computationally prohibitive for real time applications. Neural
operators enable fast inference but are limited by costly data requirements and
poor generalization to 3D flows. We present a data-free operator network for
the Navier Stokes equations that eliminates the need for paired solution data
and enables robust, real time inference for large ensemble forecasting. The
physics-grounded architecture takes initial and boundary conditions as well as
forcing functions, yielding solutions robust to high variability and
perturbations. Across 2D benchmarks and 3D test cases, the method surpasses
prior neural operators in accuracy and, for ensembles, achieves greater
efficiency than conventional numerical solvers. Notably, it delivers accurate
solutions of the three dimensional Navier Stokes equations, a regime not
previously demonstrated for data free neural operators. By uniting a
numerically grounded architecture with the scalability of machine learning,
this approach establishes a practical pathway toward data free, high fidelity
PDE surrogates for end to end scientific simulation and prediction.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To better understand and reproduce the spatiotemporal behavior of biological systems, especially in electrophysiological processes, through a computational model.

Method: Developed a 3D multicomponent reaction-diffusion model linked to excitable dynamics, inspired by FitzHugh-Nagumo. Its results were used to train an Echo State Network (ESN) for dynamic reproduction.

Result: The ESN successfully replicated the dynamic behavior of the biological system modeled by the reaction-diffusion framework.

Conclusion: Simulating biological systems' dynamics using ESN models proved feasible, demonstrating their effectiveness in replicating complex behaviors.

Abstract: In this work, a three-dimensional multicomponent reaction-diffusion model has
been developed, combining excitable-system dynamics with diffusion processes
and sharing conceptual features with the FitzHugh-Nagumo model. Designed to
capture the spatiotemporal behavior of biological systems, particularly
electrophysiological processes, the model was solved numerically to generate
time-series data. These data were subsequently used to train and evaluate an
Echo State Network (ESN), which successfully reproduced the system's dynamic
behavior. The results demonstrate that simulating biological dynamics using
data-driven, multifunctional ESN models is both feasible and effective.

*Qianfeng Wen,Zhenwei Tang,Ashton Anderson*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ChessQA provides a novel benchmark for evaluating the chess understanding of large language models (LLMs), covering various skill aspects from structural knowledge to semantic comprehension.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current evaluations for LLM chess abilities are limited and inconsistent, making it hard to measure their understanding of chess or compare methodologies.

Method: ChessQA is designed to assess LLM chess understanding with tasks that mirror skill development in chess players, spanning rules, motifs, tactics, position evaluation, and semantic description.

Result: Upon evaluation with multiple contemporary LLMs, ChessQA reveals consistent deficiencies in their chess understanding across all task categories.

Conclusion: ChessQA offers a standardized and evolving benchmark to diagnose and compare LLMs in chess reasoning, supporting future research with public tools and dynamic datasets.

Abstract: Chess provides an ideal testbed for evaluating the reasoning, modeling, and
abstraction capabilities of large language models (LLMs), as it has
well-defined structure and objective ground truth while admitting a wide
spectrum of skill levels. However, existing evaluations of LLM ability in chess
are ad hoc and narrow in scope, making it difficult to accurately measure LLM
chess understanding and how it varies with scale, post-training methodologies,
or architecture choices. We present ChessQA, a comprehensive benchmark that
assesses LLM chess understanding across five task categories (Structural,
Motifs, Short Tactics, Position Judgment, and Semantic), which approximately
correspond to the ascending abstractions that players master as they accumulate
chess knowledge, from understanding basic rules and learning tactical motifs to
correctly calculating tactics, evaluating positions, and semantically
describing high-level concepts. In this way, ChessQA captures a more
comprehensive picture of chess ability and understanding, going significantly
beyond the simple move quality evaluations done previously, and offers a
controlled, consistent setting for diagnosis and comparison. Furthermore,
ChessQA is inherently dynamic, with prompts, answer keys, and construction
scripts that can evolve as models improve. Evaluating a range of contemporary
LLMs, we find persistent weaknesses across all five categories and provide
results and error analyses by category. We will release the code, periodically
refreshed datasets, and a public leaderboard to support further research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome limitations of current probabilistic AI hardware by creating scalable and efficient stochastic computing systems.

Method: Introducing an all-transistor probabilistic computer that integrates denoising AI models at the hardware level.

Result: System-level analysis suggests drastic energy efficiency, achieving GPU-like capabilities yet consuming significantly less energy.

Conclusion: The approach highlights the potential for scalable, energy-efficient probabilistic computing systems, revolutionizing computational applications.

Abstract: The proliferation of probabilistic AI has promoted proposals for specialized
stochastic computers. Despite promising efficiency gains, these proposals have
failed to gain traction because they rely on fundamentally limited modeling
techniques and exotic, unscalable hardware. In this work, we address these
shortcomings by proposing an all-transistor probabilistic computer that
implements powerful denoising models at the hardware level. A system-level
analysis indicates that devices based on our architecture could achieve
performance parity with GPUs on a simple image benchmark using approximately
10,000 times less energy.

TL;DR: The paper introduces Diffusion Adaptive Text Embedding (DATE) to dynamically update text embeddings during text-to-image diffusion processes, enhancing text-image alignment without requiring additional model training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Text embeddings used in text-to-image diffusion models remain fixed across timesteps, limiting adaptability and degrading text-image alignment quality.

Method: DATE dynamically updates text embeddings during each diffusion timestep, refining them based on intermediate perturbed data. It leverages an optimization problem and update rule for improved alignment and preference between predicted images and text.

Result: DATE achieves better text-image alignment compared to fixed embeddings while maintaining generative capabilities across tasks like multi-concept generation and text-guided image editing.

Conclusion: DATE improves text-to-image alignment during diffusion sampling without requiring model retraining, showing promise in advancing multi-concept generation and text-guided editing tasks.

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models rely on text embeddings from a pre-trained
text encoder, but these embeddings remain fixed across all diffusion timesteps,
limiting their adaptability to the generative process. We propose Diffusion
Adaptive Text Embedding (DATE), which dynamically updates text embeddings at
each diffusion timestep based on intermediate perturbed data. We formulate an
optimization problem and derive an update rule that refines the text embeddings
at each sampling step to improve alignment and preference between the mean
predicted image and the text. This allows DATE to dynamically adapts the text
conditions to the reverse-diffused images throughout diffusion sampling without
requiring additional model training. Through theoretical analysis and empirical
results, we show that DATE maintains the generative capability of the model
while providing superior text-image alignment over fixed text embeddings across
various tasks, including multi-concept generation and text-guided image
editing. Our code is available at https://github.com/aailab-kaist/DATE.

*Yohan Abeysinghe,Muhammad Akhtar Munir,Sanoojan Baliah,Ron Sarafian,Fahad Shahbaz Khan,Yinon Rudich,Salman Khan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SynCast is a novel forecasting model that predicts air pollution more accurately by focusing on both average and extreme conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current air pollution forecasting models often fail to predict extreme pollution events caused by factors like wildfires or urban haze.

Method: Developed SynCast, a neural forecasting model with a transformer backbone and a diffusion-based refinement module to better predict particulate matter using meteorological and air composition data.

Result: SynCast demonstrated improved accuracy in forecasting PM concentrations, particularly in predicting rare and extreme pollution events.

Conclusion: The study highlights an effective model for scalable air quality early-warning systems, aiding climate-health risk mitigation in vulnerable areas.

Abstract: Air pollution remains a leading global health and environmental risk,
particularly in regions vulnerable to episodic air pollution spikes due to
wildfires, urban haze and dust storms. Accurate forecasting of particulate
matter (PM) concentrations is essential to enable timely public health warnings
and interventions, yet existing models often underestimate rare but hazardous
pollution events. Here, we present SynCast, a high-resolution neural
forecasting model that integrates meteorological and air composition data to
improve predictions of both average and extreme pollution levels. Built on a
regionally adapted transformer backbone and enhanced with a diffusion-based
stochastic refinement module, SynCast captures the nonlinear dynamics driving
PM spikes more accurately than existing approaches. Leveraging on harmonized
ERA5 and CAMS datasets, our model shows substantial gains in forecasting
fidelity across multiple PM variables (PM$_1$, PM$_{2.5}$, PM$_{10}$),
especially under extreme conditions. We demonstrate that conventional loss
functions underrepresent distributional tails (rare pollution events) and show
that SynCast, guided by domain-aware objectives and extreme value theory,
significantly enhances performance in highly impacted regions without
compromising global accuracy. This approach provides a scalable foundation for
next-generation air quality early warning systems and supports climate-health
risk mitigation in vulnerable regions.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces the Spectral Transformation Network (STNet) to enhance deep learning methods for solving operator eigenvalue problems by addressing spectral distribution challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the curse of dimensionality and improve numerical methods for operator eigenvalue problems, particularly utilizing spectral transformations to enhance deep learning methods.

Method: The proposed STNet iteratively applies deflation projection to exclude solved eigenfunctions and uses filter transforms to amplify desired eigenvalues, simplifying the operator eigenvalue problem.

Result: STNet consistently surpasses existing deep learning approaches, achieving state-of-the-art performance in accuracy.

Conclusion: Spectral transformations, as applied in STNet, effectively simplify operator eigenvalue problems and enhance precision in deep learning methods.

Abstract: Operator eigenvalue problems play a critical role in various scientific
fields and engineering applications, yet numerical methods are hindered by the
curse of dimensionality. Recent deep learning methods provide an efficient
approach to address this challenge by iteratively updating neural networks.
These methods' performance relies heavily on the spectral distribution of the
given operator: larger gaps between the operator's eigenvalues will improve
precision, thus tailored spectral transformations that leverage the spectral
distribution can enhance their performance. Based on this observation, we
propose the Spectral Transformation Network (STNet). During each iteration,
STNet uses approximate eigenvalues and eigenfunctions to perform spectral
transformations on the original operator, turning it into an equivalent but
easier problem. Specifically, we employ deflation projection to exclude the
subspace corresponding to already solved eigenfunctions, thereby reducing the
search space and avoiding converging to existing eigenfunctions. Additionally,
our filter transform magnifies eigenvalues in the desired region and suppresses
those outside, further improving performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that STNet consistently outperforms existing learning-based methods, achieving
state-of-the-art performance in accuracy.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper presents a machine learning method for predicting the number of barges in tow using AIS vessel tracking data, attaining strong prediction accuracy and emphasizing key vessel maneuverability features.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the challenge of accurately estimating barge quantities in real-time on inland waterways, which is important for maritime operations but currently constrained by traditional systems.

Method: Machine learning models were trained using manually annotated satellite data matched with AIS vessel tracking data to predict barge counts. Recursive Feature Elimination identified predictive features, and six regression models were tested.

Result: The Poisson Regressor model achieved the best performance with 1.92 Mean Absolute Error (MAE) using 12 key features, highlighting vessel maneuverability metrics as the most predictive.

Conclusion: The approach demonstrates scalable applications for Maritime Domain Awareness, offering potential enhancements in lock scheduling, port management, and freight planning, with future research aimed at model generalizability across diverse river systems.

Abstract: Accurate, real-time estimation of barge quantity on inland waterways remains
a critical challenge due to the non-self-propelled nature of barges and the
limitations of existing monitoring systems. This study introduces a novel
method to use Automatic Identification System (AIS) vessel tracking data to
predict the number of barges in tow using Machine Learning (ML). To train and
test the model, barge instances were manually annotated from satellite scenes
across the Lower Mississippi River. Labeled images were matched to AIS vessel
tracks using a spatiotemporal matching procedure. A comprehensive set of 30
AIS-derived features capturing vessel geometry, dynamic movement, and
trajectory patterns were created and evaluated using Recursive Feature
Elimination (RFE) to identify the most predictive variables. Six regression
models, including ensemble, kernel-based, and generalized linear approaches,
were trained and evaluated. The Poisson Regressor model yielded the best
performance, achieving a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 1.92 barges using 12 of
the 30 features. The feature importance analysis revealed that metrics
capturing vessel maneuverability such as course entropy, speed variability and
trip length were most predictive of barge count. The proposed approach provides
a scalable, readily implementable method for enhancing Maritime Domain
Awareness (MDA), with strong potential applications in lock scheduling, port
management, and freight planning. Future work will expand the proof of concept
presented here to explore model transferability to other inland rivers with
differing operational and environmental conditions.

TL;DR: The paper introduces Safe Text embedding Guidance (STG), a training-free method to improve the safety of text-to-image diffusion models without compromising generation quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the issue of harmful outputs generated by text-to-image models due to inappropriate or biased datasets, aiming for safer and responsible AI applications.

Method: Proposing Safe Text embedding Guidance (STG), which adjusts text embeddings during sampling using a safety function evaluated on expected final images, requiring no additional training.

Result: STG achieves improved safety in content generation, surpassing training-based and training-free baselines in scenarios like nudity, violence, and artist-style removal, while preserving semantic fidelity.

Conclusion: The approach effectively aligns model outputs with safety constraints, enhancing safety without significant trade-offs in output quality, demonstrating a practical and scalable solution.

Abstract: Text-to-image models have recently made significant advances in generating
realistic and semantically coherent images, driven by advanced diffusion models
and large-scale web-crawled datasets. However, these datasets often contain
inappropriate or biased content, raising concerns about the generation of
harmful outputs when provided with malicious text prompts. We propose Safe Text
embedding Guidance (STG), a training-free approach to improve the safety of
diffusion models by guiding the text embeddings during sampling. STG adjusts
the text embeddings based on a safety function evaluated on the expected final
denoised image, allowing the model to generate safer outputs without additional
training. Theoretically, we show that STG aligns the underlying model
distribution with safety constraints, thereby achieving safer outputs while
minimally affecting generation quality. Experiments on various safety
scenarios, including nudity, violence, and artist-style removal, show that STG
consistently outperforms both training-based and training-free baselines in
removing unsafe content while preserving the core semantic intent of input
prompts. Our code is available at https://github.com/aailab-kaist/STG.

Motivation: Existing methods struggle to capture the temporal evolution of connections between specific functional communities in the brain.

Method: The framework uses medically-supported static partitioning (e.g., Yeo and Smith ICA) to extract connection pathway data, modeling them with a temporal neural network.

Result: Validated on three public fMRI datasets, NeuroPathNet outperformed mainstream methods across multiple indicators.

Conclusion: This work advances dynamic graph learning for brain network analysis and presents potential clinical applications in neurological disease diagnosis.

Abstract: Understanding the evolution of brain functional networks over time is of
great significance for the analysis of cognitive mechanisms and the diagnosis
of neurological diseases. Existing methods often have difficulty in capturing
the temporal evolution characteristics of connections between specific
functional communities. To this end, this paper proposes a new path-level
trajectory modeling framework (NeuroPathNet) to characterize the dynamic
behavior of connection pathways between brain functional partitions. Based on
medically supported static partitioning schemes (such as Yeo and Smith ICA), we
extract the time series of connection strengths between each pair of functional
partitions and model them using a temporal neural network. We validate the
model performance on three public functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI)
datasets, and the results show that it outperforms existing mainstream methods
in multiple indicators. This study can promote the development of dynamic graph
learning methods for brain network analysis, and provide possible clinical
applications for the diagnosis of neurological diseases.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces a Global-Local Fusion sampling strategy to enhance Physics-Informed Neural Networks, combining global stability and local efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study seeks to address the challenge of balancing accuracy and efficiency in Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) by optimizing the placement of collocation points in solving complex PDEs efficiently.

Method: The GLF sampling strategy combines global and local methods by using Gaussian noise inversely scaled to residuals for collocation point generation, alongside a lightweight linear surrogate for global residual approximation.

Result: Experiments show that GLF improves both accuracy and efficiency of PINNs compared to traditional global and local sampling strategies when solving benchmark PDEs.

Conclusion: The GLF strategy offers a practical and scalable solution for enhancing PINNs' reliability and computational efficiency in handling complex PDE problems.

Abstract: The accuracy of Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) critically depends
on the placement of collocation points, as the PDE loss is approximated through
sampling over the solution domain. Global sampling ensures stability by
covering the entire domain but requires many samples and is computationally
expensive, whereas local sampling improves efficiency by focusing on
high-residual regions but may neglect well-learned areas, reducing robustness.
We propose a Global-Local Fusion (GLF) Sampling Strategy that combines the
strengths of both approaches. Specifically, new collocation points are
generated by perturbing training points with Gaussian noise scaled inversely to
the residual, thereby concentrating samples in difficult regions while
preserving exploration. To further reduce computational overhead, a lightweight
linear surrogate is introduced to approximate the global residual-based
distribution, achieving similar effectiveness at a fraction of the cost.
Together, these components, residual-adaptive sampling and residual-based
approximation, preserve the stability of global methods while retaining the
efficiency of local refinement. Extensive experiments on benchmark PDEs
demonstrate that GLF consistently improves both accuracy and efficiency
compared with global and local sampling strategies. This study provides a
practical and scalable framework for enhancing the reliability and efficiency
of PINNs in solving complex and high-dimensional PDEs.

TL;DR: This paper addresses the selection of input variables for spatio-temporal multivariate time series forecasting (STMF) to optimize accuracy and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome limitations in forecasting where the number of sensors is smaller than monitoring locations, and to improve model performance by optimally selecting input variables.

Method: A unified framework combining masked variable-parameter pruning, prioritized variable-parameter replay, and dynamic extrapolation mechanism to jointly optimize variable selection and model accuracy.

Result: Experimental results on five datasets highlight significant improvements in forecast accuracy and model efficiency over state-of-the-art baselines.

Conclusion: Jointly selecting input variables and optimizing the forecasting model enhances prediction accuracy and computational efficiency.

Abstract: Spatio-Temporal Multivariate time series Forecast (STMF) uses the time series
of $n$ spatially distributed variables in a period of recent past to forecast
their values in a period of near future. It has important applications in
spatio-temporal sensing forecast such as road traffic prediction and air
pollution prediction. Recent papers have addressed a practical problem of
missing variables in the model input, which arises in the sensing applications
where the number $m$ of sensors is far less than the number $n$ of locations to
be monitored, due to budget constraints. We observe that the state of the art
assumes that the $m$ variables (i.e., locations with sensors) in the model
input are pre-determined and the important problem of how to choose the $m$
variables in the input has never been studied. This paper fills the gap by
studying a new problem of STMF with chosen variables, which optimally selects
$m$-out-of-$n$ variables for the model input in order to maximize the forecast
accuracy. We propose a unified framework that jointly performs variable
selection and model optimization for both forecast accuracy and model
efficiency. It consists of three novel technical components: (1) masked
variable-parameter pruning, which progressively prunes less informative
variables and attention parameters through quantile-based masking; (2)
prioritized variable-parameter replay, which replays low-loss past samples to
preserve learned knowledge for model stability; (3) dynamic extrapolation
mechanism, which propagates information from variables selected for the input
to all other variables via learnable spatial embeddings and adjacency
information. Experiments on five real-world datasets show that our work
significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art baselines in both accuracy and
efficiency, demonstrating the effectiveness of joint variable selection and
model optimization.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a self-supervised learning framework for solving combinatorial optimization problems with discrete constraints using neural networks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The challenge lies in designing a differentiable approach to handle discrete constraints inherent in combinatorial optimization problems.

Method: The authors use techniques from convex geometry and Carathéodory's theorem to decompose neural network outputs into feasible solutions while enabling self-supervised training.

Result: Experiments demonstrate that the approach consistently outperforms neural baselines in cardinality-constrained optimization and extends well to other combinatorial tasks.

Conclusion: The framework provides an efficient and quality-preserving approach for solving diverse discrete combinatorial optimization problems using neural networks.

Abstract: Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) for Combinatorial Optimization (CO) is an
emerging paradigm for solving combinatorial problems using neural networks. In
this paper, we address a central challenge of SSL for CO: solving problems with
discrete constraints. We design an end-to-end differentiable framework that
enables us to solve discrete constrained optimization problems with neural
networks. Concretely, we leverage algorithmic techniques from the literature on
convex geometry and Carath\'eodory's theorem to decompose neural network
outputs into convex combinations of polytope corners that correspond to
feasible sets. This decomposition-based approach enables self-supervised
training but also ensures efficient quality-preserving rounding of the neural
net output into feasible solutions. Extensive experiments in
cardinality-constrained optimization show that our approach can consistently
outperform neural baselines. We further provide worked-out examples of how our
method can be applied beyond cardinality-constrained problems to a diverse set
of combinatorial optimization tasks, including finding independent sets in
graphs, and solving matroid-constrained problems.

*Akira Tamamori*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Two-Stage LKPLO outlier detection framework, which uses a loss-based measure, kernel PCA, and local clustering, achieving state-of-the-art results on challenging datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations in conventional projection-based outlier detection methods, specifically their reliance on fixed statistical metrics and single data structure assumption.

Method: The framework combines a loss-based outlyingness measure (PLO), global kernel PCA to linearize non-linear structures, and local clustering to manage multi-modal distributions.

Result: Experiments with 10 benchmark datasets using automated hyperparameter optimization confirm superior performance, especially for multi-cluster and high-dimensional data.

Conclusion: Two-Stage LKPLO is a robust, multi-stage framework offering significant improvements for outlier detection problems, highlighting the value of hybrid architectures.

Abstract: This paper presents Two-Stage LKPLO, a novel multi-stage outlier detection
framework that overcomes the coexisting limitations of conventional
projection-based methods: their reliance on a fixed statistical metric and
their assumption of a single data structure. Our framework uniquely synthesizes
three key concepts: (1) a generalized loss-based outlyingness measure (PLO)
that replaces the fixed metric with flexible, adaptive loss functions like our
proposed SVM-like loss; (2) a global kernel PCA stage to linearize non-linear
data structures; and (3) a subsequent local clustering stage to handle
multi-modal distributions. Comprehensive 5-fold cross-validation experiments on
10 benchmark datasets, with automated hyperparameter optimization, demonstrate
that Two-Stage LKPLO achieves state-of-the-art performance. It significantly
outperforms strong baselines on datasets with challenging structures where
existing methods fail, most notably on multi-cluster data (Optdigits) and
complex, high-dimensional data (Arrhythmia). Furthermore, an ablation study
empirically confirms that the synergistic combination of both the kernelization
and localization stages is indispensable for its superior performance. This
work contributes a powerful new tool for a significant class of outlier
detection problems and underscores the importance of hybrid, multi-stage
architectures.

### [294] [Mitigating Negative Transfer via Reducing Environmental Disagreement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24044)
*Hui Sun,Zheng Xie,Hao-Yuan He,Ming Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper addresses negative transfer in unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) by introducing a causally disentangled learning method called RED to reduce cross-domain disagreement on non-causal features, achieving state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to overcome negative transfer in UDA caused by domain shift, particularly due to reliance on non-causal environmental features.

Method: The proposed method, RED, disentangles samples into causal (domain-invariant) and non-causal (domain-specific) features using adversarial training and reduces environmental disagreement based on non-causal features.

Result: Experimental results demonstrate that RED effectively reduces negative transfer and achieves superior performance compared to prior methods.

Conclusion: Causally disentangled learning, specifically RED, successfully addresses domain shift and improves knowledge transfer in UDA, offering a robust approach for challenging tasks.

Abstract: Unsupervised Domain Adaptation~(UDA) focuses on transferring knowledge from a
labeled source domain to an unlabeled target domain, addressing the challenge
of \emph{domain shift}. Significant domain shifts hinder effective knowledge
transfer, leading to \emph{negative transfer} and deteriorating model
performance. Therefore, mitigating negative transfer is essential. This study
revisits negative transfer through the lens of causally disentangled learning,
emphasizing cross-domain discriminative disagreement on non-causal
environmental features as a critical factor. Our theoretical analysis reveals
that overreliance on non-causal environmental features as the environment
evolves can cause discriminative disagreements~(termed \emph{environmental
disagreement}), thereby resulting in negative transfer. To address this, we
propose Reducing Environmental Disagreement~(RED), which disentangles each
sample into domain-invariant causal features and domain-specific non-causal
environmental features via adversarially training domain-specific environmental
feature extractors in the opposite domains. Subsequently, RED estimates and
reduces environmental disagreement based on domain-specific non-causal
environmental features. Experimental results confirm that RED effectively
mitigates negative transfer and achieves state-of-the-art performance.

TL;DR: CA-GAN introduces a novel framework for generating synthetic tabular datasets while preserving causal structure, utility, and privacy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address privacy concerns and regulatory challenges in using tabular data for model training and large-scale analysis.

Method: CA-GAN combines causal graph extraction with a Conditional WGAN-GP optimized via Reinforcement Learning.

Result: Comparison with six SOTA methods across 14 datasets shows superiority in causal, utility, and privacy preservation.

Conclusion: CA-GAN is a practical solution for creating high-quality, privacy-compliant synthetic data suitable for various data engineering applications.

Abstract: The utility of tabular data for tasks ranging from model training to
large-scale data analysis is often constrained by privacy concerns or
regulatory hurdles. While existing data generation methods, particularly those
based on Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), have shown promise, they
frequently struggle with capturing complex causal relationship, maintaining
data utility, and providing provable privacy guarantees suitable for enterprise
deployment. We introduce CA-GAN, a novel generative framework specifically
engineered to address these challenges for real-world tabular datasets. CA-GAN
utilizes a two-step approach: causal graph extraction to learn a robust,
comprehensive causal relationship in the data's manifold, followed by a custom
Conditional WGAN-GP (Wasserstein GAN with Gradient Penalty) that operates
exclusively as per the structure of nodes in the causal graph. More
importantly, the generator is trained with a new Reinforcement Learning-based
objective that aligns the causal graphs constructed from real and fake data,
ensuring the causal awareness in both training and sampling phases. We
demonstrate CA-GAN superiority over six SOTA methods across 14 tabular
datasets. Our evaluations, focused on core data engineering metrics: causal
preservation, utility preservation, and privacy preservation. Our method offers
a practical, high-performance solution for data engineers seeking to create
high-quality, privacy-compliant synthetic datasets to benchmark database
systems, accelerate software development, and facilitate secure data-driven
research.

*Hao Jia,Penghao Zhao,Hao Wu,Yuan Gao,Yangyu Tao,Bin Cui*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a Retrieval-Augmented Prediction (RAP) framework combining deep networks and historical data to accurately predict complex physical systems over the long term.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations in deep learning models where errors accumulate during long-term predictions, leading to unrealistic results.

Method: The RAP framework retrieves historical data as conditional input for deep networks, incorporating a dual-stream architecture to guide predictions with physically plausible trajectories.

Result: RAP outperforms state-of-the-art methods and analog-only baselines across diverse benchmarks while maintaining physically realistic predictions.

Conclusion: The RAP framework enhances long-term prediction accuracy and reliability for complex physical systems by synergizing parametric and non-parametric methods.

Abstract: Accurate and long-term spatiotemporal prediction for complex physical systems
remains a fundamental challenge in scientific computing. While deep learning
models, as powerful parametric approximators, have shown remarkable success,
they suffer from a critical limitation: the accumulation of errors during
long-term autoregressive rollouts often leads to physically implausible
artifacts. This deficiency arises from their purely parametric nature, which
struggles to capture the full constraints of a system's intrinsic dynamics. To
address this, we introduce a novel \textbf{Retrieval-Augmented Prediction
(RAP)} framework, a hybrid paradigm that synergizes the predictive power of
deep networks with the grounded truth of historical data. The core philosophy
of RAP is to leverage historical evolutionary exemplars as a non-parametric
estimate of the system's local dynamics. For any given state, RAP efficiently
retrieves the most similar historical analog from a large-scale database. The
true future evolution of this analog then serves as a \textbf{reference
target}. Critically, this target is not a hard constraint in the loss function
but rather a powerful conditional input to a specialized dual-stream
architecture. It provides strong \textbf{dynamic guidance}, steering the
model's predictions towards physically viable trajectories. In extensive
benchmarks across meteorology, turbulence, and fire simulation, RAP not only
surpasses state-of-the-art methods but also significantly outperforms a strong
\textbf{analog-only forecasting baseline}. More importantly, RAP generates
predictions that are more physically realistic by effectively suppressing error
divergence in long-term rollouts.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Researchers present FolDE, a novel Active Learning-assisted Directed Evolution (ALDE) method, which improves protein optimization by addressing training data homogeneity issues and utilizing protein language models and batch diversity techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional methods for optimizing proteins are expensive due to iterative mutant testing, and current ALDE methods suffer from issues with homogeneous training data, limiting accuracy and prediction effectiveness in directed evolution campaigns.

Method: The proposed method, FolDE, enhances protein optimization by incorporating warm-starting techniques using protein language models to improve activity prediction and introducing a constant-liar batch selector to enhance batch diversity.

Result: Simulations on 20 protein targets showed that FolDE outperforms existing ALDE approaches, identifying 23% more top 10% mutants and being 55% more likely to discover top 1% mutations.

Conclusion: FolDE represents a significant advancement in protein optimization by improving outcomes and making the process more cost-effective, with open-source availability ensuring broader accessibility for laboratories.

Abstract: Proteins are traditionally optimized through the costly construction and
measurement of many mutants. Active Learning-assisted Directed Evolution (ALDE)
alleviates that cost by predicting the best improvements and iteratively
testing mutants to inform predictions. However, existing ALDE methods face a
critical limitation: selecting the highest-predicted mutants in each round
yields homogeneous training data insufficient for accurate prediction models in
subsequent rounds. Here we present FolDE, an ALDE method designed to maximize
end-of-campaign success. In simulations across 20 protein targets, FolDE
discovers 23% more top 10% mutants than the best baseline ALDE method (p=0.005)
and is 55% more likely to find top 1% mutants. FolDE achieves this primarily
through naturalness-based warm-starting, which augments limited activity
measurements with protein language model outputs to improve activity
prediction. We also introduce a constant-liar batch selector, which improves
batch diversity; this is important in multi-mutation campaigns but had limited
effect in our benchmarks. The complete workflow is freely available as
open-source software, making efficient protein optimization accessible to any
laboratory.

*Kanghyun Choi,Hyeyoon Lee,SunJong Park,Dain Kwon,Jinho Lee*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FP8 generates performance benefits in operations with large sizes but is inefficient for LoRA due to small matrix dimensions. FALQON integrates LoRA adapters directly during FP8-quantized training, significantly reducing quantization overhead and enhancing training efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Despite hardware acceleration, FP8 quantization faces challenges with low-rank adaptation (LoRA) due to small matrix dimensions in fine-tuning LLMs, limiting overall training speedup.

Method: The study introduces FALQON, which merges LoRA adapters into FP8-quantized backbones during fine-tuning. It features reformulated computation approaches and a row-wise proxy update mechanism to reduce quantization overhead without requiring post-training quantization.

Result: FALQON achieves around 3× training speedup compared to existing FP8 quantized LoRA approaches, while maintaining similar model accuracy and improving the efficiency of deployment workflows.

Conclusion: FALQON provides a practical solution for large-scale model fine-tuning by overcoming FP8 quantization's inherent inefficiency in LoRA setups, ensuring faster and more streamlined training processes.

Abstract: Low-bit floating-point (FP) formats, such as FP8, provide significant
acceleration and memory savings in model training thanks to native hardware
support on modern GPUs and NPUs. However, we analyze that FP8 quantization
offers speedup primarily for large-dimensional matrix multiplications, while
inherent quantization overheads diminish speedup when applied to low-rank
adaptation (LoRA), which uses small-dimensional matrices for efficient
fine-tuning of large language models (LLMs). To address this limitation, we
propose FALQON, a novel framework that eliminates the quantization overhead
from separate LoRA computational paths by directly merging LoRA adapters into
an FP8-quantized backbone during fine-tuning. Furthermore, we reformulate the
forward and backward computations for merged adapters to significantly reduce
quantization overhead, and introduce a row-wise proxy update mechanism that
efficiently integrates substantial updates into the quantized backbone.
Experimental evaluations demonstrate that FALQON achieves approximately a
3$\times$ training speedup over existing quantized LoRA methods with a similar
level of accuracy, providing a practical solution for efficient large-scale
model fine-tuning. Moreover, FALQON's end-to-end FP8 workflow removes the need
for post-training quantization, facilitating efficient deployment. Code is

*Moongyu Jeon,Sangwoo Shin,Dongjae Jeon,Albert No*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces a framework for log-likelihood estimation using score-matching losses in discrete diffusion models, grounded in information theory.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop principled estimators for log-likelihood in discrete diffusion models, addressing the gap in existing methodologies by leveraging information-theoretic relations.

Method: The authors propose the I-MDSE and I-MDCE relations to link mutual information with score-based losses like DSE and DCE in discrete and masked diffusion models.

Result: The framework proves score-based losses as exact log-likelihood estimators. Practical extensions such as conditional likelihood estimation and likelihood ratio computations are validated through experiments on synthetic and real-world data.

Conclusion: The proposed relations and framework enhance understanding of score-based losses, providing stable and accurate estimators for log-likelihood in discrete diffusion modeling.

Abstract: We present an information-theoretic framework for discrete diffusion models
that yields principled estimators of log-likelihood using score-matching
losses. Inspired by the I-MMSE identity for the Gaussian setup, we derive
analogous results for the discrete setting. Specifically, we introduce the
Information-Minimum Denoising Score Entropy (I-MDSE) relation, which links
mutual information between data and its diffused version to the minimum
denoising score entropy (DSE) loss. We extend this theory to masked diffusion
and establish the Information-Minimum Denoising Cross-Entropy (I-MDCE)
relation, connecting cross-entropy losses to mutual information in discrete
masked processes. These results provide a time-integral decomposition of the
log-likelihood of the data in terms of optimal score-based losses, showing that
commonly used losses such as DSE and DCE are not merely variational bounds but
tight and principled estimators of log-likelihood. The I-MDCE decomposition
further enables practical extensions, including time-free formula, conditional
likelihood estimation in prompt-response tasks, and coupled Monte Carlo
estimation of likelihood ratios. Experiments on synthetic and real-world data
confirm the accuracy, variance stability, and utility of our estimators. The

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper addresses cost-effective knowledge graph construction for retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) in LLM-based question answering, proposing Graph-Guided Concept Selection (G2ConS) that reduces costs and improves performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study focuses on minimizing costs and improving retrieval in LLM-based question answering through enhanced knowledge graph construction, crucial for domains requiring complex reasoning.

Method: The proposed G2ConS combines a chunk selection method to identify salient document portions and an LLM-independent concept graph to mitigate gaps caused by selective chunking, reducing costs while enhancing retrieval.

Result: G2ConS demonstrated better performance than existing methods, reducing construction costs, improving retrieval capabilities, and enhancing answering quality on diverse datasets.

Conclusion: Graph-Guided Concept Selection (G2ConS) is an effective approach for constructing knowledge graphs with reduced costs while maintaining high retrieval and answering quality, meeting the demands of resource-sensitive domains.

Abstract: Graph-based RAG constructs a knowledge graph (KG) from text chunks to enhance
retrieval in Large Language Model (LLM)-based question answering. It is
especially beneficial in domains such as biomedicine, law, and political
science, where effective retrieval often involves multi-hop reasoning over
proprietary documents. However, these methods demand numerous LLM calls to
extract entities and relations from text chunks, incurring prohibitive costs at
scale. Through a carefully designed ablation study, we observe that certain
words (termed concepts) and their associated documents are more important.
Based on this insight, we propose Graph-Guided Concept Selection (G2ConS). Its
core comprises a chunk selection method and an LLM-independent concept graph.
The former selects salient document chunks to reduce KG construction costs; the
latter closes knowledge gaps introduced by chunk selection at zero cost.
Evaluations on multiple real-world datasets show that G2ConS outperforms all
baselines in construction cost, retrieval effectiveness, and answering quality.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how Causal CNNs can model and interpret dynamic systems through spectral behavior in multi-frequency datasets, providing insights into their spectral learning properties.

Method: Analysis of Causal CNNs through extended convolutional kernels, validating their reduced equivalence to FIR filters optimized via least-squares on simulated and real-world vibration datasets.

Result: Causal CNNs mimic the behavior of optimized Finite Impulse Response filters, with improved spectral feature capture both implicitly and explicitly, validated on diverse dynamic response datasets.

Conclusion: Causal CNNs offer enhanced interpretability for dynamic systems modeling and reveal their potential for spectral learning in sparse frequency signals, linking them closely to optimized FIR filtering.

Abstract: This study investigates the behavior of Causal Convolutional Neural Networks
(CNNs) with quasi-linear activation functions when applied to time-series data
characterized by multimodal frequency content. We demonstrate that, once
trained, such networks exhibit properties analogous to Finite Impulse Response
(FIR) filters, particularly when the convolutional kernels are of extended
length exceeding those typically employed in standard CNN architectures. Causal
CNNs are shown to capture spectral features both implicitly and explicitly,
offering enhanced interpretability for tasks involving dynamic systems.
Leveraging the associative property of convolution, we further show that the
entire network can be reduced to an equivalent single-layer filter resembling
an FIR filter optimized via least-squares criteria. This equivalence yields new
insights into the spectral learning behavior of CNNs trained on signals with
sparse frequency content. The approach is validated on both simulated beam
dynamics and real-world bridge vibration datasets, underlining its relevance
for modeling and identifying physical systems governed by dynamic responses.

TL;DR: This study proposes a deep learning-driven framework for identifying lithium-ion battery model parameters, overcoming limitations in traditional and machine learning methods by boosting computational efficiency and accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Lithium-ion battery diagnosis is critical due to the increase in electric vehicle usage, but current methods are either computationally costly or impractical under dynamic scenarios.

Method: A deep learning-based framework is introduced, combining a neural surrogate model (NeuralSPMe) and a deep learning-based fixed-point iteration method (PUNet) for fast and precise parameter identification.

Result: The framework demonstrates over 2000 times faster parameter identification, improved sample efficiency, and 10 times higher accuracy compared to metaheuristic algorithms under dynamic EV load conditions.

Conclusion: The proposed approach significantly advances battery health assessment, especially under real-world dynamic operating conditions, by offering improved speed, efficiency, and accuracy.

Abstract: The rapid expansion of electric vehicles has intensified the need for
accurate and efficient diagnosis of lithium-ion batteries. Parameter
identification of electrochemical battery models is widely recognized as a
powerful method for battery health assessment. However, conventional
metaheuristic approaches suffer from high computational cost and slow
convergence, and recent machine learning methods are limited by their reliance
on constant current data, which may not be available in practice. To overcome
these challenges, we propose deep learning-based framework for parameter
identification of electrochemical battery models. The proposed framework
combines a neural surrogate model of the single particle model with electrolyte
(NeuralSPMe) and a deep learning-based fixed-point iteration method. NeuralSPMe
is trained on realistic EV load profiles to accurately predict lithium
concentration dynamics under dynamic operating conditions while a parameter
update network (PUNet) performs fixed-point iterative updates to significantly
reduce both the evaluation time per sample and the overall number of iterations
required for convergence. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that the
proposed framework accelerates the parameter identification by more than 2000
times, achieves superior sample efficiency and more than 10 times higher
accuracy compared to conventional metaheuristic algorithms, particularly under
dynamic load scenarios encountered in practical applications.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper systematically evaluates in-context learning (ICL) in Vision-Language Models (VLMs) using multiple benchmarks to explore its effectiveness and limitations. ICL in VLMs is less effective than expected, often focusing on textual cues over visual information.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to explore the underexplored area of in-context learning within Vision-Language Models and analyze its performance, focusing on design, architecture, and training factors.

Method: The authors evaluate seven VLMs across three image captioning benchmarks, analyze attention patterns, and investigate the role of prompt design, architectural choices, training strategies, and instruction tuning.

Result: Training on image-text interleaved data improves ICL but does not integrate visual and textual info effectively. Instruction tuning enhances instruction-following yet reduces reliance on in-context demonstrations. Attention analysis suggests limited multimodal integration as VLMs predominantly focus on textual cues.

Conclusion: Current VLMs show limitations in utilizing multimodal information for ICL. The paper uncovers areas for improvement in enhancing VLMs’ ability to learn from multimodal in-context demonstrations.

Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) enables Large Language Models (LLMs) to learn tasks
from demonstration examples without parameter updates. Although it has been
extensively studied in LLMs, its effectiveness in Vision-Language Models (VLMs)
remains underexplored. In this work, we present a systematic study of ICL in
VLMs, evaluating seven models spanning four architectures on three image
captioning benchmarks. We analyze how prompt design, architectural choices, and
training strategies influence multimodal ICL. To our knowledge, we are the
first to analyze how attention patterns in VLMs vary with an increasing number
of in-context demonstrations. Our results reveal that training on imag-text
interleaved data enhances ICL performance but does not imply effective
integration of visual and textual information from demonstration examples. In
contrast, instruction tuning improves instruction-following but can reduce
reliance on in-context demonstrations, suggesting a trade-off between
instruction alignment and in-context adaptation. Attention analyses further
show that current VLMs primarily focus on textual cues and fail to leverage
visual information, suggesting a limited capacity for multimodal integration.
These findings highlight key limitations in the ICL abilities of current VLMs
and provide insights for enhancing their ability to learn from multimodal
in-context examples.

Conclusion: I-OnsagerNet serves as a general, data-driven framework for discovering and interpreting non-equilibrium dynamics in diverse systems, offering improved analysis capabilities through its novel approach.

Abstract: Complex dissipative systems appear across science and engineering, from
polymers and active matter to learning algorithms. These systems operate far
from equilibrium, where energy dissipation and time irreversibility are key to
their behavior, but are difficult to quantify from data. Learning accurate and
interpretable models of such dynamics remains a major challenge: the models
must be expressive enough to describe diverse processes, yet constrained enough
to remain physically meaningful and mathematically identifiable. Here, we
introduce I-OnsagerNet, a neural framework that learns dissipative stochastic
dynamics directly from trajectories while ensuring both interpretability and
uniqueness. I-OnsagerNet extends the Onsager principle to guarantee that the
learned potential is obtained from the stationary density and that the drift
decomposes cleanly into time-reversible and time-irreversible components, as
dictated by the Helmholtz decomposition. Our approach enables us to calculate
the entropy production and to quantify irreversibility, offering a principled
way to detect and quantify deviations from equilibrium. Applications to polymer
stretching in elongational flow and to stochastic gradient Langevin dynamics
reveal new insights, including super-linear scaling of barrier heights and
sub-linear scaling of entropy production rates with the strain rate, and the
suppression of irreversibility with increasing batch size. I-OnsagerNet thus
establishes a general, data-driven framework for discovering and interpreting
non-equilibrium dynamics.

*Yiheng Du,Aditi S. Krishnapriyan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces EddyFormer, a Transformer-based spectral-element architecture, for simulating turbulence efficiently and accurately without the computational overhead of traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Resolving turbulence through direct numerical simulation is computationally demanding; proposing data-driven approaches like machine learning can help achieve efficiency while maintaining accuracy.

Method: EddyFormer uses a novel spectral-element tokenization to divide flow into grid-scale and subgrid-scale components, capturing local and global turbulence features. It is trained on 3D isotropic turbulence data to achieve DNS-level accuracy and scalability.

Result: EddyFormer achieves DNS-level accuracy with 30x computational speedup, generalizes to unseen domains up to 4x larger, and outperforms prior machine learning models on diverse turbulent flows.

Conclusion: EddyFormer provides an efficient and accurate approach for simulating turbulence, demonstrating scalability, robustness across different domains, and outperforming existing machine learning models on diverse conditions.

Abstract: Computationally resolving turbulence remains a central challenge in fluid
dynamics due to its multi-scale interactions. Fully resolving large-scale
turbulence through direct numerical simulation (DNS) is computationally
prohibitive, motivating data-driven machine learning alternatives. In this
work, we propose EddyFormer, a Transformer-based spectral-element (SEM)
architecture for large-scale turbulence simulation that combines the accuracy
of spectral methods with the scalability of the attention mechanism. We
introduce an SEM tokenization that decomposes the flow into grid-scale and
subgrid-scale components, enabling capture of both local and global features.
We create a new three-dimensional isotropic turbulence dataset and train
EddyFormer to achieves DNS-level accuracy at 256^3 resolution, providing a 30x
speedup over DNS. When applied to unseen domains up to 4x larger than in
training, EddyFormer preserves accuracy on physics-invariant metrics-energy
spectra, correlation functions, and structure functions-showing domain
generalization. On The Well benchmark suite of diverse turbulent flows,
EddyFormer resolves cases where prior ML models fail to converge, accurately
reproducing complex dynamics across a wide range of physical conditions.

*Arpita Kundu,Joyita Chakraborty,Anindita Desarkar,Aritra Sen,Srushti Anil Patil,Vishwanathan Raman*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: V-SAT framework addresses subtitle generation issues by leveraging AI models, improving quality metrics and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing subtitle generation methods have multiple deficiencies like poor synchronization, inappropriate reading speeds, and lack of adaptation to dynamic audio-visual contexts.

Method: Combination of Large Language Models (LLMs), Vision-Language Models (VLMs), Image Processing, and Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) with contextual cues from audio and video.

Result: Improved subtitle quality with SUBER score reduction from 9.6 to 3.54 for language issues and ~0.80 F1-scores for image issues.

Conclusion: V-SAT provides a comprehensive solution for subtitle annotation, enhancing quality and efficiency with human-in-the-loop validation.

Abstract: The surge of audiovisual content on streaming platforms and social media has
heightened the demand for accurate and accessible subtitles. However, existing
subtitle generation methods primarily speech-based transcription or OCR-based
extraction suffer from several shortcomings, including poor synchronization,
incorrect or harmful text, inconsistent formatting, inappropriate reading
speeds, and the inability to adapt to dynamic audio-visual contexts. Current
approaches often address isolated issues, leaving post-editing as a
labor-intensive and time-consuming process. In this paper, we introduce V-SAT
(Video Subtitle Annotation Tool), a unified framework that automatically
detects and corrects a wide range of subtitle quality issues. By combining
Large Language Models(LLMs), Vision-Language Models (VLMs), Image Processing,
and Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR), V-SAT leverages contextual cues from
both audio and video. Subtitle quality improved, with the SUBER score reduced
from 9.6 to 3.54 after resolving all language mode issues and F1-scores of
~0.80 for image mode issues. Human-in-the-loop validation ensures high-quality
results, providing the first comprehensive solution for robust subtitle
annotation.

*Fan Xu,Hao Wu,Kun Wang,Nan Wang,Qingsong Wen,Xian Wu,Wei Gong,Xibin Zhao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SPARK introduces a physics-guided augmentation plugin for dynamical systems, combining physical principles with data-driven approaches to address computational cost and data scarcity challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional numerical methods for dynamical systems are computationally expensive, and modern data-driven methods struggle with limited data and shifts in data distribution.

Method: SPARK utilizes a reconstruction autoencoder to create a physics-rich state dictionary for augmenting training samples, and applies Fourier-enhanced Graph ODE for prediction to capture temporal dependencies.

Result: SPARK outperformed state-of-the-art methods, showing strong results in scenarios with limited data and distribution shifts.

Conclusion: SPARK presents a powerful solution by integrating physics-guided augmentation with modern prediction techniques, improving performance in challenging modeling scenarios.

Abstract: In dynamical system modeling, traditional numerical methods are limited by
high computational costs, while modern data-driven approaches struggle with
data scarcity and distribution shifts. To address these fundamental
limitations, we first propose SPARK, a physics-guided quantitative augmentation
plugin. Specifically, SPARK utilizes a reconstruction autoencoder to integrate
physical parameters into a physics-rich discrete state dictionary. This state
dictionary then acts as a structured dictionary of physical states, enabling
the creation of new, physically-plausible training samples via principled
interpolation in the latent space. Further, for downstream prediction, these
augmented representations are seamlessly integrated with a Fourier-enhanced
Graph ODE, a combination designed to robustly model the enriched data
distribution while capturing long-term temporal dependencies. Extensive
experiments on diverse benchmarks demonstrate that SPARK significantly
outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, particularly in challenging
out-of-distribution scenarios and data-scarce regimes, proving the efficacy of
our physics-guided augmentation paradigm.

*Alisher Turubayev,Anna Shopova,Fabian Lange,Mahmut Kamalak,Paul Mattes,Victoria Ayvasky,Bert Arnrich,Bjarne Pfitzner,Robin P. van de Water*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper evaluates imputation techniques for missing ICU data to enhance clinical prediction models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenges posed by missing ICU data and improving clinical prediction models using machine learning.

Method: Comparison of 15 imputation and 4 amputation methods on major ICU datasets through an extensible and reusable benchmark.

Result: Identified best practices for imputing vital signs and provided a foundation to improve clinical models' performance.

Conclusion: The work establishes a robust benchmark for guiding machine learning researchers in selecting optimal imputation methods for ICU datasets.

Abstract: As more Intensive Care Unit (ICU) data becomes available, the interest in
developing clinical prediction models to improve healthcare protocols
increases. However, the lack of data quality still hinders clinical prediction
using Machine Learning (ML). Many vital sign measurements, such as heart rate,
contain sizeable missing segments, leaving gaps in the data that could
negatively impact prediction performance. Previous works have introduced
numerous time-series imputation techniques. Nevertheless, more comprehensive
work is needed to compare a representative set of methods for imputing ICU
vital signs and determine the best practice. In reality, ad-hoc imputation
techniques that could decrease prediction accuracy, like zero imputation, are
still used. In this work, we compare established imputation techniques to guide
researchers in improving the performance of clinical prediction models by
selecting the most accurate imputation technique. We introduce an extensible
and reusable benchmark with currently 15 imputation and 4 amputation methods,
created for benchmarking on major ICU datasets. We hope to provide a
comparative basis and facilitate further ML development to bring more models
into clinical practice.

### [309] [PRIVET: Privacy Metric Based on Extreme Value Theory](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24233)
*Antoine Szatkownik,Aurélien Decelle,Beatriz Seoane,Nicolas Bereux,Léo Planche,Guillaume Charpiat,Burak Yelmen,Flora Jay,Cyril Furtlehner*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces PRIVET, an algorithm for assessing privacy leakage in synthetic data by assigning a privacy leak score to individual samples and provides sample-level assessments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Privacy concerns with synthetic data generated by deep generative models are critical, as existing evaluation methods lack sample-level granularity and interpretability.

Method: The authors propose PRIVET, which uses extreme value statistics on nearest-neighbor distances to assign privacy leak scores, ensuring rigorous sample-level privacy evaluation.

Result: PRIVET successfully detects privacy leakage and memorization across diverse data modalities and settings, even with challenges like very high dimensionality or limited sample sizes.

Conclusion: PRIVET addresses limitations of current privacy evaluation methods by providing sample-based insights, aiding practical deployment of synthetic data in various applications.

Abstract: Deep generative models are often trained on sensitive data, such as genetic
sequences, health data, or more broadly, any copyrighted, licensed or protected
content. This raises critical concerns around privacy-preserving synthetic
data, and more specifically around privacy leakage, an issue closely tied to
overfitting. Existing methods almost exclusively rely on global criteria to
estimate the risk of privacy failure associated to a model, offering only
quantitative non interpretable insights. The absence of rigorous evaluation
methods for data privacy at the sample-level may hinder the practical
deployment of synthetic data in real-world applications. Using extreme value
statistics on nearest-neighbor distances, we propose PRIVET, a generic
sample-based, modality-agnostic algorithm that assigns an individual privacy
leak score to each synthetic sample. We empirically demonstrate that PRIVET
reliably detects instances of memorization and privacy leakage across diverse
data modalities, including settings with very high dimensionality, limited
sample sizes such as genetic data and even under underfitting regimes. We
compare our method to existing approaches under controlled settings and show
its advantage in providing both dataset level and sample level assessments
through qualitative and quantitative outputs. Additionally, our analysis
reveals limitations in existing computer vision embeddings to yield
perceptually meaningful distances when identifying near-duplicate samples.

*Ludovic Schwartz,Hamish Flynn,Gergely Neu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces the SOIDS algorithm that achieves optimal regret rates in both data-rich and data-poor regimes for stochastic sparse linear bandits, extending prior results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing algorithms for high-dimensional online decision-making problems fail to adapt optimally to both data-rich and data-poor regimes simultaneously.

Method: The authors propose Sparse Optimistic Information Directed Sampling (SOIDS) and develop a novel analysis involving a time-dependent learning rate to balance information and regret.

Result: SOIDS achieves optimal worst-case regret in both data-rich and data-poor regimes without needing Bayesian assumptions.

Conclusion: SOIDS extends theoretical guarantees and exhibits strong empirical performance, overcoming prior limitations of sparse linear bandit algorithms.

Abstract: Many high-dimensional online decision-making problems can be modeled as
stochastic sparse linear bandits. Most existing algorithms are designed to
achieve optimal worst-case regret in either the data-rich regime, where
polynomial dependence on the ambient dimension is unavoidable, or the data-poor
regime, where dimension-independence is possible at the cost of worse
dependence on the number of rounds. In contrast, the sparse Information
Directed Sampling (IDS) algorithm satisfies a Bayesian regret bound that has
the optimal rate in both regimes simultaneously. In this work, we explore the
use of Sparse Optimistic Information Directed Sampling (SOIDS) to achieve the
same adaptivity in the worst-case setting, without Bayesian assumptions.
Through a novel analysis that enables the use of a time-dependent learning
rate, we show that SOIDS can optimally balance information and regret. Our
results extend the theoretical guarantees of IDS, providing the first algorithm
that simultaneously achieves optimal worst-case regret in both the data-rich
and data-poor regimes. We empirically demonstrate the good performance of
SOIDS.

### [311] [PaTaRM: Bridging Pairwise and Pointwise Signals via Preference-Aware Task-Adaptive Reward Modeling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24235)
*Ai Jian,Jingqing Ruan,Xing Ma,Dailin Li,QianLin Zhou,Ke Zeng,Xunliang Cai*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces PaTaRM, a new framework for reward modeling in reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study focuses on addressing limitations in current reward model training approaches, which rely on either pair-wise methods with binary labels or point-wise methods with expensive, inflexible labeling strategies.

Method: PaTaRM combines a Preference-Aware Reward (PAR) mechanism using pairwise data and a task-adaptive rubric system that flexibly generates evaluation criteria.

Result: PaTaRM exhibits a 4.7% improvement on RewardBench and RMBench datasets and enhances RLHF performance by 13.6% on IFEval and InFoBench benchmarks.

Conclusion: PaTaRM provides more efficient, adaptable, and interpretable reward modeling for aligning large language models with human preferences.

Abstract: Reward models (RMs) are central to reinforcement learning from human feedback
(RLHF), providing the critical supervision signals that align large language
models (LLMs) with human preferences. While generative reward models (GRMs)
offer greater interpretability than traditional scalar RMs, current training
paradigms remain limited. Pair-wise methods rely on binary good-versus-bad
labels, which cause mismatches for point-wise inference and necessitate complex
pairing strategies for effective application in RLHF. On the other hand,
point-wise methods require more elaborate absolute labeling with rubric-driven
criteria, resulting in poor adaptability and high annotation costs. In this
work, we propose the Preference-Aware Task-Adaptive Reward Model (PaTaRM), a
unified framework that integrates a preference-aware reward (PAR) mechanism
with dynamic rubric adaptation. PaTaRM leverages relative preference
information from pairwise data to construct robust point-wise training signals,
eliminating the need for explicit point-wise labels. Simultaneously, it employs
a task-adaptive rubric system that flexibly generates evaluation criteria for
both global task consistency and instance-specific fine-grained reasoning. This
design enables efficient, generalizable, and interpretable reward modeling for
RLHF. Extensive experiments show that PaTaRM achieves an average relative
improvement of 4.7% on RewardBench and RMBench across Qwen3-8B and Qwen3-14B
models. Furthermore, PaTaRM boosts downstream RLHF performance, with an average
improvement of 13.6% across IFEval and InFoBench benchmarks, confirming its
effectiveness and robustness. Our code is available at

### [312] [Temporal Knowledge Graph Hyperedge Forecasting: Exploring Entity-to-Category Link Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24240)
*Edward Markai,Sina Molavipour*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper extends TLogic, a rule-based framework for temporal knowledge graphs, to achieve explainable predictions and improved accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of transparency and explainability in embedding-based methods used for temporal knowledge graph predictions.

Method: Introduce a new rule format using entity categories and propose a data-driven LLM-based approach for generating categories.

Result: Enhanced prediction accuracy combined with explainability, and investigated aggregation methods for score-based entity category prediction.

Conclusion: The extension of TLogic improves interpretability and performance of temporal knowledge graph predictions while supporting critical evaluation of rule-based outputs.

Abstract: Temporal Knowledge Graphs have emerged as a powerful way of not only modeling
static relationships between entities but also the dynamics of how relations
evolve over time. As these informational structures can be used to store
information from a real-world setting, such as a news flow, predicting future
graph components to a certain extent equates predicting real-world events. Most
of the research in this field focuses on embedding-based methods, often
leveraging convolutional neural net architectures. These solutions act as black
boxes, limiting insight. In this paper, we explore an extension to an
established rule-based framework, TLogic, that yields a high accuracy in
combination with explainable predictions. This offers transparency and allows
the end-user to critically evaluate the rules applied at the end of the
prediction stage. The new rule format incorporates entity category as a key
component with the purpose of limiting rule application only to relevant
entities. When categories are unknown for building the graph, we propose a
data-driven method to generate them with an LLM-based approach. Additionally,
we investigate the choice of aggregation method for scores of retrieved
entities when performing category prediction.

### [313] [SALS: Sparse Attention in Latent Space for KV cache Compression](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24273)
*Junlin Mu,Hantao Huang,Jihang Zhang,Minghui Yu,Tao Wang,Yidong Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes Sparse Attention in Latent Space (SALS), a framework for highly efficient KV cache compression and sparse token selection in LLMs, achieving significant improvements in speed and space efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Inference for extended context Large Language Models is resource-intensive due to large KV cache size and high memory bandwidth demand, driving the need for efficient solutions.

Method: The SALS framework compresses the KV cache into a low-rank latent space, performs sparse token selection without RoPE, and reconstructs only necessary tokens, reducing computational overhead.

Result: SALS achieves state-of-the-art compression and speed improvements, including 6.4x KV cache reduction, 5.7x attention operator speed-up, and substantial end-to-end throughput gains.

Conclusion: SALS offers an effective methodology for optimizing LLM inference, balancing accuracy with compression and speed improvements.

Abstract: Large Language Models capable of handling extended contexts are in high
demand, yet their inference remains challenging due to substantial Key-Value
cache size and high memory bandwidth requirements. Previous research has
demonstrated that KV cache exhibits low-rank characteristics within the hidden
dimension, suggesting the potential for effective compression. However, due to
the widely adopted Rotary Position Embedding mechanism in modern LLMs, naive
low-rank compression suffers severe accuracy degradation or creates a new speed
bottleneck, as the low-rank cache must first be reconstructed in order to apply
RoPE. In this paper, we introduce two key insights: first, the application of
RoPE to the key vectors increases their variance, which in turn results in a
higher rank; second, after the key vectors are transformed into the latent
space, they largely maintain their representation across most layers. Based on
these insights, we propose the Sparse Attention in Latent Space framework. SALS
projects the KV cache into a compact latent space via low-rank projection, and
performs sparse token selection using RoPE-free query-key interactions in this
space. By reconstructing only a small subset of important tokens, it avoids the
overhead of full KV cache reconstruction. We comprehensively evaluate SALS on
various tasks using two large-scale models: LLaMA2-7b-chat and Mistral-7b, and
additionally verify its scalability on the RULER-128k benchmark with
LLaMA3.1-8B-Instruct. Experimental results demonstrate that SALS achieves SOTA
performance by maintaining competitive accuracy. Under different settings, SALS
achieves 6.4-fold KV cache compression and 5.7-fold speed-up in the attention
operator compared to FlashAttention2 on the 4K sequence. For the end-to-end
throughput performance, we achieves 1.4-fold and 4.5-fold improvement compared
to GPT-fast on 4k and 32K sequences, respectively.

*Guus Toussaint,Arno Knobbe*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces EDC, a new Equation Discovery (ED)-based framework for binary classification, capable of deriving interpretable decision boundaries and outperforming state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current Symbolic Regression approaches have been successful in regression tasks but lack effective application in binary classification. This paper aims to address this gap in the domain.

Method: The method involves finding simple analytical functions for decision boundaries using a configurable grammar incorporating linear, quadratic, exponential terms, and feature products for adaptable yet non-overfitting models.

Result: EDC demonstrated superior performance in binary classification tasks compared to state-of-the-art ED methods and comparable overall classification results.

Conclusion: EDC offers an innovative and domain-specific approach for binary classification with interpretable results and adaptable methods for various datasets, highlighting its strengths over existing techniques.

Abstract: Equation Discovery techniques have shown considerable success in regression
tasks, where they are used to discover concise and interpretable models
(\textit{Symbolic Regression}). In this paper, we propose a new ED-based binary
classification framework. Our proposed method EDC finds analytical functions of
manageable size that specify the location and shape of the decision boundary.
In extensive experiments on artificial and real-life data, we demonstrate how
EDC is able to discover both the structure of the target equation as well as
the value of its parameters, outperforming the current state-of-the-art
ED-based classification methods in binary classification and achieving
performance comparable to the state of the art in binary classification. We
suggest a grammar of modest complexity that appears to work well on the tested
datasets but argue that the exact grammar -- and thus the complexity of the
models -- is configurable, and especially domain-specific expressions can be
included in the pattern language, where that is required. The presented grammar
consists of a series of summands (additive terms) that include linear,
quadratic and exponential terms, as well as products of two features (producing
hyperbolic curves ideal for capturing XOR-like dependencies). The experiments
demonstrate that this grammar allows fairly flexible decision boundaries while
not so rich to cause overfitting.

*Prajit Bhaskaran,Tom Viering*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Cluster-PFN, a Transformer-based model for Bayesian clustering that is computationally efficient, robust to missing data, and more accurate in estimating the number of clusters compared to traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Many real-world datasets suffer from missing values and require scalable Bayesian clustering. Current methods either ignore uncertainty associated with missing data or are computationally expensive. There is a need for an efficient and reliable Bayesian clustering method.

Method: Cluster-PFN is a Transformer-based model utilizing Prior-Data Fitted Networks trained on synthetic datasets from a finite Gaussian Mixture Model prior. It estimates posterior distributions over cluster numbers and assignments, supporting flexible priors with missing data.

Result: Cluster-PFN outperforms traditional model selection methods like AIC, BIC, and Variational Inference for estimating cluster numbers. It also provides competitive clustering quality while reducing computation time. Additionally, it achieves superior performance on genomic datasets with high missingness compared to imputation-based methods.

Conclusion: Cluster-PFN is a scalable and flexible Bayesian clustering tool that effectively handles missing data and offers significant improvements over traditional methods in accuracy and computational efficiency.

Abstract: Bayesian clustering accounts for uncertainty but is computationally demanding
at scale. Furthermore, real-world datasets often contain missing values, and
simple imputation ignores the associated uncertainty, resulting in suboptimal
results. We present Cluster-PFN, a Transformer-based model that extends
Prior-Data Fitted Networks (PFNs) to unsupervised Bayesian clustering. Trained
entirely on synthetic datasets generated from a finite Gaussian Mixture Model
(GMM) prior, Cluster-PFN learns to estimate the posterior distribution over
both the number of clusters and the cluster assignments. Our method estimates
the number of clusters more accurately than handcrafted model selection
procedures such as AIC, BIC and Variational Inference (VI), and achieves
clustering quality competitive with VI while being orders of magnitude faster.
Cluster-PFN can be trained on complex priors that include missing data,
outperforming imputation-based baselines on real-world genomic datasets, at
high missingness. These results show that the Cluster-PFN can provide scalable
and flexible Bayesian clustering.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a data-centric method that filters low-quality data during training and rejects low-confidence predictions during inference in ML models, improving reliability in healthcare applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The research is motivated by the need for more reliable predictions in high-stakes domains like healthcare, as ML models often deliver outputs without accounting for prediction uncertainty.

Method: A two-step approach is introduced: (1) Filtering training instances with high Instance Hardness (IH) to improve data quality, and (2) Implementing confidence-based rejection criteria during inference to ensure predictions are dependable.

Result: The evaluation on three real-world healthcare datasets shows improved model reliability, effective balancing of predictive performance and rejection rate, and superior results compared to baselines using influence values and uncertainty criteria.

Conclusion: Integrating data quality filtering and confidence-based rejection improves ML model reliability, making it a practical solution for critical areas like healthcare.

Abstract: Machine Learning (ML) models are widely used in high-stakes domains such as
healthcare, where the reliability of predictions is critical. However, these
models often fail to account for uncertainty, providing predictions even with
low confidence. This work proposes a novel two-step data-centric approach to
enhance the performance of ML models by improving data quality and filtering
low-confidence predictions. The first step involves leveraging Instance
Hardness (IH) to filter problematic instances during training, thereby refining
the dataset. The second step introduces a confidence-based rejection mechanism
during inference, ensuring that only reliable predictions are retained. We
evaluate our approach using three real-world healthcare datasets, demonstrating
its effectiveness at improving model reliability while balancing predictive
performance and rejection rate. Additionally, we use alternative criteria -
influence values for filtering and uncertainty for rejection - as baselines to
evaluate the efficiency of the proposed method. The results demonstrate that
integrating IH filtering with confidence-based rejection effectively enhances
model performance while preserving a large proportion of instances. This
approach provides a practical method for deploying ML systems in
safety-critical applications.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Synthetic data can address privacy and accessibility concerns in smart card data for public transport research, but requires rigorous evaluation. The proposed RPU framework evaluates representativeness, privacy, and utility across multiple dimensions, identifying CTGAN as the most balanced method.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Public transport research faces challenges in utilizing smart card data due to privacy concerns and accessibility issues, prompting the need for reliable synthetic alternatives.

Method: The paper introduces the RPU framework for evaluating synthetic trip data across representativeness, privacy, and utility dimensions at record, group, and population levels, applying metrics for fair assessment.

Result: Evaluation of twelve data generation methods shows clear trade-offs between privacy, representativeness, and utility, with CTGAN demonstrating the most balanced performance.

Conclusion: The RPU framework offers a reproducible approach for assessing synthetic data generation methods and identifying suitable solutions, enhancing public transport research applications.

Abstract: Synthetic data offers a promising solution to the privacy and accessibility
challenges of using smart card data in public transport research. Despite rapid
progress in generative modeling, there is limited attention to comprehensive
evaluation, leaving unclear how reliable, safe, and useful synthetic data truly
are. Existing evaluations remain fragmented, typically limited to
population-level representativeness or record-level privacy, without
considering group-level variations or task-specific utility. To address this
gap, we propose a Representativeness-Privacy-Utility (RPU) framework that
systematically evaluates synthetic trip data across three complementary
dimensions and three hierarchical levels (record, group, population). The
framework integrates a consistent set of metrics to quantify similarity,
disclosure risk, and practical usefulness, enabling transparent and balanced
assessment of synthetic data quality. We apply the framework to benchmark
twelve representative generation methods, spanning conventional statistical
models, deep generative networks, and privacy-enhanced variants. Results show
that synthetic data do not inherently guarantee privacy and there is no
"one-size-fits-all" model, the trade-off between privacy and
representativeness/utility is obvious. Conditional Tabular generative
adversarial network (CTGAN) provide the most balanced trade-off and is
suggested for practical applications. The RPU framework provides a systematic
and reproducible basis for researchers and practitioners to compare synthetic
data generation techniques and select appropriate methods in public transport
applications.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces APEX, a method for efficient virtual screening in large combinatorial synthesis libraries (CSLs), achieving fast and accurate retrieval of top candidates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation behind this paper is to enable effective virtual screening in vast combinatorial synthesis libraries, despite computational constraints, without missing high-scoring candidates.

Method: The proposed method, APEX, uses a neural network surrogate that leverages the structure of CSLs. It performs approximate-but-exhaustive search to retrieve top-k sets efficiently via consumer GPUs.

Result: APEX demonstrates strong performance in accuracy and runtime, as validated on a large benchmark CSL with over 10 million compounds, outperforming alternative virtual screening methods.

Conclusion: APEX provides an efficient and effective approach for virtual screening campaigns, capable of quickly identifying top compounds in large libraries while addressing computational challenges.

Abstract: Make-on-demand combinatorial synthesis libraries (CSLs) like Enamine REAL
have significantly enabled drug discovery efforts. However, their large size
presents a challenge for virtual screening, where the goal is to identify the
top compounds in a library according to a computational objective (e.g.,
optimizing docking score) subject to computational constraints under a limited
computational budget. For current library sizes -- numbering in the tens of
billions of compounds -- and scoring functions of interest, a routine virtual
screening campaign may be limited to scoring fewer than 0.1% of the available
compounds, leaving potentially many high scoring compounds undiscovered.
Furthermore, as constraints (and sometimes objectives) change during the course
of a virtual screening campaign, existing virtual screening algorithms
typically offer little room for amortization. We propose the
approximate-but-exhaustive search protocol for CSLs, or APEX. APEX utilizes a
neural network surrogate that exploits the structure of CSLs in the prediction
of objectives and constraints to make full enumeration on a consumer GPU
possible in under a minute, allowing for exact retrieval of approximate top-$k$
sets. To demonstrate APEX's capabilities, we develop a benchmark CSL comprised
of more than 10 million compounds, all of which have been annotated with their
docking scores on five medically relevant targets along with physicohemical
properties measured with RDKit such that, for any objective and set of
constraints, the ground truth top-$k$ compounds can be identified and compared
against the retrievals from any virtual screening algorithm. We show APEX's
consistently strong performance both in retrieval accuracy and runtime compared

*Seyed Mahdi Basiri Azad,Joschka Boedecker*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Introducing a method to initiate RL agents using a few successful demonstrations in sparse-reward environments, improving efficiency and performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Sparse-reward environments hinder RL agents due to insufficient learning feedback. Efficient initiation strategies are needed.

Method: The proposed approach uses offline demonstration data to precompute value estimates, which inform RL agents during early learning, and combines offline and online RL paradigms.

Result: Tests reveal accelerated convergence and better sample efficiency compared to baselines, even with minimal or suboptimal demonstration data.

Conclusion: Hybridizing offline demonstration initialization with online RL improves sparse-reward learning settings, addressing exploration challenges effectively.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) in sparse-reward environments remains a
significant challenge due to the lack of informative feedback. We propose a
simple yet effective method that uses a small number of successful
demonstrations to initialize the value function of an RL agent. By precomputing
value estimates from offline demonstrations and using them as targets for early
learning, our approach provides the agent with a useful prior over promising
actions. The agent then refines these estimates through standard online
interaction. This hybrid offline-to-online paradigm significantly reduces the
exploration burden and improves sample efficiency in sparse-reward settings.
Experiments on benchmark tasks demonstrate that our method accelerates
convergence and outperforms standard baselines, even with minimal or suboptimal
demonstration data.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the survival of colorectal cancer patients is critical for decision-making, driving the need for robust machine learning models capable of handling censored data.

Method: The study compared six machine learning models (RSF, GBSA, SSVM, XGB-Cox, XGB-AFT, LGBM) using extensive evaluation metrics (C-Index, AUC, IBS) and applied SHAP and permutation importance for interpretation.

Result: XGB-AFT model achieved the highest prediction performance with C-Index = 0.7618 and IPCW = 0.7532, outperforming other models.

Conclusion: The paper demonstrates that machine learning models, especially XGB-AFT, can advance survival predictions and support medical decisions effectively.

Abstract: This study presents a comparative methodological analysis of six machine
learning models for survival analysis (MLSA). Using data from nearly 45,000
colorectal cancer patients in the Hospital-Based Cancer Registries of S\~ao
Paulo, we evaluated Random Survival Forest (RSF), Gradient Boosting for
Survival Analysis (GBSA), Survival SVM (SSVM), XGBoost-Cox (XGB-Cox),
XGBoost-AFT (XGB-AFT), and LightGBM (LGBM), capable of predicting survival
considering censored data. Hyperparameter optimization was performed with
different samplers, and model performance was assessed using the Concordance
Index (C-Index), C-Index IPCW, time-dependent AUC, and Integrated Brier Score
(IBS). Survival curves produced by the models were compared with predictions
from classification algorithms, and predictor interpretation was conducted
using SHAP and permutation importance. XGB-AFT achieved the best performance
(C-Index = 0.7618; IPCW = 0.7532), followed by GBSA and RSF. The results
highlight the potential and applicability of MLSA to improve survival
prediction and support decision making.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance the quality and reproducibility of sepsis research by addressing outdated datasets, non-transparent preprocessing, and limited clinical intervention coverage.

Method: A curated dataset derived from the MIMIC-IV database with transparent preprocessing using Sepsis-3 criteria, structured imputation, and standardized clinical variables for benchmark tasks.

Result: Empirical findings show that incorporating treatment variables significantly boosts performance, especially in Transformer-based models for ICU research tasks.

Conclusion: MIMIC-Sepsis offers a reproducible and comprehensive platform for evaluating predictive models in critical care, particularly for sepsis-related challenges.

Abstract: Sepsis is a leading cause of mortality in intensive care units (ICUs), yet
existing research often relies on outdated datasets, non-reproducible
preprocessing pipelines, and limited coverage of clinical interventions. We
introduce MIMIC-Sepsis, a curated cohort and benchmark framework derived from
the MIMIC-IV database, designed to support reproducible modeling of sepsis
trajectories. Our cohort includes 35,239 ICU patients with time-aligned
clinical variables and standardized treatment data, including vasopressors,
fluids, mechanical ventilation and antibiotics. We describe a transparent
preprocessing pipeline-based on Sepsis-3 criteria, structured imputation
strategies, and treatment inclusion-and release it alongside benchmark tasks
focused on early mortality prediction, length-of-stay estimation, and shock
onset classification. Empirical results demonstrate that incorporating
treatment variables substantially improves model performance, particularly for
Transformer-based architectures. MIMIC-Sepsis serves as a robust platform for
evaluating predictive and sequential models in critical care research.

*Qingyue Zhang,Chang Chu,Tianren Peng,Qi Li,Xiangyang Luo,Zhihao Jiang,Shao-Lun Huang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes the LoRA-DA algorithm, a new method for data-aware LoRA initialization that improves adaptation for large language models using a theoretical optimization framework.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LoRA initialization methods exhibit limitations such as shallow target-domain data utilization and lack of rigorous theoretical foundation. The paper aims to address these issues and improve performance.

Method: The authors derive a theoretical optimization framework, utilizing Fisher-gradient formulation for bias approximation and Fisher information for variance consideration. They then develop the LoRA-DA algorithm which uses target-domain samples to achieve optimal initialization.

Result: Empirical evaluations show improved accuracy, faster and more stable convergence, robustness across ranks, and minimal initialization overhead for LoRA-DA compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: LoRA-DA outperforms existing initialization strategies, enhancing adaptation for large language models efficiently and robustly, and its code will be made available for further verification and use.

Abstract: With the widespread adoption of LLMs, LoRA has become a dominant method for
PEFT, and its initialization methods have attracted increasing attention.
However, existing methods have notable limitations: many methods do not
incorporate target-domain data, while gradient-based methods exploit data only
at a shallow level by relying on one-step gradient decomposition, which remains
unsatisfactory due to the weak empirical performance of the one-step
fine-tuning model that serves as their basis, as well as the fact that these
methods either lack a rigorous theoretical foundation or depend heavily on
restrictive isotropic assumptions. In this paper, we establish a theoretical
framework for data-aware LoRA initialization based on asymptotic analysis.
Starting from a general optimization objective that minimizes the expectation
of the parameter discrepancy between the fine-tuned and target models, we
derive an optimization problem with two components: a bias term, which is
related to the parameter distance between the fine-tuned and target models, and
is approximated using a Fisher-gradient formulation to preserve anisotropy; and
a variance term, which accounts for the uncertainty introduced by sampling
stochasticity through the Fisher information. By solving this problem, we
obtain an optimal initialization strategy for LoRA. Building on this
theoretical framework, we develop an efficient algorithm, LoRA-DA, which
estimates the terms in the optimization problem from a small set of target
domain samples and obtains the optimal LoRA initialization. Empirical results
across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that LoRA-DA consistently improves final
accuracy over existing initialization methods. Additional studies show faster,
more stable convergence, robustness across ranks, and only a small
initialization overhead for LoRA-DA. The source code will be released upon
publication.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper presents DistDF, a method to improve time-series forecast models by minimizing discrepancies between forecast and label distributions, using a novel Wasserstein discrepancy. Extensive experiments verify its efficacy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional direct forecast approaches face biases when labels are autocorrelated, impacting model accuracy.

Method: The proposed DistDF optimizes a novel joint-distribution Wasserstein discrepancy to align conditional forecasts and label distributions. This discrepancy is tractably estimated using empirical samples during training.

Result: DistDF enhances performance across various forecast models and achieves state-of-the-art results in time-series forecasting.

Conclusion: DistDF offers a robust and scalable solution for accurate time-series forecasting by alleviating biases using joint-distribution discrepancy minimization.

Abstract: Training time-series forecast models requires aligning the conditional
distribution of model forecasts with that of the label sequence. The standard
direct forecast (DF) approach resorts to minimize the conditional negative
log-likelihood of the label sequence, typically estimated using the mean
squared error. However, this estimation proves to be biased in the presence of
label autocorrelation. In this paper, we propose DistDF, which achieves
alignment by alternatively minimizing a discrepancy between the conditional
forecast and label distributions. Because conditional discrepancies are
difficult to estimate from finite time-series observations, we introduce a
newly proposed joint-distribution Wasserstein discrepancy for time-series
forecasting, which provably upper bounds the conditional discrepancy of
interest. This discrepancy admits tractable, differentiable estimation from
empirical samples and integrates seamlessly with gradient-based training.
Extensive experiments show that DistDF improves the performance diverse
forecast models and achieves the state-of-the-art forecasting performance. Code

Method: The model combines a hybrid quantum neural network with classical deep learning layers, includes an evaluator with LIME-based interpretability, and extends through quantum GAN and self-supervised learning techniques.

Result: Empirical evaluations show that the Vanilla model achieves competitive regression metrics, such as RMSE = 0.27, MSE = 0.071, MAE = 0.21, and R^2 = 0.59, demonstrating consistent regression performance.

Conclusion: Integrating quantum-inspired techniques with classical architectures can create interpretable, high-performing predictive models and expand the scope of quantum machine learning.

Abstract: Current quantum machine learning approaches often face challenges balancing
predictive accuracy, robustness, and interpretability. To address this, we
propose a novel quantum adversarial framework that integrates a hybrid quantum
neural network (QNN) with classical deep learning layers, guided by an
evaluator model with LIME-based interpretability, and extended through quantum
GAN and self-supervised variants. In the proposed model, an adversarial
evaluator concurrently guides the QNN by computing feedback loss, thereby
optimizing both prediction accuracy and model explainability. Empirical
evaluations show that the Vanilla model achieves RMSE = 0.27, MSE = 0.071, MAE
= 0.21, and R^2 = 0.59, delivering the most consistent performance across
regression metrics compared to adversarial counterparts. These results
demonstrate the potential of combining quantum-inspired methods with classical
architectures to develop lightweight, high-performance, and interpretable
predictive models, advancing the applicability of QML beyond current

*James Josep Perry,Pablo Garcia-Conde Ortiz,George Konstantinou,Cornelie Vergouwen,Edlyn Santha Kumaran,Morteza Moradi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The study introduces a data-driven framework for health indicator extraction in aerospace composites, leveraging semi-supervised and unsupervised learning methods to address challenges in damage variability and detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Extracting reliable health indicators for diagnosing aerospace composite structures is challenging due to material variability, stochastic damage evolution, and diverse damage modes.

Method: Two learning approaches (semi-supervised Diversity-DeepSAD and unsupervised DTC-VAE) combined with multi-domain signal processing are proposed to extract health indicators, alongside guided waves monitored with time-frequency representations.

Result: The Diversity-DeepSAD approach achieved an 81.6% performance, while the DTC-VAE model outperformed with consistent health indicators and a 92.3% performance.

Conclusion: The novel framework offers consistent and efficient health indicator extraction, demonstrating superior performance compared to existing methods.

Abstract: Health indicators (HIs) are central to diagnosing and prognosing the
condition of aerospace composite structures, enabling efficient maintenance and
operational safety. However, extracting reliable HIs remains challenging due to
variability in material properties, stochastic damage evolution, and diverse
damage modes. Manufacturing defects (e.g., disbonds) and in-service incidents
(e.g., bird strikes) further complicate this process. This study presents a
comprehensive data-driven framework that learns HIs via two learning approaches
integrated with multi-domain signal processing. Because ground-truth HIs are
unavailable, a semi-supervised and an unsupervised approach are proposed: (i) a
diversity deep semi-supervised anomaly detection (Diversity-DeepSAD) approach
augmented with continuous auxiliary labels used as hypothetical damage proxies,
which overcomes the limitation of prior binary labels that only distinguish
healthy and failed states while neglecting intermediate degradation, and (ii) a
degradation-trend-constrained variational autoencoder (DTC-VAE), in which the
monotonicity criterion is embedded via an explicit trend constraint. Guided
waves with multiple excitation frequencies are used to monitor single-stiffener
composite structures under fatigue loading. Time, frequency, and time-frequency
representations are explored, and per-frequency HIs are fused via unsupervised
ensemble learning to mitigate frequency dependence and reduce variance. Using
fast Fourier transform features, the augmented Diversity-DeepSAD model achieved
81.6% performance, while DTC-VAE delivered the most consistent HIs with 92.3%
performance, outperforming existing baselines.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the inefficiency and limitations of traditional ILP algorithms that require multiple training runs for ensemble learning and often result in higher computational costs.

Method: The authors propose training an ILP algorithm only once, saving intermediate hypotheses during this training, and then combining these hypotheses using a minimum description length weighting scheme to create an ensemble model.

Result: The approach achieves a 4% improvement in predictive accuracy across benchmarks, including game playing and visual reasoning tasks, with less than 1% additional computational overhead.

Conclusion: The proposed method demonstrates that combining intermediate hypotheses from a single ILP training run is an efficient way to improve predictive accuracy while maintaining low computational overhead.

Abstract: Inductive logic programming (ILP) is a form of logical machine learning. Most
ILP algorithms learn a single hypothesis from a single training run. Ensemble
methods train an ILP algorithm multiple times to learn multiple hypotheses. In
this paper, we train an ILP algorithm only once and save intermediate
hypotheses. We then combine the hypotheses using a minimum description length
weighting scheme. Our experiments on multiple benchmarks, including game
playing and visual reasoning, show that our approach improves predictive
accuracy by 4% with less than 1% computational overhead.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DOTS (Diffusion Ordered Temporal Structure) is proposed to enhance causal discovery from time series by using multiple causal orderings. It surpasses state-of-the-art baselines in accuracy and scalability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve causal discovery in time series, which is challenging due to combinatorial complexity as the number of variables and time points increases.

Method: DOTS integrates multiple causal orderings with diffusion-based causal discovery for temporal data, solving the limitations of single-ordering methods.

Result: DOTS improves causal discovery performance on synthetic datasets, achieving a mean window-graph F1 of 0.81 and demonstrates competitive average summary-graph F1 on real-world benchmarks while halving runtime.

Conclusion: DOTS represents a robust, scalable, and accurate solution for temporal causal discovery in complex datasets compared to existing methods.

Abstract: Predicting causal structure from time series data is crucial for
understanding complex phenomena in physiology, brain connectivity, climate
dynamics, and socio-economic behaviour. Causal discovery in time series is
hindered by the combinatorial complexity of identifying true causal
relationships, especially as the number of variables and time points grow. A
common approach to simplify the task is the so-called ordering-based methods.
Traditional ordering methods inherently limit the representational capacity of
the resulting model. In this work, we fix this issue by leveraging multiple
valid causal orderings, instead of a single one as standard practice. We
propose DOTS (Diffusion Ordered Temporal Structure), using diffusion-based
causal discovery for temporal data. By integrating multiple orderings, DOTS
effectively recovers the transitive closure of the underlying directed acyclic
graph, mitigating spurious artifacts inherent in single-ordering approaches. We
formalise the problem under standard assumptions such as stationarity and the
additive noise model, and leverage score matching with diffusion processes to
enable efficient Hessian estimation. Extensive experiments validate the
approach. Empirical evaluations on synthetic and real-world datasets
demonstrate that DOTS outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, offering a
scalable and robust approach to temporal causal discovery. On synthetic
benchmarks ($d{=}\!3-\!6$ variables, $T{=}200\!-\!5{,}000$ samples), DOTS
improves mean window-graph $F1$ from $0.63$ (best baseline) to $0.81$. On the
CausalTime real-world benchmark ($d{=}20\!-\!36$), while baselines remain the
best on individual datasets, DOTS attains the highest average summary-graph
$F1$ while halving runtime relative to graph-optimisation methods. These
results establish DOTS as a scalable and accurate solution for temporal causal
discovery.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper analyzes how many parameters ReLU networks require to robustly memorize data with specific separation and robustness criteria.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the parameter complexity required for robust memorization in ReLU networks, bridging the gap in fine-grained analysis across various robustness scenarios.

Method: Conducted theoretical analysis to derive upper and lower bounds on parameter counts needed for robust memorization, focusing on a range of robustness ratios (ρ).

Result: Established tighter bounds on parameter requirements for robust memorization, showing complexity depends on the robustness ratio ρ.

Conclusion: Robust memorization's parameter complexity matches non-robust cases when robustness is low but increases with higher robustness requirements.

Abstract: We study the parameter complexity of robust memorization for $\mathrm{ReLU}$
networks: the number of parameters required to interpolate any given dataset
with $\epsilon$-separation between differently labeled points, while ensuring
predictions remain consistent within a $\mu$-ball around each training sample.
We establish upper and lower bounds on the parameter count as a function of the
robustness ratio $\rho = \mu / \epsilon$. Unlike prior work, we provide a
fine-grained analysis across the entire range $\rho \in (0,1)$ and obtain
tighter upper and lower bounds that improve upon existing results. Our findings
reveal that the parameter complexity of robust memorization matches that of
non-robust memorization when $\rho$ is small, but grows with increasing $\rho$.

TL;DR: Pearl is a new model for predicting protein-ligand 3D structures, improving accuracy and efficiency using innovative training techniques and architecture.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate prediction of protein-ligand 3D structures is vital for drug discovery, yet limited by data scarcity and architectural constraints.

Method: Pearl uses synthetic data for training, SO(3)-equivariant diffusion modules in architecture, and flexible inference modes.

Result: Pearl outperforms AlphaFold 3 and other models in accuracy benchmarks, with significant improvements in cofolding and pose generation.

Conclusion: Pearl represents a breakthrough in structural prediction by exploiting data, architecture, and inference innovations to enhance drug discovery potential.

Abstract: Accurately predicting the three-dimensional structures of protein-ligand
complexes remains a fundamental challenge in computational drug discovery that
limits the pace and success of therapeutic design. Deep learning methods have
recently shown strong potential as structural prediction tools, achieving
promising accuracy across diverse biomolecular systems. However, their
performance and utility are constrained by scarce experimental data,
inefficient architectures, physically invalid poses, and the limited ability to
exploit auxiliary information available at inference. To address these issues,
we introduce Pearl (Placing Every Atom in the Right Location), a foundation
model for protein-ligand cofolding at scale. Pearl addresses these challenges
with three key innovations: (1) training recipes that include large-scale
synthetic data to overcome data scarcity; (2) architectures that incorporate an
SO(3)-equivariant diffusion module to inherently respect 3D rotational
symmetries, improving generalization and sample efficiency, and (3)
controllable inference, including a generalized multi-chain templating system
supporting both protein and non-polymeric components as well as dual
unconditional/conditional modes. Pearl establishes a new state-of-the-art
performance in protein-ligand cofolding. On the key metric of generating
accurate (RMSD < 2 \r{A}) and physically valid poses, Pearl surpasses AlphaFold
3 and other open source baselines on the public Runs N' Poses and PoseBusters
benchmarks, delivering 14.5% and 14.2% improvements, respectively, over the
next best model. In the pocket-conditional cofolding regime, Pearl delivers
$3.6\times$ improvement on a proprietary set of challenging, real-world drug
targets at the more rigorous RMSD < 1 \r{A} threshold. Finally, we demonstrate
that model performance correlates directly with synthetic dataset size used in
training.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper uses the options framework in reinforcement learning to improve autonomous driving on highways by introducing hierarchical control strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Few autonomous driving studies use the options framework, even though it is well-suited for hierarchical control tasks like driving.

Method: Dedicated options for longitudinal and lateral control maneuvers are defined, embedding safety and comfort constraints, creating hierarchical policies for more human-like and interpretable behavior.

Result: Policies leveraging hybrid options outperform baseline policies in expressing flexibility and handling traffic variations.

Conclusion: The options framework enhances autonomous driving by enabling interpretable, flexible, and high-performing policies suitable for varying conditions through hierarchical control.

Abstract: Out of the many deep reinforcement learning approaches for autonomous
driving, only few make use of the options (or skills) framework. That is
surprising, as this framework is naturally suited for hierarchical control
applications in general, and autonomous driving tasks in specific. Therefore,
in this work the options framework is applied and tailored to autonomous
driving tasks on highways. More specifically, we define dedicated options for
longitudinal and lateral manoeuvres with embedded safety and comfort
constraints. This way, prior domain knowledge can be incorporated into the
learning process and the learned driving behaviour can be constrained more
easily. We propose several setups for hierarchical control with options and
derive practical algorithms following state-of-the-art reinforcement learning
techniques. By separately selecting actions for longitudinal and lateral
control, the introduced policies over combined and hybrid options obtain the
same expressiveness and flexibility that human drivers have, while being easier
to interpret than classical policies over continuous actions. Of all the
investigated approaches, these flexible policies over hybrid options perform
the best under varying traffic conditions, outperforming the baseline policies
over actions.

*Peilin He,Tananun Songdechakraiwut*

Main category: cs.NE

TL;DR: This paper introduces CG-ALR, a connectomics-inspired mechanism that dynamically adjusts learning rates based on the functional organization of neural networks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding how the human brain adapts during learning and cognition inspires improved adaptive mechanisms for artificial neural networks.

Method: CG-ALR dynamically constructs a functional connectome of neural networks via neuron co-activations and adjusts learning rates based on reconfiguration stability.

Result: The framework generally outperforms traditional SGD-based schedules and recent adaptive learning methods.

Conclusion: Brain-inspired principles can enhance adaptive learning rates in deep learning networks, improving training efficiency and outcomes.

Abstract: The human brain is highly adaptive: its functional connectivity reconfigures
on multiple timescales during cognition and learning, enabling flexible
information processing. By contrast, artificial neural networks typically rely
on manually-tuned learning-rate schedules or generic adaptive optimizers whose
hyperparameters remain largely agnostic to a model's internal dynamics. In this
paper, we propose Connectome-Guided Automatic Learning Rate (CG-ALR) that
dynamically constructs a functional connectome of the neural network from
neuron co-activations at each training iteration and adjusts learning rates
online as this connectome reconfigures. This connectomics-inspired mechanism
adapts step sizes to the network's dynamic functional organization, slowing
learning during unstable reconfiguration and accelerating it when stable
organization emerges. Our results demonstrate that principles inspired by brain
connectomes can inform the design of adaptive learning rates in deep learning,
generally outperforming traditional SGD-based schedules and recent methods.

Main category: cs.NE

TL;DR: The paper presents a novel multi-level spiking neuron model and introduces a new Sparse-ResNet architecture, achieving higher accuracy and efficiency in spiking neural networks (SNNs).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the significant information loss and accuracy degradation in Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) caused by the binary nature of spikes, while leveraging their low-power potential and sparse operations.

Method: The authors propose a multi-level spiking neuron model for improved quantization and efficiency, and design a new residual architecture called Sparse-ResNet to mitigate the spike avalanche effect in spiking models.

Result: The multi-level spiking neurons reduce energy consumption by 2-3x compared to binary SNNs and minimize latencies, achieving a compression factor of 10 in latency reduction on neuromorphic data. Sparse-ResNet demonstrates over 20% reduction in network activity while maintaining state-of-the-art classification accuracy.

Conclusion: The proposed approaches—multi-level spiking neurons and Sparse-ResNet—enhance SNN efficiency and performance. They lead to lower power consumption, reduced inference latency, and improved accuracy, providing significant advancements for neuromorphic architectures.

Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) are one of the most promising bio-inspired
neural networks models and have drawn increasing attention in recent years. The
event-driven communication mechanism of SNNs allows for sparse and
theoretically low-power operations on dedicated neuromorphic hardware. However,
the binary nature of instantaneous spikes also leads to considerable
information loss in SNNs, resulting in accuracy degradation. To address this
issue, we propose a multi-level spiking neuron model able to provide both
low-quantization error and minimal inference latency while approaching the
performance of full precision Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs). Experimental
results with popular network architectures and datasets, show that multi-level
spiking neurons provide better information compression, allowing therefore a
reduction in latency without performance loss. When compared to binary SNNs on
image classification scenarios, multi-level SNNs indeed allow reducing by 2 to
3 times the energy consumption depending on the number of quantization
intervals. On neuromorphic data, our approach allows us to drastically reduce
the inference latency to 1 timestep, which corresponds to a compression factor
of 10 compared to previously published results. At the architectural level, we
propose a new residual architecture that we call Sparse-ResNet. Through a
careful analysis of the spikes propagation in residual connections we highlight
a spike avalanche effect, that affects most spiking residual architectures.
Using our Sparse-ResNet architecture, we can provide state-of-the-art accuracy
results in image classification while reducing by more than 20% the network
activity compared to the previous spiking ResNets.

### [334] [Improved Accuracy of Robot Localization Using 3-D LiDAR in a Hippocampus-Inspired Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24029)
*Andrew Gerstenslager,Bekarys Dukenbaev,Ali A. Minai*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper proposes a 3D extension to Boundary Vector Cell (BVC) models, enabling enhanced spatial localization and navigation in three-dimensional environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing BVC models are limited to 2D environments, leading to spatial ambiguities in scenarios with horizontal symmetries. Improved models for robust navigation in 3D spaces are required.

Method: The researchers extended the BVC framework to include vertical angular sensitivity and processed LiDAR data for capturing vertical contours. This enhancement disambiguates locations indistinct in 2D models.

Result: The 3D BVC model performs comparably to 2D models in environments with low vertical variation but demonstrates superior accuracy in complex 3D environments, reducing spatial aliasing and offering more distinct place fields.

Conclusion: Incorporating vertical dimensions into BVC frameworks improves navigation and mapping in 3D environments while maintaining performance in simpler scenarios.

Abstract: Boundary Vector Cells (BVCs) are a class of neurons in the brains of
vertebrates that encode environmental boundaries at specific distances and
allocentric directions, playing a central role in forming place fields in the
hippocampus. Most computational BVC models are restricted to two-dimensional
(2D) environments, making them prone to spatial ambiguities in the presence of
horizontal symmetries in the environment. To address this limitation, we
incorporate vertical angular sensitivity into the BVC framework, thereby
enabling robust boundary detection in three dimensions, and leading to
significantly more accurate spatial localization in a biologically-inspired
robot model.
  The proposed model processes LiDAR data to capture vertical contours, thereby
disambiguating locations that would be indistinguishable under a purely 2D
representation. Experimental results show that in environments with minimal
vertical variation, the proposed 3D model matches the performance of a 2D
baseline; yet, as 3D complexity increases, it yields substantially more
distinct place fields and markedly reduces spatial aliasing. These findings
show that adding a vertical dimension to BVC-based localization can
significantly enhance navigation and mapping in real-world 3D spaces while
retaining performance parity in simpler, near-planar scenarios.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: RoboOmni introduces cross-modal contextual instructions to enable robots to infer human intentions proactively, fusing auditory and visual cues for robotic manipulation tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to improve robotic manipulation by addressing the gap where robots often require explicit instructions, which contrasts with real-world human interactions where intent is inferred indirectly.

Method: The RoboOmni framework combines intention recognition, interaction confirmation, and action execution using end-to-end omni-modal large language models. It utilizes audiovisual signals and direct speech interaction. A new dataset, OmniAction, is also developed for training.

Result: RoboOmni demonstrates superior performance compared to text- and ASR-based models in areas like success rate, inference speed, intention recognition, and proactive assistance, in both simulated and real-world environments.

Conclusion: RoboOmni, with its cross-modal approach and new dataset, paves the way for more intuitive robotic collaboration with humans by enabling proactive intention inference from contextual cues.

Abstract: Recent advances in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have driven rapid
progress in Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models for robotic manipulation.
Although effective in many scenarios, current approaches largely rely on
explicit instructions, whereas in real-world interactions, humans rarely issue
instructions directly. Effective collaboration requires robots to infer user
intentions proactively. In this work, we introduce cross-modal contextual
instructions, a new setting where intent is derived from spoken dialogue,
environmental sounds, and visual cues rather than explicit commands. To address
this new setting, we present RoboOmni, a Perceiver-Thinker-Talker-Executor
framework based on end-to-end omni-modal LLMs that unifies intention
recognition, interaction confirmation, and action execution. RoboOmni fuses
auditory and visual signals spatiotemporally for robust intention recognition,
while supporting direct speech interaction. To address the absence of training
data for proactive intention recognition in robotic manipulation, we build
OmniAction, comprising 140k episodes, 5k+ speakers, 2.4k event sounds, 640
backgrounds, and six contextual instruction types. Experiments in simulation
and real-world settings show that RoboOmni surpasses text- and ASR-based
baselines in success rate, inference speed, intention recognition, and
proactive assistance.

### [336] [Motivating Students' Self-study with Goal Reminder and Emotional Support](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23860)
*Hyung Chan Cho,Go-Eum Cha,Yanfu Liu,Sooyeon Jeong*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper investigates how social robots can assist college students during self-study tasks, emphasizing goal reminders and emotional support.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the potential of social robots as peer companions for college students during self-study tasks, addressing an underexplored area of their use.

Method: Conducted an exploratory Wizard-of-Oz study comparing robot behaviors providing goal-oriented reminders or emotional support versus a control group with physical presence only.

Result: Participants receiving goal reminders and emotional support reported greater satisfaction, ease of use, and higher willingness to use the robot, with goal-oriented reminders correlating with improved task achievement.

Conclusion: Socially assistive robots hold promise in enhancing students' self-study experiences through both functional and emotional interventions.

Abstract: While the efficacy of social robots in supporting people in learning tasks
has been extensively investigated, their potential impact in assisting students
in self-studying contexts has not been investigated much. This study explores
how a social robot can act as a peer study companion for college students
during self-study tasks by delivering task-oriented goal reminder and positive
emotional support. We conducted an exploratory Wizard-of-Oz study to explore
how these robotic support behaviors impacted students' perceived focus,
productivity, and engagement in comparison to a robot that only provided
physical presence (control). Our study results suggest that participants in the
goal reminder and the emotional support conditions reported greater ease of
use, with the goal reminder condition additionally showing a higher willingness
to use the robot in future study sessions. Participants' satisfaction with the
robot was correlated with their perception of the robot as a social other, and
this perception was found to be a predictor for their level of goal achievement
in the self-study task. These findings highlight the potential of socially
assistive robots to support self-study through both functional and emotional
engagement.

*Jans Solano,Diego Quiroz*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper proposes a cost-effective recovery-aware visual-inertial navigation system for wheeled quadrupeds, combining vision-based perception and reinforcement learning to achieve robust locomotion, fall recovery, and navigation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges of costly systems and lack of integrated recovery in wheeled-legged robots, offering a more affordable and capable robotic platform for diverse terrains.

Method: The system integrates vision-based perception using a depth camera and deep reinforcement learning, enabling agile mobility, terrain handling, and autonomous recovery from falls on a low-cost wheeled quadruped.

Result: Simulated tests demonstrate efficient locomotion with low-torque actuators, reliable fall-recovery capabilities, and goal-oriented navigation in indoor environments using affordable sensors.

Conclusion: This innovative approach makes autonomous navigation and robust locomotion feasible for budget-constrained robotic systems, combining cost-effectiveness with high performance.

Abstract: Wheeled-legged robots combine the efficiency of wheels with the obstacle
negotiation of legs, yet many state-of-the-art systems rely on costly actuators
and sensors, and fall-recovery is seldom integrated, especially for
wheeled-legged morphologies. This work presents a recovery-aware
visual-inertial navigation system on a low-cost wheeled quadruped. The proposed
system leverages vision-based perception from a depth camera and deep
reinforcement learning policies for robust locomotion and autonomous recovery
from falls across diverse terrains. Simulation experiments show agile mobility
with low-torque actuators over irregular terrain and reliably recover from
external perturbations and self-induced failures. We further show goal directed
navigation in structured indoor spaces with low-cost perception. Overall, this
approach lowers the barrier to deploying autonomous navigation and robust
locomotion policies in budget-constrained robotic platforms.

### [338] [Adaptive Keyframe Selection for Scalable 3D Scene Reconstruction in Dynamic Environments](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23928)
*Raman Jha,Yang Zhou,Giuseppe Loianno*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces a new adaptive keyframe selection method for better 3D scene reconstruction in dynamic environments, improving quality and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations in real-time 3D reconstruction quality due to static keyframe selection strategies in dynamic scenes.

Method: It combines an error-based module (using photometric and SSIM errors) and a momentum-based module to adjust selection thresholds according to scene dynamics.

Result: Tests on two state-of-the-art networks, Spann3r and CUT3R, show consistent improvements in 3D reconstruction quality. Ablation studies validate the contributions of individual components.

Conclusion: This approach enhances adaptive perception and supports scalable robot learning in complex and changing environments, moving beyond static methods.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose an adaptive keyframe selection method for improved
3D scene reconstruction in dynamic environments. The proposed method integrates
two complementary modules: an error-based selection module utilizing
photometric and structural similarity (SSIM) errors, and a momentum-based
update module that dynamically adjusts keyframe selection thresholds according
to scene motion dynamics. By dynamically curating the most informative frames,
our approach addresses a key data bottleneck in real-time perception. This
allows for the creation of high-quality 3D world representations from a
compressed data stream, a critical step towards scalable robot learning and
deployment in complex, dynamic environments. Experimental results demonstrate
significant improvements over traditional static keyframe selection strategies,
such as fixed temporal intervals or uniform frame skipping. These findings
highlight a meaningful advancement toward adaptive perception systems that can
dynamically respond to complex and evolving visual scenes. We evaluate our
proposed adaptive keyframe selection module on two recent state-of-the-art 3D
reconstruction networks, Spann3r and CUT3R, and observe consistent improvements
in reconstruction quality across both frameworks. Furthermore, an extensive
ablation study confirms the effectiveness of each individual component in our
method, underlining their contribution to the overall performance gains.

### [339] [A Comprehensive General Model of Tendon-Actuated Concentric Tube Robots with Multiple Tubes and Tendons](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23954)
*Pejman Kheradmand,Behnam Moradkhani,Raghavasimhan Sankaranarayanan,Kent K. Yamamoto,Tanner J. Zachem,Patrick J. Codd,Yash Chitalia,Pierre E. Dupont*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper presents a Cosserat rod-based model for tendon-actuated concentric tube robots, enabling accurate shape prediction with exceptional versatility across configurations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Tendon-actuated concentric tube mechanisms aim to address the limitations of tendon-driven continuum robots and concentric tube robots, including restricted degrees of freedom and snapping instability.

Method: The authors propose a Cosserat rod-based mechanical model that accounts for twisting, elongation, and centerline bending across n concentric tubes, each actuated independently by tendons.

Result: Experimental validation demonstrates tip prediction errors below 4% of total length for assemblies, with a general applicability to existing robots where deviations remain around 5%.

Conclusion: The proposed framework lays the foundation for precise shape estimation and control of advanced tendon-actuated concentric tube robots.

Abstract: Tendon-actuated concentric tube mechanisms combine the advantages of
tendon-driven continuum robots and concentric tube robots while addressing
their respective limitations. They overcome the restricted degrees of freedom
often seen in tendon-driven designs, and mitigate issues such as snapping
instability associated with concentric tube robots. However, a complete and
general mechanical model for these systems remains an open problem. In this
work, we propose a Cosserat rod-based framework for modeling the general case
of $n$ concentric tubes, each actuated by $m_i$ tendons, where $i = \{1,
\ldots, n\}$. The model allows each tube to twist and elongate while enforcing
a shared centerline for bending. We validate the proposed framework through
experiments with two-tube and three tube assemblies under various tendon
routing configurations, achieving tip prediction errors $<4\%$ of the robot's
total length. We further demonstrate the model's generality by applying it to
existing robots in the field, where maximum tip deviations remain around $5\%$
of the total length. This model provides a foundation for accurate shape
estimation and control of advanced tendon-actuated concentric tube robots.

### [340] [Adaptive-twist Soft Finger Mechanism for Grasping by Wrapping](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23963)
*Hiroki Ishikawa,Kyosuke Ishibashi,Ko Yamamoto*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces a soft robotic finger capable of adaptive-twist deformation to grasp objects tightly through wrapping, enabled by a variable stiffness mechanism controlled by a single actuator.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to enable soft robotic fingers to access tightly packed objects in confined spaces and grasp them effectively by combining adaptive-twist deformation and force control.

Method: The method involves proposing a variable stiffness mechanism that adjusts stiffness with changing pressure, performing finite element analysis for design optimization, and testing the finger experimentally on various objects.

Result: The results include successful finite element analysis leading to an optimized design and demonstration of effective grasping with the developed soft finger in various scenarios.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates the feasibility and advantages of an adaptive-twist deformation-enabled soft robotic finger for intricate grasping tasks, showcasing its potential application in densely packed environments.

Abstract: This paper presents a soft robot finger capable of adaptive-twist deformation
to grasp objects by wrapping them. For a soft hand to grasp and pick-up one
object from densely contained multiple objects, a soft finger requires the
adaptive-twist deformation function in both in-plane and out-of-plane
directions. The function allows the finger to be inserted deeply into a limited
gap among objects. Once inserted, the soft finger requires appropriate control
of grasping force normal to contact surface, thereby maintaining the twisted
deformation. In this paper, we refer to this type of grasping as grasping by
wrapping. To achieve these two functions by a single actuation source, we
propose a variable stiffness mechanism that can adaptively change the stiffness
as the pressure is higher. We conduct a finite element analysis (FEA) on the
proposed mechanism and determine its design parameter based on the FEA result.
Using the developed soft finger, we report basic experimental results and
demonstrations on grasping various objects.

Result: The survey summarizes approaches and offers insights into datasets and evaluation metrics for SLAM, providing an organized view of challenges and solutions.

Conclusion: Future research areas are identified, such as lifelong mapping, semantic association, robustness enhancement through multi-modal techniques, and addressing the Sim2Real gap.

Abstract: This survey comprehensively reviews the evolving field of multi-robot
collaborative Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) using 3D Gaussian
Splatting (3DGS). As an explicit scene representation, 3DGS has enabled
unprecedented real-time, high-fidelity rendering, ideal for robotics. However,
its use in multi-robot systems introduces significant challenges in maintaining
global consistency, managing communication, and fusing data from heterogeneous
sources. We systematically categorize approaches by their architecture --
centralized, distributed -- and analyze core components like multi-agent
consistency and alignment, communication-efficient, Gaussian representation,
semantic distillation, fusion and pose optimization, and real-time scalability.
In addition, a summary of critical datasets and evaluation metrics is provided
to contextualize performance. Finally, we identify key open challenges and
chart future research directions, including lifelong mapping, semantic
association and mapping, multi-model for robustness, and bridging the Sim2Real
gap.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces VOCALoco, a modular framework for improving legged robot locomotion by dynamically selecting safe and energy-efficient strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing deep reinforcement learning approaches for legged robot locomotion struggle with safety, interpretability, and generalization to new terrains.

Method: VOCALoco uses pre-trained locomotion policies and evaluates them based on safety, energy consumption, and predicted transport cost over a planning horizon.

Result: In staircase locomotion tasks, VOCALoco shows improved robustness and safety in both simulated and real-world environments compared to end-to-end deep reinforcement learning policies.

Conclusion: VOCALoco enhances the adaptability of legged robots to challenging terrains, particularly stairs, offering a safer and energy-efficient solution.

Abstract: Recent advancements in legged robot locomotion have facilitated traversal
over increasingly complex terrains. Despite this progress, many existing
approaches rely on end-to-end deep reinforcement learning (DRL), which poses
limitations in terms of safety and interpretability, especially when
generalizing to novel terrains. To overcome these challenges, we introduce
VOCALoco, a modular skill-selection framework that dynamically adapts
locomotion strategies based on perceptual input. Given a set of pre-trained
locomotion policies, VOCALoco evaluates their viability and energy-consumption
by predicting both the safety of execution and the anticipated cost of
transport over a fixed planning horizon. This joint assessment enables the
selection of policies that are both safe and energy-efficient, given the
observed local terrain. We evaluate our approach on staircase locomotion tasks,
demonstrating its performance in both simulated and real-world scenarios using
a quadrupedal robot. Empirical results show that VOCALoco achieves improved
robustness and safety during stair ascent and descent compared to a
conventional end-to-end DRL policy

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This study introduces SynAD, a framework leveraging synthetic driving scenarios to enhance end-to-end autonomous driving (E2E AD) models. Key innovations include designating an ego vehicle in synthetic scenarios, integrating map-based synthetic data via a novel Map-to-BEV Network, and combining synthetic and real data effectively during training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper seeks to overcome limitations of relying exclusively on real-world datasets for end-to-end autonomous driving training, such as restricted driving scenario diversity. Synthetic scenario generation aims to provide richer training data diversity but hasn't been fully explored within such driving models.

Method: SynAD assigns a synthetic ego vehicle in multi-agent scenarios with rich driving data. Map-level scenarios are projected and processed using a Map-to-BEV Network to extract features without sensor inputs. Subsequently, the paper introduces a strategy that integrates synthetic map-based and real-world data during training.

Result: Experiments demonstrate that SynAD integrates synthetic and real-world data effectively, notably enhancing safety performance in autonomous driving models.

Conclusion: SynAD bridges the gap between synthetic scenario generation and autonomous driving, offering enhanced training diversity and robustness for E2E AD models, contributing to safer autonomous driving systems.

Abstract: Recent advancements in deep learning and the availability of high-quality
real-world driving datasets have propelled end-to-end autonomous driving.
Despite this progress, relying solely on real-world data limits the variety of
driving scenarios for training. Synthetic scenario generation has emerged as a
promising solution to enrich the diversity of training data; however, its
application within E2E AD models remains largely unexplored. This is primarily
due to the absence of a designated ego vehicle and the associated sensor
inputs, such as camera or LiDAR, typically provided in real-world scenarios. To
address this gap, we introduce SynAD, the first framework designed to enhance
real-world E2E AD models using synthetic data. Our method designates the agent
with the most comprehensive driving information as the ego vehicle in a
multi-agent synthetic scenario. We further project path-level scenarios onto
maps and employ a newly developed Map-to-BEV Network to derive bird's-eye-view
features without relying on sensor inputs. Finally, we devise a training
strategy that effectively integrates these map-based synthetic data with real
driving data. Experimental results demonstrate that SynAD effectively
integrates all components and notably enhances safety performance. By bridging
synthetic scenario generation and E2E AD, SynAD paves the way for more
comprehensive and robust autonomous driving models.

Result: On real-robot benchmarks, the framework improved success rates of existing methods (ACT by 33.75%, DP by 25%). The entire approach achieved an average success rate of 79%, a 21% improvement over advanced baselines.

Conclusion: Combining semantic grounding with expert specialization significantly enhances the efficiency and robustness of multitask robotic manipulation systems.

Abstract: Perceptual ambiguity and task conflict limit multitask robotic manipulation
via imitation learning. We propose a framework combining a Language-Conditioned
Visual Representation (LCVR) module and a Language-conditioned
Mixture-ofExperts Density Policy (LMoE-DP). LCVR resolves perceptual
ambiguities by grounding visual features with language instructions, enabling
differentiation between visually similar tasks. To mitigate task conflict,
LMoE-DP uses a sparse expert architecture to specialize in distinct, multimodal
action distributions, stabilized by gradient modulation. On real-robot
benchmarks, LCVR boosts Action Chunking with Transformers (ACT) and Diffusion
Policy (DP) success rates by 33.75% and 25%, respectively. The full framework
achieves a 79% average success, outperforming the advanced baseline by 21%. Our
work shows that combining semantic grounding and expert specialization enables

Conclusion: This novel exploration planning and task allocation method effectively optimizes multi-robot operations, offering theoretical guarantees and enhanced performance metrics in challenging environments.

Abstract: This work addresses the collaborative multi-robot autonomous online
exploration problem, particularly focusing on distributed exploration planning
for dynamically balanced exploration area partition and task allocation among a
team of mobile robots operating in obstacle-dense non-convex environments.
  We present a novel topological map structure that simultaneously
characterizes both spatial connectivity and global exploration completeness of
the environment. The topological map is updated incrementally to utilize known
spatial information for updating reachable spaces, while exploration targets

TL;DR: The paper introduces a phase-based trajectory optimization framework for legged robots, ensuring compliance with translational dynamics and friction cone constraints to generate reliable motions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable legged robots to generate reliable motion by combining path and contact sequence computations while considering dynamics accurately.

Method: The approach uses the superposition properties of linear differential equations and differentiation matrix of Bézier polynomials to decouple dynamics, derive analytical relationships between position and force, and ensure compliance with constraints.

Result: The framework successfully generates dynamically reliable motions with various gait sequences for legged robots.

Conclusion: The proposed method provides a consistent and feasible way to address dynamics and constraints during motion generation for legged robots.

Abstract: To generate reliable motion for legged robots through trajectory
optimization, it is crucial to simultaneously compute the robot's path and
contact sequence, as well as accurately consider the dynamics in the problem
formulation. In this paper, we present a phase-based trajectory optimization
that ensures the feasibility of translational dynamics and friction cone
constraints throughout the entire trajectory. Specifically, our approach
leverages the superposition properties of linear differential equations to
decouple the translational dynamics for each contact point, which operates
under different phase sequences. Furthermore, we utilize the differentiation
matrix of B{\'e}zier polynomials to derive an analytical relationship between
the robot's position and force, thereby ensuring the consistent satisfaction of
translational dynamics. Additionally, by exploiting the convex closure property
of B{\'e}zier polynomials, our method ensures compliance with friction cone
constraints. Using the aforementioned approach, the proposed trajectory
optimization framework can generate dynamically reliable motions with various
gait sequences for legged robots. We validate our framework using a quadruped
robot model, focusing on the feasibility of dynamics and motion generation.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces ZTRS, a framework eliminating imitation learning while combining raw sensor input and reinforcement learning for autonomous driving.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address limitations of imitation learning and leverage reinforcement learning for truly end-to-end autonomous driving from raw sensor inputs.

Method: Develop ZTRS with offline reinforcement learning, incorporating Exhaustive Policy Optimization (EPO) for enumerable actions and rewards.

Result: ZTRS achieves state-of-the-art performance on benchmarks Navtest, Navhard, and HUGSIM, and surpasses IL-based methods.

Conclusion: ZTRS demonstrates robust end-to-end performance using reinforcement learning, marking a significant step forward in autonomous driving frameworks.

Abstract: End-to-end autonomous driving maps raw sensor inputs directly into
ego-vehicle trajectories to avoid cascading errors from perception modules and
to leverage rich semantic cues. Existing frameworks largely rely on Imitation
Learning (IL), which can be limited by sub-optimal expert demonstrations and
covariate shift during deployment. On the other hand, Reinforcement Learning
(RL) has recently shown potential in scaling up with simulations, but is
typically confined to low-dimensional symbolic inputs (e.g. 3D objects and
maps), falling short of full end-to-end learning from raw sensor data. We
introduce ZTRS (Zero-Imitation End-to-End Autonomous Driving with Trajectory
Scoring), a framework that combines the strengths of both worlds: sensor inputs
without losing information and RL training for robust planning. To the best of
our knowledge, ZTRS is the first framework that eliminates IL entirely by only
learning from rewards while operating directly on high-dimensional sensor data.
ZTRS utilizes offline reinforcement learning with our proposed Exhaustive
Policy Optimization (EPO), a variant of policy gradient tailored for enumerable
actions and rewards. ZTRS demonstrates strong performance across three
benchmarks: Navtest (generic real-world open-loop planning), Navhard (open-loop
planning in challenging real-world and synthetic scenarios), and HUGSIM
(simulated closed-loop driving). Specifically, ZTRS achieves the
state-of-the-art result on Navhard and outperforms IL-based baselines on
HUGSIM. Code will be available at https://github.com/woxihuanjiangguo/ZTRS.

TL;DR: The paper proposes an improved embodied robotic agent framework leveraging Vision-Language Models (VLMs), demonstrating superior task success rates in natural language control tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address shortcomings in LLM-based embodied agents, particularly their inability to effectively plan and execute complex natural language control tasks online.

Method: The framework integrates three modules: 1) human-robot voice interaction, 2) vision-language agent with task planning and language instruction conversion, and 3) action execution. VLMs are employed for enhanced task planning and execution.

Result: Experimental results show a 28% improvement in average task success rates in both simulated and real-world tasks, outperforming approaches using LLM+CLIP.

Conclusion: This framework significantly enhances the capability of robots to perform natural language tasks, advancing Human-centered AI implementation with intelligent embodied agents.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) has marked a
significant breakthrough in Artificial Intelligence (AI), ushering in a new era
of Human-centered Artificial Intelligence (HAI). HAI aims to better serve human
welfare and needs, thereby placing higher demands on the intelligence level of
robots, particularly in aspects such as natural language interaction, complex
task planning, and execution. Intelligent agents powered by LLMs have opened up
new pathways for realizing HAI. However, existing LLM-based embodied agents
often lack the ability to plan and execute complex natural language control
tasks online. This paper explores the implementation of intelligent robotic
manipulating agents based on Vision-Language Models (VLMs) in the physical
world. We propose a novel embodied agent framework for robots, which comprises
a human-robot voice interaction module, a vision-language agent module and an
action execution module. The vision-language agent itself includes a

*Haotian Zhou,Xiaole Wang,He Li,Fusheng Sun,Shengyu Guo,Guolei Qi,Jianghuan Xu,Huijing Zhao*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper introduces LagMemo, a visual navigation system for multi-modal, open-vocabulary, and multi-goal tasks in intelligent robots, leveraging a 3D language Gaussian Splatting memory.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Classical visual navigation methods are limited in handling complex scenarios like multi-goal, multi-modal, and open-vocabulary tasks, restricting robotic utility in practical applications.

Method: LagMemo builds a unified 3D language memory during exploration, queries task goals to predict locations, and employs a local perception-based verification mechanism for dynamic goal matching and validation.

Result: LagMemo significantly improves multi-modal, open-vocabulary goal localization and surpasses state-of-the-art methods in multi-goal visual navigation using the curated evaluation dataset GOAT-Core.

Conclusion: LagMemo effectively addresses limitations of classical systems, demonstrating advanced capabilities in multi-modal and multi-goal visual navigation of robots, paving the way for practical applications.

Abstract: Navigating to a designated goal using visual information is a fundamental
capability for intelligent robots. Most classical visual navigation methods are
restricted to single-goal, single-modality, and closed set goal settings. To
address the practical demands of multi-modal, open-vocabulary goal queries and
multi-goal visual navigation, we propose LagMemo, a navigation system that
leverages a language 3D Gaussian Splatting memory. During exploration, LagMemo
constructs a unified 3D language memory. With incoming task goals, the system
queries the memory, predicts candidate goal locations, and integrates a local
perception-based verification mechanism to dynamically match and validate goals
during navigation. For fair and rigorous evaluation, we curate GOAT-Core, a
high-quality core split distilled from GOAT-Bench tailored to multi-modal
open-vocabulary multi-goal visual navigation. Experimental results show that
LagMemo's memory module enables effective multi-modal open-vocabulary goal
localization, and that LagMemo outperforms state-of-the-art methods in
multi-goal visual navigation. Project page:

*Ev Zisselman,Mirco Mutti,Shelly Francis-Meretzki,Elisei Shafer,Aviv Tamar*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper introduces blindfolded behavioral cloning, demonstrating that hiding certain task information from the demonstrator improves generalization to unseen tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Generalization in behavioral cloning requires extensive task demonstrations from human experts, which is resource-intensive.

Method: Introduces blindfolded experts where certain task information is deliberately hidden, compelling them to explore non-trivial solutions.

Result: Blindfolded experts demonstrated better generalization to unseen tasks in robot peg insertion and videogame experiments compared to fully-informed experts.

Conclusion: Cloning blindfolded experts yields improved generalization with fewer task demonstrations and is theoretically supported by generalization error scaling with hidden task information and the number of tasks.

Abstract: Behavioral cloning is a simple yet effective technique for learning
sequential decision-making from demonstrations. Recently, it has gained
prominence as the core of foundation models for the physical world, where
achieving generalization requires countless demonstrations of a multitude of
tasks. Typically, a human expert with full information on the task demonstrates
a (nearly) optimal behavior. In this paper, we propose to hide some of the
task's information from the demonstrator. This ``blindfolded'' expert is
compelled to employ non-trivial exploration to solve the task. We show that
cloning the blindfolded expert generalizes better to unseen tasks than its
fully-informed counterpart. We conduct experiments of real-world robot peg
insertion tasks with (limited) human demonstrations, alongside videogames from
the Procgen benchmark. Additionally, we support our findings with theoretical
analysis, which confirms that the generalization error scales with
$\sqrt{I/m}$, where $I$ measures the amount of task information available to
the demonstrator, and $m$ is the number of demonstrated tasks. Both theory and
practice indicate that cloning blindfolded experts generalizes better with
fewer demonstrated tasks. Project page with videos and code:

*Ziqi Ma,Changda Tian,Yue Gao*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces HMAMP, a method using adversarial motion priors to teach robots human-like manipulation skills, tested successfully on hammering tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is increasing interest in making robots interact naturally with humans, including replicating human-style object and tool manipulation.

Method: The proposed method, HMAMP, uses adversarial networks trained on real-world and simulated data to generate human-like manipulation trajectories.

Result: The approach excels in learning human-style manipulation skills, outperforming current baselines, and demonstrates viability in real-world robot arm hammering tasks.

Conclusion: HMAMP signifies progress towards robots interacting naturally and intuitively with humans through improved manipulation techniques.

Abstract: In recent years, there has been growing interest in developing robots and
autonomous systems that can interact with human in a more natural and intuitive
way. One of the key challenges in achieving this goal is to enable these
systems to manipulate objects and tools in a manner that is similar to that of
humans. In this paper, we propose a novel approach for learning human-style
manipulation skills by using adversarial motion priors, which we name HMAMP.
The approach leverages adversarial networks to model the complex dynamics of
tool and object manipulation, as well as the aim of the manipulation task. The
discriminator is trained using a combination of real-world data and simulation
data executed by the agent, which is designed to train a policy that generates
realistic motion trajectories that match the statistical properties of human
motion. We evaluated HMAMP on one challenging manipulation task: hammering, and
the results indicate that HMAMP is capable of learning human-style manipulation
skills that outperform current baseline methods. Additionally, we demonstrate
that HMAMP has potential for real-world applications by performing real robot
arm hammering tasks. In general, HMAMP represents a significant step towards
developing robots and autonomous systems that can interact with humans in a
more natural and intuitive way, by learning to manipulate tools and objects in
a manner similar to how humans do.

*Jingyi Tian,Le Wang,Sanping Zhou,Sen Wang,Jiayi Li,Gang Hua*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: DynaRend is a representation learning framework designed to improve robotic manipulation by learning 3D-aware and dynamics-informed triplane features using multi-view RGB-D video data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenge of learning robotic manipulation policies caused by the lack of diverse real-world training data.

Method: Developed DynaRend, which leverages masked reconstruction and future prediction with differentiable volumetric rendering to jointly capture spatial geometry, dynamics, and semantics in a unified representation.

Result: DynaRend showed substantial improvements in success rates, generalization, and real-world applicability on RLBench, Colosseum, and real-world experiments.

Conclusion: The framework offers a promising approach for increasing the generalizability and effectiveness of robotic manipulation across diverse tasks.

Abstract: Learning generalizable robotic manipulation policies remains a key challenge
due to the scarcity of diverse real-world training data. While recent
approaches have attempted to mitigate this through self-supervised
representation learning, most either rely on 2D vision pretraining paradigms
such as masked image modeling, which primarily focus on static semantics or
scene geometry, or utilize large-scale video prediction models that emphasize
2D dynamics, thus failing to jointly learn the geometry, semantics, and
dynamics required for effective manipulation. In this paper, we present
DynaRend, a representation learning framework that learns 3D-aware and
dynamics-informed triplane features via masked reconstruction and future
prediction using differentiable volumetric rendering. By pretraining on
multi-view RGB-D video data, DynaRend jointly captures spatial geometry, future
dynamics, and task semantics in a unified triplane representation. The learned
representations can be effectively transferred to downstream robotic
manipulation tasks via action value map prediction. We evaluate DynaRend on two
challenging benchmarks, RLBench and Colosseum, as well as in real-world robotic
experiments, demonstrating substantial improvements in policy success rate,
generalization to environmental perturbations, and real-world applicability
across diverse manipulation tasks.

*Baozhe Zhang,Xinwei Chen,Qingcheng Chen,Chao Xu,Fei Gao,Yanjun Cao*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces CoNi-OA, an efficient obstacle-avoidance algorithm for UAV-UGV cooperation, which uses LiDAR data, avoids global state reliance, and generates real-time collision-free trajectories.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to enhance UAV control in cooperative air-ground tasks by addressing the limitations of CoNi-MPC, specifically its inability to manage obstacle avoidance due to the absence of environmental information.

Method: The proposed method, CoNi-OA, uses a single frame of raw LiDAR data from UAVs to create a modulation matrix, enabling real-time velocity adjustments within a UGV's non-inertial frame for obstacle avoidance, without the need for global state estimation or obstacle prediction.

Result: CoNi-OA achieves efficient, real-time obstacle avoidance (less than 5 ms per iteration) in dynamic and unpredictable environments, generating collision-free trajectories while maintaining computational efficiency.

Conclusion: CoNi-OA provides a robust solution for UAV-UGV cooperation, overcoming the need for global state estimation and obstacle modeling. It effectively handles static and dynamic scenarios, expanding its applicability to complex, featureless environments.

Abstract: CoNi-MPC provides an efficient framework for UAV control in air-ground
cooperative tasks by relying exclusively on relative states, eliminating the
need for global state estimation. However, its lack of environmental
information poses significant challenges for obstacle avoidance. To address
this issue, we propose a novel obstacle avoidance algorithm, Cooperative
Non-inertial frame-based Obstacle Avoidance (CoNi-OA), designed explicitly for
UAV-UGV cooperative scenarios without reliance on global state estimation or
obstacle prediction. CoNi-OA uniquely utilizes a single frame of raw LiDAR data
from the UAV to generate a modulation matrix, which directly adjusts the
quadrotor's velocity to achieve obstacle avoidance. This modulation-based
method enables real-time generation of collision-free trajectories within the
UGV's non-inertial frame, significantly reducing computational demands (less
than 5 ms per iteration) while maintaining safety in dynamic and unpredictable
environments. The key contributions of this work include: (1) a
modulation-based obstacle avoidance algorithm specifically tailored for UAV-UGV
cooperation in non-inertial frames without global states; (2) rapid, real-time
trajectory generation based solely on single-frame LiDAR data, removing the
need for obstacle modeling or prediction; and (3) adaptability to both static
and dynamic environments, thus extending applicability to featureless or
unknown scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the need for fast, safe, and optimal crane trajectories while considering physical constraints like friction and collision avoidance.

Method: The method involves leveraging differential flatness to include dynamic and physical constraints, allowing aggressive movement while constraining payload swing only at the final point.

Result: Simulation studies reveal that neglecting dry friction causes actuator saturation and collisions, proving the necessity of friction modeling.

Conclusion: Incorporating friction modeling is essential for achieving fast and safe crane trajectories while respecting physical and dynamic constraints.

Abstract: This paper presents an optimal trajectory generation method for 3D overhead
cranes by leveraging differential flatness. This framework enables the direct
inclusion of complex physical and dynamic constraints, such as nonlinear
friction and collision avoidance for both payload and rope. Our approach allows
for aggressive movements by constraining payload swing only at the final point.
A comparative simulation study validates our approach, demonstrating that

### [356] [Supervisory Measurement-Guided Noise Covariance Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24508)
*Haoying Li,Yifan Peng,Junfeng Wu*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper proposes a method for optimizing state estimation by estimating sensor noise covariances more efficiently, using a bilevel optimization approach.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate state estimation depends on correctly specifying sensor noise covariances, which can be challenging due to various factors such as environmental differences and sensor preprocessing.

Method: The approach formulates noise covariance estimation as a Bayesian-based bilevel optimization problem, employing an invariant extended Kalman filter at the lower level and analytical gradient computation for upper-level covariance refinement.

Result: The proposed method outperforms existing solutions in efficiency according to experiments conducted on synthetic and real-world datasets.

Conclusion: This method provides a computationally efficient strategy for improving state estimation accuracy by optimizing noise covariance estimations through a novel bilevel optimization framework.

Abstract: Reliable state estimation hinges on accurate specification of sensor noise
covariances, which weigh heterogeneous measurements. In practice, these
covariances are difficult to identify due to environmental variability,
front-end preprocessing, and other reasons. We address this by formulating
noise covariance estimation as a bilevel optimization that, from a Bayesian
perspective, factorizes the joint likelihood of so-called odometry and
supervisory measurements, thereby balancing information utilization with
computational efficiency. The factorization converts the nested Bayesian
dependency into a chain structure, enabling efficient parallel computation: at
the lower level, an invariant extended Kalman filter with state augmentation
estimates trajectories, while a derivative filter computes analytical gradients
in parallel for upper-level gradient updates. The upper level refines the
covariance to guide the lower-level estimation. Experiments on synthetic and
real-world datasets show that our method achieves higher efficiency over
existing baselines.

### [357] [Stochastic Prize-Collecting Games: Strategic Planning in Multi-Robot Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24515)
*Malintha Fernando,Petter Ögren,Silun Zhang*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces Stochastic Prize-Collecting Games (SPCG) to address the Team Orienteering Problem (TOP) with competing robots. Two algorithms, ORS and FORL, help robots plan and learn policies under energy constraints and stochastic graphs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing research on the Team Orienteering Problem assumes purely cooperative robots. The study aims to expand this model to scenarios with competitive, reward-scarce environments.

Method: The authors propose SPCG, theoretically analyze Nash equilibria in specific graph settings, and introduce two algorithms: ORS (Ordinal Rank Search) and FORL (Fictitious Ordinal Response Learning) for ranking and policy-learning among competing robots.

Result: Empirical tests on various graphs showed efficient scaling with OR-conditioning and better generalization with FORL, achieving 87%-95% of the optimality compared to mixed-integer linear programming solutions.

Conclusion: SPCG and its algorithms provide effective strategies for competitive robot planning, showing scalability and high optimality in reward-scarce, energy-constrained environments.

Abstract: The Team Orienteering Problem (TOP) generalizes many real-world multi-robot
scheduling and routing tasks that occur in autonomous mobility, aerial
logistics, and surveillance applications. While many flavors of the TOP exist
for planning in multi-robot systems, they assume that all the robots cooperate
toward a single objective; thus, they do not extend to settings where the
robots compete in reward-scarce environments. We propose Stochastic
Prize-Collecting Games (SPCG) as an extension of the TOP to plan in the
presence of self-interested robots operating on a graph, under energy
constraints and stochastic transitions. A theoretical study on complete and
star graphs establishes that there is a unique pure Nash equilibrium in SPCGs
that coincides with the optimal routing solution of an equivalent TOP given a
rank-based conflict resolution rule. This work proposes two algorithms: Ordinal
Rank Search (ORS) to obtain the ''ordinal rank'' --one's effective rank in
temporarily-formed local neighborhoods during the games' stages, and Fictitious
Ordinal Response Learning (FORL) to obtain best-response policies against one's
senior-rank opponents. Empirical evaluations conducted on road networks and
synthetic graphs under both dynamic and stationary prize distributions show
that 1) the state-aliasing induced by OR-conditioning enables learning policies
that scale more efficiently to large team sizes than those trained with the
global index, and 2) Policies trained with FORL generalize better to imbalanced
prize distributions than those with other multi-agent training methods.
Finally, the learned policies in the SPCG achieved between 87% and 95%
optimality compared to an equivalent TOP solution obtained by mixed-integer
linear programming.

*Yuan Shen,Yuze Hong,Guangyang Zeng,Tengfei Zhang,Pui Yi Chui,Ziyang Hong,Junfeng Wu*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces GeVI-SLAM, a gravity-enhanced VI SLAM system that improves underwater localization by leveraging stereo cameras and advanced computation methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Underwater VI SLAM faces challenges like visual degeneracy and poor IMU excitation, making accurate localization difficult.

Method: Using stereo cameras for direct depth estimation, decoupling gravity components from pose estimation, introducing computationally efficient PnP solvers, and refining pose based on dynamic motion and gravity priors.

Result: GeVI-SLAM demonstrates improved accuracy and stability in simulated and real-world experiments compared to current methods.

Conclusion: The proposed system successfully enhances underwater localization accuracy and stability by addressing existing challenges using novel techniques.

Abstract: Accurate visual inertial simultaneous localization and mapping (VI SLAM) for
underwater robots remains a significant challenge due to frequent visual
degeneracy and insufficient inertial measurement unit (IMU) motion excitation.
In this paper, we present GeVI-SLAM, a gravity-enhanced stereo VI SLAM system
designed to address these issues. By leveraging the stereo camera's direct
depth estimation ability, we eliminate the need to estimate scale during IMU
initialization, enabling stable operation even under low acceleration dynamics.
With precise gravity initialization, we decouple the pitch and roll from the
pose estimation and solve a 4 degrees of freedom (DOF) Perspective-n-Point
(PnP) problem for pose tracking. This allows the use of a minimal 3-point
solver, which significantly reduces computational time to reject outliers
within a Random Sample Consensus framework. We further propose a
bias-eliminated 4-DOF PnP estimator with provable consistency, ensuring the
relative pose converges to the true value as the feature number increases. To
handle dynamic motion, we refine the full 6-DOF pose while jointly estimating
the IMU covariance, enabling adaptive weighting of the gravity prior. Extensive
experiments on simulated and real-world data demonstrate that GeVI-SLAM
achieves higher accuracy and greater stability compared to state-of-the-art
methods.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces a hierarchical framework for robotic inspection in uncertain environments, focusing on adaptive planning and traversal.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address challenges in robotic inspection due to discrepancies between environmental models and real conditions, caused by natural or human activities.

Method: Propose a two-part framework: (a) global view-planning based on historical maps and (b) local view replanning to adapt to current surface conditions.

Result: Validated through real-world tests in subterranean mines using quadrupedal robots, demonstrating robustness against environmental uncertainties.

Conclusion: The framework ensures comprehensive global coverage while adapting reactively to local morphology, supporting robust robotic inspection under uncertainty.

Abstract: In this work, we present a hierarchical framework designed to support robotic
inspection under environment uncertainty. By leveraging a known environment
model, existing methods plan and safely track inspection routes to visit points
of interest. However, discrepancies between the model and actual site
conditions, caused by either natural or human activities, can alter the surface
morphology or introduce path obstructions. To address this challenge, the
proposed framework divides the inspection task into: (a) generating the initial
global view-plan for region of interests based on a historical map and (b)
local view replanning to adapt to the current morphology of the inspection
scene. The proposed hierarchy preserves global coverage objectives while
enabling reactive adaptation to the local surface morphology. This enables the
local autonomy to remain robust against environment uncertainty and complete
the inspection tasks. We validate the approach through deployments in
real-world subterranean mines using quadrupedal robot.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper introduces the Unified Iterative Calibration (UIC) framework for accurate extrinsic parameter and time offset calibration in underwater SLAM systems using Doppler Velocity Log (DVL).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the gap in existing methods for calibrating extrinsic parameters and clock offsets in underwater SLAM systems, which either rely on specific sensor configurations or make oversimplified assumptions.

Method: The authors propose a general UIC framework using Maximum A Posteriori (MAP) estimation supported by a Gaussian Process (GP) motion prior. It alternates between motion state updates and gradient-based calibration variable updates, with a consistent initialization scheme.

Result: The proposed UIC framework was validated through simulations and real-world tests, and its utility extends beyond underwater SLAM to general multi-sensor calibration problems.

Conclusion: The UIC framework effectively addresses challenges in DVL calibration, offering a reliable, generalizable solution for underwater SLAM systems and broader multi-sensor calibration applications. Open-source toolbox for DVL-camera calibration is provided.

Abstract: The calibration of extrinsic parameters and clock offsets between sensors for
high-accuracy performance in underwater SLAM systems remains insufficiently
explored. Existing methods for Doppler Velocity Log (DVL) calibration are
either constrained to specific sensor configurations or rely on oversimplified
assumptions, and none jointly estimate translational extrinsics and time
offsets. We propose a Unified Iterative Calibration (UIC) framework for general
DVL sensor setups, formulated as a Maximum A Posteriori (MAP) estimation with a
Gaussian Process (GP) motion prior for high-fidelity motion interpolation. UIC
alternates between efficient GP-based motion state updates and gradient-based
calibration variable updates, supported by a provably statistically consistent
sequential initialization scheme. The proposed UIC can be applied to IMU,
cameras and other modalities as co-sensors. We release an open-source
DVL-camera calibration toolbox. Beyond underwater applications, several aspects
of UIC-such as the integration of GP priors for MAP-based calibration and the
design of provably reliable initialization procedures-are broadly applicable to
other multi-sensor calibration problems. Finally, simulations and real-world
tests validate our approach.

Method: A curriculum-based reinforcement learning framework is introduced, incorporating densified rewards via projectile motion laws and reference state initialization to optimize jumping behavior exploration without needing reference trajectories.

Result: Horizontal jumps achieved up to 1.25 m with centimeter-level accuracy and vertical jumps up to 1.0 m. Versatile locomotion capabilities including omnidirectional jumping were demonstrated, alongside robust walking on diverse terrains.

Conclusion: The proposed framework successfully enables dynamic and precise jumping for robots, surpassing prior works and showcasing versatility and real-world applicability with minimal modifications.

Abstract: This paper presents a curriculum-based reinforcement learning framework for
training precise and high-performance jumping policies for the robot `Olympus'.
Separate policies are developed for vertical and horizontal jumps, leveraging a
simple yet effective strategy. First, we densify the inherently sparse jumping
reward using the laws of projectile motion. Next, a reference state
initialization scheme is employed to accelerate the exploration of dynamic
jumping behaviors without reliance on reference trajectories. We also present a
walking policy that, when combined with the jumping policies, unlocks versatile
and dynamic locomotion capabilities. Comprehensive testing validates walking on
varied terrain surfaces and jumping performance that exceeds previous works,
effectively crossing the Sim2Real gap. Experimental validation demonstrates
horizontal jumps up to 1.25 m with centimeter accuracy and vertical jumps up to
1.0 m. Additionally, we show that with only minor modifications, the proposed
method can be used to learn omnidirectional jumping.

Motivation: Develop a localization system capable of precise and efficient robot positioning in large-scale outdoor environments, irrespective of varied sensor models.

Method: GroundLoc employs Bird's-Eye View image projection focusing on ground areas and uses R2D2 or SIFT for keypoints identification in map registration.

Result: GroundLoc surpasses current methods on SemanticKITTI and HeLiPR datasets; achieves an Average Trajectory Error below 50 cm across multi-session evaluations and supports multiple sensors.

Conclusion: The pipeline is effective for robot localization while being storage-efficient, adaptable across sensor variations, and capable of online runtime performance.

Abstract: In this letter, we introduce GroundLoc, a LiDAR-only localization pipeline
designed to localize a mobile robot in large-scale outdoor environments using
prior maps. GroundLoc employs a Bird's-Eye View (BEV) image projection focusing
on the perceived ground area and utilizes the place recognition network R2D2,
or alternatively, the non-learning approach Scale-Invariant Feature Transform
(SIFT), to identify and select keypoints for BEV image map registration. Our
results demonstrate that GroundLoc outperforms state-of-the-art methods on the
SemanticKITTI and HeLiPR datasets across various sensors. In the multi-session
localization evaluation, GroundLoc reaches an Average Trajectory Error (ATE)
well below 50 cm on all Ouster OS2 128 sequences while meeting online runtime
requirements. The system supports various sensor models, as evidenced by
evaluations conducted with Velodyne HDL-64E, Ouster OS2 128, Aeva Aeries II,
and Livox Avia sensors. The prior maps are stored as 2D raster image maps,
which can be created from a single drive and require only 4 MB of storage per

Motivation: To address the challenges of ensuring functionality and robustness of intelligent driving systems by utilizing cost-effective and efficient virtual testing methods.

Method: The paper proposes a Transformer-enhanced Conditional Variational Autoencoder (CVAE-T) for generating realistic traffic scenarios in roundabouts.

Result: CVAE-T effectively reconstructs scenarios, creates diverse synthetic ones, and demonstrates interpretability of latent dimensions while evaluating behaviors with KPIs.

Conclusion: The model is effective for creating multi-agent scenarios, supporting the validation and advancement of intelligent driving systems in complex roundabout environments.

Abstract: With the increasing integration of intelligent driving functions into
serial-produced vehicles, ensuring their functionality and robustness poses
greater challenges. Compared to traditional road testing, scenario-based
virtual testing offers significant advantages in terms of time and cost
efficiency, reproducibility, and exploration of edge cases. We propose a
Transformer-enhanced Conditional Variational Autoencoder (CVAE-T) model for
generating multi-agent traffic scenarios in roundabouts, which are
characterized by high vehicle dynamics and complex layouts, yet remain
relatively underexplored in current research. The results show that the
proposed model can accurately reconstruct original scenarios and generate
realistic, diverse synthetic scenarios. Besides, two Key-Performance-Indicators
(KPIs) are employed to evaluate the interactive behavior in the generated
scenarios. Analysis of the latent space reveals partial disentanglement, with
several latent dimensions exhibiting distinct and interpretable effects on
scenario attributes such as vehicle entry timing, exit timing, and velocity
profiles. The results demonstrate the model's capability to generate scenarios
for the validation of intelligent driving functions involving multi-agent
interactions, as well as to augment data for their development and iterative
improvement.

Result: The method achieves high accuracy in noisy environments, with gait phase estimation at 100% accuracy under 150 Hz and joint angle prediction errors of 8.71% (thigh) and 6.78% (knee).

Conclusion: The study demonstrates high effectiveness in predicting gait progression and joint angles, offering practical benefits for users in overcoming obstacles with powered prosthetics.

Abstract: For amputees with powered transfemoral prosthetics, navigating obstacles or
complex terrain remains challenging. This study addresses this issue by using
an inertial sensor on the sound ankle to guide obstacle-crossing movements. A
genetic algorithm computes the optimal neural network structure to predict the
required angles of the thigh and knee joints. A gait progression prediction
algorithm determines the actuation angle index for the prosthetic knee motor,
ultimately defining the necessary thigh and knee angles and gait progression.
Results show that when the standard deviation of Gaussian noise added to the
thigh angle data is less than 1, the method can effectively eliminate noise
interference, achieving 100\% accuracy in gait phase estimation under 150 Hz,
with thigh angle prediction error being 8.71\% and knee angle prediction error
being 6.78\%. These findings demonstrate the method's ability to accurately
predict gait progression and joint angles, offering significant practical value
for obstacle negotiation in powered transfemoral prosthetics.

### [365] [Fare: Failure Resilience in Learned Visual Navigation Control](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24680)
*Zishuo Wang,Joel Loo,David Hsu*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper introduces Fare, a framework enhancing imitation learning policies with failure recognition and recovery capabilities in OOD scenarios without using explicit failure data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Imitation learning policies often fail in OOD scenarios, lacking resilience and recovery capabilities which are crucial for robust navigation.

Method: Fare integrates OOD-detection, failure recognition through image region analysis, and recovery heuristics into imitation learning policies, enhancing their robustness in complex environments.

Result: Real-world experiments demonstrate improved failure recovery and navigation robustness using Fare in two policy architectures.

Conclusion: Fare successfully enables imitation learning policies to manage failures without explicit failure data, improving robustness and long-range navigation in difficult environments.

Abstract: While imitation learning (IL) enables effective visual navigation, IL
policies are prone to unpredictable failures in out-of-distribution (OOD)
scenarios. We advance the notion of failure-resilient policies, which not only
detect failures but also recover from them automatically. Failure recognition
that identifies the factors causing failure is key to informing recovery: e.g.
pinpointing image regions triggering failure detections can provide cues to
guide recovery. We present Fare, a framework to construct failure-resilient IL
policies, embedding OOD-detection and recognition in them without using
explicit failure data, and pairing them with recovery heuristics. Real-world
experiments show that Fare enables failure recovery across two different policy
architectures, enabling robust long-range navigation in complex environments.

*Caleb Escobedo,Nataliya Nechyporenko,Shreyas Kadekodi,Alessandro Roncone*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper presents a framework for analyzing object-aware controllers for robots, focusing on safe motion control to anticipate and avoid collisions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address the challenge of ensuring safe robot operation in dynamic environments with moving obstacles.

Method: The paper introduces a framework based on three key design considerations: kinematics, motion profiles, and virtual constraints. It uses experimental scenarios to verify and analyze robot behaviors.

Result: The analysis unveils shortcomings in current object-aware controllers, including lack of focus on kinematics, discontinuities in control, and instability in movement profiles.

Conclusion: The proposed framework serves as a valuable tool for designing, comparing, and benchmarking obstacle avoidance strategies in robotics.

Abstract: Real-time control is an essential aspect of safe robot operation in the real
world with dynamic objects. We present a framework for the analysis of
object-aware controllers, methods for altering a robot's motion to anticipate
and avoid possible collisions. This framework is focused on three design
considerations: kinematics, motion profiles, and virtual constraints.
Additionally, the analysis in this work relies on verification of robot
behaviors using fundamental robot-obstacle experimental scenarios. To showcase
the effectiveness of our method we compare three representative object-aware
controllers. The comparison uses metrics originating from the design
considerations. From the analysis, we find that the design of object-aware
controllers often lacks kinematic considerations, continuity of control points,
and stability in movement profiles. We conclude that this framework can be used
in the future to design, compare, and benchmark obstacle avoidance methods.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper focuses on embedding physical computing into soft robots for enhanced behaviors, bypassing traditional electronics, and highlights three strategies: analog oscillators, physical reservoir computing, and physical algorithmic computing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance the intelligence, robustness, and utility of soft robots by embedding physical computing, reducing reliance on traditional computer systems.

Method: The paper surveys three strategies (analog oscillators, physical reservoir computing, physical algorithmic computing) and analyzes their utility for enabling complex behaviors in soft robots.

Result: Discussed strategies allow soft robots to perform complex tasks like locomotion, obstacle avoidance, payload classification, and logical programming without CMOS electronics.

Conclusion: Embedding physical computing in soft robots opens new avenues for intelligent, robust, and adaptable functionalities, with vast potential for future development.

Abstract: Softening and onboarding computers and controllers is one of the final
frontiers in soft robotics towards their robustness and intelligence for
everyday use. In this regard, embodying soft and physical computing presents
exciting potential. Physical computing seeks to encode inputs into a mechanical
computing kernel and leverage the internal interactions among this kernel's
constituent elements to compute the output. Moreover, such input-to-output
evolution can be re-programmable. This perspective paper proposes a framework
for embodying physical computing into soft robots and discusses three unique
strategies in the literature: analog oscillators, physical reservoir computing,
and physical algorithmic computing. These embodied computers enable the soft
robot to perform complex behaviors that would otherwise require CMOS-based
electronics -- including coordinated locomotion with obstacle avoidance,
payload weight and orientation classification, and programmable operation based
on logical rules. This paper will detail the working principles of these
embodied physical computing methods, survey the current state-of-the-art, and
present a perspective for future development.

*Yuansheng Ni,Songcheng Cai,Xiangchao Chen,Jiarong Liang,Zhiheng Lyu,Jiaqi Deng,Kai Zou,Ping Nie,Fei Yuan,Xiang Yue,Wenhu Chen*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper addresses the limitations of current coding agents for visualization by introducing a dataset, a benchmark, and a new model for improved multi-language visualization coding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome issues in current coding agents such as limited language support, unreliable execution, and lack of iterative correction in visualization workflows.

Method: Development of VisCode-Multi-679K dataset, VisPlotBench benchmark, and training of the VisCoder2 models for multi-language visualization coding.

Result: VisCoder2 achieves high execution pass rates, surpassing open-source baselines and approximating proprietary models like GPT-4.1.

Conclusion: VisCoder2 and its supporting resources significantly improve multi-language visualization coding agents, resolving reliability and iterative correction issues.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have recently enabled coding agents capable of
generating, executing, and revising visualization code. However, existing
models often fail in practical workflows due to limited language coverage,
unreliable execution, and lack of iterative correction mechanisms. Progress has
been constrained by narrow datasets and benchmarks that emphasize single-round
generation and single-language tasks. To address these challenges, we introduce
three complementary resources for advancing visualization coding agents.
VisCode-Multi-679K is a large-scale, supervised dataset containing 679K
validated and executable visualization samples with multi-turn correction
dialogues across 12 programming languages. VisPlotBench is a benchmark for
systematic evaluation, featuring executable tasks, rendered outputs, and
protocols for both initial generation and multi-round self-debug. Finally, we
present VisCoder2, a family of multi-language visualization models trained on
VisCode-Multi-679K. Experiments show that VisCoder2 significantly outperforms
strong open-source baselines and approaches the performance of proprietary
models like GPT-4.1, with further gains from iterative self-debug, reaching
82.4% overall execution pass rate at the 32B scale, particularly in symbolic or
compiler-dependent languages.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: Agentsway is a framework for designing software with autonomous AI agents as collaborators, addressing limitations of traditional human-centric methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional software methodologies are inadequate for teams involving autonomous AI agents, necessitating a new framework.

Method: Agentsway introduces roles and processes for AI agents, focusing on human orchestration, privacy, iterative improvement, and adaptive learning.

Result: Agentsway facilitates domain-specific reasoning, transparent decision-making, and embeds Responsible AI principles through fine-tuned LLMs.

Conclusion: Agentsway formalizes AI agent collaboration in software engineering, paving the way for next-generation development methods.

Abstract: The emergence of Agentic AI is fundamentally transforming how software is
designed, developed, and maintained. Traditional software development
methodologies such as Agile, Kanban, ShapeUp, etc, were originally designed for
human-centric teams and are increasingly inadequate in environments where
autonomous AI agents contribute to planning, coding, testing, and continuous
learning. To address this methodological gap, we present "Agentsway" a novel
software development framework designed for ecosystems where AI agents operate
as first-class collaborators. Agentsway introduces a structured lifecycle
centered on human orchestration, and privacy-preserving collaboration among
specialized AI agents. The framework defines distinct roles for planning,
prompting, coding, testing, and fine-tuning agents, each contributing to
iterative improvement and adaptive learning throughout the development process.
By integrating fine-tuned LLMs that leverage outputs and feedback from
different agents throughout the development cycle as part of a retrospective
learning process, Agentsway enhances domain-specific reasoning, and explainable
decision-making across the entire software development lifecycle. Responsible
AI principles are further embedded across the agents through the coordinated
use of multiple fine-tuned LLMs and advanced reasoning models, ensuring
balanced, transparent, and accountable decision-making. This work advances
software engineering by formalizing agent-centric collaboration, integrating
privacy-by-design principles, and defining measurable metrics for productivity
and trust. Agentsway represents a foundational step toward the next generation
of AI-native, self-improving software development methodologies. To the best of
our knowledge, this is the first research effort to introduce a dedicated
methodology explicitly designed for AI agent-based software engineering teams.

TL;DR: RefleXGen improves code security in large language models (LLMs) using Retrieval-Augmented Generation and self-reflection mechanisms without requiring fine-tuning or specialized datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of enhancing code security in large language models without relying on resource-intensive methods like fine-tuning or creating secure code datasets.

Method: RefleXGen uses Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) techniques combined with iterative self-reflection mechanisms, enabling models to refine and improve code generation securely through self-assessment over time.

Result: RefleXGen achieved notable security improvements across various models, including a 13.6% increase with GPT-3.5 Turbo and other enhancements with GPT-4o, CodeQwen, and Gemini.

Conclusion: Enhancing model self-reflection is a practical and effective strategy for increasing the security of AI-generated code. RefleXGen offers a resource-efficient solution to this problem.

Abstract: Security in code generation remains a pivotal challenge when applying large
language models (LLMs). This paper introduces RefleXGen, an innovative method
that significantly enhances code security by integrating Retrieval-Augmented
Generation (RAG) techniques with guided self-reflection mechanisms inherent in
LLMs. Unlike traditional approaches that rely on fine-tuning LLMs or developing
specialized secure code datasets - processes that can be resource-intensive -
RefleXGen iteratively optimizes the code generation process through
self-assessment and reflection without the need for extensive resources. Within
this framework, the model continuously accumulates and refines its knowledge
base, thereby progressively improving the security of the generated code.
Experimental results demonstrate that RefleXGen substantially enhances code
security across multiple models, achieving a 13.6% improvement with GPT-3.5
Turbo, a 6.7% improvement with GPT-4o, a 4.5% improvement with CodeQwen, and a
5.8% improvement with Gemini. Our findings highlight that improving the quality
of model self-reflection constitutes an effective and practical strategy for
strengthening the security of AI-generated code.

### [372] [TDFlow: Agentic Workflows for Test Driven Software Engineering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23761)
*Kevin Han,Siddharth Maddikayala,Tim Knappe,Om Patel,Austen Liao,Amir Barati Farimani*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper introduces TDFlow, an agentic workflow for repository-scale software engineering that achieves superior results in resolving human-written tests through a test-driven, sub-agent based approach.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve repository-scale software engineering by creating a workflow that solves human-written tests effectively and addresses existing challenges in program repair tasks.

Method: The method involves TDFlow, a workflow that decomposes software repair tasks into four sub-agent-controlled components: patch proposing, debugging, revision, and optional test generation. This reduces cognitive load on agents, focuses them on sub-tasks, and improves performance through specialization.

Result: TDFlow achieved an 88.8% pass rate on SWE-Bench Lite (a 27.8% improvement over prior systems) and a 94.3% pass rate on SWE-Bench Verified. Instances of test hacking were minimal, suggesting the workflow's reliability.

Conclusion: Modern LLMs integrated into a highly engineered, test-driven workflow like TDFlow can achieve human-level test resolution performance. The remaining challenge is developing accurate reproduction tests for fully autonomous repository repair.

Abstract: We introduce TDFlow, a novel test-driven agentic workflow that frames
repository-scale software engineering as a test-resolution task, specifically
designed to solve human-written tests. Given a set of tests, TDFlow repeatedly
proposes, revises, and debugs repository-scale patches using precisely
engineered sub-agents and tightly constrained tools. The workflow decomposes
software engineering program repair into four components governed by respective
sub-agents. This simple, forced decoupling of patch proposing, debugging, patch
revision, and optional test generation (1) reduces long-context burden on any
individual sub-agent, (2) focuses each sub-agent on specific, pre-defined
sub-tasks, and (3) allows for specialized performance improvement on specific
sub-tasks. When provided human-written tests, TDFlow attains 88.8% pass rate on
SWE-Bench Lite (an absolute improvement of 27.8% over the next best system) and
94.3% on SWE-Bench Verified. Manual inspection of the 800 TDFlow runs within
SWE-Bench Lite and Verified uncover only 7 instances of test hacking, which
were subsequently counted as failures. Furthermore, we show that the primary
obstacle to human-level software engineering performance lies within writing
successful reproduction tests. We envision a human-LLM interactive system
powered by TDFlow where human developers write tests solved by LLM systems.
Together, these results indicate that modern LLMs, when embedded in a narrowly
engineered, test-driven workflow, already achieve human-level test resolution
-- with the final frontier for fully autonomous repository repair being the
accurate generation of valid reproduction tests.

*Rodrigo Falcão,Stefan Schweitzer,Julien Siebert,Emily Calvet,Frank Elberzhager*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper examines the effectiveness of large language models (LLMs) for achieving autonomous runtime interoperability in systems of systems, using experiments with curated datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the technical and economic challenges of interoperability in increasingly dynamic and heterogeneous systems of systems, leveraging the advancements in LLMs to enable autonomous and human-independent interoperability solutions.

Method: The study tested 13 LLMs with four versions of a dataset focused on agricultural interoperability. Two strategies—DIRECT and CODEGEN—were applied over multiple runs to compare model effectiveness and consistency.

Result: The qwen2.5-coder:32b model outperformed others, achieving high accuracy in most dataset versions. Notably, this model succeeded in cases requiring unit conversion when other models failed using the DIRECT strategy.

Conclusion: Certain LLMs are capable of enabling autonomous interoperability, suggesting the need for further evaluation across diverse domains and additional research into improving reliability and consistency strategies.

Abstract: Background: Systems of systems are becoming increasingly dynamic and
heterogeneous, and this adds pressure on the long-standing challenge of
interoperability. Besides its technical aspect, interoperability has also an
economic side, as development time efforts are required to build the
interoperability artifacts. Objectives: With the recent advances in the field
of large language models (LLMs), we aim at analyzing the effectiveness of
LLM-based strategies to make systems interoperate autonomously, at runtime,
without human intervention. Method: We selected 13 open source LLMs and curated
four versions of a dataset in the agricultural interoperability use case. We
performed three runs of each model with each version of the dataset, using two
different strategies. Then we compared the effectiveness of the models and the
consistency of their results across multiple runs. Results: qwen2.5-coder:32b
was the most effective model using both strategies DIRECT (average pass@1 >=
0.99) and CODEGEN (average pass@1 >= 0.89) in three out of four dataset
versions. In the fourth dataset version, which included an unit conversion, all
models using the strategy DIRECT failed, whereas using CODEGEN
qwen2.5-coder:32b succeeded with an average pass@1 = 0.75. Conclusion: Some
LLMs can make systems interoperate autonomously. Further evaluation in
different domains is recommended, and further research on reliability
strategies should be conducted.

*Maria C. Borges,Julian Legler,Lucca Di Benedetto*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper discusses the challenges of designing effective alerts and introduces an alerting extension for the OXN observability tool that enables early experimentation and validation of alerts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need to design effective alerts arises from the difficulty of balancing early fault detection with minimizing false alarms. Alerts often address rare faults, requiring rigorous testing tools to ensure functionality.

Method: The paper presents a new alerting extension integrated with the OXN observability tool, which allows engineers to experiment with alert rules and validate alert behavior during the development phase.

Result: Using the introduced tool enables engineers to tune alert rules before deployment and systematically validate alerts to anticipate and avoid runtime issues.

Conclusion: The proposed OXN extension helps enhance the reliability of alerts by allowing systematic design, testing, and validation during the development phase, addressing current gaps in alert management.

Abstract: Observability and alerting form the backbone of modern reliability
engineering. Alerts help teams catch faults early before they turn into
production outages and serve as first clues for troubleshooting. However,
designing effective alerts is challenging. They need to strike a fine balance
between catching issues early and minimizing false alarms. On top of this,
alerts often cover uncommon faults, so the code is rarely executed and
therefore rarely checked. To address these challenges, several industry
practitioners advocate for testing alerting code with the same rigor as
application code. Still, there's a lack of tools that support such systematic
design and validation of alerts.
  This paper introduces a new alerting extension for the observability
experimentation tool OXN. It lets engineers experiment with alerts early during
development. With OXN, engineers can now tune rules at design time and
routinely validate the firing behavior of their alerts, avoiding future
problems at runtime.

*Xing Xing,Wei Wang,Lipeng Ma,Weidong Yang,Junjie Zheng*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper introduces a lifecycle-aware framework for large language models (LLMs) that incorporates intermediate software engineering artifacts into code generation processes. This approach improves code correctness and performance, especially for fine-tuned open-source models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current code generation approaches rely on single-step translation, neglecting structured software engineering practices and intermediate reasoning artifacts.

Method: The framework integrates intermediate artifacts such as requirements analysis, state machine modeling, and pseudocode into training and inference stages, aligning code generation with software development phases.

Result: Lifecycle-level fine-tuning improved code correctness by up to 75%, with open-source LLMs fine-tuned using this framework outperforming pretrained models on metrics like CodeBLEU.

Conclusion: Incorporating intermediate scaffolding and lifecycle-aware processes enhances code generation quality and robustness, proving effective even with reduced training data and demonstrating the importance of structured reasoning artifacts.

Abstract: Recent progress in large language models (LLMs) has advanced automatic code
generation, yet most approaches rely on direct, single-step translation from
problem descriptions to code, disregarding structured software engineering
practices. We introduce a lifecycle-aware framework that systematically
incorporates intermediate artifacts such as requirements analysis, state
machine modeling, and pseudocode into both the training and inference stages.
This design aligns code generation with standard software development phases
and enables more structured reasoning. Experiments show that lifecycle-level
fine-tuning improves code correctness by up to 75% over the same model before
fine-tuning, with performance gains compounding across intermediate stages.
Multi-step inference consistently surpasses single-step generation,
demonstrating the effectiveness of intermediate scaffolding. Notably,
open-source LLMs, once fine-tuned under our framework, match or slightly
outperform models pretrained on code. When applied to DeepSeek-Coder-1.3B, our
framework yields relative CodeBLEU improvements of 34.3%, 20.0%, 11.2%, and
22.3% over ChatGPT-3.5, ChatGPT-4o-mini, DeepSeek-R1, and LLaMA-8B,
respectively. Our pipeline also proves robust with up to 80\% less training
data, confirming its resilience. Ablation studies further reveal that each
intermediate artifact contributes distinctly to final code quality, with state
machine modeling yielding the most substantial impact. Our source code and
detailed experimental data are available at

Motivation: ML systems fail silently, making it crucial to enhance observability for error detection and diagnosis.

Method: The authors conducted seven focus group sessions with domain practitioners to collect empirical data on ML observability practices.

Result: They documented what information practitioners currently monitor in ML systems, how they validate models, and identify faults.

Conclusion: This paper highlights gaps in current practices and proposes recommendations for improving observability tooling and research in ML systems.

Abstract: Production machine learning (ML) systems fail silently -- not with crashes,
but through wrong decisions. While observability is recognized as critical for
ML operations, there is a lack empirical evidence of what practitioners
actually capture. This study presents empirical results on ML observability in
practice through seven focus group sessions in several domains. We catalog the
information practitioners systematically capture across ML systems and their
environment and map how they use it to validate models, detect and diagnose

practice and outline implications for tooling design and research to establish
ML observability practices.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the long-term reliability of software generated by Large Language Models (LLMs) and address concerns about their potential degradation during sustained execution.

Method: Applications generated by LLM tools using standardized prompts were subjected to 50-hour load tests on the Bolt platform. Resource usage, response time, and throughput were monitored to identify patterns of software aging. Statistical analyses were conducted to confirm trends and assess application-specific aging severity.

Result: The study revealed significant software aging in all applications tested, evidenced by progressive memory consumption, slowed response times, and performance instability. The severity of these issues varied by application type.

Conclusion: The paper highlights the critical need to address aging in LLM-generated software and proposes further research into mitigation strategies and long-term evaluation methodologies.

Abstract: Automatically generated software, especially code produced by Large Language
Models (LLMs), is increasingly adopted to accelerate development and reduce
manual effort. However, little is known about the long-term reliability of such
systems under sustained execution. In this paper, we experimentally investigate
the phenomenon of software aging in applications generated by LLM-based tools.
Using the Bolt platform and standardized prompts from Baxbench, we generated
four service-oriented applications and subjected them to 50-hour load tests.
Resource usage, response time, and throughput were continuously monitored to
detect degradation patterns. The results reveal significant evidence of
software aging, including progressive memory growth, increased response time,
and performance instability across all applications. Statistical analyzes
confirm these trends and highlight variability in the severity of aging
according to the type of application. Our findings show the need to consider
aging in automatically generated software and provide a foundation for future
studies on mitigation strategies and long-term reliability evaluation.

TL;DR: MAGNET is a novel framework for code clone detection, combining multiple graph representations with advanced attention mechanisms, achieving state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address limitations of existing code clone detection methods that rely on singular or handcrafted fusion strategies and fail to capture comprehensive code semantics.

Method: Introduce MAGNET, a framework using ASTs, CFGs, DFGs with residual graph neural networks, gated cross-attention, and Set2Set pooling for representation fusion.

Result: MAGNET outperforms previous methods, achieving high F1 scores of 96.5% and 99.2% on BigCloneBench and Google Code Jam datasets.

Conclusion: Multi-graph fusion and attentional components significantly improve code clone detection accuracy, advancing software engineering tasks like refactoring and vulnerability analysis.

Abstract: Code clone detection is a fundamental task in software engineering that
underpins refactoring, debugging, plagiarism detection, and vulnerability
analysis. Existing methods often rely on singular representations such as
abstract syntax trees (ASTs), control flow graphs (CFGs), and data flow graphs
(DFGs), which capture only partial aspects of code semantics. Hybrid approaches
have emerged, but their fusion strategies are typically handcrafted and
ineffective. In this study, we propose MAGNET, a multi-graph attentional
framework that jointly leverages AST, CFG, and DFG representations to capture
syntactic and semantic features of source code. MAGNET integrates residual
graph neural networks with node-level self-attention to learn both local and
long-range dependencies, introduces a gated cross-attention mechanism for
fine-grained inter-graph interactions, and employs Set2Set pooling to fuse
multi-graph embeddings into unified program-level representations. Extensive
experiments on BigCloneBench and Google Code Jam demonstrate that MAGNET
achieves state-of-the-art performance with an overall F1 score of 96.5\% and
99.2\% on the two datasets, respectively. Ablation studies confirm the critical
contributions of multi-graph fusion and each attentional component. Our code is

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to clarify how generative AI tools affect various dimensions of developer productivity, addressing the unclear evidence in this area.

Method: The authors surveyed 415 software practitioners to analyze perceptions of productivity changes across different dimensions using the SPACE framework.

Result: The findings show limited overall productivity improvements, revealing a paradox where developers work faster but do not necessarily develop better software or feel more satisfied.

Conclusion: While generative AI speeds up development processes, its impact on overall productivity, quality, and fulfillment remains limited, exposing a productivity paradox.

Abstract: Generative AI (GenAI) tools are increasingly being adopted in software
development as productivity aids. However, evidence regarding where and when
these tools actually enhance productivity is unclear. In this paper, we
investigate how GenAI adoption affects different dimensions of developer
productivity. We surveyed 415 software practitioners to capture their
perceptions of productivity changes associated with AI-assisted development
using the SPACE framework - Satisfaction and well-being, Performance, Activity,
Communication and collaboration, and Efficiency and flow. Our results,
disaggregated by frequency of AI usage, reveal limited overall productivity
change, highlighting the productivity paradox in which developers become faster
but do not necessarily create better software or feel more fulfilled.

*Lingyue Fu,Bolun Zhang,Hao Guan,Yaoming Zhu,Lin Qiu,Weiwen Liu,Xuezhi Cao,Xunliang Cai,Weinan Zhang,Yong Yu*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper proposes PRDBench, a novel benchmark designed to assess code agents using diverse and complex real-world Python projects. It also introduces a new evaluation framework to address existing limitations of rigid metrics and high setup costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks for evaluating code agents are limited by their high annotation costs and expertise requirements, as well as inflexible metrics primarily relying on unit tests.

Method: The paper introduces an agent-driven pipeline to construct benchmarks, incorporating human supervision to efficiently generate diverse project-level tasks. It proposes PRDBench with structured Product Requirement Documents (PRD), evaluation criteria, and reference implementations.

Result: The PRDBench benchmark system features flexible metrics, extensive data sources, and greater task complexity. It employs an Agent-as-a-Judge paradigm for evaluating outputs beyond unit tests.

Conclusion: PRDBench provides an effective framework for scalable annotation and evaluation, addressing major limitations in code agent benchmarks while enabling more robust and diverse assessment.

Abstract: Recent advances in code agents have enabled automated software development at
the project level, supported by large language models (LLMs) and widely adopted
tools. However, existing benchmarks for code agent evaluation face two major
limitations: high annotation cost and expertise requirements, and rigid
evaluation metrics that rely primarily on unit tests. To address these
challenges, we propose an agent-driven benchmark construction pipeline that
leverages human supervision to efficiently generate diverse and challenging
project-level tasks. Based on this approach, we introduce PRDBench, a novel
benchmark comprising 50 real-world Python projects across 20 domains, each with
structured Product Requirement Document (PRD) requirements, comprehensive
evaluation criteria, and reference implementations. PRDBench features rich data
sources, high task complexity, and flexible metrics. We further employ an
Agent-as-a-Judge paradigm to score agent outputs, enabling the evaluation of
various test types beyond unit tests. Extensive experiments on PRDBench
demonstrate its effectiveness in assessing the capabilities of both code agents
and evaluation agents, providing a scalable and robust framework for annotation
and evaluation.

*Junda He,Jieke Shi,Terry Yue Zhuo,Christoph Treude,Jiamou Sun,Zhenchang Xing,Xiaoning Du,David Lo*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper explores the emerging role of Large Language Models (LLMs) as automated evaluators for software artifacts, addressing scalability challenges in evaluation and proposing a roadmap for advancing this paradigm by 2030.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The integration of LLMs in software engineering creates a surge in generated artifacts, but lacks scalable, nuanced evaluation methods, prompting research into automated solutions.

Method: The paper conducts a literature review of current studies, identifies limitations and research gaps, and proposes a framework and roadmap for developing LLM-as-a-Judge systems in software evaluation.

Result: Identifies existing challenges in evaluating LLM-generated software artifacts and suggests a structured plan to enable robust, scalable evaluation systems by leveraging LLMs.

Conclusion: Advancing the LLM-as-a-Judge paradigm could transform software artifact evaluation by providing scalable, nuanced, and consistent methods by the year 2030.

Abstract: The rapid integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) into software
engineering (SE) has revolutionized tasks like code generation, producing a
massive volume of software artifacts. This surge has exposed a critical
bottleneck: the lack of scalable, reliable methods to evaluate these outputs.
Human evaluation is costly and time-consuming, while traditional automated
metrics like BLEU fail to capture nuanced quality aspects. In response, the
LLM-as-a-Judge paradigm - using LLMs for automated evaluation - has emerged.
This approach leverages the advanced reasoning of LLMs, offering a path toward
human-like nuance at automated scale. However, LLM-as-a-Judge research in SE is
still in its early stages. This forward-looking SE 2030 paper aims to steer the
community toward advancing LLM-as-a-Judge for evaluating LLM-generated software
artifacts. We provide a literature review of existing SE studies, analyze their
limitations, identify key research gaps, and outline a detailed roadmap. We
envision these frameworks as reliable, robust, and scalable human surrogates
capable of consistent, multi-faceted artifact evaluation by 2030. Our work aims
to foster research and adoption of LLM-as-a-Judge frameworks, ultimately
improving the scalability of software artifact evaluation.

*Nguyen Hoang Anh,Minh Le-Anh,Bach Le,Nghi D. Q. Bui*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper introduces CodeWiki, an open-source framework for repository-level documentation using hierarchical decomposition, recursive processing, and synthesis of textual and visual artifacts. It outperforms existing systems and helps document repositories more effectively.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Developers spend most of their time trying to understand codebases, but proper repository-level documentation is often lacking due to complexity and manual labor.

Method: The authors propose CodeWiki, a framework that uses hierarchical decomposition, recursive agentic processing, and textual/visual artifact synthesis for repository-level documentation. They also created CodeWikiBench to provide a benchmark for evaluating repository-level documentation quality.

Result: CodeWiki achieves high-quality scores (68.79% with proprietary models, 64.80% with open-source) and outperforms current documentation systems.

Conclusion: CodeWiki offers a scalable, innovative solution to improve documentation at the repository level, making it easier for developers to understand and work with large codebases.

Abstract: Developers spend nearly 58% of their time understanding codebases, yet
maintaining comprehensive documentation remains challenging due to complexity
and manual effort. While recent Large Language Models (LLMs) show promise for
function-level documentation, they fail at the repository level, where
capturing architectural patterns and cross-module interactions is essential. We
introduce CodeWiki, the first open-source framework for holistic
repository-level documentation across seven programming languages. CodeWiki
employs three innovations: (i) hierarchical decomposition that preserves
architectural context, (ii) recursive agentic processing with dynamic
delegation, and (iii) synthesis of textual and visual artifacts including
architecture diagrams and data flows. We also present CodeWikiBench, the first
repository-level documentation benchmark with multi-level rubrics and agentic
assessment. CodeWiki achieves 68.79% quality score with proprietary models and
64.80% with open-source alternatives, outperforming existing closed-source
systems and demonstrating scalable, accurate documentation for real-world
repositories.

TL;DR: The essay provides a darkly humorous take on the future of software engineering following discussions from the FUture of Software Engineering (FUSE) symposium.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To critically analyze and reflect on the state of software engineering and its potential future challenges through the lens of a symposium discussion.

Method: The author uses observations from the FUSE symposium, incorporating sarcasm and cynicism to present three key issues facing the future of software engineering.

Result: Three major challenges are highlighted: unqualified software makers inadvertently succeeding, the fast pace of the field leading to forgotten lessons, and rapid technological advancements causing overwhelming complexity.

Conclusion: The essay views the future of software engineering as a slow-motion disaster, emphasizing the need for reflection and awareness to navigate challenges effectively.

Abstract: In June 2024 I co-organized the FUture of Software Engineering symposium in
Okinawa, Japan. Me, Andrian Marcus, Takashi Kobayashi and Shinpei Hayashi were
general chairs, Nicole Novielli, Kevin Moran, Yutaro Kashiwa and Masanari Kondo
were program chairs, some members of my group, Carmen Armenti, Stefano
Campanella, Roberto Minelli, were the tables, can't have a room with only
chairs, after all. We invited a crowd of people to discuss what future software
engineering has. FUSE became a 3-day marathon on whether there is actually a
future at all for SE. This essay is a slightly dark take about what I saw at
that event, very loosely based on the discussions that took place, adding some
healthy sarcasm and cynicism, the intellectual salt and pepper I never seem to
run out of. I listened to the brilliant people who gathered to talk about where
we're headed, and distilled three nightmares headed in our direction: software
makers who don't know what they're doing, but get the job done anyway, a field
moving so fast it can't remember its own lessons, and technologies multiplying
like rabbits in Spring. So, let's start. The future, eh? The future of software
engineering looks like a car crash in slow motion: you can see it coming but
you can't look away. The thing is...

*Junpeng Gong,Chunkai Wang,Hao Li,Jinyong Ma,Haoxuan Li,Xu He*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper highlights issues with traditional A/B testing methods, including their unreliable results under skewed data or unequal sample sizes, and proposes a correction method to improve accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: A/B testing is widely used in online platforms for decision-making, but its reliability is often compromised due to deviations from ideal data assumptions, risking false positives.

Method: The authors analyze the impact of skewed, long-tailed data and unequal sample sizes on error rates in A/B tests, derive formulas for necessary sample sizes, and propose an Edgeworth-based correction for more accurate results.

Result: The study found that regular A/B tests require extremely large samples for accuracy, and developed a correction method that performs better under real-world data and sample constraints.

Conclusion: Introducing the Edgeworth-based correction improves A/B testing accuracy and reliability, addressing issues with current methods under challenging data conditions.

Abstract: A/B testing has become the cornerstone of decision-making in online markets,
guiding how platforms launch new features, optimize pricing strategies, and
improve user experience. In practice, we typically employ the pairwise $t$-test
to compare outcomes between the treatment and control groups, thereby assessing
the effectiveness of a given strategy. To be trustworthy, these experiments
must keep Type I error (i.e., false positive rate) under control; otherwise, we
may launch harmful strategies. However, in real-world applications, we find
that A/B testing often fails to deliver reliable results. When the data
distribution departs from normality or when the treatment and control groups
differ in sample size, the commonly used pairwise $t$-test is no longer
trustworthy. In this paper, we quantify how skewed, long tailed data and
unequal allocation distort error rates and derive explicit formulas for the
minimum sample size required for the $t$-test to remain valid. We find that
many online feedback metrics require hundreds of millions samples to ensure
reliable A/B testing. Thus we introduce an Edgeworth-based correction that
provides more accurate $p$-values when the available sample size is limited.
Offline experiments on a leading A/B testing platform corroborate the practical
value of our theoretical minimum sample size thresholds and demonstrate that
the corrected method substantially improves the reliability of A/B testing in
real-world conditions.

*Samuel G. Fadel,Hrittik Roy,Nicholas Krämer,Yevgen Zainchkovskyy,Stas Syrota,Alejandro Valverde Mahou,Carl Henrik Ek,Søren Hauberg*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper examines variational mean field approximations for deep neural networks, highlighting issues and proposing a novel method using two independent linear subspaces to build a correlation-aware posterior. This approach significantly improves predictive performance and calibration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Bayesian approaches to deep learning have struggled with unstable training and poor predictive performance despite their theoretical advantages. This paper aims to address these challenges.

Method: The paper proposes a novel variational family that leverages two independent linear subspaces within the parameter space, reflecting the geometry of reparametrizations. Scalable techniques are developed to optimize ELBO and sample from the posterior.

Result: Empirical tests demonstrated state-of-the-art performance across tasks, models, and datasets compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: By constructing inference mechanisms that account for reparametrization geometry, Bayesian inference for deep neural networks becomes feasible and effective, challenging the notion that such inference is impractical for modern models.

Abstract: Variational mean field approximations tend to struggle with contemporary
overparametrized deep neural networks. Where a Bayesian treatment is usually
associated with high-quality predictions and uncertainties, the practical
reality has been the opposite, with unstable training, poor predictive power,
and subpar calibration. Building upon recent work on reparametrizations of
neural networks, we propose a simple variational family that considers two
independent linear subspaces of the parameter space. These represent functional
changes inside and outside the support of training data. This allows us to
build a fully-correlated approximate posterior reflecting the
overparametrization that tunes easy-to-interpret hyperparameters. We develop
scalable numerical routines that maximize the associated evidence lower bound
(ELBO) and sample from the approximate posterior. Empirically, we observe
state-of-the-art performance across tasks, models, and datasets compared to a
wide array of baseline methods. Our results show that approximate Bayesian
inference applied to deep neural networks is far from a lost cause when
constructing inference mechanisms that reflect the geometry of
reparametrizations.

### [386] [Bayesian neural networks with interpretable priors from Mercer kernels](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23745)
*Alex Alberts,Ilias Bilionis*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: This paper introduces Mercer priors for Bayesian neural networks (BNNs) to ensure the network samples approximate a specified Gaussian Process (GP), providing interpretable constraints on uncertainty quantification without restricting model scalability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate uncertainty quantification is needed for scientific and engineering decisions under limited data, but existing Bayesian neural networks struggle with interpretable priors, and Gaussian processes lack scalability for large datasets.

Method: Proposes the Mercer priors, derived from the Mercer representation of covariance kernels, to define meaningful Bayesian priors for BNNs, enabling them to approximate Gaussian Process samples without imposing specific network structures.

Result: The Mercer priors allow Bayesian neural networks to achieve interpretability in uncertainty quantification tasks while maintaining scalability across large datasets.

Conclusion: Mercer priors bridge the gap between the interpretability of Gaussian processes and the scalability of Bayesian neural networks, enabling meaningful uncertainty quantification in practical applications.

Abstract: Quantifying the uncertainty in the output of a neural network is essential
for deployment in scientific or engineering applications where decisions must
be made under limited or noisy data. Bayesian neural networks (BNNs) provide a
framework for this purpose by constructing a Bayesian posterior distribution
over the network parameters. However, the prior, which is of key importance in
any Bayesian setting, is rarely meaningful for BNNs. This is because the
complexity of the input-to-output map of a BNN makes it difficult to understand
how certain distributions enforce any interpretable constraint on the output
space. Gaussian processes (GPs), on the other hand, are often preferred in
uncertainty quantification tasks due to their interpretability. The drawback is
that GPs are limited to small datasets without advanced techniques, which often
rely on the covariance kernel having a specific structure. To address these
challenges, we introduce a new class of priors for BNNs, called Mercer priors,
such that the resulting BNN has samples which approximate that of a specified
GP. The method works by defining a prior directly over the network parameters
from the Mercer representation of the covariance kernel, and does not rely on
the network having a specific structure. In doing so, we can exploit the
scalability of BNNs in a meaningful Bayesian way.

*Enze Shi,Pankaj Bhagwat,Zhixian Yang,Linglong Kong,Bei Jiang*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper addresses biases in machine learning models by proposing a framework to balance fairness and predictive utility through adjustments in data representations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Machine learning models often amplify historical biases, leading to unfair outcomes. Traditional fairness approaches do not directly address biases in data representations.

Method: The framework decomposes feature space into three components (target-relevant, sensitive, and shared) using sufficient dimension reduction, and selectively removes sensitive information to control fairness-utility trade-offs.

Result: Theoretical analyses and experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets validate the approach, indicating improved fairness while maintaining predictive performance.

Conclusion: Adjusting data representations offers a principled way to address biases and achieves a balance between fairness and predictive utility in machine learning models.

Abstract: Machine learning models have achieved widespread success but often inherit
and amplify historical biases, resulting in unfair outcomes. Traditional
fairness methods typically impose constraints at the prediction level, without
addressing underlying biases in data representations. In this work, we propose
a principled framework that adjusts data representations to balance predictive
utility and fairness. Using sufficient dimension reduction, we decompose the
feature space into target-relevant, sensitive, and shared components, and
control the fairness-utility trade-off by selectively removing sensitive
information. We provide a theoretical analysis of how prediction error and
fairness gaps evolve as shared subspaces are added, and employ influence
functions to quantify their effects on the asymptotic behavior of parameter
estimates. Experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets validate our
theoretical insights and show that the proposed method effectively improves
fairness while preserving predictive performance.

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper proposes a constrained generative model using underdamped Langevin dynamics with specular reflection, enabling efficient, boundary-aware sampling while comparing it to existing reflected stochastic differential equation methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of score-based generative models in satisfying underlying constraints during sampling from unknown distributions.

Method: The authors utilize kinetic Langevin dynamics with specular reflection of velocity at boundaries to enforce constraints, offering a time-reversed (denoising) process restricted to domains with boundaries. They enhance reflected SDEs models by introducing efficient numerical samplers.

Result: They demonstrate optimal rate convergence of their proposed numerical samplers and compare performance between confined Langevin diffusion and reflected diffusion models with local time.

Conclusion: Constrained generative models based on kinetic Langevin dynamics provide an effective solution for boundary-aware sampling, improving performance over traditional reflected SDE methods.

Abstract: Score-based generative models based on stochastic differential equations
(SDEs) achieve impressive performance in sampling from unknown distributions,
but often fail to satisfy underlying constraints. We propose a constrained
generative model using kinetic (underdamped) Langevin dynamics with specular
reflection of velocity on the boundary defining constraints. This results in
piecewise continuously differentiable noising and denoising process where the
latter is characterized by a time-reversed dynamics restricted to a domain with
boundary due to specular boundary condition. In addition, we also contribute to
existing reflected SDEs based constrained generative models, where the
stochastic dynamics is restricted through an abstract local time term. By
presenting efficient numerical samplers which converge with optimal rate in
terms of discretizations step, we provide a comprehensive comparison of models
based on confined (specularly reflected kinetic) Langevin diffusion with models
based on reflected diffusion with local time.

*Agnideep Aich,Ashit Baran Aich*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: Introduces the Copula-Stein Discrepancy (CSD) to detect higher-order dependency structures in copulas for goodness-of-fit testing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard Kernel Stein Discrepancies (KSDs) are not effective in capturing complex dependency structures, such as tail dependence, which are important in scientific and financial fields.

Method: Proposes a Copula-Stein Discrepancy (CSD) defined on copula density, using Stein operator and deriving closed-form Stein kernel for Archimedean copulas. Provides theoretical guarantees, including metrizing weak convergence and sensitivity to tail dependence.

Result: CSD detects dependency mismatches effectively, has optimally converging empirical estimators, and includes scalable computation methods like random feature approximation.

Conclusion: CSD is a robust and efficient tool for dependence-aware statistical inference, useful in a wide range of copula frameworks including Archimedean, elliptical, and vine copulas.

Abstract: Kernel Stein discrepancies (KSDs) have become a principal tool for
goodness-of-fit testing, but standard KSDs are often insensitive to
higher-order dependency structures, such as tail dependence, which are critical
in many scientific and financial domains. We address this gap by introducing
the Copula-Stein Discrepancy (CSD), a novel class of discrepancies tailored to
the geometry of statistical dependence. By defining a Stein operator directly
on the copula density, CSD leverages the generative structure of dependence,
rather than relying on the joint density's score function. For the broad class
of Archimedean copulas, this approach yields a closed-form Stein kernel derived
from the scalar generator function. We provide a comprehensive theoretical
analysis, proving that CSD (i) metrizes weak convergence of copula
distributions, ensuring it detects any mismatch in dependence; (ii) has an
empirical estimator that converges at the minimax optimal rate of
$O_P(n^{-1/2})$; and (iii) is provably sensitive to differences in tail
dependence coefficients. The framework is extended to general non-Archimedean
copulas, including elliptical and vine copulas. Computationally, the exact CSD
kernel evaluation scales linearly in dimension, while a novel random feature
approximation reduces the $n$-dependence from quadratic $O(n^2)$ to near-linear
$\tilde{O}(n)$, making CSD a practical and theoretically principled tool for
dependence-aware inference.

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: This paper presents a framework combining Follow-the-Regularized-Leader (FTRL) and Follow-the-Perturbed-Leader (FTPL) methods for adversarial linear bandits, introducing self-concordant perturbations and achieving enhanced regret bounds.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve the regret bounds in adversarial linear bandits and extend the connection between FTRL and FTPL methods beyond the full-information setting.

Method: The authors develop a unified framework leveraging self-concordant perturbations and design a novel FTPL-based algorithm that incorporates self-concordant regularization with stochastic exploration.

Result: The proposed algorithm achieves a regret of $O(d\sqrt{n \ln n})$, matching the best-known rate on the Euclidean ball and offering a $\sqrt{d}$ improvement on the hypercube, aligning with the optimal bounds up to a logarithmic factor.

Conclusion: The new FTPL-based algorithm effectively extends the concepts of self-concordant regularization to adversarial linear bandits, offering significant improvements in regret bounds and demonstrating the interplay between FTRL and FTPL.

Abstract: We study the adversarial linear bandits problem and present a unified
algorithmic framework that bridges Follow-the-Regularized-Leader (FTRL) and
Follow-the-Perturbed-Leader (FTPL) methods, extending the known connection
between them from the full-information setting. Within this framework, we
introduce self-concordant perturbations, a family of probability distributions
that mirror the role of self-concordant barriers previously employed in the
FTRL-based SCRiBLe algorithm. Using this idea, we design a novel FTPL-based
algorithm that combines self-concordant regularization with efficient
stochastic exploration. Our approach achieves a regret of $O(d\sqrt{n \ln n})$
on both the $d$-dimensional hypercube and the Euclidean ball. On the Euclidean
ball, this matches the rate attained by existing self-concordant FTRL methods.
For the hypercube, this represents a $\sqrt{d}$ improvement over these methods
and matches the optimal bound up to logarithmic factors.

*Jessica Doohan,Lucas Kook,Kevin Burke*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper reviews and compares the performance of Neural Networks and Generalized Additive Models (GAMs) on real-world tabular data across 143 papers and 430 datasets. It found no consistent evidence favoring one model over the other, highlighting that they are complementary approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to systematically analyze how Neural Networks and Generalized Additive Models (GAMs)—two state-of-the-art modeling approaches with respective advantages—perform on real-world tabular data.

Method: The authors conducted a systematic review following PRISMA guidelines, analyzing 143 papers and 430 datasets. Mixed-effects modeling was used to identify key characteristics that explain performance differences, based on metrics such as RMSE, R², and AUC.

Result: No clear superiority was found between Neural Networks and GAMs across datasets. Neural Networks performed better with larger datasets and more predictors, but their advantage decreased over time. GAMs were competitive in smaller datasets and offered better interpretability.

Conclusion: Both Neural Networks and GAMs are valuable and should be seen as complementary methods. For many real-world tabular data applications, the trade-off between performance and explainability favors the use of GAMs for interpretability.

Abstract: Neural networks have become a popular tool in predictive modelling, more
commonly associated with machine learning and artificial intelligence than with
statistics. Generalised Additive Models (GAMs) are flexible non-linear
statistical models that retain interpretability. Both are state-of-the-art in
their own right, with their respective advantages and disadvantages. This paper
analyses how these two model classes have performed on real-world tabular data.
Following PRISMA guidelines, we conducted a systematic review of papers that
performed empirical comparisons of GAMs and neural networks. Eligible papers
were identified, yielding 143 papers, with 430 datasets. Key attributes at both
paper and dataset levels were extracted and reported. Beyond summarising
comparisons, we analyse reported performance metrics using mixed-effects
modelling to investigate potential characteristics that can explain and
quantify observed differences, including application area, study year, sample
size, number of predictors, and neural network complexity. Across datasets, no
consistent evidence of superiority was found for either GAMs or neural networks
when considering the most frequently reported metrics (RMSE, $R^2$, and AUC).
Neural networks tended to outperform in larger datasets and in those with more
predictors, but this advantage narrowed over time. Conversely, GAMs remained
competitive, particularly in smaller data settings, while retaining
interpretability. Reporting of dataset characteristics and neural network
complexity was incomplete in much of the literature, limiting transparency and
reproducibility. This review highlights that GAMs and neural networks should be
viewed as complementary approaches rather than competitors. For many tabular
applications, the performance trade-off is modest, and interpretability may
favour GAMs.

*Jean Barbier,Francesco Camilli,Minh-Toan Nguyen,Mauro Pastore,Rudy Skerk*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper studies deep learning models, focusing on supervised learning in multi-layer perceptrons where feature learning and challenging interpolation regimes are analyzed. It explores optimal learning limits and layer specialization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the longstanding question of whether statistical physics can analyze deep learning models effectively, particularly regarding feature learning beyond narrow networks and kernel methods.

Method: The study uses the matched teacher-student setting to investigate fundamental limits of learning in supervised deep networks and examines the Bayesian-optimal scenarios for understanding neural network dynamics and feature learning.

Result: The research reveals varying learning transitions, showing that specialization propagates from shallow to deeper layers and varies across neurons. Additionally, deeper targets are identified as more challenging to learn.

Conclusion: The findings provide insights into the influence of depth, non-linearity, and width in feature learning, demonstrating a richer understanding of how neural networks adapt optimally to tasks.

Abstract: For three decades statistical physics has been providing a framework to
analyse neural networks. A long-standing question remained on its capacity to
tackle deep learning models capturing rich feature learning effects, thus going
beyond the narrow networks or kernel methods analysed until now. We positively
answer through the study of the supervised learning of a multi-layer
perceptron. Importantly, (i) its width scales as the input dimension, making it
more prone to feature learning than ultra wide networks, and more expressive
than narrow ones or with fixed embedding layers; and (ii) we focus on the
challenging interpolation regime where the number of trainable parameters and
data are comparable, which forces the model to adapt to the task. We consider
the matched teacher-student setting. It provides the fundamental limits of
learning random deep neural network targets and helps in identifying the
sufficient statistics describing what is learnt by an optimally trained network
as the data budget increases. A rich phenomenology emerges with various
learning transitions. With enough data optimal performance is attained through
model's "specialisation" towards the target, but it can be hard to reach for
training algorithms which get attracted by sub-optimal solutions predicted by
the theory. Specialisation occurs inhomogeneously across layers, propagating
from shallow towards deep ones, but also across neurons in each layer.
Furthermore, deeper targets are harder to learn. Despite its simplicity, the
Bayesian-optimal setting provides insights on how the depth, non-linearity and
finite (proportional) width influence neural networks in the feature learning
regime that are potentially relevant way beyond it.

*Ashutosh Anshul,Mohammad Zia Ur Rehman,Sri Akash Kadali,Nagendra Kumar*

Main category: cs.SI

TL;DR: This paper introduces a novel bot detection framework employing multimodal data integration without relying on follower-following data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the challenge of detecting bots effectively, especially in scenarios where explicit user relationship data is unavailable.

Method: The method integrates textual features and user metadata, utilizing transformer-based models like BERT for semantic embeddings combined with a GraphSAGE model.

Result: The method demonstrated robust performance with high accuracies on multiple datasets like Cresci-15, Cresci-17, and PAN 2019, achieving 99.8%, 99.1%, and 96.8%, respectively.

Conclusion: The proposed framework is effective in detecting bots, overcoming previous limitations and adapting to sophisticated bot strategies.

Abstract: Detecting automated accounts (bots) among genuine users on platforms like
Twitter remains a challenging task due to the evolving behaviors and adaptive
strategies of such accounts. While recent methods have achieved strong
detection performance by combining text, metadata, and user relationship
information within graph-based frameworks, many of these models heavily depend
on explicit user-user relationship data. This reliance limits their
applicability in scenarios where such information is unavailable. To address
this limitation, we propose a novel multimodal framework that integrates
detailed textual features with enriched user metadata while employing
graph-based reasoning without requiring follower-following data. Our method
uses transformer-based models (e.g., BERT) to extract deep semantic embeddings
from tweets, which are aggregated using max pooling to form comprehensive
user-level representations. These are further combined with auxiliary
behavioral features and passed through a GraphSAGE model to capture both local
and global patterns in user behavior. Experimental results on the Cresci-15,
Cresci-17, and PAN 2019 datasets demonstrate the robustness of our approach,
achieving accuracies of 99.8%, 99.1%, and 96.8%, respectively, and highlighting

Main category: cs.SI

TL;DR: The paper introduces GDHME, a spatiotemporal model using human mobility data for urban sensing, built with self-supervised learning. It's validated on a multi-task benchmark and deployed in a real-world system.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing human mobility analysis methods inadequately model spatiotemporal dynamics and lack versatility for diverse applications.

Method: The paper introduces the GDHME framework relying on large mobility data, dynamic graph representation, continuous-time encoding, and a self-supervised autoregressive task.

Result: The GDHME framework effectively learns node features from substantial data volumes and is validated using a multi-task benchmark.

Conclusion: GDHME advances urban sensing by providing a versatile and efficient spatiotemporal model for diverse mobility-related tasks, showcased through its deployment in a real system.

Abstract: As a window for urban sensing, human mobility contains rich spatiotemporal
information that reflects both residents' behavior preferences and the
functions of urban areas. The analysis of human mobility has attracted the
attention of many researchers. However, existing methods often address specific
tasks from a particular perspective, leading to insufficient modeling of human
mobility and limited applicability of the learned knowledge in various
downstream applications. To address these challenges, this paper proposes to
push massive amounts of human mobility data into a spatiotemporal model,
discover latent semantics behind mobility behavior and support various urban
sensing tasks. Specifically, a large-scale and widely covering human mobility
data is collected through the ubiquitous base station system and a framework
named General-purpose and Dynamic Human Mobility Embedding (GDHME) for urban
sensing is introduced. The framework follows the self-supervised learning idea
and contains two major stages. In stage 1, GDHME treats people and regions as
nodes within a dynamic graph, unifying human mobility data as
people-region-time interactions. An encoder operating in continuous-time
dynamically computes evolving node representations, capturing dynamic states
for both people and regions. Moreover, an autoregressive self-supervised task
is specially designed to guide the learning of the general-purpose node
embeddings. In stage 2, these representations are utilized to support various
tasks. To evaluate the effectiveness of our GDHME framework, we further
construct a multi-task urban sensing benchmark. Offline experiments demonstrate
GDHME's ability to automatically learn valuable node features from vast amounts
of data. Furthermore, our framework is used to deploy the JiuTian ChuanLiu Big
Model, a system that has been presented at the 2023 China Mobile Worldwide
Partner Conference.

*Michail Dadopoulos,Anestis Ladas,Stratos Moschidis,Ioannis Negkakis*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: The paper proposes and evaluates a novel multi-stage RAG architecture leveraging LLM-generated metadata to enhance financial document retrieval and generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in financial filings such as sparse and cross-referenced evidence which limits conventional RAG systems.

Method: Advanced metadata-driven techniques, including pre-retrieval filtering, post-retrieval reranking, and enriched embeddings embedded into a multi-stage LLM-driven architecture.

Result: Significant performance improvements were achieved by embedding chunk metadata with text and leveraging pre-retrieval optimizations, outperforming commercial reranking solutions.

Conclusion: The study provides an efficient and cost-effective approach to developing metadata-driven RAG systems for structured financial documents, establishing a practical trade-off between performance and efficiency.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) struggles on long, structured financial
filings where relevant evidence is sparse and cross-referenced. This paper
presents a systematic investigation of advanced metadata-driven
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) techniques, proposing and evaluating a
novel, multi-stage RAG architecture that leverages LLM-generated metadata. We
introduce a sophisticated indexing pipeline to create contextually rich
document chunks and benchmark a spectrum of enhancements, including
pre-retrieval filtering, post-retrieval reranking, and enriched embeddings,
benchmarked on the FinanceBench dataset. Our results reveal that while a
powerful reranker is essential for precision, the most significant performance
gains come from embedding chunk metadata directly with text ("contextual
chunks"). Our proposed optimal architecture combines LLM-driven pre-retrieval
optimizations with these contextual embeddings to achieve superior performance.
Additionally, we present a custom metadata reranker that offers a compelling,
cost-effective alternative to commercial solutions, highlighting a practical
trade-off between peak performance and operational efficiency. This study
provides a blueprint for building robust, metadata-aware RAG systems for
financial document analysis.

*Xiaoyu Kong,Leheng Sheng,Junfei Tan,Yuxin Chen,Jiancan Wu,An Zhang,Xiang Wang,Xiangnan He*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: This paper introduces MiniOneRec, the first open-source generative recommendation framework, validated to scale effectively on public benchmarks, offering enhanced ranking accuracy and candidate diversity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore scaling laws for recommender systems using generative paradigms and address the lack of open-source industrial deployments.

Method: MiniOneRec employs Residual Quantized VAE for SID generation, supervised fine-tuning, and reinforcement learning with constrained decoding and hybrid rewards.

Result: Experiments show improved efficiency with increasing model size, reduced training and evaluation losses, and enhanced accuracy and diversity via post-training methods.

Conclusion: Generative approaches, exemplified by MiniOneRec, are effective for scaling recommender systems in terms of performance and scalability, leveraging modern lightweight post-training pipelines.

Abstract: The recent success of large language models (LLMs) has renewed interest in
whether recommender systems can achieve similar scaling benefits. Conventional
recommenders, dominated by massive embedding tables, tend to plateau as
embedding dimensions grow. In contrast, the emerging generative paradigm
replaces embeddings with compact Semantic ID (SID) sequences produced by
autoregressive Transformers. Yet most industrial deployments remain
proprietary, leaving two fundamental questions open: (1) Do the expected
scaling laws hold on public benchmarks? (2) What is the minimal post-training
recipe that enables competitive performance?
  We present MiniOneRec, to the best of our knowledge, the first fully
open-source generative recommendation framework, which provides an end-to-end
workflow spanning SID construction, supervised fine-tuning, and
recommendation-oriented reinforcement learning. We generate SIDs via a Residual
Quantized VAE and post-train Qwen backbones ranging from 0.5B to 7B parameters
on the Amazon Review dataset. Our experiments reveal a consistent downward
trend in both training and evaluation losses with increasing model size,
validating the parameter efficiency of the generative approach. To further
enhance performance, we propose a lightweight yet effective post-training
pipeline that (1) enforces full-process SID alignment and (2) applies
reinforcement learning with constrained decoding and hybrid rewards. Together,
these techniques yield significant improvements in both ranking accuracy and
candidate diversity.

*Arman Zadgar,Somayeh Fallah,Farshid Mehrdoust*

Main category: math.AP

TL;DR: This paper discusses using deep learning to improve the computational efficiency and accuracy of calibrating the Heston stochastic volatility model for option pricing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Calibrating the Heston stochastic volatility model is computationally challenging and prone to errors due to nonlinear structure and high-dimensional parameters.

Method: The authors propose a hybrid deep learning framework using two supervised neural networks: the Price Approximator Network and the Calibration Correction Network.

Result: Experimental results show this deep learning approach surpasses traditional calibration methods in accuracy, speed, and generalization on real S&P 500 option data.

Conclusion: The framework provides a practical, efficient, and robust solution for real-time financial model calibration.

Abstract: The Heston stochastic volatility model is a widely used tool in financial
mathematics for pricing European options. However, its calibration remains
computationally intensive and sensitive to local minima due to the model's
nonlinear structure and high-dimensional parameter space. This paper introduces
a hybrid deep learning-based framework that enhances both the computational
efficiency and the accuracy of the calibration procedure. The proposed approach
integrates two supervised feedforward neural networks: the Price Approximator
Network (PAN), which approximates the option price surface based on strike and
moneyness inputs, and the Calibration Correction Network (CCN), which refines
the Heston model's output by correcting systematic pricing errors. Experimental
results on real S\&P 500 option data demonstrate that the deep learning
approach outperforms traditional calibration techniques across multiple error
metrics, achieving faster convergence and superior generalization in both
in-sample and out-of-sample settings. This framework offers a practical and
robust solution for real-time financial model calibration.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Running data analytics queries on serverless workers exhibits efficiency under various scenarios, but existing methods lack robust query planning approaches, creating the need for automated solutions.

Method: Odyssey integrates a query planner, a cost model, and a serverless execution engine. It employs state space pruning heuristics and a novel search algorithm to identify plans that optimize cost and performance.

Result: Odyssey effectively predicts monetary cost and latency and consistently outperforms AWS Athena in terms of cost and/or latency.

Conclusion: Odyssey successfully addresses the challenges of efficient query planning in serverless data analytics, offering improved performance and reduced cost compared to existing solutions.

Abstract: Running data analytics queries on serverless (FaaS) workers has been shown to
be cost- and performance-efficient for a variety of real-world scenarios,
including intermittent query arrival patterns, sudden load spikes and
management challenges that afflict managed VM clusters. Alas, existing
serverless data analytics works focus primarily on the serverless execution
engine and assume the existence of a "good" query execution plan or rely on
user guidance to construct such a plan. Meanwhile, even simple analytics
queries on serverless have a huge space of possible plans, with vast
differences in both performance and cost among plans.
  This paper introduces Odyssey, an end-to-end serverless-native data analytics
pipeline that integrates a query planner, cost model and execution engine.
Odyssey automatically generates and evaluates serverless query plans, utilizing
state space pruning heuristics and a novel search algorithm to identify
Pareto-optimal plans that balance cost and performance with low latency even
for complex queries. Our evaluations demonstrate that Odyssey accurately
predicts both monetary cost and latency, and consistently outperforms AWS

### [399] [Self-supervised Synthetic Pretraining for Inference of Stellar Mass Embedded in Dense Gas](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24159)
*Keiya Hirashima,Shingo Nozaki,Naoto Harada*

Main category: astro-ph.GA

TL;DR: The study uses self-supervised pretrained vision transformers to address stellar mass estimation challenges in star-forming regions, showing improvement over supervised methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Estimating stellar mass in star-forming regions is difficult due to obscuration by dense gas and highly inhomogeneous regions, making conventional methods unreliable.

Method: The paper pretrained a vision transformer using DINOv2 on synthetic fractal images and applied it to limited high-resolution magneto-hydrodynamical simulations to predict stellar mass.

Result: The pretrained model demonstrated better performance than supervised models and enabled unsupervised segmentation of star-forming structures, revealing meaningful features through PCA analysis.

Conclusion: Self-supervised pretraining on synthetic data enhances machine learning models for stellar mass prediction and provides insights into star-forming regions without requiring labeled data.

Abstract: Stellar mass is a fundamental quantity that determines the properties and
evolution of stars. However, estimating stellar masses in star-forming regions
is challenging because young stars are obscured by dense gas and the regions
are highly inhomogeneous, making spherical dynamical estimates unreliable.
Supervised machine learning could link such complex structures to stellar mass,
but it requires large, high-quality labeled datasets from high-resolution
magneto-hydrodynamical (MHD) simulations, which are computationally expensive.
We address this by pretraining a vision transformer on one million synthetic
fractal images using the self-supervised framework DINOv2, and then applying
the frozen model to limited high-resolution MHD simulations. Our results
demonstrate that synthetic pretraining improves frozen-feature regression
stellar mass predictions, with the pretrained model performing slightly better
than a supervised model trained on the same limited simulations. Principal
component analysis of the extracted features further reveals semantically
meaningful structures, suggesting that the model enables unsupervised
segmentation of star-forming regions without the need for labeled data or
fine-tuning.

*Nishant Doshi*

TL;DR: This paper proposes an efficient method for learning optimal multi-agent plans using LTL, Buchi Automata, and reinforcement learning, with a novel reward shaping approach to improve sample complexity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the challenge of accelerated learning for optimal plans in multi-agent systems represented with Linear Temporal Logic (LTL). It seeks to overcome the challenges associated with exponential sample complexity and large state-action spaces in such systems.

Method: The authors convert task specifications into Buchi Automata to construct a product Semi Markov Decision Process (SMDP) on-the-fly, enabling model-free reinforcement learning. They introduce a novel reward shaping approach to mitigate sample complexity and enhance convergence.

Result: The proposed algorithm, tested in a deterministic gridworld simulation, shows reduced convergence times due to reward shaping and demonstrates the increasing relevance of using options as state-action spaces grow.

Conclusion: The approach effectively accelerates learning of correct-by-design controllers for multi-agent systems using model-free reinforcement learning and reward shaping, making it highly scalable for complex environments.

Abstract: This paper presents an approach for accelerated learning of optimal plans for
a given task represented using Linear Temporal Logic (LTL) in multi-agent
systems. Given a set of options (temporally abstract actions) available to each
agent, we convert the task specification into the corresponding Buchi Automaton
and proceed with a model-free approach which collects transition samples and
constructs a product Semi Markov Decision Process (SMDP) on-the-fly.
Value-based Reinforcement Learning algorithms can then be used to synthesize a
correct-by-design controller without learning the underlying transition model
of the multi-agent system. The exponential sample complexity due to multiple
agents is dealt with using a novel reward shaping approach. We test the
proposed algorithm in a deterministic gridworld simulation for different tasks
and find that the reward shaping results in significant reduction in
convergence times. We also infer that using options becomes increasing more
relevant as the state and action space increases in multi-agent systems.

*Maria G. Mendoza,Addison Kalanther,Daniel Bostwick,Emma Stephan,Chinmay Maheshwari,Shankar Sastry*

Main category: cs.MA

TL;DR: This paper introduces a multi-agent framework using UAVs to assist evacuations, employing advanced decision-making under stress and uncertainty.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Autonomous drones are underutilized in dynamic real-time evacuations due to the neglect of psychological and emotional factors influencing human behavior.

Method: The study models evacuation as a POMDP using two UAV agents (HLR and LLR) and employs the PPO algorithm with recurrent policies for decision-making.

Result: Simulation results show UAVs effectively locate and guide evacuees to safety, improving evacuation times.

Conclusion: Autonomous UAV coordination enhances evacuation outcomes significantly by addressing human behavior complexities and environmental uncertainties.

Abstract: Autonomous drone technology holds significant promise for enhancing search
and rescue operations during evacuations by guiding humans toward safety and
supporting broader emergency response efforts. However, their application in
dynamic, real-time evacuation support remains limited. Existing models often
overlook the psychological and emotional complexity of human behavior under
extreme stress. In real-world fire scenarios, evacuees frequently deviate from
designated safe routes due to panic and uncertainty. To address these
challenges, this paper presents a multi-agent coordination framework in which
autonomous Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) assist human evacuees in real-time
by locating, intercepting, and guiding them to safety under uncertain
conditions. We model the problem as a Partially Observable Markov Decision
Process (POMDP), where two heterogeneous UAV agents, a high-level rescuer (HLR)
and a low-level rescuer (LLR), coordinate through shared observations and
complementary capabilities. Human behavior is captured using an agent-based
model grounded in empirical psychology, where panic dynamically affects
decision-making and movement in response to environmental stimuli. The
environment features stochastic fire spread, unknown evacuee locations, and
limited visibility, requiring UAVs to plan over long horizons to search for
humans and adapt in real-time. Our framework employs the Proximal Policy
Optimization (PPO) algorithm with recurrent policies to enable robust
decision-making in partially observable settings. Simulation results
demonstrate that the UAV team can rapidly locate and intercept evacuees,
significantly reducing the time required for them to reach safety compared to
scenarios without UAV assistance.

Motivation: Antibody sequence-structure-function relationships are crucial for therapeutic and research advancements.

Method: Develop ML models combining structural data (via graph representations) with neural networks.

Result: Frameworks ANTIPASTI and INFUSSE predict binding affinity and residue flexibility respectively.

Conclusion: Incorporating structural information in ML models offers insights into molecular mechanisms and enhances prediction accuracy.

Abstract: Understanding the relationship between antibody sequence, structure and
function is essential for the design of antibody-based therapeutics and
research tools. Recently, machine learning (ML) models mostly based on the
application of large language models to sequence information have been
developed to predict antibody properties. Yet there are open directions to
incorporate structural information, not only to enhance prediction but also to
offer insights into the underlying molecular mechanisms. This chapter provides
an overview of these approaches and describes two ML frameworks that integrate
structural data (via graph representations) with neural networks to predict
properties of antibodies: ANTIPASTI predicts binding affinity (a global
property) whereas INFUSSE predicts residue flexibility (a local property). We
survey the principles underpinning these models; the ways in which they encode
structural knowledge; and the strategies that can be used to extract
biologically relevant statistical signals that can help discover and
disentangle molecular determinants of the properties of interest.

Motivation: To improve metastasis risk prediction models by incorporating patient-specific regulatory mechanisms, addressing the limitations of shallow architectures in precision oncology.

Method: Combining classical machine learning models (ElasticNet, Random Forest, XGBoost) with graph-based deep learning (GNN via GATv2) to analyze personalized gene regulatory networks.

Result: XGBoost achieved the highest AUROC of 0.7051, while the graph neural network captured non-linear dependencies specific to individual patients.

Conclusion: The integration of graph-based deep learning with traditional techniques offers a scalable and interpretable approach to predicting metastatic risk, suggesting enhancements in precision oncology applications.

Abstract: Metastasis is the leading cause of cancer-related mortality, yet most
predictive models rely on shallow architectures and neglect patient-specific
regulatory mechanisms. Here, we integrate classical machine learning and deep
learning to predict metastatic potential across multiple cancer types. Gene
expression profiles from the Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia were combined with a
transcription factor-target prior from DoRothEA, focusing on nine
metastasis-associated regulators. After selecting differential genes using the
Kruskal-Wallis test, ElasticNet, Random Forest, and XGBoost models were trained
for benchmarking. Personalized gene regulatory networks were then constructed
using PANDA and LIONESS and analyzed through a graph attention neural network
(GATv2) to learn topological and expression-based representations. While
XGBoost achieved the highest AUROC (0.7051), the GNN captured non-linear
regulatory dependencies at the patient level. These results demonstrate that
combining traditional machine learning with graph-based deep learning enables a
scalable and interpretable framework for metastasis risk prediction in
precision oncology.

TL;DR: The paper introduces Local Momentum Tracking (LMT), a communication-efficient distributed optimization method that achieves linear speedup and optimal complexity properties.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address the communication overhead problem in distributed optimization by enabling multiple local updates between communication rounds.

Method: LMT integrates momentum tracking and Loopless Chebyshev Acceleration (LCA) techniques, allowing agents to perform multiple updates locally before communicating.

Result: LMT achieves linear speedup concerning the number of updates and agents. It attains optimal communication complexity for sufficient local updates and optimal iteration complexity for moderate updates.

Conclusion: LMT is a pioneering method combining local practicality and theoretical optimality in distributed stochastic gradient optimization.

Abstract: We propose Local Momentum Tracking (LMT), a novel distributed stochastic
gradient method for solving distributed optimization problems over networks. To
reduce communication overhead, LMT enables each agent to perform multiple local
updates between consecutive communication rounds. Specifically, LMT integrates
local updates with the momentum tracking strategy and the Loopless Chebyshev
Acceleration (LCA) technique. We demonstrate that LMT achieves linear speedup
with respect to the number of local updates as well as the number of agents for
minimizing smooth objective functions. Moreover, with sufficiently many local
updates ($Q\geq Q^*$), LMT attains the optimal communication complexity. For a
moderate number of local updates ($Q\in[1,Q^*]$), it achieves the optimal
iteration complexity. To our knowledge, LMT is the first method that enjoys
such properties.

TL;DR: A neural network method directly derives exact closed-form solutions for quadratic programming problems with linear constraints without training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address the challenge of ensuring solution optimality and feasibility in deep neural networks applied to complex optimization problems.

Method: The paper proposes deriving neural network parameters analytically from problem coefficients, leveraging the piecewise linear behavior of ReLU-based neural networks to model multiparametric quadratic programming solutions.

Result: The proposed approach outperformed trained neural networks and was competitive with the commercial solver Gurobi for computational cost and accuracy, while solving large-scale optimization problems efficiently.

Conclusion: This closed-form neural network method is a promising alternative to traditional, trained models for optimization, offering accurate and computationally efficient solutions.

Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) have been used to model complex optimization
problems in many applications, yet have difficulty guaranteeing solution
optimality and feasibility, despite training on large datasets. Training a NN
as a surrogate optimization solver amounts to estimating a global solution
function that maps varying problem input parameters to the corresponding
optimal solutions. Work in multiparametric programming (mp) has shown that
solutions to quadratic programs (QP) are piece-wise linear functions of the
parameters, and researchers have suggested leveraging this property to model
mp-QP using NN with ReLU activation functions, which also exhibit piecewise
linear behaviour. This paper proposes a NN modeling approach and learning
algorithm that discovers the exact closed-form solution to QP with linear
constraints, by analytically deriving NN model parameters directly from the
problem coefficients without training. Whereas generic DNN cannot guarantee
accuracy outside the training distribution, the closed-form NN model produces
exact solutions for every discovered critical region of the solution function.
To evaluate the closed-form NN model, it was applied to DC optimal power flow
problems in electricity management. In terms of Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT)
optimality and feasibility of solutions, it outperformed a classically trained
DNN and was competitive with, or outperformed, a commercial analytic solver
(Gurobi) at far less computational cost. For a long-range energy planning
problem, it was able to produce optimal and feasible solutions for millions of
input parameters within seconds.

TL;DR: This paper introduces AdaSDBO, a decentralized bilevel optimization algorithm that is fully free of problem-specific parameters and hyperparameter tuning. It adapts using cumulative gradient norms and matches top methods in convergence rate.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The main motivation is to address the challenges in decentralized bilevel optimization, particularly the reliance on prior knowledge of problem parameters which leads to cumbersome hyperparameter tuning.

Method: AdaSDBO utilizes adaptive stepsizes based on cumulative gradient norms in a single-loop structure to update variables simultaneously, negating the need for prior knowledge of problem parameters.

Result: AdaSDBO achieves a convergence rate comparable to state-of-the-art methods, demonstrating competitive performance and robust adaptability to varying stepsize configurations.

Conclusion: AdaSDBO effectively simplifies decentralized bilevel optimization by eliminating hyperparameter tuning, offering theoretically sound convergence rates and robust practical performance.

Abstract: Decentralized bilevel optimization has garnered significant attention due to
its critical role in solving large-scale machine learning problems. However,
existing methods often rely on prior knowledge of problem parameters-such as
smoothness, convexity, or communication network topologies-to determine
appropriate stepsizes. In practice, these problem parameters are typically
unavailable, leading to substantial manual effort for hyperparameter tuning. In
this paper, we propose AdaSDBO, a fully problem-parameter-free algorithm for
decentralized bilevel optimization with a single-loop structure. AdaSDBO
leverages adaptive stepsizes based on cumulative gradient norms to update all
variables simultaneously, dynamically adjusting its progress and eliminating
the need for problem-specific hyperparameter tuning. Through rigorous
theoretical analysis, we establish that AdaSDBO achieves a convergence rate of
$\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}\left(\frac{1}{T}\right)$, matching the performance of
well-tuned state-of-the-art methods up to polylogarithmic factors. Extensive
numerical experiments demonstrate that AdaSDBO delivers competitive performance
compared to existing decentralized bilevel optimization methods while
exhibiting remarkable robustness across diverse stepsize configurations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Bilevel optimization problems are computationally complex, especially when dealing with non-smooth hyper-objectives and Hessian matrix challenges. The paper aims to simplify these challenges and improve computational efficiency.

Method: The authors reformulated the bilevel optimization problem into a single-level problem using penalty and augmented Lagrangian methods and developed the SFLCB algorithm, a single-loop, first-order method.

Result: The proposed SFLCB algorithm achieves improved convergence rates compared to previous double-loop methods, reducing from $O(\epsilon^{-3}\log(\epsilon^{-1}))$ to $O(\epsilon^{-3})$, while experiments confirm its practical efficiency.

Conclusion: This paper successfully simplifies linearly constrained bilevel optimization with a reformulated approach and achieves faster convergence through the SFLCB algorithm, supported by strong theoretical guarantees and practical experiments.

Abstract: We study bilevel optimization problems where the lower-level problems are
strongly convex and have coupled linear constraints. To overcome the potential
non-smoothness of the hyper-objective and the computational challenges
associated with the Hessian matrix, we utilize penalty and augmented Lagrangian
methods to reformulate the original problem as a single-level one. Especially,
we establish a strong theoretical connection between the reformulated function
and the original hyper-objective by characterizing the closeness of their
values and derivatives. Based on this reformulation, we propose a single-loop,
first-order algorithm for linearly constrained bilevel optimization (SFLCB). We
provide rigorous analyses of its non-asymptotic convergence rates, showing an
improvement over prior double-loop algorithms -- form
$O(\epsilon^{-3}\log(\epsilon^{-1}))$ to $O(\epsilon^{-3})$. The experiments
corroborate our theoretical findings and demonstrate the practical efficiency
of the proposed SFLCB algorithm. Simulation code is provided at

Main category: math.OC

TL;DR: This paper proves the non-singularity of the gradient descent (GD) map on realistic neural network architectures, ensuring GD avoids saddle points and converges effectively for most step-sizes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The assumption that GD avoids saddle points and maxima has been central but required restrictive conditions. The paper aims to address this gap by investigating non-singularity in realistic neural networks.

Method: The authors analyze the GD map function on neural network weights and biases and provide theoretical proof of non-singularity for fully connected, convolutional, attention layers, and analytic activation functions.

Result: The paper successfully proves the non-singularity of GD map for practical architectures and most step-sizes, supporting convergence to global minima in these scenarios.

Conclusion: This research enhances understanding of GD dynamics in neural networks, ensuring broader applicability and encouraging exploration of modern machine learning frameworks.

Abstract: The theory of training deep networks has become a central question of modern
machine learning and has inspired many practical advancements. In particular,
the gradient descent (GD) optimization algorithm has been extensively studied
in recent years. A key assumption about GD has appeared in several recent
works: the \emph{GD map is non-singular} -- it preserves sets of measure zero
under preimages. Crucially, this assumption has been used to prove that GD
avoids saddle points and maxima, and to establish the existence of a computable
quantity that determines the convergence to global minima (both for GD and
stochastic GD). However, the current literature either assumes the
non-singularity of the GD map or imposes restrictive assumptions, such as
Lipschitz smoothness of the loss (for example, Lipschitzness does not hold for
deep ReLU networks with the cross-entropy loss) and restricts the analysis to
GD with small step-sizes. In this paper, we investigate the neural network map
as a function on the space of weights and biases. We also prove, for the first
time, the non-singularity of the gradient descent (GD) map on the loss
landscape of realistic neural network architectures (with fully connected,
convolutional, or softmax attention layers) and piecewise analytic activations

work significantly extends the existing results on the convergence of GD and
SGD by guaranteeing that they apply to practical neural network settings and

*Nicola Tuccari,Eva Sciacca,Yolanda Becerra,Enric Sosa Cintero,Emiliano Tramontana*

Main category: astro-ph.IM

TL;DR: The paper addresses the challenge of handling large data volumes in Astronomy & Cosmology by presenting an in-situ processing approach using Hecuba for real-time visualization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Simulations and observations in Astronomy & Cosmology generate massive datasets, posing challenges for storage, access, and analysis. Current methods reliant on disk storage limit performance, necessitating innovative solutions.

Method: The study integrates Hecuba, a distributed database framework, with ChaNGa, a cosmological simulator, enabling on-line visualization through tools like ParaView and VisIVO.

Result: The approach successfully enables real-time visualization of N-body simulation results, bypassing traditional data storage bottlenecks.

Conclusion: The proposed method addresses high-performance computing challenges by allowing concurrent simulation, analysis, and visualization for large-scale A&C datasets.

Abstract: Modern simulations and observations in Astronomy & Cosmology (A&C) produce
massively large data volumes, posing significant challenges for storage, access
and data analysis. A long-standing bottleneck in high-performance computing,
especially now in the exascale era, has been the requirement to write these
large datasets to disks, which limits the performance. A promising solution to
this challenge is in-situ processing, where analysis and visualization are
performed concurrently with the simulation itself, bypassing the storage of the
simulation data. In this work, we present new results from an approach for
in-situ processing based on Hecuba, a framework that provides a highly
distributed database for streaming A&C simulation data directly into the
visualization pipeline to make possible on-line visualization. By integrating
Hecuba with the high-performance cosmological simulator ChaNGa, we enable
real-time, in-situ visualization of N-body simulation results using tools such
as ParaView and VisIVO.

Main category: astro-ph.IM

TL;DR: The paper addresses the challenge of managing and visualizing large-scale Astronomy & Cosmology simulation data using in-situ visualization techniques. It integrates the Hecuba platform with Changa for online visualization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The growing size of Astronomy & Cosmology simulation and observational data makes effective analysis and visualization increasingly challenging. Direct storage of results is inefficient, and visualization requires data filtering.

Method: The authors use the Hecuba framework to enable streaming of simulation data for concurrent analysis and visualization. It integrates Hecuba with Changa and employs tools like ParaView and VisIVO for in-situ visualization.

Result: The approach demonstrates efficient visualization of petascale N-body simulation data without storing the full results.

Conclusion: Integrating in-situ visualization tools with distributed database frameworks like Hecuba is a promising solution for handling large-scale simulation data in Astronomy & Cosmology.

Abstract: The Astronomy & Cosmology (A&C) community is presently witnessing an
unprecedented growth in the quality and quantity of data coming from
simulations and observations. Writing results of numerical simulations to disk
files has long been a bottleneck in high-performance computing. To access
effectively and extract the scientific content of such large-scale data sets
appropriate tools and techniques are needed. This is especially true for
visualization tools, where petascale data size problems cannot be visualized
without some data filtering, which reduces either the resolution or the amount
of data volume managed by the visualization tool.
  A solution to this problem is to run the analysis and visualization
concurrently (in-situ) with the simulation and bypass the storage of the full
results. In particular we use Hecuba, a framework offering a highly distributed
database to stream A\&C simulation data for on-line visualization. We will
demonstrate the Hecuba platform integration with the Changa high performant
cosmological simulator and the in-situ visualization of its N-body results with
the ParaView and VisIVO tools.

### [411] [In Search of the Unknown Unknowns: A Multi-Metric Distance Ensemble for Out of Distribution Anomaly Detection in Astronomical Surveys](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23702)
*Siddharth Chaini,Federica B. Bianco,Ashish Mahabal*

Main category: astro-ph.IM

TL;DR: The paper presents a novel anomaly detection method, DiMMAD, which utilizes an ensemble of distance metrics, overcoming limitations of single-metric approaches in high-dimensional spaces for enhanced scientific discovery in astronomy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Distance-based anomaly detection often relies on a single user-defined distance metric, posing challenges in high-dimensional feature spaces such as in astronomy.

Method: DiMMAD uses a robust ensemble of diverse distance metrics, interpreting them as different geometries in feature space, to create an anomaly score independent of a single metric definition.

Result: The method excels at detecting out-of-distribution anomalies, facilitates discovery of diverse new classes, and performs comparably to state-of-the-art methods for rare in-distribution anomalies with potential improved interpretability.

Conclusion: DiMMAD offers a robust and interpretable approach for anomaly detection in astronomical data using a multi-metric ensemble, advancing both anomaly detection performance and scientific discovery.

Abstract: Distance-based methods involve the computation of distance values between
features and are a well-established paradigm in machine learning. In anomaly
detection, anomalies are identified by their large distance from normal data
points. However, the performance of these methods often hinges on a single,
user-selected distance metric (e.g., Euclidean), which may not be optimal for
the complex, high-dimensional feature spaces common in astronomy. Here, we
introduce a novel anomaly detection method, Distance Multi-Metric Anomaly
Detection (DiMMAD), which uses an ensemble of distance metrics to find
novelties.
  Using multiple distance metrics is effectively equivalent to using different
geometries in the feature space. By using a robust ensemble of diverse distance
metrics, we overcome the metric-selection problem, creating an anomaly score
that is not reliant on any single definition of distance. We demonstrate this
multi-metric approach as a tool for simple, interpretable scientific discovery
on astronomical time series -- (1) with simulated data for the upcoming Vera C.
Rubin Observatory Legacy Survey of Space and Time, and (2) real data from the
Zwicky Transient Facility.
  We find that DiMMAD excels at out-of-distribution anomaly detection --
anomalies in the data that might be new classes -- and beats other
state-of-the-art methods in the goal of maximizing the diversity of new classes
discovered. For rare in-distribution anomaly detection, DiMMAD performs
similarly to other methods, but may allow for improved interpretability. All
our code is open source: DiMMAD is implemented within DistClassiPy:
https://github.com/sidchaini/distclassipy/, while all code to reproduce the
results of this paper is available here: https://github.com/sidchaini/dimmad/.

*John F. Wu,Michael Walmsley*

Main category: astro-ph.IM

TL;DR: Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) are effective at extracting interpretable features from neural networks for galaxy morphology analysis, outperforming PCA.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improve feature identification in galaxy morphology using advanced neural network techniques.

Method: Used Sparse Autoencoders on Euclid Q1 images with supervised (Zoobot) and self-supervised (MAE) models, also compared to PCA.

Result: SAEs identified interpretable features outside human-defined classification systems and aligned stronger with Galaxy Zoo labels.

Conclusion: SAEs are promising for uncovering novel astrophysical phenomena beyond current classification frameworks.

Abstract: Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) can efficiently identify candidate monosemantic
features from pretrained neural networks for galaxy morphology. We demonstrate
this on Euclid Q1 images using both supervised (Zoobot) and new self-supervised
(MAE) models. Our publicly released MAE achieves superhuman image
reconstruction performance. While a Principal Component Analysis (PCA) on the
supervised model primarily identifies features already aligned with the Galaxy
Zoo decision tree, SAEs can identify interpretable features outside of this
framework. SAE features also show stronger alignment than PCA with Galaxy Zoo
labels. Although challenges in interpretability remain, SAEs provide a powerful
engine for discovering astrophysical phenomena beyond the confines of
human-defined classification.

*Ovi Sarkar,Md Shafiuzzaman,Md. Faysal Ahamed,Golam Mahmud,Muhammad E. H. Chowdhury*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: This paper introduces MSRANetV2, a deep learning model for colorectal tissue image classification, achieving high performance metrics and interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Colorectal cancer diagnosis is critical to patient outcomes, but current methods are subjective, time-consuming, and prone to variability. The paper aims to address these challenges by leveraging digital pathology and advanced deep learning.

Method: MSRANetV2 uses a ResNet50V2 backbone combined with residual attention mechanisms and squeeze-and-excitation blocks for feature extraction. Multi-scale feature fusion techniques enhance classification robustness. The model's performance was evaluated on CRC-VAL-HE-7K and NCT-CRC-HE-100K datasets using stratified cross-validation.

Result: MSRANetV2 achieved high Precision, Recall, F1-score, AUC, and test accuracy, with values near-perfect across two CRC datasets (7K and 100K). Grad-CAM visualizations aided interpretability of tissue region relevance.

Conclusion: MSRANetV2 is a reliable, interpretable, and high-performing model for colorectal cancer tissue classification, offering advancements in diagnostic precision and efficiency.

Abstract: Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a leading worldwide cause of cancer-related
mortality, and the role of prompt precise detection is of paramount interest in
improving patient outcomes. Conventional diagnostic methods such as colonoscopy
and histological examination routinely exhibit subjectivity, are extremely
time-consuming, and are susceptible to variation. Through the development of
digital pathology, deep learning algorithms have become a powerful approach in
enhancing diagnostic precision and efficiency. In our work, we proposed a
convolutional neural network architecture named MSRANetV2, specially optimized
for the classification of colorectal tissue images. The model employs a
ResNet50V2 backbone, extended with residual attention mechanisms and
squeeze-and-excitation (SE) blocks, to extract deep semantic and fine-grained
spatial features. With channel alignment and upsampling operations, MSRANetV2
effectively fuses multi-scale representations, thereby enhancing the robustness
of the classification. We evaluated our model on a five-fold stratified
cross-validation strategy on two publicly available datasets: CRC-VAL-HE-7K and
NCT-CRC-HE-100K. The proposed model achieved remarkable average Precision,
recall, F1-score, AUC, and test accuracy were 0.9884 plus-minus 0.0151, 0.9900
plus-minus 0.0151, 0.9900 plus-minus 0.0145, 0.9999 plus-minus 0.00006, and
0.9905 plus-minus 0.0025 on the 7K dataset. On the 100K dataset, they were
0.9904 plus-minus 0.0091, 0.9900 plus-minus 0.0071, 0.9900 plus-minus 0.0071,
0.9997 plus-minus 0.00016, and 0.9902 plus-minus 0.0006. Additionally, Grad-CAM
visualizations were incorporated to enhance model interpretability by
highlighting tissue areas that are medically relevant. These findings validate
that MSRANetV2 is a reliable, interpretable, and high-performing architectural
model for classifying CRC tissues.

*Andreas Hauptmann,Leonid Kunyansky,Jenni Poimala*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: The paper presents novel algorithms that efficiently compute forward and adjoint operators for photoacoustic tomography in circular configurations, significantly optimizing iterative image reconstruction processes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to improve computational efficiency in solving inverse source problems in photoacoustic tomography and related fields, as existing methods require numerous applications of computationally expensive forward and adjoint operators.

Method: The authors developed new asymptotically fast algorithms for evaluating forward and adjoint operators, achieving computational complexity of $O(n^2 \log n)$. These algorithms are used within iterative reconstruction techniques and deep learning-based methods.

Result: Numerical simulations demonstrate the effectiveness of these algorithms in various image reconstruction techniques, including variational methods and deep learning approaches. The algorithms achieve performance improvements in practical applications.

Conclusion: The proposed algorithms provide a significant reduction in computational cost while maintaining accuracy. Their Python implementation is made publicly available for broader adoption and use in research communities.

Abstract: The inverse source problem arising in photoacoustic tomography and in several
other coupled-physics modalities is frequently solved by iterative algorithms.
Such algorithms are based on the minimization of a certain cost functional. In
addition, novel deep learning techniques are currently being investigated to
further improve such optimization approaches. All such methods require multiple
applications of the operator defining the forward problem, and of its adjoint.
In this paper, we present new asymptotically fast algorithms for numerical
evaluation of the forward and adjoint operators, applicable in the circular
acquisition geometry. For an $(n \times n)$ image, our algorithms compute these
operators in $\mathcal{O}(n^2 \log n)$ floating point operations. We
demonstrate the performance of our algorithms in numerical simulations, where
they are used as an integral part of several iterative image reconstruction
techniques: classic variational methods, such as non-negative least squares and
total variation regularized least squares, as well as deep learning methods,
such as learned primal dual. A Python implementation of our algorithms and
computational examples is available to the general public.

Main category: astro-ph.CO

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel emulator to connect different simulators using flow-based learning and achieves reliable results in weak lensing simulation tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a need for connecting two different simulation frameworks with unpaired datasets while preserving the underlying data structure.

Method: The authors leverage flow-based likelihood transport, applying Conditional Optimal Transport Flow Matching (COT-FM) to minimize distortion during mapping between simulators.

Result: The new emulator successfully bridges weak lensing simulators (LPT to PM) and accurately enables full-field inference, surpassing traditional methods relying solely on summary statistics.

Conclusion: The proposed emulator effectively transforms between simulators and validates accuracy, providing a robust tool for simulation-based posterior inference applications.

Abstract: We propose a new field-level emulator that bridges two simulators using
unpaired simulation datasets. Our method leverages a flow-based approach to
learn the likelihood transport from one simulator to the other. Since multiple
transport maps exist, we employ Conditional Optimal Transport Flow Matching
(COT-FM) to ensure that the transformation minimally distorts the underlying
structure of the data. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach by
bridging weak lensing simulators: a Lagrangian Perturbation Theory (LPT) to a
N-body Particle-Mesh (PM). We demonstrate that our emulator captures the full
correction between the simulators by showing that it enables full-field
inference to accurately recover the true posterior, validating its accuracy
beyond traditional summary statistics.

*Ziyi Fang,Lingxiao Huang,Runkai Yang*

Main category: cs.DS

TL;DR: The paper improves coreset construction techniques for solving the robust geometric median problem and extends these methods to clustering tasks, while significantly reducing reliance on data with outliers and demonstrating better tradeoffs empirically.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a need to address the robust geometric median problem by constructing efficient coresets that handle outlier influence better, ensuring more scalable, accurate solutions for large datasets.

Method: The authors introduced a non-component-wise error analysis strategy and constructed coresets of reduced size using innovative techniques to reduce dependence on outlier counts.

Result: The paper achieved coreset constructions without $O(m)$ dependency, minimized size for $d=1$, extended results to $(k,z)$-clustering in metric spaces, and showcased empirical improvements in accuracy-runtime tradeoffs.

Conclusion: Advancements in coreset construction have led to practical improvements in handling robust geometric median and clustering tasks, with reduced influence of outliers and better scalability.

Abstract: We study the robust geometric median problem in Euclidean space
$\mathbb{R}^d$, with a focus on coreset construction.A coreset is a compact
summary of a dataset $P$ of size $n$ that approximates the robust cost for all
centers $c$ within a multiplicative error $\varepsilon$. Given an outlier count
$m$, we construct a coreset of size $\tilde{O}(\varepsilon^{-2} \cdot
\min\{\varepsilon^{-2}, d\})$ when $n \geq 4m$, eliminating the $O(m)$
dependency present in prior work [Huang et al., 2022 & 2023]. For the special
case of $d = 1$, we achieve an optimal coreset size of
$\tilde{\Theta}(\varepsilon^{-1/2} + \frac{m}{n} \varepsilon^{-1})$, revealing
a clear separation from the vanilla case studied in [Huang et al., 2023;
Afshani and Chris, 2024]. Our results further extend to robust
$(k,z)$-clustering in various metric spaces, eliminating the $m$-dependence
under mild data assumptions. The key technical contribution is a novel
non-component-wise error analysis, enabling substantial reduction of outlier
influence, unlike prior methods that retain them.Empirically, our algorithms
consistently outperform existing baselines in terms of size-accuracy tradeoffs
and runtime, even when data assumptions are violated across a wide range of
datasets.

Motivation: Current Tsetlin Machines struggle with speech tasks and require enhancements in accuracy, design efficiency, and energy consumption.

Method: Introduces feature extraction through MFSC-SF and spectral convolution, compresses model using OG-BCSR, and deploys energy-efficient hardware architecture.

Result: Achieves competitive 87.35% accuracy for 12-keyword spotting, 9.84× model size reduction, and ultra-low power hardware consumption of 16.58 μW.

Conclusion: Tsetlin Machines, with the TsetlinKWS framework, demonstrate significant advancements in performing ultra-low-power keyword recognition effectively.

Abstract: The Tsetlin Machine (TM) has recently attracted attention as a low-power
alternative to neural networks due to its simple and interpretable inference
mechanisms. However, its performance on speech-related tasks remains limited.
This paper proposes TsetlinKWS, the first algorithm-hardware co-design
framework for the Convolutional Tsetlin Machine (CTM) on the 12-keyword
spotting task. Firstly, we introduce a novel Mel-Frequency Spectral Coefficient
and Spectral Flux (MFSC-SF) feature extraction scheme together with spectral
convolution, enabling the CTM to reach its first-ever competitive accuracy of
87.35% on the 12-keyword spotting task. Secondly, we develop an Optimized
Grouped Block-Compressed Sparse Row (OG-BCSR) algorithm that achieves a
remarkable 9.84$\times$ reduction in model size, significantly improving the
storage efficiency on CTMs. Finally, we propose a state-driven architecture
tailored for the CTM, which simultaneously exploits data reuse and sparsity to
achieve high energy efficiency. The full system is evaluated in 65 nm process
technology, consuming 16.58 $\mu$W at 0.7 V with a compact 0.63 mm$^2$ core
area. TsetlinKWS requires only 907k logic operations per inference,
representing a 10$\times$ reduction compared to the state-of-the-art KWS
accelerators, positioning the CTM as a highly-efficient candidate for
ultra-low-power speech applications.

*Harshavardhana T. Gowda,Lee M. Miller*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: The study introduces a neuromuscular speech interface that translates EMG signals from orofacial muscles into audio using self-supervised speech representations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the use of electromyographic signals from muscles for direct speech synthesis, bypassing traditional articulatory models and vocoder training.

Method: The paper utilizes self-supervised speech representations to reveal their correlation with EMG signals and proposes a system mapping EMG data directly to speech synthesis.

Result: The proposed method demonstrated structured clustering of EMG power for different gestures, with direct and effective speech synthesis without requiring explicit articulatory models.

Conclusion: Self-supervised speech models inherently encode articulatory mechanisms, enabling novel EMG-to-speech interfaces and promising advancements in speech synthesis.

Abstract: We present a neuromuscular speech interface that translates electromyographic
(EMG) signals collected from orofacial muscles during speech articulation
directly into audio. We show that self-supervised speech (SS) representations
exhibit a strong linear relationship with the electrical power of muscle action
potentials: SS features can be linearly mapped to EMG power with a correlation
of $r = 0.85$. Moreover, EMG power vectors corresponding to different
articulatory gestures form structured and separable clusters in feature space.
This relationship: $\text{SS features}$ $\xrightarrow{\texttt{linear mapping}}$
$\text{EMG power}$ $\xrightarrow{\texttt{gesture-specific clustering}}$
$\text{articulatory movements}$, highlights that SS models implicitly encode
articulatory mechanisms. Leveraging this property, we directly map EMG signals
to SS feature space and synthesize speech, enabling end-to-end EMG-to-speech
generation without explicit articulatory models and vocoder training.

TL;DR: The paper introduces STAR-Bench, a benchmark for fine-grained audio 4D intelligence focusing on sound dynamics in time and 3D space, revealing limitations in existing models' perceptual reasoning capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of benchmarks testing fine-grained perceptual reasoning over dynamic sound information, not just semantics recoverable from text captions.

Method: Developed STAR-Bench with two settings: Foundational Acoustic Perception (six attributes in absolute/relative modes) and Holistic Spatio-Temporal Reasoning (audio segment reordering, spatial tasks). Utilized procedurally synthesized/physics-simulated audio and human-validated high-quality data.

Result: STAR-Bench caused significant accuracy loss in models when relying solely on caption-based reasoning (-31.5% temporal, -35.2% spatial), showcasing its challenge for linguistically hard-to-describe cues. Human performance still outperforms all 19 tested models.

Conclusion: STAR-Bench highlights the gap in current Multi-modal and Audio-Language Models' abilities compared to human cognition. It identifies capability hierarchies and acts as a guide for building models with stronger understanding of the physical world.

Abstract: Despite rapid progress in Multi-modal Large Language Models and Large
Audio-Language Models, existing audio benchmarks largely test semantics that
can be recovered from text captions, masking deficits in fine-grained
perceptual reasoning. We formalize audio 4D intelligence that is defined as
reasoning over sound dynamics in time and 3D space, and introduce STAR-Bench to
measure it. STAR-Bench combines a Foundational Acoustic Perception setting (six
attributes under absolute and relative regimes) with a Holistic Spatio-Temporal
Reasoning setting that includes segment reordering for continuous and discrete
processes and spatial tasks spanning static localization, multi-source
relations, and dynamic trajectories. Our data curation pipeline uses two
methods to ensure high-quality samples. For foundational tasks, we use
procedurally synthesized and physics-simulated audio. For holistic data, we
follow a four-stage process that includes human annotation and final selection
based on human performance. Unlike prior benchmarks where caption-only
answering reduces accuracy slightly, STAR-Bench induces far larger drops
(-31.5\% temporal, -35.2\% spatial), evidencing its focus on linguistically
hard-to-describe cues. Evaluating 19 models reveals substantial gaps compared
with humans and a capability hierarchy: closed-source models are bottlenecked
by fine-grained perception, while open-source models lag across perception,
knowledge, and reasoning. Our STAR-Bench provides critical insights and a clear
path forward for developing future models with a more robust understanding of
the physical world.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve open-domain video-to-audio generation by introducing a more coherent and scalable model-guided approach.

Method: Uses a flow-based Transformer, dual-role alignment mechanism where the encoder serves two purposes (conditioning and aligning), and a model-guided training objective for enhanced cross-modal coherence.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on VGGSound benchmarks, substantially outperforming prior methods across metrics such as FAD, FD, IS, and alignment. It generalizes well to UnAV-100.

Conclusion: Model-guided dual-role alignment is a scalable and effective approach for conditional video-to-audio generation, setting new benchmark performance and highlighting its potential.

Abstract: We present MGAudio, a novel flow-based framework for open-domain
video-to-audio generation, which introduces model-guided dual-role alignment as
a central design principle. Unlike prior approaches that rely on
classifier-based or classifier-free guidance, MGAudio enables the generative
model to guide itself through a dedicated training objective designed for
video-conditioned audio generation. The framework integrates three main
components: (1) a scalable flow-based Transformer model, (2) a dual-role
alignment mechanism where the audio-visual encoder serves both as a
conditioning module and as a feature aligner to improve generation quality, and
(3) a model-guided objective that enhances cross-modal coherence and audio
realism. MGAudio achieves state-of-the-art performance on VGGSound, reducing
FAD to 0.40, substantially surpassing the best classifier-free guidance
baselines, and consistently outperforms existing methods across FD, IS, and
alignment metrics. It also generalizes well to the challenging UnAV-100
benchmark. These results highlight model-guided dual-role alignment as a
powerful and scalable paradigm for conditional video-to-audio generation. Code

potentially outperform state-of-the-art methods in room acoustics simulation,
in particular in the range of mid to high frequencies.

*Yuanhang Qian,Kunlong Zhao,Jilu Jin,Xueqin Luo,Gongping Huang,Jingdong Chen,Jacob Benesty*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: The paper introduces a neural fusion framework to combine fixed beamformers for improved interference suppression in dynamic acoustic environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fixed beamforming struggles with varying acoustic conditions, and challenges arise with adaptive convex combination (ACC) methods in highly non-stationary scenarios.

Method: A frame-online neural network is used to estimate combination weights for distortionless differential beamformers, improving adaptability to dynamic environments.

Result: The proposed approach achieves enhanced interference suppression while upholding the distortionless constraint in dynamic acoustic scenarios.

Conclusion: The neural fusion framework outperforms traditional ACC methods, offering stability and robustness in rapidly changing acoustic conditions.

Abstract: Fixed beamforming is widely used in practice since it does not depend on the
estimation of noise statistics and provides relatively stable performance.
However, a single beamformer cannot adapt to varying acoustic conditions, which
limits its interference suppression capability. To address this, adaptive
convex combination (ACC) algorithms have been introduced, where the outputs of
multiple fixed beamformers are linearly combined to improve robustness.
Nevertheless, ACC often fails in highly non-stationary scenarios, such as
rapidly moving interference, since its adaptive updates cannot reliably track
rapid changes. To overcome this limitation, we propose a frame-online neural
fusion framework for multiple distortionless differential beamformers, which
estimates the combination weights through a neural network. Compared with
conventional ACC, the proposed method adapts more effectively to dynamic
acoustic environments, achieving stronger interference suppression while
maintaining the distortionless constraint.

### [424] [Audio Signal Processing Using Time Domain Mel-Frequency Wavelet Coefficient](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24519)
*Rinku Sebastian,Simon O'Keefe,Martin Trefzer*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: This paper proposes the Time domain Mel frequency Wavelet Coefficient (TMFWC) technique to efficiently extract Mel-scaled features for audio signal processing, combining wavelet transform concepts with reservoir computing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC) and standard wavelet transform in speech signal analysis by creating a method that combines their advantages efficiently.

Method: The method introduces Time domain Mel frequency Wavelet Coefficient (TMFWC) to reduce computational complexity for extracting Mel-scaled features, combining wavelet transform principles in the time domain.

Result: The TMFWC technique significantly enhances audio signal processing when paired with reservoir computing, improving efficiency and reducing computational burden.

Conclusion: The proposed TMFWC method successfully combines MFCC and wavelet transform benefits, alleviating their individual limitations and optimizing speech feature extraction for better processing performance.

Abstract: Extracting features from the speech is the most critical process in speech
signal processing. Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC) are the most
widely used features in the majority of the speaker and speech recognition
applications, as the filtering in this feature is similar to the filtering
taking place in the human ear. But the main drawback of this feature is that it
provides only the frequency information of the signal but does not provide the
information about at what time which frequency is present. The wavelet
transform, with its flexible time-frequency window, provides time and frequency
information of the signal and is an appropriate tool for the analysis of
non-stationary signals like speech. On the other hand, because of its uniform
frequency scaling, a typical wavelet transform may be less effective in
analysing speech signals, have poorer frequency resolution in low frequencies,
and be less in line with human auditory perception. Hence, it is necessary to
develop a feature that incorporates the merits of both MFCC and wavelet
transform. A great deal of studies are trying to combine both these features.
The present Wavelet Transform based Mel-scaled feature extraction methods
require more computation when a wavelet transform is applied on top of
Mel-scale filtering, since it adds extra processing steps. Here we are
proposing a method to extract Mel scale features in time domain combining the
concept of wavelet transform, thus reducing the computational burden of
time-frequency conversion and the complexity of wavelet extraction. Combining
our proposed Time domain Mel frequency Wavelet Coefficient(TMFWC) technique
with the reservoir computing methodology has significantly improved the
efficiency of audio signal processing.

*Yuchi Ishikawa,Toranosuke Manabe,Tatsuya Komatsu,Yoshimitsu Aoki*

Main category: eess.AS

TL;DR: The study evaluates the bias and robustness of audio-visual captioning models and enhances dataset quality by introducing AudioVisualCaps.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the complementarity and robustness of audio-visual captioning models to modality degradation.

Method: The researchers tested LAVCap by suppressing or corrupting audio or visual inputs to measure modality sensitivity. They also enhanced the AudioCaps dataset with multimodal textual annotations to create AudioVisualCaps.

Result: LAVCap relies predominantly on audio input and shows better-balanced performance when trained with the new AudioVisualCaps dataset.

Conclusion: Training models on more balanced datasets like AudioVisualCaps reduces modality bias, improving the robustness and complementarity of audio-visual captioning.

Abstract: Audio-visual captioning aims to generate holistic scene descriptions by
jointly modeling sound and vision. While recent methods have improved
performance through sophisticated modality fusion, it remains unclear to what
extent the two modalities are complementary in current audio-visual captioning
models and how robust these models are when one modality is degraded. We
address these questions by conducting systematic modality robustness tests on
LAVCap, a state-of-the-art audio-visual captioning model, in which we
selectively suppress or corrupt the audio or visual streams to quantify
sensitivity and complementarity. The analysis reveals a pronounced bias toward
the audio stream in LAVCap. To evaluate how balanced audio-visual captioning
models are in their use of both modalities, we augment AudioCaps with textual
annotations that jointly describe the audio and visual streams, yielding the
AudioVisualCaps dataset. In our experiments, we report LAVCap baseline results
on AudioVisualCaps. We also evaluate the model under modality robustness tests
on AudioVisualCaps and the results indicate that LAVCap trained on
AudioVisualCaps exhibits less modality bias than when trained on AudioCaps.

TL;DR: The paper presents a method to improve ASR recognition by integrating user-specific phrases and using an attention-based biasing decoder for scoring candidate phrases.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to enhance ASR's ability to accurately recognize user-specific phrases or entities in variable contexts.

Method: The paper employs an attention-based biasing decoder to score candidate phrases from acoustic information and uses a per-token discriminative objective for filtering unlikely phrases and boosting accuracy in shallow-fusion biasing.

Result: Experiments on the Librispeech biasing benchmark demonstrated effective filtering of candidate phrases and significant improvement in recognition accuracy.

Conclusion: The proposed approach is modular, widely applicable to ASR systems, and offers potential improvement for other biasing methods.

Abstract: Contextual biasing improves automatic speech recognition (ASR) by integrating
external knowledge, such as user-specific phrases or entities, during decoding.
In this work, we use an attention-based biasing decoder to produce scores for
candidate phrases based on acoustic information extracted by an ASR encoder,
which can be used to filter out unlikely phrases and to calculate bonus for
shallow-fusion biasing. We introduce a per-token discriminative objective that
encourages higher scores for ground-truth phrases while suppressing
distractors. Experiments on the Librispeech biasing benchmark show that our
method effectively filters out majority of the candidate phrases, and
significantly improves recognition accuracy under different biasing conditions
when the scores are used in shallow fusion biasing. Our approach is modular and
can be used with any ASR system, and the filtering mechanism can potentially
boost performance of other biasing methods.

*Alec Sathiyamoorthy,Wenhao Zhou,Xiangmin Zhou,Xiaodong Li,Iqbal Gondal*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: The paper presents a Multimodal Fire Spread Prediction Framework (MFiSP) integrating satellite data and social media to enhance fire forecasting accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The urgency of improving wildfire forecasting is emphasized by the large-scale devastation from Australia's 2019-2020 Black Summer bushfires.

Method: The study integrates dynamic satellite data, remote sensing, and social media information into a multimodal framework, adapting fire behavior predictions to real-time conditions.

Result: Synthetic fire event scenarios showed improved fire spread prediction accuracy compared to traditional methods.

Conclusion: The MFiSP framework provides better wildfire forecasting by leveraging multimodal data, outperforming static and expert-dependent methods.

Abstract: The 2019-2020 Black Summer bushfires in Australia devastated 19 million
hectares, destroyed 3,000 homes, and lasted seven months, demonstrating the
escalating scale and urgency of wildfire threats requiring better forecasting
for effective response. Traditional fire modeling relies on manual
interpretation by Fire Behaviour Analysts (FBAns) and static environmental
data, often leading to inaccuracies and operational limitations. Emerging data
sources, such as NASA's FIRMS satellite imagery and Volunteered Geographic
Information, offer potential improvements by enabling dynamic fire spread
prediction. This study proposes a Multimodal Fire Spread Prediction Framework
(MFiSP) that integrates social media data and remote sensing observations to
enhance forecast accuracy. By adapting fuel map manipulation strategies between
assimilation cycles, the framework dynamically adjusts fire behavior
predictions to align with the observed rate of spread. We evaluate the efficacy
of MFiSP using synthetically generated fire event polygons across multiple
scenarios, analyzing individual and combined impacts on forecast perimeters.
Results suggest that our MFiSP integrating multimodal data can improve fire
spread prediction beyond conventional methods reliant on FBAn expertise and
static inputs.

TL;DR: The paper presents a probabilistic machine learning framework to model and predict precipitation in Arctic marine regions by integrating causal analysis, data-driven forecasting, and uncertainty quantification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve understanding and forecasting of precipitation in Arctic maritime regions to assess climate risks and aid in early warning systems.

Method: The study uses wavelet coherence for scale-dependent analysis, Synergistic-Unique-Redundant Decomposition for causal analysis, and conformal prediction for uncertainty estimation in forecasting models.

Result: The proposed framework highlights the significance of integrating causal analysis with probabilistic forecasting for reliable precipitation predictions in Arctic environments.

Conclusion: Combining causal insights and probabilistic methods is essential for enhancing precipitation prediction capabilities in regions with vulnerable climates.

Abstract: Understanding and forecasting precipitation events in the Arctic maritime
environments, such as Bear Island and Ny-{\AA}lesund, is crucial for assessing
climate risk and developing early warning systems in vulnerable marine regions.
This study proposes a probabilistic machine learning framework for modeling and
predicting the dynamics and severity of precipitation. We begin by analyzing
the scale-dependent relationships between precipitation and key atmospheric
drivers (e.g., temperature, relative humidity, cloud cover, and air pressure)
using wavelet coherence, which captures localized dependencies across time and
frequency domains. To assess joint causal influences, we employ
Synergistic-Unique-Redundant Decomposition, which quantifies the impact of
interaction effects among each variable on future precipitation dynamics. These
insights inform the development of data-driven forecasting models that
incorporate both historical precipitation and causal climate drivers. To
account for uncertainty, we employ the conformal prediction method, which
enables the generation of calibrated non-parametric prediction intervals. Our
results underscore the importance of utilizing a comprehensive framework that
combines causal analysis with probabilistic forecasting to enhance the
reliability and interpretability of precipitation predictions in Arctic marine
environments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To unify and better understand methods in debiased machine learning, specifically NN matching and Riesz regression.

Method: The study hinges on the equivalence of Lin et al. (2023)’s density-ratio estimation method to LSIF (Least-Squares Importance Fitting) and derives Riesz regression using LSIF framework.

Result: It builds theoretical connections between NN matching, density-ratio estimation, and Riesz regression, expanding their applications in debiased machine learning.

Conclusion: The findings demonstrate NN matching as linked to Riesz regression, facilitating improved automatic debiased machine learning strategies.

Abstract: This study proves that Nearest Neighbor (NN) matching can be interpreted as
an instance of Riesz regression for automatic debiased machine learning. Lin et
al. (2023) shows that NN matching is an instance of density-ratio estimation
with their new density-ratio estimator. Chernozhukov et al. (2024) develops
Riesz regression for automatic debiased machine learning, which directly
estimates the Riesz representer (or equivalently, the bias-correction term) by
minimizing the mean squared error. In this study, we first prove that the
density-ratio estimation method proposed in Lin et al. (2023) is essentially
equivalent to Least-Squares Importance Fitting (LSIF) proposed in Kanamori et
al. (2009) for direct density-ratio estimation. Furthermore, we derive Riesz
regression using the LSIF framework. Based on these results, we derive NN
matching from Riesz regression. This study is based on our work Kato (2025a)

TL;DR: This study applies a novel machine learning technique to evaluate a flipped classroom model's influence, revealing benefits in student experience but no significant academic performance improvement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to analyze the efficacy of transitioning from lecture-based teaching to a flipped classroom model, focusing on its impact on both academic outcomes and student behaviors like self-conception and procrastination.

Method: A double/debiased machine learning (DML) approach was used, which incorporates psychometric considerations for analyzing Likert scale variables. Detailed usage data was utilized to assess the instructional approach's application.

Result: The flipped classroom model positively affected student self-conception, reduced procrastination, and increased enjoyment. However, it showed no significant impact on exam scores, passing rates, or knowledge retention.

Conclusion: While the flipped classroom has merits in non-academic student outcomes, its limited use diminishes its full potential, indicating the necessity for complementary teaching strategies.

Abstract: This study uses double/debiased machine learning (DML) to evaluate the impact
of transitioning from lecture-based blended teaching to a flipped classroom
concept. Our findings indicate effects on students' self-conception,
procrastination, and enjoyment. We do not find significant positive effects on
exam scores, passing rates, or knowledge retention. This can be explained by
the insufficient use of the instructional approach that we can identify with
uniquely detailed usage data and highlights the need for additional teaching
strategies. Methodologically, we propose a powerful DML approach that
acknowledges the latent structure inherent in Likert scale variables and,
hence, aligns with psychometric principles.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding how AI adoption reshapes work requires knowledge of its capabilities and actual usage. This study aims to investigate intrinsic task traits influencing AI delegation decisions.

Method: The study analyzed four million Claude AI interactions, scored tasks across seven dimensions, applied multivariate techniques to identify task archetypes, and analyzed their relationship with AI usage patterns.

Result: Tasks with high creativity, complexity, and cognitive demand but low routineness attracted the most AI usage. Three archetypes were identified: Dynamic Problem Solving, Procedural & Analytical Work, and Standardized Operational Tasks. Additionally, 59% of AI interactions concentrated on just 5% of tasks.

Conclusion: AI usage patterns are strongly influenced by task characteristics, offering insights into human-AI division of labor. The research presents a framework for systematically linking generative AI application to task traits.

Abstract: Purpose: The rapid integration of artificial intelligence (AI) systems like
ChatGPT, Claude AI, etc., has a deep impact on how work is done. Predicting how
AI will reshape work requires understanding not just its capabilities, but how
it is actually being adopted. This study investigates which intrinsic task
characteristics drive users' decisions to delegate work to AI systems.
Methodology: This study utilizes the Anthropic Economic Index dataset of four
million Claude AI interactions mapped to O*NET tasks. We systematically scored
each task across seven key dimensions: Routine, Cognitive, Social Intelligence,
Creativity, Domain Knowledge, Complexity, and Decision Making using 35
parameters. We then employed multivariate techniques to identify latent task
archetypes and analyzed their relationship with AI usage. Findings: Tasks
requiring high creativity, complexity, and cognitive demand, but low
routineness, attracted the most AI engagement. Furthermore, we identified three
task archetypes: Dynamic Problem Solving, Procedural & Analytical Work, and
Standardized Operational Tasks, demonstrating that AI applicability is best
predicted by a combination of task characteristics, over individual factors.
Our analysis revealed highly concentrated AI usage patterns, with just 5% of
tasks accounting for 59% of all interactions. Originality: This research
provides the first systematic evidence linking real-world generative AI usage
to a comprehensive, multi-dimensional framework of intrinsic task

TL;DR: The paper introduces KANalogue, a fully analog neural computation method leveraging negative differential resistance devices for energy-efficient machine learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current analog computation faces challenges in nonlinear operations, often needing digital/hybrid solutions. This paper aims to address these shortcomings.

Method: KANalogue employs tunnel diodes with negative differential resistance as learnable univariate basis functions, constructing analog nonlinear activations. It uses NbSi2N4/HfSi2N4 heterostructures and I-V data for device modeling.

Result: KANalogue approximates complex functions efficiently with minimal parameters and performs vision benchmarks with accuracy comparable to digital systems.

Conclusion: This approach offers a promising path for scalable and energy-efficient analog machine learning, merging physics and function approximation theory.

Abstract: Achieving fully analog neural computation requires hardware that can natively
implement both linear and nonlinear operations with high efficiency. While
analogue matrix-vector multiplication has advanced via compute-in-memory
architectures, nonlinear activation functions remain a bottleneck, often
requiring digital or hybrid solutions. Inspired by the Kolmogorov-Arnold
framework, we propose KANalogue, a fully analogue implementation of
Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) using negative differential resistance
devices as physical realizations of learnable univariate basis functions. By
leveraging the intrinsic negative differential resistance characteristics of
tunnel diodes fabricated from NbSi2N4/HfSi2N4 heterostructures, we construct
coordinate-wise nonlinearities with distinct curvature and support profiles. We
extract I-V data from fabricated armchair and zigzag devices, fit high-order
polynomials to emulate diode behavior in software, and train KANs on vision
benchmarks using these learned basis functions. Our results demonstrate that
KANalogue can approximate complex functions with minimal parameters while
maintaining classification accuracy competitive with digital baselines. This
work bridges device-level physics and function approximation theory, charting a
path toward scalable, energy-efficient analogue machine learning systems.

Motivation: The research aims to address the challenges of deploying large vision-language models (LVLMs) in real-world LEO satellite systems, which are hampered by constrained onboard resources and limited satellite-ground communication windows.

Method: Grace deploys a compact LVLM on satellites for real-time processing, while larger LVLMs operate on ground stations (GSs) for enhanced overall performance. The system uses an asynchronous satellite-GS Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and a confidence-based task dispatch algorithm to optimize data processing and task allocation.

Result: Experiments conducted with real satellite orbital data reveal that Grace reduces latency by 76-95% compared to current methods, maintaining robust inference accuracy.

Conclusion: Grace provides an effective solution for leveraging LVLMs in near-realtime RS tasks on LEO satellites, overcoming traditional challenges and greatly improving system efficiency.

Abstract: Large vision-language models (LVLMs) have recently demonstrated great
potential in remote sensing (RS) tasks (e.g., disaster monitoring) conducted by
low Earth orbit (LEO) satellites. However, their deployment in real-world LEO
satellite systems remains largely unexplored, hindered by limited onboard
computing resources and brief satellite-ground contacts. We propose Grace, a
satellite-ground collaborative system designed for near-realtime LVLM inference
in RS tasks. Accordingly, we deploy compact LVLM on satellites for realtime
inference, but larger ones on ground stations (GSs) to guarantee end-to-end
performance. Grace is comprised of two main phases that are asynchronous
satellite-GS Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), and a task dispatch
algorithm. Firstly, we still the knowledge archive of GS RAG to satellite
archive with tailored adaptive update algorithm during limited satellite-ground
data exchange period. Secondly, propose a confidence-based test algorithm that
either processes the task onboard the satellite or offloads it to the GS.
Extensive experiments based on real-world satellite orbital data show that
Grace reduces the average latency by 76-95% compared to state-of-the-art
methods, without compromising inference accuracy.

*Samuel Del Fré,Andrée de Backer,Christophe Domain,Ludovic Thuinet,Charlotte S. Becquart*

Main category: cond-mat.mtrl-sci

TL;DR: This study introduces an unsupervised machine learning (ML) framework to detect and classify atomic-level defects from molecular dynamics data caused by neutron irradiation. It applies this to analyze defects in three different materials, achieving significant clustering accuracy and agreeing with conventional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to develop an unsupervised ML workflow to improve the detection, classification, and understanding of primary damage caused by neutron irradiation in materials, which is crucial for long-term material stability and applications in various industries.

Method: The authors use a combination of Smooth Overlap of Atomic Positions (SOAP), autoencoder neural networks, Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP), and Hierarchical Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (HDBSCAN) to identify and cluster atomic defects. These techniques analyze molecular dynamics data to detect anomalies and classify specific defect types.

Result: The ML framework successfully separates defect-related atoms into distinct groups such as vacancy-dominated and interstitial-dominated regions. It achieves 99.7% accuracy in clustering physical motifs, correlates well with traditional methods, and does not rely on preset templates or thresholds.

Conclusion: This unsupervised ML workflow provides a novel, efficient, and adaptable method for quantitatively mapping structural anomalies, especially for studying irradiation defects in materials, enhancing our ability to analyze and predict material behavior post-damage.

Abstract: Neutron irradiation produces, within a few picoseconds, displacement cascades
that are sequences of atomic collisions generating point and extended defects
which subsequently affects the long-term evolution of materials. The diversity
of these defects, characterized morphologically and statistically, defines what
is called the "primary damage". In this work, we present a fully unsupervised
machine learning (ML) workflow that detects and classifies these defects
directly from molecular dynamics data. Local environments are encoded by the
Smooth Overlap of Atomic Positions (SOAP) vector, anomalous atoms are isolated
with autoencoder neural networks (AE), embedded with Uniform Manifold
Approximation and Projection (UMAP) and clustered using Hierarchical
Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (HDBSCAN). Applied
to 80 keV displacement cascades in Ni, Fe$_7$0Ni$_{10}$Cr$_{20}$, and Zr, the
AE successfully identify the small fraction of outlier atoms that participate
in defect formation. HDBSCAN then partitions the UMAP latent space of
AE-flagged SOAP descriptors into well defined groups representing vacancy- and
interstitial-dominated regions and, within each, separates small from large
aggregates, assigning 99.7 % of outliers to compact physical motifs. A signed
cluster-identification score confirms this separation, and cluster size scales
with net defect counts (R2 > 0.89). Statistical cross analyses between the ML
outlier map and several conventional detectors (centrosymmetry, dislocation
extraction, etc.) reveal strong overlap and complementary coverage, all
achieved without template or threshold tuning. This ML workflow thus provides
an efficient tool for the quantitative mapping of structural anomalies in
materials, particularly those arising from irradiation damage in displacement
cascades.

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: This paper models group target trajectory intent using cooperative game theory and NLP-based generative models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To optimally formalize and infer group trajectory intent in complex spatio-temporal patterns.

Method: Developing Fisher-information-based characteristic functions for cooperative games, building NLP-based generative models, and training Graph Transformer Neural Networks (GTNN) for inference.

Result: The framework effectively generates realistic multi-target trajectory data and accurately infers group intent through GTNN.

Conclusion: The proposed methods enable the optimal modeling and inference of group trajectory intent linking signal processing with generative and deep learning models.

Abstract: This paper studies group target trajectory intent as the outcome of a
cooperative game where the complex-spatio trajectories are modeled using an
NLP-based generative model. In our framework, the group intent is specified by
the characteristic function of a cooperative game, and allocations for players
in the cooperative game are specified by either the core, the Shapley value, or
the nucleolus. The resulting allocations induce probability distributions that
govern the coordinated spatio-temporal trajectories of the targets that reflect
the group's underlying intent. We address two key questions: (1) How can the
intent of a group trajectory be optimally formalized as the characteristic
function of a cooperative game? (2) How can such intent be inferred from noisy
observations of the targets? To answer the first question, we introduce a
Fisher-information-based characteristic function of the cooperative game, which
yields probability distributions that generate coordinated spatio-temporal
patterns. As a generative model for these patterns, we develop an NLP-based
generative model built on formal grammar, enabling the creation of realistic
multi-target trajectory data. To answer the second question, we train a Graph
Transformer Neural Network (GTNN) to infer group trajectory intent-expressed as
the characteristic function of the cooperative game-from observational data
with high accuracy. The self-attention function of the GTNN depends on the
track estimates. Thus, the formulation and algorithms provide a multi-layer
approach that spans target tracking (Bayesian signal processing) and the GTNN
(for group intent inference).

*Zihan Zhao,Masood Mortazavi,Ning Yan*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: This paper introduces PULSE, a framework for stress detection that uses EDA during pretraining but eliminates its use in inference by relying on cheaper sensors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Stress detection using Electrodermal Activity can be costly due to hardware limitations, prompting a need for methods utilizing alternative, affordable sensors.

Method: PULSE uses self-supervised pretraining with EDA to generate shared and private embeddings across modalities, followed by knowledge transfer from EDA to student encoders.

Result: Strong stress-detection performance was achieved on the WESAD dataset, enabling accurate results while significantly reducing hardware dependency.

Conclusion: Privileged EDA data can enhance stress-detection accuracy even when using lower-cost sensors, presenting a cost-effective solution for real-world wearable applications.

Abstract: Electrodermal activity (EDA), the primary signal for stress detection,
requires costly hardware often unavailable in real-world wearables. In this
paper, we propose PULSE, a framework that utilizes EDA exclusively during
self-supervised pretraining, while enabling inference without EDA but with more
readily available modalities such as ECG, BVP, ACC, and TEMP. Our approach
separates encoder outputs into shared and private embeddings. We align shared
embeddings across modalities and fuse them into a modality-invariant
representation. The private embeddings carry modality-specific information to
support the reconstruction objective. Pretraining is followed by knowledge
transfer where a frozen EDA teacher transfers sympathetic-arousal
representations into student encoders. On WESAD, our method achieves strong
stress-detection performance, showing that representations of privileged EDA
can be transferred to low-cost sensors to improve accuracy while reducing
hardware cost.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a digital twin-assisted framework for UAV trajectory design in low-altitude wireless networks, enhancing flight safety, user scheduling, and minimizing mission time.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenges of efficient and safe UAV trajectory design in low-altitude wireless networks deployed in unknown environmental topologies.

Method: A digital twin-assisted training and deployment framework, where UAVs integrate sensing and communication while constructing virtual environments. A trajectory design scheme combines simulated annealing and a deep deterministic policy gradient algorithm.

Result: The proposed framework achieves faster algorithm convergence, higher flight safety, and reduced mission completion time compared with baseline methods.

Conclusion: The framework provides a robust solution for deploying UAVs in low-altitude wireless networks within unknown environments, enabling effective trajectory designs and improved mission performance.

Abstract: Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are emerging as key enablers for low-altitude
wireless network (LAWN), particularly when terrestrial networks are
unavailable. In such scenarios, the environmental topology is typically
unknown; hence, designing efficient and safe UAV trajectories is essential yet
challenging. To address this, we propose a digital twin (DT)-assisted training
and deployment framework. In this framework, the UAV transmits integrated
sensing and communication signals to provide communication services to ground
users, while simultaneously collecting echoes that are uploaded to the DT
server to progressively construct virtual environments (VEs). These VEs
accelerate model training and are continuously updated with real-time UAV
sensing data during deployment, supporting decision-making and enhancing flight
safety. Based on this framework, we further develop a trajectory design scheme
that integrates simulated annealing for efficient user scheduling with the
twin-delayed deep deterministic policy gradient algorithm for continuous
trajectory design, aiming to minimize mission completion time while ensuring
obstacle avoidance. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed approach
achieves faster convergence, higher flight safety, and shorter mission
completion time compared with baseline methods, providing a robust and
efficient solution for LAWN deployment in unknown environments.

### [438] [Towards actionable hypotension prediction -- predicting catecholamine therapy initiation in the intensive care unit](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24287)
*Richard Koebe,Noah Saibel,Juan Miguel Lopez Alcaraz,Simon Schäfer,Nils Strodthoff*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: The paper presents an ML model to predict catecholamine initiation in ICU patients with hypotension using MAP trends, treatment context, and patient factors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to create a clinically actionable prediction model that supports decisions about escalating to catecholamine therapy, addressing risks of undertreatment or overtreatment in critically ill patients.

Method: A binary prediction model (XGBoost) was developed using MIMIC-III data, incorporating MAP dynamics, patient demographics, biometrics, comorbidities, and treatments, with interpretability provided by SHAP analysis.

Result: The model achieved an AUROC of 0.822, surpassing a common hypotension threshold baseline AUROC of 0.686. SHAP identified key predictors, and subgroup analysis highlighted demographic and clinical contexts affecting performance.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates the feasibility of using ML to predict catecholamine initiation in ICU settings, offering a shift from threshold-based hypotension alarms to targeted decision support for therapy escalation.

Abstract: Hypotension in critically ill ICU patients is common and life-threatening.
Escalation to catecholamine therapy marks a key management step, with both
undertreatment and overtreatment posing risks. Most machine learning (ML)
models predict hypotension using fixed MAP thresholds or MAP forecasting,
overlooking the clinical decision behind treatment escalation. Predicting
catecholamine initiation, the start of vasoactive or inotropic agent
administration offers a more clinically actionable target reflecting real
decision-making. Using the MIMIC-III database, we modeled catecholamine
initiation as a binary event within a 15-minute prediction window. Input
features included statistical descriptors from a two-hour sliding MAP context
window, along with demographics, biometrics, comorbidities, and ongoing
treatments. An Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) model was trained and
interpreted via SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP). The model achieved an
AUROC of 0.822 (0.813-0.830), outperforming the hypotension baseline (MAP < 65,
AUROC 0.686 [0.675-0.699]). SHAP analysis highlighted recent MAP values, MAP
trends, and ongoing treatments (e.g., sedatives, electrolytes) as dominant
predictors. Subgroup analysis showed higher performance in males, younger
patients (<53 years), those with higher BMI (>32), and patients without
comorbidities or concurrent medications. Predicting catecholamine initiation
based on MAP dynamics, treatment context, and patient characteristics supports
the critical decision of when to escalate therapy, shifting focus from
threshold-based alarms to actionable decision support. This approach is
feasible across a broad ICU cohort under natural event imbalance. Future work
should enrich temporal and physiological context, extend label definitions to
include therapy escalation, and benchmark against existing hypotension
prediction systems.

*Yuzhi Yang,Sen Yan,Weijie Zhou,Brahim Mefgouda,Ridong Li,Zhaoyang Zhang,Mérouane Debbah*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: The paper discusses the application of generative AI (specifically diffusion models) to improve channel estimation in large-scale OFDM wireless systems, which traditional methods have struggled with.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional methods for channel estimation in large-scale OFDM systems are inefficient and pose as bottlenecks in transceiver performance, prompting exploration of AI-based solutions.

Method: The study leverages generative AI, specifically diffusion models (DMs), for channel estimation problems in OFDM systems, combining them with traditional signal processing techniques.

Result: The potential of DMs in enhancing wireless transceiver systems is demonstrated, along with a proof-of-concept for improving wireless receiver performance using DM-based techniques.

Conclusion: Diffusion models show great potential in overcoming the limitations of traditional methods in wireless transceiver efficiency, opening up new research directions in AI-driven signal processing.

Abstract: With the development of artificial intelligence (AI) techniques, implementing
AI-based techniques to improve wireless transceivers becomes an emerging
research topic. Within this context, AI-based channel characterization and
estimation become the focus since these methods have not been solved by
traditional methods very well and have become the bottleneck of transceiver
efficiency in large-scale orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM)
systems. Specifically, by formulating channel estimation as a generative AI
problem, generative AI methods such as diffusion models (DMs) can efficiently
deal with rough initial estimations and have great potential to cooperate with
traditional signal processing methods. This paper focuses on the transceiver
design of OFDM systems based on DMs, provides an illustration of the potential
of DMs in wireless transceivers, and points out the related research directions
brought by DMs. We also provide a proof-of-concept case study of further
adapting DMs for better wireless receiver performance.

*Xin Jin,Nitish Kumar Chandra,Mohadeseh Azari,Kaushik P. Seshadreesan,Junyu Liu*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: The paper proposes a secure quantum network architecture employing post-quantum cryptography and continuous monitoring, addressing vulnerabilities of classical communications against quantum-era threats.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation stems from the vulnerabilities of current classical cryptography to quantum computing, which could compromise classical channels while transmitting cryptographic keys and information in quantum networks.

Method: The authors propose integrating post-quantum cryptographic techniques to secure classical communications and utilizing continuous monitoring and orchestration across diverse infrastructures for enhanced security in quantum and classical layers.

Result: The proposed architecture achieves end-to-end security for quantum networks that protects against classical and quantum-era adversaries.

Conclusion: By securing both quantum and classical channels with post-quantum cryptographic protections and monitoring, this framework offers a solution for robust, scalable quantum networks that will remain secure in the quantum computing era.

Abstract: Quantum networks rely on both quantum and classical channels for coordinated
operation. Current architectures employ entanglement distribution and key
exchange over quantum channels but often assume that classical communication is
sufficiently secure. In practice, classical channels protected by traditional
cryptography remain vulnerable to quantum adversaries, since large-scale
quantum computers could break widely used public-key schemes and reduce the
effective security of symmetric cryptography. This perspective presents a
quantum-resistant network architecture that secures classical communication
with post-quantum cryptographic techniques while supporting entanglement-based
communication over quantum channels. Beyond cryptographic protection, the
framework incorporates continuous monitoring of both quantum and classical
layers, together with orchestration across heterogeneous infrastructures, to
ensure end-to-end security. Collectively, these mechanisms provide a pathway
toward scalable, robust, and secure quantum networks that remain dependable
against both classical and quantum-era threats.

*Simone Colli,Emiliano Maresi,Vincenzo Bonnici*

Main category: q-bio.GN

TL;DR: PanDelos-plus is a redesigned, parallel version of PanDelos, offering faster execution and lower memory usage for bacterial pangenomics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional methods for identifying homologous gene families in bacterial pangenomics are computationally demanding, especially with growing genomic datasets.

Method: PanDelos-plus employs a parallel algorithm using data decomposition, thread pool strategies, and lightweight data structures to enhance speed and efficiency.

Result: Benchmarks show up to 14x faster execution and reduced memory usage by up to 96% while maintaining accuracy.

Conclusion: PanDelos-plus makes large-scale bacterial pangenome analysis accessible for routine use on standard multicore workstations.

Abstract: The identification of homologous gene families across multiple genomes is a
central task in bacterial pangenomics traditionally requiring computationally
demanding all-against-all comparisons. PanDelos addresses this challenge with
an alignment-free and parameter-free approach based on k-mer profiles,
combining high speed, ease of use, and competitive accuracy with
state-of-the-art methods. However, the increasing availability of genomic data
requires tools that can scale efficiently to larger datasets. To address this
need, we present PanDelos-plus, a fully parallel, gene-centric redesign of
PanDelos. The algorithm parallelizes the most computationally intensive phases
(Best Hit detection and Bidirectional Best Hit extraction) through data
decomposition and a thread pool strategy, while employing lightweight data
structures to reduce memory usage. Benchmarks on synthetic datasets show that
PanDelos-plus achieves up to 14x faster execution and reduces memory usage by
up to 96%, while maintaining accuracy. These improvements enable
population-scale comparative genomics to be performed on standard multicore
workstations, making large-scale bacterial pangenome analysis accessible for
routine use in everyday research.

*Hoora Sobhani,Hyoseung Kim*

TL;DR: The paper introduces a systematic framework using Integer Linear Programming for optimizing real-time performance metrics in Autonomous Driving Systems, focusing on diverse fusion patterns in Directed Acyclic Graph scheduling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current DAG scheduling methods for ADS fail to address the diverse fusion patterns found in real-world applications, oversimplifying data fusion tasks by assuming fixed triggering mechanisms.

Method: The framework models three distinct fusion task types (timer-triggered, wait-for-all, and immediate) and applies an ILP-based optimization approach to optimize real-time performance metrics while producing deterministic offline schedules.

Result: The framework improves performance in reaction time, time disparity, age of information, and response time, as validated through real-world ADS case studies, Raspberry Pi experiments, and randomly generated DAGs.

Conclusion: The proposed framework enhances the handling of diverse fusion patterns in ADS, addressing limitations in current DAG scheduling methods and offering substantial performance benefits.

Abstract: In Autonomous Driving Systems (ADS), Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) are
widely used to model complex data dependencies and inter-task communication.
However, existing DAG scheduling approaches oversimplify data fusion tasks by
assuming fixed triggering mechanisms, failing to capture the diverse fusion
patterns found in real-world ADS software stacks. In this paper, we propose a
systematic framework for analyzing various fusion patterns and their
performance implications in ADS. Our framework models three distinct fusion
task types: timer-triggered, wait-for-all, and immediate fusion, which
comprehensively represent real-world fusion behaviors. Our Integer Linear
Programming (ILP)-based approach enables an optimization of multiple real-time
performance metrics, including reaction time, time disparity, age of
information, and response time, while generating deterministic offline
schedules directly applicable to real platforms. Evaluation using real-world
ADS case studies, Raspberry Pi implementation, and randomly generated DAGs
demonstrates that our framework handles diverse fusion patterns beyond the
scope of existing work, and achieves substantial performance improvements in
comparable scenarios.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve water distribution management by accurately estimating network hydraulic states for better pressure control and leak detection.

Method: A comparison of two Unscented Kalman Filter-based approaches—joint state vector and dual-estimator scheme—using pressure, demand, and flow data.

Result: Simulation results on the L-TOWN benchmark demonstrate the performance, characteristics, and practical viability of the two approaches.

Conclusion: The paper provides insights into the advantages, limitations, and complexities of the two strategies, aiding in selecting the suitable method for water network management.

Abstract: The sustainability of modern cities highly depends on efficient water
distribution management, including effective pressure control and leak
detection and localization. Accurate information about the network hydraulic
state is therefore essential. This article presents a comparison between two
data-driven state estimation methods based on the Unscented Kalman Filter
(UKF), fusing pressure, demand and flow data for head and flow estimation. One
approach uses a joint state vector with a single estimator, while the other
uses a dual-estimator scheme. We analyse their main characteristics, discussing
differences, advantages and limitations, and compare them theoretically in
terms of accuracy and complexity. Finally, we show several estimation results
for the L-TOWN benchmark, allowing to discuss their properties in a real

*Lukas Bartl,Julian Linne,Kirstin Peters*

Main category: cs.LO

TL;DR: The paper extends fault-tolerant multiparty session types by introducing a novel loop construct for verifying distributed algorithms while supporting fault-tolerance and absence of deadlock.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable formal verification of distributed algorithms that mimic multiparty communication protocols, with a focus on termination, progress, and fault-tolerance.

Method: The approach extends FTMPST with a fault-tolerant looping mechanism featuring global escapes and non-blocking exit-messages to handle failures without requiring global coordination.

Result: The proposed extension is demonstrated using a variant of the rotating coordinator algorithm, showcasing its practicality for fault-tolerant distributed algorithms.

Conclusion: The extension facilitates efficient modeling and verification of distributed algorithms in fault-prone systems, promoting progress and fault-tolerance without added complexity.

Abstract: Multiparty session types are designed to abstractly capture the structure of
communication protocols and verify behavioural properties. One important such
property is progress, i.e., the absence of deadlock. Distributed algorithms
often resemble multiparty communication protocols. But proving their
properties, in particular termination that is closely related to progress, can
be elaborate. Since distributed algorithms are often designed to cope with
faults, a first step towards using session types to verify distributed
algorithms is to integrate fault-tolerance.
  We extend FTMPST (a version of fault-tolerant multiparty session types with
failure patterns to represent system requirements for system failures such as
unreliable communication and process crashes) by a novel, fault-tolerant loop
construct with global escapes that does not require global coordination. Each
process runs its own local version of the loop. If a process finds a solution
to the considered problem, it does not only terminate its own loop but also
informs the other participants via exit-messages. Upon receiving an
exit-message, a process immediately terminates its algorithm. To increase
efficiency and model standard fault-tolerant algorithms, these messages are
non-blocking, i.e., a process may continue until a possibly delayed
exit-message is received. To illustrate our approach, we analyse a variant of
the well-known rotating coordinator algorithm by Chandra and Toueg.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of achieving secrecy capacity in reversely-degraded wiretap channels, which is zero without feedback.

Method: Combination of universal hash functions for security and learned feedback-based codes for reliability, alongside analyzing the trade-off between reliability and information leakage.

Result: Demonstrated that feedback allows secret key agreement between legitimate parties, overcoming the wiretapper's advantage.

Conclusion: Feedback significantly enhances secure communication, and motivates future code designs for sensing-assisted secure communication in integrated systems.

Abstract: We consider reversely-degraded wiretap channels, for which the secrecy
capacity is zero if there is no channel feedback. This work focuses on a seeded
modular code design for the Gaussian wiretap channel with channel output
feedback, combining universal hash functions for security and learned
feedback-based codes for reliability to achieve positive secrecy rates. We
study the trade-off between communication reliability and information leakage,
illustrating that feedback enables agreeing on a secret key shared between
legitimate parties, overcoming the security advantage of the wiretapper. Our
findings also motivate code designs for sensing-assisted secure communication,
to be used in next-generation integrated sensing and communication methods.

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: The paper addresses recoverability of a sparse signal $x^*$ from noisy observations $\mathbf{y}$ when the matrix $\mathbf{A}$ and vector $\mathbf{e}$ have minimal assumptions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to solve the problem of recovering sparse signals from noisy data without relying on strong assumptions about the matrix $\mathbf{A}$ or the signal $x^*$. Existing methods require structural assumptions that are often impractical.

Method: The authors analyze the recoverable information of $x^*$ based on rowspace properties of submatrices of $\mathbf{A}$ and characterize the best possible recoverable set using projection matrices. They also show a constructive method that minimizes the $\ell_0$-norm to identify a solution within the recoverable set.

Result: The smallest uniformly recoverable set is shown to be $x^* + \ker(\mathbf{U})$, where $\mathbf{U}$ is a projection matrix derived from intersections of rowspaces. This reveals the fundamental limits of recoverability without strong assumptions.

Conclusion: Recoverability without structural assumptions is limited, but it can be characterized using kernel properties of projection matrices derived from $\mathbf{A}$. The approach provides insights into constructive recovery methods.

Abstract: Let $\mathbf{A} \in \mathbb{R}^{m \times n}$ be an arbitrary, known matrix
and $\mathbf{e}$ a $q$-sparse adversarial vector. Given $\mathbf{y} =
\mathbf{A} x^* + \mathbf{e}$ and $q$, we seek the smallest set containing
$x^*$-hence the one conveying maximal information about $x^*$-that is uniformly
recoverable from $\mathbf{y}$ without knowing $\mathbf{e}$. While exact
recovery of $x^*$ via strong (and often impractical) structural assumptions on
$\mathbf{A}$ or $x^*$ (for example, restricted isometry, sparsity) is well
studied, recoverability for arbitrary $\mathbf{A}$ and $x^*$ remains open. Our
main result shows that the best that one can hope to recover is $x^* +
\ker(\mathbf{U})$, where $\mathbf{U}$ is the unique projection matrix onto the
intersection of rowspaces of all possible submatrices of $\mathbf{A}$ obtained
by deleting $2q$ rows. Moreover, we prove that every $x$ that minimizes the
$\ell_0$-norm of $\mathbf{y} - \mathbf{A} x$ lies in $x^* + \ker(\mathbf{U})$,
which then gives a constructive approach to recover this set.

*Lingyi Wang,Rashed Shelim,Walid Saad,Naren Ramakrishnan*

TL;DR: Existing RL solutions in wireless networks suffer from inefficiencies and lack adaptability. This paper introduces a dual-mind world model combining pattern recognition and logic-driven components for better wireless network optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The limitations of existing RL methods, such as inefficiency, short-sightedness, and inability to generalize to novel states, are significant hurdles in complex and highly dynamic wireless networks.

Method: A novel dual-mind world model is proposed, inspired by cognitive psychology. It integrates a pattern-driven System 1 and a logic-driven System 2 to enable long-term planning and decision-making in wireless networks, particularly in mmWave V2X scenarios.

Result: The proposed model demonstrates enhanced data efficiency, strong generalization, and the ability to adapt to unseen environments, surpassing other state-of-the-art RL baselines in simulation results.

Conclusion: The dual-mind world model is a promising approach to addressing inherent limitations in RL for wireless networks, offering efficient, adaptable, and long-term solutions.

Abstract: Despite the popularity of reinforcement learning (RL) in wireless networks,
existing approaches that rely on model-free RL (MFRL) and model-based RL (MBRL)
are data inefficient and short-sighted. Such RL-based solutions cannot
generalize to novel network states since they capture only statistical patterns
rather than the underlying physics and logic from wireless data. These
limitations become particularly challenging in complex wireless networks with
high dynamics and long-term planning requirements. To address these
limitations, in this paper, a novel dual-mind world model-based learning
framework is proposed with the goal of optimizing completeness-weighted age of
information (CAoI) in a challenging mmWave V2X scenario. Inspired by cognitive
psychology, the proposed dual-mind world model encompasses a pattern-driven
System 1 component and a logic-driven System 2 component to learn dynamics and
logic of the wireless network, and to provide long-term link scheduling over
reliable imagined trajectories. Link scheduling is learned through end-to-end
differentiable imagined trajectories with logical consistency over an extended
horizon rather than relying on wireless data obtained from environment
interactions. Moreover, through imagination rollouts, the proposed world model
can jointly reason network states and plan link scheduling. During intervals
without observations, the proposed method remains capable of making efficient
decisions. Extensive experiments are conducted on a realistic simulator based
on Sionna with real-world physical channel, ray-tracing, and scene objects with
material properties. Simulation results show that the proposed world model
achieves a significant improvement in data efficiency and achieves strong
generalization and adaptation to unseen environments, compared to the
state-of-the-art RL baselines, and the world model approach with only System 1.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a need for robust variable selection methods for heavy-tailed response datasets, particularly in genetic and epigenetic studies with non-Gaussian errors.

Method: A Bayesian variable selection framework is developed utilizing modal regression and an expectation-maximization algorithm for parameter estimation, accompanied by a test statistic to separate informative covariates.

Result: Simulations show the method effectively identifies crucial covariates even with non-Gaussian errors. It is successfully applied to datasets in genetic and epigenetic studies.

Conclusion: The proposed Bayesian modal regression method efficiently selects important variables in datasets with heavy-tailed responses, demonstrating its practical applicability.

Abstract: We propose a Bayesian variable selection method in the framework of modal
regression for heavy-tailed responses. An efficient expectation-maximization
algorithm is employed to expedite parameter estimation. A test statistic is
constructed to exploit the shape of the model error distribution to effectively

demonstrate and evaluate the efficacy of the proposed method in identifying
important covariates in the presence of non-Gaussian model errors. Finally, we
apply the proposed method to analyze two datasets arising in genetic and
epigenetic studies.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Comparing regression functions is crucial in many applications like data integration, transfer learning, and causal inference, but existing methods struggle with high dimensionality and restrictive assumptions.

Method: This work introduces a new characterization of kernel-based conditional mean dependence and designs two flexible machine learning-powered tests with robust asymptotic properties.

Result: The proposed tests are effective in both fixed and high-dimensional setups, require only mild assumptions, and outperform existing approaches in numerical studies.

Conclusion: This study advances statistical inference by providing efficient and flexible methods to compare regression functions, overcoming prior limitations in high-dimensional settings.

Abstract: We revisit the classical problem of comparing regression functions, a
fundamental question in statistical inference with broad relevance to modern
applications such as data integration, transfer learning, and causal inference.
Existing approaches typically rely on smoothing techniques and are thus
hindered by the curse of dimensionality. We propose a generalized notion of
kernel-based conditional mean dependence that provides a new characterization
of the null hypothesis of equal regression functions. Building on this
reformulation, we develop two novel tests that leverage modern machine learning
methods for flexible estimation. We establish the asymptotic properties of the
test statistics, which hold under both fixed- and high-dimensional regimes.
Unlike existing methods that often require restrictive distributional
assumptions, our framework only imposes mild moment conditions. The efficacy of
the proposed tests is demonstrated through extensive numerical studies.

TL;DR: This paper presents SymMaP, a framework that learns interpretable symbolic expressions for matrix preconditioning parameters using a neural network to enhance speed and accuracy in solving linear systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Matrix preconditioning faces challenges in parameter selection, with traditional methods requiring expertise and limiting performance. Machine learning offers promise but suffers from high inference costs and limited interpretability.

Method: The authors propose SymMaP, which employs neural networks to discover symbolic expressions for preconditioning parameters, making the solution efficient and interpretable.

Result: SymMaP demonstrates superior performance over traditional methods across various benchmarks, combining high efficiency and excellent interpretability.

Conclusion: The framework successfully bridges traditional and ML approaches, providing a novel symbolic discovery that optimizes parameter selection while being efficient and deployable.

Abstract: Matrix preconditioning is a critical technique to accelerate the solution of
linear systems, where performance heavily depends on the selection of
preconditioning parameters. Traditional parameter selection approaches often
define fixed constants for specific scenarios. However, they rely on domain
expertise and fail to consider the instance-wise features for individual
problems, limiting their performance. In contrast, machine learning (ML)
approaches, though promising, are hindered by high inference costs and limited
interpretability. To combine the strengths of both approaches, we propose a
symbolic discovery framework-namely, Symbolic Matrix Preconditioning
(SymMaP)-to learn efficient symbolic expressions for preconditioning
parameters. Specifically, we employ a neural network to search the
high-dimensional discrete space for expressions that can accurately predict the
optimal parameters. The learned expression allows for high inference efficiency
and excellent interpretability (expressed in concise symbolic formulas), making
it simple and reliable for deployment. Experimental results show that SymMaP
consistently outperforms traditional strategies across various benchmarks.

Main category: math.NA

TL;DR: This paper introduces new methods to strongly enforce Neumann or Robin boundary conditions in machine learning methods for solving partial differential equations, addressing instability issues in domains with globally $C^0$ boundaries.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current techniques for enforcing boundary conditions in partial differential equations, particularly Neumann or Robin conditions, face limitations in accuracy and training times when using weak enforcement. Strong enforcement methods are better but can suffer instability in domains with non-smooth boundaries.

Method: The authors propose two techniques: (1) a generalization of Sukumar & Srivastava's method, and (2) a new approach based on orthogonal projections. These methods aim to address the instability in strongly enforcing boundary conditions on piecewise $C^1$ boundaries.

Result: The proposed techniques demonstrate improved performance in enforcing boundary conditions compared to weak and semi-weak methods, particularly for scalar Darcy flow and stationary Navier-Stokes equations.

Conclusion: The study resolves key limitations in enforcing boundary conditions on domains with non-smooth boundaries, showing promising results in machine-learning-based solutions for complex PDEs.

Abstract: Machine-learning based methods like physics-informed neural networks and
physics-informed neural operators are becoming increasingly adept at solving
even complex systems of partial differential equations. Boundary conditions can
be enforced either weakly by penalizing deviations in the loss function or
strongly by training a solution structure that inherently matches the
prescribed values and derivatives. The former approach is easy to implement but
the latter can provide benefits with respect to accuracy and training times.
However, previous approaches to strongly enforcing Neumann or Robin boundary
conditions require a domain with a fully $C^1$ boundary and, as we demonstrate,
can lead to instability if those boundary conditions are posed on a segment of
the boundary that is piecewise $C^1$ but only $C^0$ globally. We introduce a
generalization of the approach by Sukumar \& Srivastava (doi:
10.1016/j.cma.2021.114333), and a new approach based on orthogonal projections
that overcome this limitation. The performance of these new techniques is
compared against weakly and semi-weakly enforced boundary conditions for the
scalar Darcy flow equation and the stationary Navier-Stokes equations.

### [454] [Attack on a PUF-based Secure Binary Neural Network](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24422)
*Bijeet Basak,Nupur Patil,Kurian Polachan,Srinivas Vivek*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This paper exposes vulnerabilities in a PUF-based security scheme designed to protect Binarized Neural Networks (BNNs) from theft attacks, demonstrating the feasibility of recovering weights, biases, and PUF keys efficiently through differential cryptanalysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to evaluate the security of existing methods for protecting BNNs against physical attacks, specifically addressing vulnerabilities in the PUF-based scheme proposed earlier.

Method: The proposed attack leverages differential cryptanalysis to systematically recover PUF keys and subsequently the BNN model parameters by observing the impact of key bits on model accuracy.

Result: The attack successfully recovers 85% of the PUF key and achieves 93% classification accuracy after recovering the parameters, closely matching the original model's accuracy of 96%.

Conclusion: PUF-based schemes for securing BNNs are vulnerable to efficient key recovery attacks, highlighting the need for more robust security measures in edge computing applications.

Abstract: Binarized Neural Networks (BNNs) deployed on memristive crossbar arrays
provide energy-efficient solutions for edge computing but are susceptible to
physical attacks due to memristor nonvolatility. Recently, Rajendran et al.
(IEEE Embedded Systems Letter 2025) proposed a Physical Unclonable Function
(PUF)-based scheme to secure BNNs against theft attacks. Specifically, the
weight and bias matrices of the BNN layers were secured by swapping columns
based on device's PUF key bits.
  In this paper, we demonstrate that this scheme to secure BNNs is vulnerable
to PUF-key recovery attack. As a consequence of our attack, we recover the
secret weight and bias matrices of the BNN. Our approach is motivated by
differential cryptanalysis and reconstructs the PUF key bit-by-bit by observing
the change in model accuracy, and eventually recovering the BNN model
parameters. Evaluated on a BNN trained on the MNIST dataset, our attack could
recover 85% of the PUF key, and recover the BNN model up to 93% classification
accuracy compared to the original model's 96% accuracy. Our attack is very
efficient and it takes a couple of minutes to recovery the PUF key and the
model parameters.

### [456] [SAND: A Self-supervised and Adaptive NAS-Driven Framework for Hardware Trojan Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23643)
*Zhixin Pan,Ziyu Shu,Linh Nguyen,Amberbir Alemayoh*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This paper addresses the challenge of efficiently detecting Hardware Trojans (HT) in globalized semiconductor supply chains using a self-supervised and adaptive NAS-driven approach.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The proliferation of HTs in embedded systems due to globalized semiconductor supply chains underscores the need for efficient and adaptive detection mechanisms. Current machine learning techniques struggle due to ad hoc feature selection and a lack of adaptability.

Method: The paper introduces SAND, a framework that leverages self-supervised learning (SSL) for automated feature extraction and employs neural architecture search (NAS) to optimize a dynamically adaptable classifier for HT detection.

Result: Experimental results show that SAND improves HT detection accuracy by up to 18.3% compared to state-of-the-art methods. Additionally, it demonstrates robustness against evasive Trojans and strong generalization capabilities.

Conclusion: SAND successfully addresses key limitations in existing HT detection methods by automating feature extraction and enabling adaptability, offering a promising solution for emerging security threats in embedded systems.

Abstract: The globalized semiconductor supply chain has made Hardware Trojans (HT) a
significant security threat to embedded systems, necessitating the design of
efficient and adaptable detection mechanisms. Despite promising machine
learning-based HT detection techniques in the literature, they suffer from ad
hoc feature selection and the lack of adaptivity, all of which hinder their
effectiveness across diverse HT attacks. In this paper, we propose SAND, a
selfsupervised and adaptive NAS-driven framework for efficient HT detection.
Specifically, this paper makes three key contributions. (1) We leverage
self-supervised learning (SSL) to enable automated feature extraction,
eliminating the dependency on manually engineered features. (2) SAND integrates
neural architecture search (NAS) to dynamically optimize the downstream
classifier, allowing for seamless adaptation to unseen benchmarks with minimal
fine-tuning. (3) Experimental results show that SAND achieves a significant
improvement in detection accuracy (up to 18.3%) over state-of-the-art methods,
exhibits high resilience against evasive Trojans, and demonstrates strong
generalization.

### [457] [MCPGuard : Automatically Detecting Vulnerabilities in MCP Servers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23673)
*Bin Wang,Zexin Liu,Hao Yu,Ao Yang,Yenan Huang,Jing Guo,Huangsheng Cheng,Hui Li,Huiyu Wu*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This paper analyzes security vulnerabilities in the Model Context Protocol (MCP) used for integrating LLMs with external tools, identifying key threats and proposing defense mechanisms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address significant security vulnerabilities introduced by MCP's openness and extensibility, threatening system reliability and user data protection.

Method: A systematic analysis of MCP-based systems, categorizing threats and surveying defense strategies such as server-side scanning, runtime monitoring, and zero-trust approaches.

Result: The paper identifies three main security threat categories in MCP systems and highlights the need for unique defense mechanisms due to the semantic nature of attacks.

Conclusion: MCP security requires a paradigm shift in defenses to address the extended attack surface involving semantic interpretation of natural language metadata.

Abstract: The Model Context Protocol (MCP) has emerged as a standardized interface
enabling seamless integration between Large Language Models (LLMs) and external
data sources and tools. While MCP significantly reduces development complexity
and enhances agent capabilities, its openness and extensibility introduce
critical security vulnerabilities that threaten system trustworthiness and user
data protection. This paper systematically analyzes the security landscape of
MCP-based systems, identifying three principal threat categories: (1) agent
hijacking attacks stemming from protocol design deficiencies; (2) traditional
web vulnerabilities in MCP servers; and (3) supply chain security. To address
these challenges, we comprehensively survey existing defense strategies,
examining both proactive server-side scanning approaches, ranging from layered
detection pipelines and agentic auditing frameworks to zero-trust registry
systems, and runtime interaction monitoring solutions that provide continuous
oversight and policy enforcement. Our analysis reveals that MCP security
fundamentally represents a paradigm shift where the attack surface extends from
traditional code execution to semantic interpretation of natural language
metadata, necessitating novel defense mechanisms tailored to this unique threat
model.

### [458] [QueryIPI: Query-agnostic Indirect Prompt Injection on Coding Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23675)
*Yuchong Xie,Zesen Liu,Mingyu Luo,Zhixiang Zhang,Kaikai Zhang,Zongjie Li,Ping Chen,Shuai Wang,Dongdong She*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper presents QueryIPI, a method to exploit vulnerabilities in coding agents by analyzing their internal prompts, achieving notable success rates in tests.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the security vulnerabilities in modern coding agents exposed through Indirect Prompt Injection (IPI) attacks with an enhanced, effective method.

Method: QueryIPI refines malicious tool descriptions using an iterative process informed by leaked internal prompts to enable query-agnostic attacks.

Result: QueryIPI demonstrated up to 87% success in tests compared to baselines, and is shown to be effective in real-world scenarios as well.

Conclusion: These findings highlight potential security risks in LLM-based coding agents, urging the need for better safeguards.

Abstract: Modern coding agents integrated into IDEs combine powerful tools and
system-level actions, exposing a high-stakes attack surface. Existing Indirect
Prompt Injection (IPI) studies focus mainly on query-specific behaviors,
leading to unstable attacks with lower success rates. We identify a more
severe, query-agnostic threat that remains effective across diverse user
inputs. This challenge can be overcome by exploiting a common vulnerability:
leakage of the agent's internal prompt, which turns the attack into a
constrained white-box optimization problem. We present QueryIPI, the first
query-agnostic IPI method for coding agents. QueryIPI refines malicious tool
descriptions through an iterative, prompt-based process informed by the leaked
internal prompt. Experiments on five simulated agents show that QueryIPI
achieves up to 87 percent success, outperforming baselines, and the generated
malicious descriptions also transfer to real-world systems, highlighting a
practical security risk to modern LLM-based coding agents.

### [459] [PRO: Enabling Precise and Robust Text Watermark for Open-Source LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23891)
*Jiaqi Xue,Yifei Zhao,Mansour Al Ghanim,Shangqian Gao,Ruimin Sun,Qian Lou,Mengxin Zheng*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper addresses the challenge of embedding watermarks in open-source large language models (LLMs) for text verification and intellectual property protection, proposing a novel method called PRO to enhance watermark detectability and robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to enable owners of open-source LLMs to verify text origin and protect intellectual property, as existing watermarking methods are ineffective for open-source models due to lack of control over the decoding process.

Method: The proposed method, PRO, involves jointly training a watermark policy model with the LLM and incorporating a regularization term to ensure detectability and resilience against downstream perturbations such as fine-tuning or model merging.

Result: Experiments demonstrate that PRO significantly improves watermark detectability and robustness for open-source LLMs, outperforming existing watermarking techniques.

Conclusion: PRO provides a practical and effective solution for text watermarking in open-source LLMs, addressing key challenges such as poor detectability and fragility to model edits.

Abstract: Text watermarking for large language models (LLMs) enables model owners to
verify text origin and protect intellectual property. While watermarking
methods for closed-source LLMs are relatively mature, extending them to
open-source models remains challenging, as developers cannot control the
decoding process. Consequently, owners of open-source LLMs lack practical means
to verify whether text was generated by their models. A core difficulty lies in
embedding watermarks directly into model weights without hurting detectability.
A promising idea is to distill watermarks from a closed-source model into an
open one, but this suffers from (i) poor detectability due to mismatch between
learned and predefined patterns, and (ii) fragility to downstream modifications
such as fine-tuning or model merging. To overcome these limitations, we propose
PRO, a Precise and Robust text watermarking method for open-source LLMs. PRO
jointly trains a watermark policy model with the LLM, producing patterns that
are easier for the model to learn and more consistent with detection criteria.
A regularization term further simulates downstream perturbations and penalizes
degradation in watermark detectability, ensuring robustness under model edits.
Experiments on open-source LLMs (e.g., LLaMA-3.2, LLaMA-3, Phi-2) show that PRO
substantially improves both watermark detectability and resilience to model
modifications.

### [460] [Scalable GPU-Based Integrity Verification for Large Machine Learning Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23938)
*Marcin Spoczynski,Marcela S. Melara*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper proposes a security framework for distributed ML by incorporating integrity verification directly on GPUs, addressing performance and architectural bottlenecks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To eliminate inefficiencies and bottlenecks in traditional CPU-based security verification for large ML models executed on GPUs.

Method: Integrating cryptographic integrity checks directly on GPUs using native compute units and leveraging high-memory bandwidth and parallel processing capabilities of GPUs.

Result: The framework provides consistent integrity checks across GPU platforms, ensuring scalability and efficiency for models exceeding 100GB.

Conclusion: A hardware-agnostic solution enhancing the security architecture for distributed machine learning, beneficial for enterprise teams regardless of hardware configurations.

Abstract: We present a security framework that strengthens distributed machine learning
by standardizing integrity protections across CPU and GPU platforms and
significantly reducing verification overheads. Our approach co-locates
integrity verification directly with large ML model execution on GPU
accelerators, resolving the fundamental mismatch between how large ML workloads
typically run (primarily on GPUs) and how security verifications traditionally
operate (on separate CPU-based processes), delivering both immediate
performance benefits and long-term architectural consistency. By performing
cryptographic operations natively on GPUs using dedicated compute units (e.g.,
Intel Arc's XMX units, NVIDIA's Tensor Cores), our solution eliminates the
potential architectural bottlenecks that could plague traditional CPU-based
verification systems when dealing with large models. This approach leverages
the same GPU-based high-memory bandwidth and parallel processing primitives
that power ML workloads ensuring integrity checks keep pace with model
execution even for massive models exceeding 100GB. This framework establishes a
common integrity verification mechanism that works consistently across
different GPU vendors and hardware configurations. By anticipating future
capabilities for creating secure channels between trusted execution
environments and GPU accelerators, we provide a hardware-agnostic foundation
that enterprise teams can deploy regardless of their underlying CPU and GPU
infrastructures.

*Austin Shouli,Yulia Bobkova,Ajay Kumar Shrestha*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper reviews how smart devices covertly collect private conversations, focusing on youth privacy and proposing the SCOUR framework to address surveillance, usage, consent, and regulatory safeguards.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Explore privacy concerns related to smart devices, particularly impacting youth, and the associated transparency issues.

Method: A structured literature review using the PRISMA methodology and the introduction of the SCOUR framework for analysis.

Result: Smart devices covertly capture private conversations, especially in youth-oriented gadgets, with unclear data practices and insufficient transparency. Youth are increasingly aware of privacy concerns.

Conclusion: Balancing privacy and utility is essential, and improving both technical and regulatory frameworks can address these challenges. Insights have implications for policy and future research directions.

Abstract: This paper investigates how smart devices covertly capture private
conversations and discusses in more in-depth the implications of this for youth
privacy. Using a structured review guided by the PRISMA methodology, the
analysis focuses on privacy concerns, data capture methods, data storage and
sharing practices, and proposed technical mitigations. To structure and
synthesize findings, we introduce the SCOUR framework, encompassing
Surveillance mechanisms, Consent and awareness, Operational data flow, Usage
and exploitation, and Regulatory and technical safeguards. Findings reveal that
smart devices have been covertly capturing personal data, especially with smart
toys and voice-activated smart gadgets built for youth. These issues are
worsened by unclear data collection practices and insufficient transparency in
smart device applications. Balancing privacy and utility in smart devices is
crucial, as youth are becoming more aware of privacy breaches and value their
personal data more. Strategies to improve regulatory and technical safeguards
are also provided. The review identifies research gaps and suggests future
directions. The limitations of this literature review are also explained. The
findings have significant implications for policy development and the
transparency of data collection for smart devices.

*Tejaswini Bollikonda*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper introduces a framework designed to integrate homomorphic encryption (HE) into cloud-native environments for privacy-preserving machine learning (ML) inference. It aims to address challenges of computational overhead, orchestration complexity, and model compatibility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to solve the problem of securely handling user data during ML inference in cloud infrastructures, due to concerns about data confidentiality. Homomorphic encryption provides a potential solution by allowing encrypted computation.

Method: The authors propose a cloud-native framework that employs containerized HE modules combined with Kubernetes for orchestration. Enhancements like ciphertext packing, polynomial modulus adjustments, and operator fusion aim to optimize performance and resource use.

Result: The proposed system demonstrated improvements in performance, achieving up to 3.2 times faster inference and a 40% reduction in memory usage compared to traditional HE pipelines.

Conclusion: The study offers a practical solution for deploying secure ML-as-a-Service systems using homomorphic encryption, effectively ensuring data confidentiality in zero-trust cloud settings.

Abstract: As machine learning (ML) models become increasingly deployed through cloud
infrastructures, the confidentiality of user data during inference poses a
significant security challenge. Homomorphic Encryption (HE) has emerged as a
compelling cryptographic technique that enables computation on encrypted data,
allowing predictions to be generated without decrypting sensitive inputs.
However, the integration of HE within large scale cloud native pipelines
remains constrained by high computational overhead, orchestration complexity,
and model compatibility issues.
  This paper presents a systematic framework for the design and optimization of
cloud native homomorphic encryption workflows that support privacy-preserving
ML inference. The proposed architecture integrates containerized HE modules
with Kubernetes-based orchestration, enabling elastic scaling and parallel
encrypted computation across distributed environments. Furthermore,
optimization strategies including ciphertext packing, polynomial modulus
adjustment, and operator fusion are employed to minimize latency and resource
consumption while preserving cryptographic integrity. Experimental results
demonstrate that the proposed system achieves up to 3.2times inference
acceleration and 40% reduction in memory utilization compared to conventional
HE pipelines. These findings illustrate a practical pathway for deploying
secure ML-as-a-Service (MLaaS) systems that guarantee data confidentiality
under zero-trust cloud conditions.
