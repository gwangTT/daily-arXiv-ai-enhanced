Although the fundamentals of this technology were\nestablished decades ago, it is experiencing a renaissance as it plays a key\nrole in efficiently computing gradients for backpropagation in machine learning\nalgorithms. AD is also crucial for many applications in scientific computing\ndomains, particularly emerging techniques that integrate machine learning\nmodels within scientific simulations and schemes. Existing AD frameworks have\nfour main limitations: limited support of programming languages, requiring code\nmodifications for AD compatibility, limited performance on scientific computing\ncodes, and a naive store-all solution for forward-pass data required for\ngradient calculations. These limitations force domain scientists to manually\ncompute the gradients for large problems. This work presents DaCe AD, a\ngeneral, efficient automatic differentiation engine that requires no code\nmodifications. DaCe AD uses a novel ILP-based algorithm to optimize the\ntrade-off between storing and recomputing to achieve maximum performance within\na given memory constraint. We showcase the generality of our method by applying\nit to NPBench, a suite of HPC benchmarks with diverse scientific computing\npatterns, where we outperform JAX, a Python framework with state-of-the-art\ngeneral AD capabilities, by more than 92 times on average without requiring any\ncode changes.", "AI": {"tldr": "DaCe AD is an efficient automatic differentiation engine that overcomes limitations of existing frameworks, achieving superior performance with minimal effort required by users.", "motivation": "The need for an automatic differentiation engine that addresses constraints like programming language support, performance, and extensive code modification while ensuring efficiency in scientific computing applications.", "method": "DaCe AD introduces a novel ILP-based algorithm that balances storing and recomputing forward-pass data under memory constraints to optimize performance.", "result": "DaCe AD outperforms JAX, a state-of-the-art AD framework, by achieving up to 92 times faster performance in diverse scientific computing benchmarks without requiring any code modifications.", "conclusion": "DaCe AD enables domain scientists to achieve high-performance automatic differentiation without compromising usability or requiring extensive manual intervention."}}

To address this issue, this paper investigates a novel perspective\nby incorporating news intent into fake news detection, bridging intents and\nsemantics together. The core insight is that by considering news intents, one\ncan deeply understand the inherent thoughts behind news deception, rather than\nthe surface patterns within words alone. To achieve this goal, we propose\nGraph-based Intent-Semantic Joint Modeling (InSide) for fake news detection,\nwhich models deception clues from both semantic and intent signals via\ngraph-based joint learning. Specifically, InSide reformulates news semantic and\nintent signals into heterogeneous graph structures, enabling long-range context\ninteraction through entity guidance and capturing both holistic and\nimplementation-level intent via coarse-to-fine intent modeling.
