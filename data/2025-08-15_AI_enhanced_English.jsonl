However, existing prompt tuning methods rely on\nsparse category labels or disparate LLM-generated descriptions, which fragment\nknowledge representation and hinder transferability. To address this\nlimitation, we introduce Semantic Prompt Tuning (SemPT), a novel framework that\ntackles the generalization challenge by leveraging shared attribute-level\nknowledge across categories. Specifically, SemPT adopts a two-step prompting\nstrategy to guide LLM in extracting shared visual attributes and generating\nattribute-level descriptions, capturing transferable semantic cues beyond\nlabels while ensuring coherent structure. Then, visually guided weighting is\napplied to the embeddings of attribute-level descriptions to reduce noise from\nirrelevant attributes and enhance the text embeddings. Additionally, image\nembeddings are jointly aligned with both label and attribute-enhanced text\nembeddings, balancing discrimination for seen categories and transferability to\nunseen ones. Considering the availability of category exposure, our inference\ndynamically selects between standard label embeddings for seen categories and\nattribute-enhanced embeddings for unseen ones to ensure effective adaptation.\nExtensive experiments on 15 benchmark datasets demonstrate that SemPT achieves\nstate-of-the-art performance across various settings, including base-to-novel\ngeneralization, cross-dataset transfer, cross-domain transfer, and few-shot\nlearning.", "AI": {"tldr": "This paper proposes Semantic Prompt Tuning (SemPT) to enhance generalization in unseen visual categories using shared attribute-level knowledge, achieving state-of-the-art results.", "motivation": "The paper aims to tackle the challenge of balancing category-specific representation and transferable knowledge for unseen visual categories in transfer learning.", "method": "The authors introduce SemPT, which uses a two-step process to extract shared visual attributes and generate descriptions, then applies visually guided weighting to improve embeddings and their alignment between seen and unseen categories.", "result": "SemPT outperformed existing methods on 15 benchmark datasets, showcasing superior results in generalization tasks like base-to-novel generalization, cross-dataset transfer, cross-domain transfer, and few-shot learning.", "conclusion": "Semantic Prompt Tuning provides a scalable and effective approach for leveraging transferable attribute-level knowledge, enabling better generalization to unseen visual categories."}}
